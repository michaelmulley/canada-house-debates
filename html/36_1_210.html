</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK4">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 338 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
convene in 1998 a meeting of `like-minded nations' in order to 
develop a multilateral plan of action to reform international 
organizations (e.g. Internation Monetary Fund, World Bank, United 
Nations) so that they can identify the precursors of conflict and 
establish multilateral conflict-prevention initiatives. 
</UL>
<A NAME="LINK5">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I would ask for the unanimous consent 
of the House for the removal of the words “in 1998” from the 
motion.  It was written two years ago and 1998 makes it obsolete. 
The removal of “in 1998” removes the time course from the 
motion and gives it more flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member is 
asking to remove “in 1998” from the motion in order to make it 
more pertinent to this date.  Is there agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the House for 
its tolerance with removing the date from the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From Kosovo, to Cambodia, to Central Africa and to many other 
parts of the world, we see over 40 conflicts that are taking 
place as we speak.  Kosovo, the one which has dominated the House 
for so long, is just the latest in a series of conflicts that 
have torn across the world for many years resulting in the death 
and dismemberment of hundreds of thousands, if not millions of 
people, and the removal from their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 90% of those involved in conflicts, individuals who have 
been killed or maimed, are people who do not have arms, are 
non-combatants and innocent victims who only want to live in 
peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before 1945, we had World War II.  Between 1945 to the late 
1980s, we have had a cold war with two superpowers glaring at 
each other, armed to the hilt with very powerful nuclear weapons. 
Since the late 1980s, with the breakdown of the cold war and the 
post-cold war era, we have seen a proliferation of conflicts.  In 
fact, over 40 conflicts have and are still taking place today 
throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the post-cold war era there was a belief that we would 
have a peace dividend, that the world would now be a safer place 
to live.  The fact is the world is a much more dangerous place. 
We do not have the tools to deal with this fluctuating situation, 
a situation that is imperilling more and more innocent people, 
costing billions of dollars and wreaking havoc over nation 
states, many of which are imploding as we speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Kosovo has drawn most of our attention, it is by no 
means the largest, bloodiest or most destructive conflict 
existing today.  The largest land mass battle ever to exist in 
the world is taking place right now on the continent of Africa. 
From Sierra Leone and Liberia to the west, to Sudan, Eritrea and 
Ethiopia to the east, right through the Central African Republic 
to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and down into Angola, a 
bloody war is taking place causing the deaths of thousands upon 
thousands of people every single week.  Many people are maimed, 
many are raped, children are left to starve and entire countries 
are laid to waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation and as an international community we have been 
completely and utterly unable to deal with this situation in any 
pre-emptive fashion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1957 Lester B. Pearson won the Nobel prize for peacekeeping, 
an innovative measure to save people's lives.  Many interesting 
initiatives have taken place since then, such as rapid 
humanitarian relief and the introduction of peacekeeping and 
peacemaking forces around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we confuse peacemaking with conflict prevention.  It is 
not conflict prevention because the moment we need to make peace, 
blood has already been shed, people have been killed and the 
seeds of ethnic discontent and future conflict are there for 
generations to come.  We need look no further than to what is 
taking place now within the former Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Slobodan Milosevic came to power and fomented violence against 
people.  He initially stirred it up with the Croats by using 
propaganda and is now stirring it up with the people of Kosovo. 
The international community's response has appropriately been to 
engage in diplomacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we were faced with the situation of the Jewish people and 
many others being slaughtered during World War II, what did we 
do?  Nothing.  If history has taught us anything it is that we 
have learned nothing.  We continually sit on our hands and do 
nothing while people are slaughtered and killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Motion No. 338 is to do something.  It will 
change the international organizations that we are part of to 
become tools of conflict prevention.  When despots are engage in 
actions that result in the deaths of thousands of people we will 
not stand by and watch.  We will act with other like-minded 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of this has been enormous.  From 1945 to 1989 the UN 
has spent 23% of its budget on peacekeeping.  From 1990 to 1995 
it has increased that amount to 77%.  Peacekeeping is bankrupting 
the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will articulate solutions to this problem through the 
revamping of the international organization.  These conflicts did 
not appear overnight.  Bosnia has been around for a long time. 
Kosovo has been around for 10 years.  Many situations have been 
brewing for a long time.  When General Roméo Dallaire spoke 
eloquently and forcefully before the slaughters in Rwanda and 
Burundi saying they would spiral out of control and result in the 
massacre of hundreds of thousands of people, we did nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things we can do.  We need to look at the precursors 
to conflict.  We can see a polarization taking place before 
anything else happens.  One group of leaders will start to remove 
the human rights of others.  It will start abusing and 
ostracizing groups.  It will polarize groups and try to get its 
own people onside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Michael Ignatieff, the famous author, said, they manage to 
polarize groups by focusing on the narcissism of the differences. 
Two people can be very similar but their small differences can be 
expanded out of proportion.  This enables the despot to cause his 
people to start killing one another.  We can see that happening. 
It is very obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can use the international financial institutions, the United 
Nations and NGOs who are on the ground to report back to the UN 
crisis centre.  The UN crisis centre, headed by Stan Carlson, a 
Canadian, can be the centre through which information is 
channelled.  The information can then go to the UN security 
council or farmed out to other organizations as part of the 
intelligence needed to determine ground activity earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The security council needs to be reformed.  Now that we are on 
the security council for the next year and a half there is much 
we can do.  The security council is obsolete but maybe there is a 
way to change it.  We could expand the security council by 
getting more countries involved, particularly those from Africa, 
South America and other developing countries.  We would then have 
a more comprehensive and representative security council.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vetoes should be removed from the five security council members. 
Granted, this would be extraordinarily difficult.  Maybe the way 
around it is to ensure that the veto power can be only used for 
chapter VII actions under the UN security council.  Or we could 
require two vetoes to block a motion or an action by the security 
council.  Or we could require that all actions by the security 
council be passed by a two-thirds majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN needs to be overhauled in terms of its diplomatic 
initiatives.  It needs to focus on what it needs to do.  It 
cannot do everything and be everything to all people.  Right now 
dozens of organizations are doing the same thing.  Why not focus 
and streamline it so that one organization is tasked to do these 
things rather than many? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actions which the UN can take are many.  First, as I 
mentioned, propaganda is one of the most powerful tools that 
groups use to polarize individuals.  For example, Slobodan 
Milosevic used anti-Croat sentiment to format anti-Croat actions 
by his own people.  In Rwanda the Hutus disseminated propaganda 
against the Tutsis through short-wave radio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN has the capability to engage in positive propaganda to 
bring together like-minded moderates from both sides.  We need to 
do this.  It is essential to do this if we are to dispel the 
negative propaganda that despots use to polarize groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to use diplomacy to bring groups together.  When that 
fails sanctions can be utilized as well as military actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soft power is good, but soft power needs teeth.  We can only 
back up soft power if we have strong, sharp teeth.  Strong 
military action is sometimes required if we are to prevent the 
deaths of thousands of people.  I would submit that is what we 
are engaging in today in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the diplomacy in the world is not going to convince 
individuals like Slobodan Milosevic to come to the peace table, 
with an olive branch, wanting peace.  These people do not engage 
in the same moral frame of reference that we do.  It is 
different.  Individuals like Hitler, Milosevic, Sese Seko Mobuto 
and Daniel Arap Moi do not engage in the same moral framework; 
they engage in behaviour that is reprehensible to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN also needs to look at revamping its arms registry, making 
it obligatory for countries to sign on to the registry so that we 
know where inappropriate militarization is taking place.  If the 
Jane's fighting ships can engage in intelligence gathering to put 
together comprehensive military expenditures, then certainly the 
United Nations could do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to consider international financial institutions. 
The World Bank and the IMF are two parts of a triumvirate.  They 
were brought together at Bretton Woods after 1945 to engage in 
peacebuilding, the reconstruction of societies, improving the 
markets of societies and also to engage in exchange rate 
stability around the world.  I would argue that they have a much 
more powerful, potent and important force in the world for peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing we need to do is to have them communicate and 
co-ordinate their actions.  Much to my shock, I learned when I 
was in Washington and New York last year that it has only been 
since the end of last year that the UN, the IMF and the World 
Bank started to talk to each other.  They have existed and 
operated in isolation.  As a result, sometimes their actions have 
resulted in matters being worse from an international security 
perspective. They need to co-ordinate their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, being on the security council and having connections 
with most of these organizations, could act as a catalyst to work 
with like-minded nations to pull these countries together. 
Canada could act as a force to bring other countries together to 
work to reform these groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wars need money.  Every time we look at the television and we 
see developing nations, we see a 13 or 14 year old kid walking 
around with an AK47, the cost of which exceeds what that person 
would make in a year. 
Where does the money come from?  Sometimes the money comes from 
us, through the IMF, the World Bank and other organizations. 
Sometimes these developing countries engage in destabilizing 
activities which result in the deaths of innocent people.  We 
cannot tolerate that.  We should have the power to prevent those 
moneys from getting into the hands of world leaders who would 
abuse their power at the expense of their people and at the 
expense of regional security. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IMF, the World Bank and other regional development banks 
need to pay close attention to where those moneys are being spent 
and make the giving of those moneys conditional upon countries 
engaging in good governance, peacebuilding and investing in basic 
human needs such as education and health care.  That builds 
peace.  Investing in AK47s and small arms does not and we should 
not be a party to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could invest in activities through international financial 
institutions, which is what the Grameen Bank has done for a long 
time.  Micro credit loaning to average citizens helps them to 
become self-sustaining and self-sufficient, and it also builds 
peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the actions of the IFIs can be used as a carrot, they can 
and must at times be used as a stick.  When leaders of these 
countries engage in bloody actions against others, such as we 
have seen with Laurent Kabila in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, or with Emperor Bokassa in the Central African Republic, 
or what we see today with Daniel Arap Moi in Kenya engaging in 
bloody action with the Maasi and the Kalenjin people against the 
Kikuyus, why do we support that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people cannot be allowed to do that.  We need to hold 
their feet to the fire.  There are things we could do.  We could 
call up loans and we could prevent those loans from being 
renegotiated.  We could suspend borrowing privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember being in Kenya in the late 1980s when Daniel Arap 
Moi, one of the richest men in the world, was begging the world 
for handouts.  He is a multibillionaire.  That should never be 
allowed to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other tools we can use, such as withholding money and 
imposing economic sanctions.  However, money needs to go to the 
people, as we do not want them to suffer.  Money can be 
channelled through non-governmental organizations.  Good NGOs, 
working effectively to provide basic services, could be used as a 
conduit to ensure that there is economic stability and that money 
is provided to the people so they can provide for themselves in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically the biggest stumbling block to early intervention 
has been the concept of state sovereignty.  Many people around 
the world have said that state sovereignty is sacrosanct.  Many 
people feel that what goes on within a country's borders is that 
country's problem.  However, if we look closely at what the 
concept means in terms of international law we can see that does 
not hold water where leaders are engaging in behaviour that is 
destructive to their people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>State sovereignty comes from the belief that sovereignty is a 
manifestation of the will of the people.  The UN convention on 
human rights protects and upholds the will of the people and is 
the basis of government.  Therefore, international law protects 
the sovereignty of a people and the will of the people, not the 
sovereignty of the nation state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, under international law it is acceptable for us to 
engage in actions against state leadership when that leadership 
is engaging in brutal behaviour that contravenes the will of the 
state and also destabilizes the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a very pragmatic and selfish reason for us to get 
involved.  When wars blow out of control, when countries implode 
and descend into hell, who picks up the pieces?  These countries 
are developing nations, generally speaking.  After the conflict 
they are more of a wasteland than they have ever been.  The cost 
to pick up the pieces rests on the shoulders of the developed 
world, countries such as Canada.  We provide aid and we provide 
defence.  At times our people lose their lives in peacekeeping 
operations, such as those we have seen in the former Yugoslavia.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a right to intervene, and to intervene early, because we 
pick up the pieces after the war has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first 40 years of the history of the United Nations there 
were 13 peacekeeping missions.  In the last 10 years there have 
been more than 25.  Rather than the situation getting better, it 
is getting worse.  What I am proposing through Motion No. 338 is 
that we pull together like-minded nations, such as we did on the 
land mines issue.  I firmly believe we can do this.  We need to 
bring together like-minded nations such as Norway, Iceland, South 
Africa, Australia and Central American nations; countries that 
are interested in pursuing peace.  We need to give them a plan of 
action.  We need to convene a meeting, maybe in Ottawa, to agree 
on a common plan of action, not a commitment for more study.  We 
can take this common plan of action to these international 
organizations.  If we all have the same plan of action, if we are 
all working toward the same goal, other countries will come on 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ultimate outcome will be the revamping and rejuvenating of 
international organizations.  They will be a tool for conflict 
prevention so that the conflicts of yesterday will not happen 
tomorrow, and innocent civilian lives that have been laid to 
waste in imploding countries will not continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot prevent all conflicts of the world, but we can prevent 
some.  That is what Motion No. 338 is about and I hope members 
from all parties will support it.  It is something upon which we 
can work together, it is congruent with our history as a nation, 
and it will save many lives and billions of dollars.

raised a number of very serious issues on the world scene, each 
of which represents a separate debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One very important issue to which he referred was the reform of 
the monetary system.  World finances have a great bearing on 
conflicts which erupt in various countries.  It is not the only 
reason, and we certainly acknowledge that.  However, the monetary 
system in our world is very important.  With his indulgence and 
with the indulgence of the House I will dwell on the monetary 
system rather than try to make an omnibus contribution to this 
debate.  I want to zero in on that one very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international agenda recently has been saturated with 
initiatives of crises prevention, more effective management of 
international financial crises and more sustainable economic 
development.  What started as a G-7 plan of action is now being 
echoed by the nations of APEC, the primary international 
organization for promoting open trade and economic co-operation 
among 21 member countries around the Pacific rim, which will be 
discussed later this month at spring meetings of the IMF and the 
World Bank, and in June at the G-7 summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a groundswell of support for strengthening domestic and 
international financial institutions and for economies that are 
more resilient to economic and financial crises when they do 
occur.  Canada is committed to strengthening the international 
financial system and the world economy.  We started this at the 
G-7 summit in Halifax in 1995.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the G-7 summit in Birmingham in May last year, leaders 
accelerated work begun in the 1995 Halifax summit on 
strengthening the international financial architecture to help 
prevent and better manage financial crises.  Key elements of 
these efforts include: reports of the three G-22 working parties, 
improving transparency and accountability, strengthening national 
financial systems and addressing international financial crises 
delivered at the G-22 meeting October 5, 1998; the G-7 leaders 
statement on the world economy issued October 30, 1998 together 
with the declaration of G-7 finance ministers and central bank 
governors; the plan for implementing reforms to the global 
financial architecture presented by G-7 finance ministers to 
heads in December 1998; the February 20, 1999 communique of G-7 
finance ministers and central bank governors; the February 1999 
Tietmeyer report to G-7 finance ministers and central bank 
governors on international co-operation and co-ordination in the 
area of financial market supervision and surveillance, and its 
proposal for the establishment of a financial stability forum to 
provide a mechanism for co-ordination and exchange of views among 
financial sector regulators and supervisors; the first meeting of 
the financial stability forum on April 13; and two seminars, one 
held on March 11 and the other to be held on April 25, 1999, 
involving 33 industrial countries and emerging markets to discuss 
outstanding issues in the international financial architecture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Priority areas for strengthening the international architecture 
outlined in the October 1998 leaders statement on the world 
economy include greater transparency and openness in financial 
systems, better processes for monitoring and promoting 
international financial stability and improvements in corporate 
governance, orderly capital account liberalization, private 
sector involvement in preventing and resolving future crises, 
protecting the most vulnerable in society, and improving the 
effectiveness of international financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latter includes a proposal for an enhanced IMF facility to 
provide a precautionary line of credit for countries pursuing 
strong IMF approved policies, accompanied by bilateral assistance 
on a case by case basis, and with appropriate private sector 
involvement.  Much has already been accomplished in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six areas were also identified in the October 1998 leaders 
statement as requiring further attention.  These six priority 
areas form the basis for G-33 discussion in the international 
seminars held on March 11 and to be held on April 25.  They 
include: examining the scope for strengthened prudential 
regulation in industrial countries; further strengthening 
prudential regulation and financial systems in emerging markets; 
considering the elements necessary for the maintenance of 
sustainable exchange rate regimes in emerging markets; developing 
new ways to respond to crises and promote greater participation 
by the private sector; assessing proposals for strengthening the 
IMF, and proposals for strengthening the interim and development 
committees of the IMF and World Bank; and minimizing the human 
cost of crises and protecting the most vulnerable.

Canadian objectives in discussions on reforming the international

substantive aspects of these discussions take place within a 
permanent process that is representative of the major 
participants in the international financial system, that measures 
to effectively involve the private sector in crisis resolution

social aspects of international financial crises are addressed.

system, and is anchored within the governance structures of the 
IMF. For this reason, Canada is supportive of efforts to improve 
the functioning of the interim committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The G-22 working group on financial crises agreed on some 
mechanisms for enhancing private sector involvement in crisis 
prevention and resolution, including collective action clauses in 
bond contracts and contingent financial arrangements with the 
private sector. Canada attaches a high priority to moving ahead 
with their implementation and moving even further to address the 
incentives that lead to imprudent lending.  Canadian proposals 
for greater private sector involvement in crisis prevention and 
resolution received general support at the March 11 seminar.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today to take part in the debate on Motion No. 338, which 
was moved by colleague from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
convene in 1998 a meeting of “like-minded nations” in order to 
develop a multilateral plan of action to reform international 
organizations (e.g. International Monetary Fund, World Bank, 
United Nations) so that they can identify the precursors of 
conflict and establish multilateral, conflict prevention 
initiatives. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very nicely put, but the Bloc Quebecois must point out 
right away that it will vote against Motion No. 338. Let us have a 
closer look together at the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First it says, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the government should convene in 1998 a meeting of 'like-minded 
nations' in order to develop a multilateral plan of action— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will agree with me that “like-minded nations” is a very 
vague and general concept. According to the logic of the motion, 
it would appear that the Reform Party is trying to create some 
level of separation, which we in the Bloc Quebecois find 
unacceptable, between industrialized countries, otherwise known 
as “like-minded nations”, and developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly undemocratic and paternalistic. How dare the 
Reform Party exclude developing countries out of hand from the 
drafting of such a multilateral plan of action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reform proposed by the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca 
would directly affect poor countries since for the most part 
conflicts are taking place in developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any reform aimed at significantly changing the role of 
international organizations such as the International Monetary 
Fund, the World Bank, and the United Nations must be carried out 
in consultation with the countries affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I would like to remind the Reform Party that the main 
aim of organizations such as the World Bank or the United 
Nations is to help developing countries. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, why exclude poor countries from this reform? They are 
the primary beneficiaries of the assistance provided by these 
organizations. It is important to consult these countries before 
undertaking any reform, so as to be aware of their needs and 
concerns, and have an accurate idea of the reality of the people 
affected by poverty or conflicts. This only makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any reform must be undertaken in partnership with international 
organizations and governments, the people affected and NGOs in 
the field. We have a lot to learn from them. But the Reform 
Party is advocating unilateral action by industrialized 
countries. The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this way of doing 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With its delusions of grandeur, the Reform Party wants to reform 
everything. But before trying to reform everything on this 
planet, it should start right here, in the Canadian government's 
own back yard. Believe me, there are lots of weeds in that back 
yard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberals came to office in 1993, CIDA's budget for 
international assistance has been reduced by almost 30%. Yet, 
more than 1.3 billion people are living in abject poverty, 
barely surviving on less than a dollar a day. Every day, 34,000 
children die from malnutrition and disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the Liberals took office, Canada was seen as a leader in 
development aid. Now, because of the Liberals' poor record in 
this field, Canada's image and reputation have been tarnished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is, in fact, no longer one of the top donors to the 
developing countries.  It has now dropped from fifth to 
eleventh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Betty Plewes, the president and chief executive officer of the 
Canadian Council for International Development, the CCIC, a 
coalition of 100 major Canadian organizations active in the 
development filed, stated as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aid to development program has been more affected by deficit 
cutting measures than other federal programs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is proof that Canada could very well, within the very near 
future, no longer be on the list of the most generous and most 
committed members of the international donor community. 
This government is so irresponsible that it has reached the 
stage of neglecting the true human values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget, the government added $50 million to its 
international aid budget, out of a total CIDA budget of just 
under $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance claims to thus be taking a step toward 
attaining the objective of devoting 7% of the GDP to 
development aid.  Yet all this does is to just barely allow it 
to keep up.  At the rate it is going, the federal government 
will not attain that objective before the fourth millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international aid budget is a perfect example of the 
distortion between Liberal rhetoric and the reality of facts and 
figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that this brief analysis will enable the member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca to realize that it would be advisable, and 
preferable, to look to what is going on in here in Canada before 
trying to revolutionize the entire world.  Before trying to 
create new international structures, let us concentrate on 
better adapting the institutions we already have to the new 
political, social and economic realities of our day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 338 by the Reform Party is all the more incomprehensible 
when one looks at the May 1995 final report by the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, “From 
Bretton Woods to Halifax and Beyond: Towards a 21st Summit for 
the 21st Century Challenge”. This was a unanimous report 
addressing issues of international financial institutions 
reforms for the agenda of the June 1995 G-7 Halifax summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At page 14 of the executive summary, it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately the world's peoples through their representatives 
need to have a democratic voice in the changes affecting global 
economic security and development. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supported this statement, because it supported 
this report.  So, what is behind this sudden change in 
direction?  Could we say improvisation?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca to read the very 
instructive report on the renewal and reform of the institutions 
responsible for international economics, including the IMF and 
the World Bank.  Had he read this report, the member would 
probably not have presented his motion, because it raises the 
concerns the member refers to in his motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would remind you that the Bloc Quebecois has 
always had a concern for the operation of international 
agencies, such as the UN, the IMF and the World Bank.  They have 
repeatedly proven their role in the maintenance of world order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, nothing is perfect. 
Political, social and economic change occurs on our planet at a 
tremendous rate and these institutions must keep up with the 
changes.  However, if the developing countries are to be denied 
a say in the reform of these institutions, as the Reform Party 
is proposing, the Bloc Quebecois must oppose Motion No. 338. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world balance is precarious enough at the moment.  There is 
therefore no question of heightening the reality of excluding 
the developing countries.  Globalization is not only economic, 
but social and human as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise to make a few brief observations on the 
worthwhileness and the relevance of the hon. member's private 
member's motion.  It is probably more timely than the member 
might have thought, although I realize he probably initially 
regretted that the motion did not come forward at an earlier time 
and therefore had to seek the unanimous consent of the House to 
amend it and take out the reference to 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just so happens that in 1999 we are in a position where we 
can see the wisdom of the idea we find in the motion, that the 
world should be more focused on conflict prevention than it has 
been and that Canada should convene a meeting or act in other 
ways to bring together like-minded nations that would like to 
reform our international institutions in a way which would make 
this kind of conflict prevention more possible and more probable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a timely debate.  From my point of view and the point of 
view of my party, although I realize this is Private Members' 
Business, reform of our international institutions has certainly 
been a focus of ours for a long time.  Just the other day, again 
in the context of Private Members' Business, the House 
unanimously passed a motion by the NDP member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle on the issue of the Tobin tax, which in a way 
addresses itself to an element of what is wrong with the global 
economy and what is wrong with it in a way that has come to 
prevent or limit the actions of international financial 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems we have with respect to the global economy 
and the international financial institutions is that they were 
designed for a global economy that was much less globalized and 
much more regulated.  One of the problems we are facing now is 
the massive deregulation of capital and capital flows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has created a new opportunity for the destabilization of 
national economies, the destabilization of regions, and it is one 
of the reasons we need to work as an international community on 
what might be loosely called a new Bretton Woods or a new way of 
regulating the global economy, to do for the global economy what 
we once did for national economies; that is to say, to make sure 
in the way we once made sure national economies worked in the 
national interest, in the public interest for the common good, we 
now need to regulate the global economy to replicate in terms of 
global institutions those things we once did only at the national 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Otherwise we would end up with this totally unfettered global 
marketplace in which we see what many have called a race to the 
bottom; that is to say, a bondage to a certain notion of 
competition. 
This means that countries have to cater in an uncritical way to 
the needs of foreign investment and international capital, which 
leads to a driving down of wages and a reduction in government 
revenues, which in turn leads to cutbacks in social programs and 
the ability of government to act on behalf of the public, both in 
terms of providing social programs and in terms of legislating in 
respect of labour and environmental standards or anything else 
that might be construed to make us less competitive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation here which certainly calls for a more 
focused effort to reform our international institutions.  I would 
say with respect to the IMF and the World Bank that in many 
respects now they are part of the problem rather than the 
solution.  They make countries do things that countries should 
not have to do.  Through structural adjustment and things like 
that they literally make countries, particularly the poorer 
countries, starve their own people in order to pay off debts 
either to the IMF directly or to banks or generally to their 
creditors.  There is something desperately wrong about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is why we have seen recently the call by the leadership of 
the churches in Canada for something that is called Jubilee 2000, 
which is an attempt to use the spirit of the jubilee proclaimed 
in Deuteronomy; that is to say, the idea that every 50 years the 
debt should be wiped clean and people should get a chance to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Leviticus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  I am sorry, Leviticus, the hon. member 
says, a biblical scholar among the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event the notion we find in the Hebrew testament about 
jubilee is something which I think more and more Canadians are 
certainly willing to consider.  They do not see the point of 
driving these poorer countries further and further into 
situations which are in the final analysis destructive of their 
environment, destructive of the social fabric of their respective 
countries, and in the end destructive for all of us, to the 
extent that these countries are driven to convert their economies 
to export economies and to the extent that they have to destroy 
their own environment to do that.  If they have to destroy their 
rain forest, for instance, to create pasture to grow beef in 
order to export it, that is the only way they can get hard 
currency to pay off their debts, instead of having an economy 
that might better service the food and the social needs of their 
own population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not getting anywhere if in the end all the debts are paid 
and all the banks are happy but we cannot breathe the air and we 
cannot go outside because the ozone layer has been so depleted. 
What shall it profit us if the banks gain the whole world and we 
lose our ability to actually survive on the planet because we 
have driven all these countries into a way of behaving that is 
destructive, not just of their environment but of our common 
environment?  That is certainly one of the concerns I have and 
one of the things we need to look at when we look at reform of 
international financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I will say a word on the United Nations.  I do not think 
anybody would dare get up in the context of this debate and with 
what has been happening in the former Yugoslavia and suggest that 
somehow the United Nations is adequate to the circumstances which 
the world is experiencing.  We have a very serious dilemma 
precisely because of the failure of the United Nations to be able 
to act in the former Yugoslavia.  There is an inability of the 
security council to come to any kind of agreement as a result of 
the vetoes that exist there and the lack of any long term will at 
the UN to develop a capacity to react to these kinds of 
situations, even if there were agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the UN had been able to agree to do something in Kosovo, 
it would have had to depend on national military capacities and 
not on its own military capacity.  One of the suggestions that 
has been made over the years is that the UN have this standing 
capacity in its own name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at democratizing the United Nations so that we 
do not have the situation where those who were considered to be 
the great powers after the second world war still have exclusive 
veto over world affairs through the UN.  A lot of things need to 
be looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems in the current situation in Kosovo is that 
we have things being done in the name of the international 
community.  I will repeat what I said the other night. 
Unfortunately the international community through the UN was not 
able to act, but that does not make NATO the international 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It causes problems for people who may at some level want to 
support what is going on in Kosovo when they hear NATO setting 
itself up as the international community because it clearly is 
not.   Not only that, NATO is being led in this case by a 
country, the United States of America, which has clearly done all 
it can over the years to marginalize the UN.  It does not pay its 
dues.  It has a significant element within its Congress that 
regularly attacks the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot to be further debated.  It is regrettable that 
some of the countries which now hold up NATO as the international 
community are not doing more at the UN to make sure that the UN 
can become the authentic voice of the international community.

be brief because many members are here to speak to the Bloc 
Quebecois motion on this opposition day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording of the motion moved by the hon. member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca is far from perfect.  I agree and I think 
the member would too.  Naturally, it is not just a matter of the 
date for the conference, 1998.  I am going to take a look at the 
wording of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other colleagues have pointed out, the motion says 
“like-minded nations”. 
Some caution is perhaps in order, because if only “like-minded 
nations” are going to be involved in changing international 
organizations, even if this is just the ground work for such 
changes, there must be a consensus of countries belonging to 
these organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all the fine speeches and meetings held with countries that 
share our thinking in certain areas, it is becoming clear that 
we are shooting ourselves in the foot, as it were, because we

when it comes to international organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Reform Party colleague gave the example of land mines.  This 
example can cut both ways.  Why?  Because there was no consensus 
among the countries most affected by the land mine problem. 
Those least affected, such as Canada, signed the Ottawa 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The countries most concerned, those wreaking the most havoc with 
land mines, were not part of the consensus.  The debate must 
therefore be extended to take in all countries belonging to an 
organization.  This debate should perhaps first be held here in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people do not even know how many international 
organizations there are and which does what.  It is becoming 
increasingly apparent that people are a bit lost and are no 
longer very clear on the distinction between the UN, the WTO, 
the former GATT, NATO and so on.  There are so many names that 
people get mixed up.  This is true for many parliamentarians, 
myself included.  There are so many international organizations 
that is hard to keep them all straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the motion, “international organizations” seems on the one 
hand to include all bodies, and on the other to exclude them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—International organizations (e.g. International Monetary Fund, 
World Bank, United Nations) so that they can identify the 
precursors of conflict and establish multilateral, conflict 
prevention initiatives. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure the WTO would play an important role in settling 
conflicts. Here again we do not know exactly what this is all 
about. Is it really a security issue, or a military, economic or 
humanitarian issue? We do not know, and it is unfortunate 
because, for the past few weeks, we have been hearing a lot 
about three major international organizations, namely the WTO, 
which got involved on the eve of the negotiations, the UN and 
NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might be well advised to make these international 
organizations better known in this parliament and across the 
country, inform Quebecers and Canadians and then ask them what 
their opinion is. If Canada can develop a national position, it 
will be much more credible internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a leadership role to play nationally, but also on the 
world scene. For decades Canada has played a role in changing, 
improving, even creating international organizations. 
Unfortunately, over the past few weeks, Canada's leadership has 
been tarnished by events in Kosovo. We asked what steps Canada 
took before the war in Kosovo, and we are expecting answers. 
What efforts has the Government of Canada made?  What leadership 
has the Government of Canada shown in preparing for the 
possibility of an armed conflict in the Yugoslav Republic?  We 
still do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN has been replaced by the flag of war, a war under NATO. 
International organizations are changing, and NATO is the prime 
example.  The purpose of NATO was preparedness if one of its 
member countries were to be invaded, and now it has become an 
international police force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this grounds for criticism?  For questioning, at least.  Is 
NATO's response in Kosovo not a sign of the UN's weakness? 
Perhaps.  Maybe this was the only approach or maybe others could 
have been considered.  Perhaps the UN and leading members of the 
UN, such as Canada, have not done their job.  There are a lot of 
questions that will probably remain unanswered, in the short 
term at least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many negative aspects to the motion with respect to 
its drafting.  We are, however, going to support it because it 
calls for examining all international bodies, and this is 
something that is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, one committee will address the WTO, another some 
other body, but there is no overall picture.  There is a shift 
going on within the international bodies.  To take an example 
that is not a military one, an examination of international 
protection of intellectual property, we realize that the 
international organization has no teeth and is calling upon the 
WTO to apply sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear therefore that a shift is taking place within the 
international organizations, which creates a need to analyse all 
of them. 
As part of this process, we should perhaps look here as well in 
Parliament at the way Canada joins these organizations and signs 
protocols and treaties without parliament having any say, or at 
least much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A reform of international organizations should include a look at 
how parliament ought to be changed in order to become a 
stakeholder in these international organizations and be involved 
from start to finish.  That is very important.  The government 
should learn to use Parliament much more than it does at the 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to draw attention to the quality of the motion, perhaps 
not in its formulation, but in what it proposes, that is, an 
analysis of and profound change in the way the international 
organizations operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support it with pleasure and we hope that this will be 
the beginning of a review of this parliament and how it relates 
to international organizations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would draw to your attention the fact that the leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois will be sharing his time with our honourable 
colleague from Beauharnois—Salaberry.  Later on, throughout the

will be sharing their time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Is there unanimous consent

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, today, we are debating a motion 
that is very democratic, reasonable and responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is asking members of parliament to vote on the 
opportunity to hold a vote on the sending of Canadian troops to 
Kosovo and the Balkan region. The motion before us applies to 
both combat troops and peacekeeping forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's debate may help us find out a little more about the 
government's intentions, about what is really going on, about 
its military planning and diplomatic initiatives. Our main 
problem, and this is the primary reason behind this motion, is 
that we sorely lack information. In fact, the government is 
providing such limited information that we are better informed 
by Newsworld and CNN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this exercise is not academic or hypothetical, as 
the Prime Minister claimed last week, in reply to our questions. 
The legitimacy of our request is evidenced by the dispatches 
published in newspapers yesterday and today, including <I>The 
Sunday Observer</I>, and alluding to preparations for a ground 
invasion of Yugoslavia toward the end of May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the leaflets that it recently dropped over the Yugoslav 
territory, NATO itself stated that an invasion would take place 
if Serbian forces did not leave Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not the only ones asking that members of parliament vote 
on this issue. Many editorials in the country's major dailies 
are asking for the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in its April 14 issue, the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> said 
that our soldiers deserve to know that their elected 
representatives are supporting them, adding that the Prime 
Minister was “badly wrong” in not allowing for a vote in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 13, the <I>National Post</I> said that only a parliamentary 
vote would give the Prime Minister the moral authority to 
involve Canada in a ground war in the former Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same day, <I>La Presse</I> said that the government's refusal to 
hold a vote was creating a democratic deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Saturday, the editorial writer for <I>Le Soleil</I> said that 
fortunately the Bloc Quebecois would be forcing such a vote 
Monday—today—in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Susan Riley, a Southam columnist, said that it would be better 
to abolish Parliament than put it through the travesty of 
consultation to which the government is now subjecting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something strange and disquieting about this whole 
business.  From the beginning, the government seems to have been 
swept along by events.  It seems to be making it up as it goes 
along. 
In fact, it is ironic to say the least that the Prime Minister, 
whose constant refrain has been the need for Canada to have a 
foreign policy that is separate from that of the United States, 
now seems to have fallen in completely with Washington.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the right to wonder if Canadian troops might find 
themselves on the frontline because their humanitarian mission 
would be transformed into a combat mission. They could get 
involved in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia through the 
back door, without parliament having had a chance to vote on 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the government announced that another six CF-18s would 
be sent to Italy, thereby tripling our initial participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to ask the Prime Minister a very simple question: 
how much will Canadian participation have to escalate before 
parliament is asked to vote on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technically, Canada could be at war without parliamentarians 
having had a chance to vote on the matter. 
This seems rather inappropriate in a democratic society and a 
parliamentary democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems even more inappropriate considering the fact that, in 
1991, the Prime Minister, who was sitting on this side of the 
House as opposition leader, was clamouring for a vote in 
parliament on the issue of military operations against Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal leader said at the time that the government did not 
have, and I quote, “the moral authority to put this country into 
a war situation” since the House of Commons had not approved, 
through a vote, Canada's participation in Operation Desert 
Storm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same member, who is now Prime Minister, should be consistent 
since he is the one who said on January 15, 1991, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we all face is why the Prime Minister— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was referring to Prime Minister Mulroney. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—has not chosen to ask the real question of the House today. This 
is the question with which the country is faced: Should Canadian 
troops participate in a war— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the government is desperately seeking reasons not to have 
a vote on this issue and to object to our motion, which is 
totally reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, last week, we heard the Prime Minister say in 
response to our questions that he did not want to have a vote 
because it could show some dissension among us, which could be 
exploited by Milosevic's propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He used this ridiculous argument, knowing full well that almost 
all MPs support Canadian participation in an international 
intervention that will put an end to the crimes against humanity 
perpetuated by the Milosevic regime in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, a vote in the House, with the support of 90%, 95% or 
98% of MPs, would lend far more authenticity to the government 
than the polls the Prime Minister refers to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were any objections at all, they would be the normal 
outcome of a sound debate within a democratic assembly in which 
it is virtually impossible to achieve unanimity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House must hold a debate on this issue.  We must set a 
democratic example for Milosevic, rather than an imposed and 
unverified unanimity.  Democracy is our true strength, and 
Milosevic's main weakness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have much idea of what is going on within the Milosevic 
government, but I doubt very much that he is waiting anxiously 
on the outcome of a vote by the House of Commons in Ottawa to 
decide whether or not he will refuse to put an end to the ethnic 
cleansing in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Holding a vote on sending troops to the Balkans has nothing to 
do with a vote of confidence toward the government, as the Prime 
Minister was stating in his roundabout way last week, nor is it 
the nonsense the House leader was calling it. Such statements 
are not a very good example for the people of Canada or of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also wrong to claim, as the government House leader did a 
few days ago, that the motion before us implies that any troop 
movement, even a normal troop rotation, would have to be 
approved by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a ridiculous argument, and it shows just how deep the 
government side had to dig to find an excuse to oppose our 
motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members, the elected representatives of the people, must have 
their say.  Citing polls, as the Prime Minister did last week, 
is a travesty of parliament.  The House of Commons is the 
expression of democracy.  We do not take polls, we were elected 
to represent the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all the more logical for us to vote since the deployment 
of troops on Yugoslav soil was predictable from the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the time it became clear that the NATO air strikes would 
not bring President Milosevic to his knees, the Atlantic 
Alliance had three options.  The first was the German peace 
plan, the diplomatic approach we must build on. The second was 
to add ground intervention to the air strikes in order to carry 
out the mission of ending the crimes of Milosevic in Kosovo. 
The third was to drop our objective, abandon the Kosovars and 
let President Milosevic complete the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo, 
if not genocide.  This would reinforce the aggression of the 
Milosevic government and encourage all the other tyrants and 
despots in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is clear.  For the sake of consistency with the 
statements made in 1991 by those who, today, are the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in the democratic 
spirit the media have summarized so well and to act on the will 
of the people, the government must allow MPs to vote on this. 
Canada's position and its participation, if it comes to that, 
will be the stronger for it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques,

leader of the Bloc Quebecois and I have one simple question for 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the current state of emergency with respect to the conflict, 
would the will of parliaments not be the best means to counter 
propaganda and identify the democratic proceedings and action to 
be taken to find a solution to this crisis finally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, this goes without saying, and 
the Germans have shown us the way. It was Germany that proposed 
a peace plan and that same country also held a debate in its 
parliament. Germans acted in a responsible and consistent 
fashion, and they strengthened the diplomatic channels by acting 
in a democratic way. These two things go hand in hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A vote will also be held by the two houses of the Czech 
republic. They too are consistent. This is what must be done. We 
must get all members of this parliament involved, and make 
sure—and I think all the opposition parties agree—that our 
colleagues across the floor wake up, stop yielding to the Prime 
Minister and start remembering the days when they displayed some 
judgment, when they sat on this side of the House. It seems as 
though they have lost all critical judgment since moving to the 
other side of the floor.

on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois to address this motion we have 
put forward in the context of the growing crisis in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's newspapers are reporting that Kosovo is becoming empty. 
Therefore, it is essential to continue the debate in this House, 
to give members an opportunity to address the serious crisis 
being reported by the television, the media and the newspapers. 
Quebecers and Canadians have been closely following this 
conflict, and there is evidence that ethnic cleansing operations 
are indeed taking place and getting worse every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Civilian populations are being displaced to neighbouring 
countries, including Albania, which is welcoming thousands of 
refugees—over 40,000 in the last few hours—Macedonia and 
Montenegro. These countries will have to share that task with 
other nations such as France and, some day, in all likelihood, 
Canada, which said it was prepared to welcome some of these 
refugees.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is ethnic cleansing bordering on genocide, the most 
terrible of crimes against humanity, a crime which saw the 
creation, in 1948, of a convention whose 50th anniversary we 
celebrated last year.  The convention provides not only that the 
crime of genocide is punishable but also that nations have an 
obligation to prevent it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, as the century comes to a close, countries, including 
Canada, seem too little concerned with trying to prevent a 
genocide that echoes the genocides with which the century 
opened: the genocides of the Armenians, the Jews during World 
War II and, more recently, the Cambodians and Rwandans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must say publicly that we have an obligation to prevent a 
genocide.  We must say it in parliaments, for parliaments have 
the role of informing the public, of presenting the situation 
and informing the public through its elected representatives. 
Until now, elected representatives have had the less than 
satisfactory task of receiving information and passing it on to 
the public that duly elected them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs is the primary spokesperson and 
we have had debates on this topic. 
When the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who is the government's 
leading spokesperson on this issue, tells us that it is the 
government's prerogative to decide to send troops abroad, he is 
forgetting that, in 1991, this parliament voted in favour of 
sending troops to Iraq.  There is a precedent for voting in 
favour of sending troops to Kosovo, whether to impose peace 
there or maintain it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important precedent.  We invoke it, and continue to 
invoke it, because it belies any notion that the government does 
not have to consult parliament and put the question to a vote 
because its prerogative does not necessarily require it to 
consult that body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should follow the lead of other parliaments. The 
Minister of Foreign Affairs himself, during a hearing of the 
foreign affairs committee, gave the example of Germany which, by 
the way, has proposed a peace plan that the Bloc Quebecois had 
asked the Government of Canada to sponsor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Germany is not afraid of its parliament. There have already been 
two debates and two votes in the German parliament on this 
issue. The government cannot invoke what is going on in foreign 
parliaments to justify an opposition to a vote in the Canadian 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hungarian and Czech parliamentarians also had an opportunity to 
vote on this issue. The Czech constitution even provides that 
the deployment of troops in a foreign country must be debated 
and approved by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows that other NATO member states trust their 
parliamentarians and their parliaments, and I believe that the 
Canadian parliament should also have a decisive role to play on 
this fundamental issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from saying that parliament must have a decisive role to 
play, I cannot exclude dealing with other dimensions of this 
conflict which the Bloc Quebecois has been concerned with since 
the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a humanitarian aspect about which we must have the 
highest concern: there are too many refugees. There are now 
hundreds of thousands of them. Kosovo, as I already said, is 
being emptied and its people is the victim of ethnic cleansing 
and, likely, of genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must help. We must be generous and show solidarity in this 
terrible ordeal the Kosovar people is undergoing. The government 
must act in a more transparent way. It must share information. 
Militants of the Bloc Quebecois participating in a general 
council during the weekend asked the government to be generous 
to refugees and to spend the $100 million committed to aid for 
the refugees in those countries where they have found refuge.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget the criminal dimension of this conflict. 
There are people, heads of state, politicians who are presumably 
taking part in crimes against humanity, crimes of genocide. They 
must not escape punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia 
should one day soon, real soon, bring to justice the individuals 
who committed and are still committing crimes against humanity. 
As for the man responsible for such crimes, the head of the 
Yugoslav state, he should not be spared and escape punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a political role or dimension to this conflict 
that should not be overlooked. We in the Bloc Quebecois have 
always been concerned with the role the UN must keep on playing 
when it comes to putting an end to international conflicts, 
settling differences, in order to maintain international peace 
and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still believe the security council should play a role, and 
Kofi Annan, who is very well received by the Europeans, should 
also be invited by Canada to play a more active role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it proved necessary, we could eventually ask the General 
Assembly of the United Nations, in keeping with the Acheson 
resolution, to play a role in maintaining international peace 
and security with regard to the present conflict. 
We think it is important for the United Nations not to be cast 
aside, not to be marginalized, to take part in the dispute 
settlement process so that it can maintain its role in the 
future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When newspapers and politicians use the word genocide, I think 
it is important for Canadian parliamentarians to rise in this 
House and exercise their responsibility. They must decide, based 
on their own conscience, whether or not their country should 
deploy peacekeeping forces or land troops, as the case may be, 
as mentioned by our leader, the member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to ask the member a question. In his speech, he 
referred to a precedent that occurred in 1991, when the House 
had a vote on a similar issue. I know the government can make 
its own decisions with regard to international treaties and 
agreements. However, it often gives Canadian parliamentarians 
the opportunity to do so. 
Bill C-27 is a good example of that. This bill, which deals with 
the United Nations fisheries agreement, will be put to a vote on 
Tuesday. Fish stocks are certainly important to me, but life in 
Kosovo is even more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry tell us what role 
Canada can play within the UN security council and give us some 
clarification about that? I know the fisheries, but I would like 
the UN to take this thing seriously and I would like the member 
to tell us about the situation in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question.  While the government, in reviewing its foreign 
policy, proposed democratizing it by giving a voice to the 
people on the matter, we note that it does not seem to want to 
give a real voice to those representing them in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have proof of this from the many times it has rejected the 
idea that these parliamentarians should vote in favour of 
sending troops abroad, not only in this debate, but in other 
debates we have had on sending troops to Iraq and the central 
African republic.  It has always rejected a vote following a 
debate on sending troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my colleague referred to the treaty, if is true that 
parliament may at times consider laws implementing treaties, 
because it is obliged to pass such laws. 
However, this same government will not let the House of Commons 
approve treaties before they are signed or ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here 
again, this is a great democratic shortcoming, which must be 
corrected and which was corrected to some extent in other 
Commonwealth parliaments, such as in Australia and New Zealand, 
and which the British government wants to correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government and others before it have put an end to a former 
practice whereby important treaties were approved.  I can give 
you one example, which is very important in the context of the 
present debate, since parliament, the House of Commons, approved 
it before Canada ratified it, and that is the treaty 
establishing NATO. 
The treaty was approved in the House before being ratified by 
the Government of Canada.  There were others, but the practice 
was dropped, and for the past few months, with Bloc colleagues, 
I have been arguing that the practice should be reinstated in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be an element of real democratization, which the 
present government will no doubt reject, as we will see from the 
way it votes on today's motion, unless it considers that 
democracy is calling out to it today and is insisting that 
parliament also decide matters related to foreign policy.

Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will begin by 
restating why Canada is involved in the action with NATO in the 
former Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Kosovo the Yugoslav regime has engaged in a campaign of 
brutal repression ever since it unilaterally striped Kosovo of 
its autonomy and abolished its local institutions in 1989 and 
1990.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations Security Council, acting under chapter VII, 
has issued several resolutions regarding the Kosovo crisis which 
identified the conflict as a threat to peace and security in the 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These resolutions and the October agreements between the FRY, 
the former republic of Yugoslavia, and the OSCE and NATO, impose 
a clear legal obligation on FRY to respect a ceasefire, protect 
the civilian population, and limit the deployment of a security 
force in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FRY is in clear violation of these commitments which were 
accepted in October and is violating the obligations imposed by 
resolutions 1199 and 1203.  The FRY has violated the ceasefire 
and has systematically violated international humanitarian law by 
launching a campaign of terror against civilians which includes 
killing and torturing, arbitrary detention and persecution, and 
denial of basic rights based on ethnicity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our preference has always been for a diplomatic solution to the 
problem of Kosovo.  Diplomacy was given every chance to succeed. 
Numerous diplomatic missions were sent to Belgrade. The OSCE 
created a major verification mission.  Finally the Rambouillet 
conference ultimately failed because of the consistent 
intransigence displayed by President Milosevic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only when these efforts had been exhausted and when all attempts 
to stop the regime's campaign of terror against civilians had 
failed did the allies resort to military action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly it would have been best if the UN could have facilitated 
an end to the conflict in Kosovo.  When the security council is 
unable to reach consensus, however, we cannot remain passive in 
the presence of massacres and humanitarian disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO's objective is to make the Yugoslav government end the 
savage repression of its own people, to degrade the military 
machine which supports this brutality, and to prompt Belgrade to 
negotiate an agreement with a just political settlement for the 
Kosovars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yugoslav security forces and paramilitary organizations are 
now carrying out a campaign of terror and expelling large numbers 
of Kosovars.  We have corroborated reports that they are 
implicated in summary executions and other atrocities against 
civilians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over one-third of the population of Kosovo has left the country. 
NATO is dealing with this humanitarian disaster, not only by 
stepping up the military intervention which is the only obstacle 
in the way of Serbian ethnic cleansing.  It is also directly 
assisting the refugees, increasing its assistance to humanitarian 
organizations and supporting the work of the International 
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criticism that NATO action is the cause of the current 
deterioration of the humanitarian situation is unfounded.  Ethnic 
cleansing by the Yugoslav authorities has been going on for 
months with forced expulsions, destruction of villages, and 
massacres by the security forces in 1998 and early 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regime blatantly violated UNSC resolutions and other 
obligations, harassed international verifiers and built up its 
military deployment in preparation for a massive spring offensive 
which started as soon as the OSCE verification mission was forced 
to leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This all happened before NATO began its military intervention. 
NATO responded to Milosevic's ethnic cleansing.  It did not 
provoke it.  The ideal course of action remains diplomacy.  Any 
diplomatic overture must however open the way to a lasting 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Milosevic knows perfectly well what the conditions are for this 
to happen.  He must immediately stop the campaign of ethnic 
cleansing and terror against civilians, withdraw Serbian forces 
from Kosovo, accept an international peacekeeping force which 
would provide the Kosovars with enough confidence to return home 
in safety and commit to a just political settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully support Canada's participation in the NATO action 
precipitated by a humanitarian disaster.  I also fully support 
our men and women in the Canadian forces who have responded so 
courageously to this situation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not able to support the motion.  The government is 
committed to consulting with parliament and has been doing so on 
an ongoing basis.  So far there have been three separate debates 
on Kosovo in the House for a total of 26 hours in which almost 
100 MPs participated.  On the issue of deployment of ground 
troops, NATO has not so far requested Canada to provide ground 
troops to the action.  Therefore the question remains 
hypothetical.  If this request occurs the Prime Minister has 
committed to consulting with parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of holding a vote I would argue that our system in 
which the government and not parliament is responsible for 
deploying troops needs to maintain its current flexibility.  This 
ensures that if necessary the government can deploy troops as it 
at times has on an emergency basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament is not always sitting and may not be in a position to 
respond to an emergency.  In practice, when Canadian military 
personnel are called upon to support peacekeeping or humanitarian 
missions abroad, the need for their presence can be immediate in 
very real terms.  A prime example is the disaster assistance 
response team which is designed to begin deployment of its 180 
members within 48 hours.  Therefore I believe it would be 
inappropriate to tie the hands of the government to respond 
quickly and effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that opposition to the motion does not mean the 
government is denying that parliament has an important role to 
play.  Parliament has been engaged throughout this conflict, as 
have the standing committees on foreign affairs and defence.   I 
repeat that the Prime Minister has made a firm commitment to 
consult parliament if the situation in Kosovo changes 
significantly.

<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker,  I 
have listened carefully to the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs.  The only argument he appears to be 
using to justify this Parliament's not voting on this motion is 
that of flexibility.  That is the only argument I heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not valid because section 32 of the National Defence Act 
gives the government that flexibility. 
I would invite the Parliamentary Secretary to read that section 
with care, as it provides that, when parliament is not in 
session, the governor in council may place the Canadian forces 
on active service and that it can, moreover, recall Parliament 
within a certain period of time so that the matter may be 
presented and eventually discussed in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the only argument he used, and it is not convincing. 
What would be convincing, however, would be to hear the 
parliamentary secretary, and through him, his government, state 
a belief in parliamentary democracy.  This is a parliamentary 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is this: ought a parliamentary democracy not to give 
MPs a true voice when it comes to sending troops abroad, 
soldiers whose lives could be in danger, and to committing major 
funding for the purpose of ensuring international peace and 
security, as we have since the beginning of the conflict?  Does 
a parliamentary democracy not require the government to accept, 
as a previous government did, our voting on a motion like the 
one to authorize sending troops to Kosovo?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Madam Speaker, I also listened very 
carefully to my hon. friend's argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically, Canada has not voted on issues of this gravity. 
When there was a vote taken on the Iraq situation, my hon. friend 
will remember that it was taken months after the fact. The debate 
did not occur at the outset of the hostilities.  I believe it was 
upwards of four months after the commencement of the hostilities 
that there was even a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the hon. member that the position of the government 
has historically been that yes, parliament must be consulted. 
Parliament in this case has been consulted on a regular basis, 
probably more often than at any other time of serious conflict. 
It must remain the prerogative of the government to make the 
instant decisions when they need to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend referred to the section in the defence act which 
gives flexibility to the government.  Certainly that flexibility 
has to be maintained all the way across the broad base. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, certainly 
I have heard the parliamentary secretary say that the Prime 
Minister will consult with parliament before he commits to any 
ground troops.  It still comes back to the very question today 
which is, are we going to have a vote on it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty hard to justify to the Canadian public that the 
government would not vote on committing the lives of men and 
women in our armed forces.  What is really wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would point to the 
response I gave to the Bloc critic. Historically, successive 
Canadian governments have maintained that it is best to present 
unanimity from all sides of the House on a decision of this 
gravity and magnitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the hon. member's position.  It is another point of 
view, but it is not the point of view that has been held 
historically by the governments of this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the motion 
before the House today is relatively straightforward.  It calls 
on the government to commit itself to hold a debate and a vote 
prior to the commitment of any ground troops to the war in the 
Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is really nothing odd about such a request.  There is 
nothing controversial or partisan about this motion.  It is 
consistent with the best democratic traditions this country can 
lay claim to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is odd is the fact that the government did not itself bring 
forth a votable motion on this issue.  What is controversial is 
the government's repeated refusal to allow such a debate or vote 
to occur.  That is what gets our constituents asking why the 
government will not let this go to a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The refusal to allow the House to decide what the role of this 
country should be in a war is truly astonishing. Let there be no 
misunderstanding.  The government does not have a mandate as a 
result of the three take note debates on Kosovo. Its claim that 
it has such a mandate are simply unacceptable and is certainly 
not why any of us participated in those take note debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1914 this country was simply notified by the Governor 
General that it was at war.  The decision was made in London. In 
September 1939 Canada waited 10 days to enter the second world 
war on the side of Britain and France, 10 days in which 
parliament debated and voted on the issue.  On September 9, 1939 
Prime Minister Mackenzie King accepted that the Commons should 
decide if Canada should go to war.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has not happened in 1999. Our pilots have already flown 
more than 100 combat missions and the present government has 
repeatedly argued that we are not at war. That position is simply 
a word game and would please many of the lawyers here, but it 
certainly does not please the Canadian public. The man on the 
street, the members of this House and our adversaries in 
Yugoslavia see things a lot differently. They are calling this 
war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 when we supported the UN coalition, this House also 
debated and voted on a resolution concerning Canadian military 
involvement.  At that time the current Prime Minister, then the 
Leader of the Official Opposition, criticized the Mulroney 
government.  I quote:  “Really Canadians have had enough of 
these ambiguities and playing the dice on the table without 
telling Canadians exactly what the situation is.  Should we have 
Canadians involved in war, yes or no?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The high-minded principles so strongly endorsed just eight years 
ago seem to have been mere words, nothing more. They have 
apparently been forgotten by the Prime Minister. They have 
vanished like smoke in the political wind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign affairs minister is no more consistent. Before this 
House in 1991 he said:  “My deepest concern is that they, the 
Tories, will be simply using parliament to try to rubber stamp or 
ratify decisions already taken, as opposed to letting parliament 
be the forum in which those decisions are formulated”. Last 
Thursday in the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade he also appeared to forget his concern for 
this House.  He argued that because this is not a republic, the 
crown retains the right to make foreign policy and to decide 
matters of war and peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians might rightly ask what is the cause of this 
uncertainty?  Why would ministers with such long parliamentary 
careers change their opinions so drastically?  I will not try to 
offer any answers to those questions.  Given this lack of 
certainty on the government benches, I would suggest we err on 
the side of democracy.  It is, after all, what this country 
expects.  We preach democracy abroad, we sell democratization to 
other countries, and we must practise it at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eight years after the gulf war this country finds itself once 
again involved in a war.  It does not really matter at this point 
in the debate that our current military intervention was not 
sanctioned by the UN.  It does not really matter in our debate 
today if NATO's long term strategy is unclear.  It does not 
really matter that we have no idea what the long term objectives 
of the current conflict are, beyond the basic moral 
considerations that my hon. colleague the Leader of the 
Opposition raised a week ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues are not the most pressing issues of the debate 
today.  The government's arguments that we cannot debate 
something that has not yet happened is equally unimportant.  This 
motion is to commit the government to a debate when and if the 
need to send ground troops should arise.  A week, a month, 
whenever that should happen, we should have a vote in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is not about the war.  It is about Canadian 
democracy.  Because this issue is so important to our democracy 
is why I can strongly endorse this motion before us today. 
Despite the fact that I might disagree on many other Bloc ideas, 
certainly this is one we should commend it for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This chamber is the House of Commons.  It is the only place in 
the entire land that the elected representatives of the Canadian 
people can meet and debate the future of our country.  This room, 
not the cabinet chamber, is the focal point for our democratic 
system of government.  Here the government of the day must answer 
to the people through their elected members of parliament.  Here 
the laws are made.  Here the great issues that affect our people 
are supposed to be decided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we send any ground troops to fight in distant lands, 
members of parliament must take a position.  It is the only right 
thing we can possibly do.  I do not want to ever stand accused by 
the parents, wives, husbands, children of our soldiers that I 
failed to take a stand in this House and ask all the questions 
that should be asked.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not seem to want to understand these simple 
facts.  The motion before us is not an attempt to embarrass the 
government.  It is not about expressing confidence or lack 
thereof in the Prime Minister and his cabinet.  It is quite 
simply a call for the government to respect the rights and 
privileges of parliament and to adhere to the most basic 
standards of Canadian democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The precedents of 1939 and 1991 clearly and forthrightly 
demonstrate that matters of war and peace are not, I repeat not, 
the sole prerogative of the crown in this country.  The Prime 
Minister and foreign affairs minister understood this in 1991.  I 
am at a loss to explain why they have forgotten that fact in 
1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us is several weeks overdue.  The official 
opposition has been urging for some time the necessity of a vote 
in the House before Canada commits ground troops to the ongoing 
war in Kosovo.  The other opposition parties have also agreed 
with us and have been urging the same thing. I commend my Bloc 
colleague again for having brought forward this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a saying that there is a time and a place for 
everything.  The time for a votable motion on the deployment of 
ground troops to Kosovo is now and the place is in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I heard the hon. member say that he strongly endorses this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that the hon. member note that there was debate in 
the House in November and further debate in February.  The 
minister appeared before the committee in March.  Then there was 
a further debate last week which went through to the wee hours of 
the morning.  I thought that parliament had a strong attack of 
me-tooism in the entire debate.  There was very little dissent 
from the position the government had taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little hard pressed to know how the hon. member strongly 
endorses what is quite easily and arguably a vague and confusing 
motion.  Is this a motion on a vote to vote, or is this a motion 
on a possibility or a hypothetical situation?  Does the hon. 
member interpret this as a matter of confidence in the 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is certainly not a 
matter of confidence.  As I pointed out, it should be a 
non-partisan approach to the whole question when we are talking 
about the lives of our soldiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the take note debate, I cannot believe that anybody in 
the House would stand and say one, that that was a debate and 
two, that it was an opportunity to let every member in the House 
become informed on the issue.  I do not need to talk about how 
many people are here when take note debates occur in the middle 
of the night, but certainly it is not many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about lives, when we talk about something as 
important as war, we say that we should put it to a vote.  We 
believe that most parties in the House would vote honestly and 
would vote for support of what is happening in NATO. I think that 
would be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand what the government is so afraid of in 
putting this to a vote.  Once that vote occurs and the majority 
position is held, then I would hope that 100% of us would support 
our troops in this war situation.  But put it to a vote.  That is 
politically such a wise thing to do I cannot imagine why the 
government is not doing it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, since the 
beginning of recorded history the human race has faced crisis 
after crisis.  The world today seems to be moving in a new 
direction, which history will undoubtedly see as the crises of 
our era.  While wars between nations were the reality earlier in 
our century,  this phenomenon now seems on the verge of 
disappearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not telling my colleagues anything they did not already 
know when I say that today's wars are increasingly taking place 
inside national boundaries.  Pluralist countries, in the grip of 
extremist tendencies, see the various groups represented in 
their population shift from an attitude of peaceful coexistence 
to one of pure and simple belligerence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this happens, a great many of the victims are found among 
the civilian population. 
This is deplorable enough, but it is made more deplorable still 
by the fact that the worst violations of human rights occur in 
these internal conflicts.  The principle of national sovereignty 
forbids any intervention from outside, so that the international 
community could justify its failure to intervene if it 
considered nothing but that principle.  But do we understand the 
cost of failing to intervene? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing we should never forget about the sacrosanct 
principle of national sovereignty, and that is that a nation's 
sovereignty counts for nothing if it does not exist for the much 
greater good of the sovereignty of its population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The roll call of these new-style conflicts is a long one.  The 
names of a few countries will suffice:  Algeria, Sierra Leone, 
Rwanda. 
They will forever be associated with the atrocities of which 
they were the theatres and their populations the actors, the 
spectators and the victims.  While our attention is turned 
elsewhere, some of these crises continue to rage.  But no 
example is more striking by its immediacy and its scale than the 
crisis in Kosovo. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today debating this motion for that very reason, the 
very seriousness of this crisis.  The motion cuts to the heart of 
why I entered politics.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was campaigning, many people who came to the door, young 
and old alike, told me their concerns about politicians. They 
were very cynical about the political process.  Many of them said 
that they were so discouraged they were not even going to vote. I 
told them not give up that basic right to vote because it is one 
of the basic principles of our democracy.  The minute we give up 
that right to vote, we give up our opportunity to change what we 
are unhappy about.  We give up the right to be a part of 
influencing decisions that affect our lives.  The right to vote 
is a very important.  I told them that I do not care whether they 
voted for me or for the next person as long as they got out and 
exercised their right to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in this particular situation, we need information.  In 
order to assess this situation, it is important to have the 
proper information.  We know that information is one of the first 
casualties of war.  The difficulty we have today in assessing the 
crisis in Kosovo is that quite often we do not know if the 
information we are getting has been screened or if it is 
propaganda from one side or the other side.  This creates 
difficulties in assessing the situation and making decisions. 
This is all the more reason why it is very important that this 
matter come before parliament.  We need to become as fully 
informed as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important in this case to have a vote because we are, 
in fact, sending our men and women off to war.  It is a very 
serious situation.  When people are being sent off to put their 
lives and limbs at risk, it is important that we as Canadians 
have a say in that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very concerned about a phrase used by by the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs when he was discussing the involvement of a vote. 
He mentioned “cabinet government”.  We recognize cabinet 
government is important.  We do recognize that government does 
have the right to govern and that it does have a responsibility 
that it cannot pass off to someone else.  However, that 
responsibility does not mean that it cannot consult with, it 
cannot be guided by a vote or it cannot bring other input into 
the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Flexibility to act was mentioned earlier.  Flexibility to act 
comes when we have as much information, help and guidance as 
possible.  That does not mean giving away the right of government 
to make the final decision.  It means that government makes its 
final decision based on all reasonable input, information and 
votes.  It is therefore very important to not confuse the issue 
of cabinet government with the right of parliament to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel it is very important to have adequate guidelines before 
committing our men and women to any kind of action on the ground, 
whether it be peaceful action or more aggressive action.  We 
should know what is involved.  We should know, for example, what 
kind of equipment is going to be used, how well the men are going 
to be prepared and what kind of support they are going to get. We 
also need to know what kind of support these people will get when 
they come home from missions because it has been an issue before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have is with reservists.  We understand that 
reservists can be called into action to help defend their country 
but the government will not guarantee them their jobs when they 
return home from service.  What would they be facing when they 
returned home?   Would they be facing the same situation as 
merchant marines who, after serving their country well, came back 
to find themselves without jobs, without opportunities to advance 
themselves and with the government saying it had no 
responsibility for this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the issues that have to be dealt with when we 
are talking about sending our men and women as ground forces into 
Kosovo.  This is why it is all the more important that parliament 
be able to debate in a meaningful way and have a vote on the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite often the government says that it has had debates and that 
opportunities have been give to express opinions.  That is true. 
We have had debates and opportunities were given to express 
opinions.  However, these were not punctuated with the right of 
parliament to then make this action concrete with a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would compare this to the people who talked to me at the door 
expressing their concern about politicians and about a having a 
say in society.  Those people who expressed their views by saying 
they were not going to vote, are similar to the take note debates 
that we have.  There are lots of views and opinions coming 
forward but no further action.  However, the ones who went out 
and voted afterwards transmitted their views into action, which 
is what we need from this House of Parliament.  We need to be 
able to transmit those views that are brought forth in debate 
into action by the very important democratic right to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, I strongly support the motion that has been 
put forward.  I feel that if, as a member of parliament, I am not 
given my right to vote on this issue, then all those people who 
elected me and who I represent have lost their right to vote and 
their say on this issue of very great importance to Canadians. 
The people's voices are heard are through their elected 
representatives.  If we in the House of Commons do not have the 
right to vote on this important issue then we have deprived all 
Canadians of their say and their right to vote on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to give this very important motion serious 
consideration and support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member will appreciate that some precision is needed 
before one can vote.  He said that it is very important and he 
encourages his constituents to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question is not whether we should or should not vote 
but rather what exactly it is we are voting on.  Are we voting on 
whether we have the right to vote?  Are we voting on a 
hypothetical situation?  Are we voting on whether or not Canada 
should go to war? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested in the hon. member's interpretation of 
what this motion means?   As I read the motion, that the 
government submit to a debate and a vote on the possibility of 
sending Canadian soldiers to the Balkans, it is, in my mind, a 
very vague motion.  I would have encouraged the drafters to be 
far more precise in their motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the vagueness of the motion, what is it the hon. member 
thinks he will be voting on when he stands up and is afforded the 
opportunity to vote on the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Madam Speaker, I understand the hon. 
member's concern.  People obviously do not want to deal with 
hypothetical situations.  However, we are dealing with a 
principle.  The principle is that we should have the right to 
vote on the very important question of sending men and women off 
to war.  If it does not happen we will not have to vote on it, 
but if it does happen we should have that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has thus far refused to make the commitment that 
it will even guarantee us the right to vote on that issue.  It 
has been indicated that it will be a cabinet decision or the 
Prime Minister will decide.  We are simply saying that as 
parliamentarians we want to be able to decide.  That is the 
essence of the motion.  We can quibble with the wording if we 
want but I think every member knows within their heart exactly 
what the motion means.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I do 
not mean to blame you, but I rose four or five times to speak. I 
am very anxious to tell the House what our feelings are with 
regard to the conflict in Kosovo, but I will content myself with 
the one minute I am allowed to put a question to the member who 
just made some good comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would like this debate to be non partisan. I would like 
to know whether we can co-operate. Just as we talk about 
globalized markets, could we not talk about globalizing peace, 
and work together with all concerned states at making it long 
lasting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member whether he shares our view 
regarding the globalization of peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will have the opportunity to speak again during the course of 
the day. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Madam Speaker, I very much agree with 
the concept of globalized peace.  I certainly agree with people 
getting together to do everything they can to bring this about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in my earlier remarks on Kosovo I said that it should 
not be a we and a they thing. I personally do not see it as us 
against the government or the government against us.  I see it as 
people working together to try to bring about some peace to a 
very troubled part of the world.  That is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree 100% with the hon. member that when we are dealing with 
the lives of individuals we should be looking at issues in an 
non-partisan way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate my colleague for his speech and support for 
the motion. I would like to ask him a question regarding the 
vote.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone agrees that what is going one in Kosovo is barbaric to 
an extent rarely seen throughout the history of mankind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are wondering whether to send in troops to push the Serbs out 
of Kosovo. I would like to ask my colleague this: would he vote 
in favour of sending troops to Kosovo to force the Serbs out? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is barbaric 
behaviour on all sides of this conflict.  One could argue that 
what is happening is barbaric with respect to the Serbian action 
against the Kosovars, but it is also barbaric when poisonous 
fumes are being released into the air, destroying our 
environment.  There is barbarism on all sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are getting into the hypothetical, and I use it advisedly, 
when we talk about how we would vote on the matter.  I would have 
to know what the details would be with respect to ground forces. 
That is what we are asking of the government, to commit to 
bringing these things before us so we can debate them fully and 
then vote on them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
no pleasure for me to rise today to speak to the Bloc Quebecois 
motion on the war in Kosovo and the probable sending of ground 
troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, of course, going to support the Bloc motion, but not the 
amendment.  Nevertheless, one can never say one rises with any 
pleasure in this House when the subject is war, when men, women 
and children are dying because of the actions of their regime, 
but also because of the actions of those who want to see the end 
of that regime, in other words NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet this must be discussed, debated and indeed voted on.  There 
has been reference in recent weeks to the gulf war.  There is 
nothing perfect about war, certainly; in fact, war is imperfect. 
Yet, as far as information and consultation of parliamentarians 
and of the Quebec and Canadian public is concerned, it is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a few minutes of the short time I have available to 
me to give a very brief overview of the events of 1990-91.  But 
first I have two comments to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing that is insulting to an MP—or perhaps I 
just lack experience—it is the take-note debates, as this is a way 
to cast aside the legitimate work of parliamentarians by 
invoking extraordinary rules, which means doing away with the 
traditional rules on which this parliament is built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, the government has made use of extraordinary 
measures, during debate, that go against the rules that make 
parliament run smoothly are concerned: no quorum calls, no 
votes, no amendments and so on.  Since 1993, this government 
has, on several occasions, used extraordinary rules for 
essential debates, which makes the debates meaningless.  I trust 
there will be no more of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the Minister of Foreign Affairs gave evidence 
before to committee.  The last time, he stayed two hours and a 
half, and I salute him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not, however, what we had asked for.  We wanted a 
complete briefing for MPs, not the extension of Oral Question 
Period this turned out to be.  Perhaps it was a bit better than 
nothing, but we did not get any information.  We have been at 
war for one month, and there has never been any official 
briefing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been promised one this week.  The foreign affairs 
committee is going to meet and is supposed to get a briefing, a 
month after the war started.  In the meantime, we have tripled 
our military presence, maybe even more than that.  This is what 
we are being told here.  This war was off to as bad a start as 
far as parliamentary rules are concerned as it was from the 
military point of view.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not an expert on military issues, but this seems to be an 
improvised war. The gulf war had all the negative 
characteristics of a war, but members will recall that all 
necessary preparations were made. Everything was there: 
aircraft, ships, ground forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We told Saddam Hussein: “Listen, either you leave Kuwait or we 
will take action”. We took action. We did not have to double or 
triple our initial commitment in the process. We were prepared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the gulf war, on August 2, 1990, Saddam Hussein tried 
to invade Kuwait. On the same day, the UN security council 
passed its first resolution. 
The UN does not exist for nothing. It is there to serve the 
international community. The first resolution urged Iraq to get 
out of Kuwait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 6, in the middle of the summer, resolution 661 
regarding economic sanctions was passed. On August 10, the then 
Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, made a statement. I am doing my 
best to make a brief summary of the sequence of events. He said 
in that statement that Canada was willing, if necessary, to 
support the deployment of troops. At that time, we were mostly 
talking about ships. The first ship left Halifax on August 24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 25, resolution 665 said that we would use whatever 
means necessary to apply economic sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 14, the cabinet agreed to send CF-18s if necessary. 
The first debate took place on September 24. 
No guns, no shots had been fired.  Not a missile had been 
launched.  Nobody had died because of the allied forces. The 
first debate was held, a 14 hour debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion condemned the invasion of Kuwait and led to Canada's 
support for troops to be sent under the aegis of the United 
Nations, a multinational force.  In September, we debated this, 
and a vote was held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another motion was debated on November 28 and 29.  No missiles 
had yet been launched.  We had a second debate.  What was going 
on?  We had a debate before anyone started shooting.  We had a 
second debate, with a vote, to support resolution 660.  A 
Liberal amendment, which we have talked about, was rejected by 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once into January, things started heating up.  There were cutoff 
dates for Saddam Hussein. 
On January 11, the Leader of the Opposition at the time, our 
current Prime Minister, as a member of the Privy Council, was 
informed by the prime minister of the time.  No missiles had yet 
been launched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, was 
entitled to a briefing, because of his position.  We have been 
waiting a month for such a briefing.  The first official 
briefing for a leader of an opposition party was held this 
morning, one month later, because he is a member of the Privy 
Council.  One month later. Missiles have been launched, our 
military involvement has tripled, but it took a month before 
there was a briefing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Leader of the Opposition at the time, the 
current Prime Minister, said on January 16, 1991, after being 
informed in detail: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“War in the gulf is useless and dangerous”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure that he does not regret his words today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January, we had our third debate, and no missiles had yet 
been launched.  We debated for 46 hours.  On January 16, 
Operation Desert Storm started.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There were three debates and three votes on hypothetical 
questions.  Were we going to war in the Persian Gulf or not? 
These were hypothetical questions. Those in the House at the 
time had the opportunity to debate the questions on three 
occasions.  It is a parliamentary privilege to vote. But it was 
on a hypothetical question.  Were we going to fight or not?  It 
came up three times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier today, the government is going to have to 
understand that parliamentarians and this parliament are a tool. 
We need to have accurate information.  We all know what is 
going on in Kosovo, or at least we know what the media tell us, 
because we cannot trust the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what is going on in Kosovo. 
We know that major crimes are taking place.  What is the exact 
nature of these crimes?  We have our suspicions.  There is 
increasing talk of mass graves.  We know that there are problems 
with Montenegro and Macedonia, and that problems with Hungary 
are not far off.  Trouble is brewing over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One month after the first military intervention, we have still 
not had a vote.  Could we at least have a real debate, a vote on 
what has gone on, and if we are officially sending ground 
troops, could that be debated and voted on as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we have much to learn from wars.  Nothing is ever 
perfect.  The last time, parliamentary committees were put to 
work.  I hope the government will understand that parliament is 
a tool.  War is madness, but parliamentarians and the public can 
bring about peace.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
earlier today the member for Red Deer reminded me that the 
present Prime Minister and the present foreign affairs minister 
rose in the House a number of times condemning the Conservative 
government for the lack of debate and the lack of a vote on the 
1991 Desert Storm crisis.  Today we see the opposite occurring. 
According to the Liberal government we are not to have a vote. We 
are not having the kind of debate we in the opposition would like 
to have.  The Conservatives are now attacking the Liberals for 
not doing exactly what they were attacked for in 1991.  The whole 
process gets a little confusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember in the last parliament the debate on whether we 
should send troops to Bosnia.  Much to our dismay, while we were 
debating whether we should send troops to Bosnia, we learned that 
the troops had been sent three days before the debate began. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly agree with the motion.  We should have a vote on the 
issue.  However, would the member not agree that before we can 
accomplish anything legitimately in the House of Commons that we 
really need some serious changes in terms of open, honest, 
transparent debates and freer votes to vote the wishes of the 
people we represent and not the wishes of the party whips? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Madam Speaker, our role today is not to 
criticize and tell the government that it did not do a good job 
back then, but that it is doing better now.  That is not the 
idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is lots of time for partisanship. We wanted to respond to 
the government's statement that there has been debate.  That is 
nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is perfectly right.  It is time, and perhaps even a 
bit too late.  At some point it will perhaps become clear that 
things have gone further than we think.  We will perhaps find 
out too late that things have already gone too far and that we 
are in much deeper than we thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that we must have accurate information and a genuine 
debate in accordance with the rules of parliament, but time is 
of the essence because the situation is changing very quickly.

first of all, I want to say that I agree with the criticisms the 
hon. member for Richmond—Arthabaska made about the briefings 
given by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We learned earlier this morning that instead of being briefed

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not forthcoming. They obviously have something 
to hide. They lack transparency and, throughout this debate, we 
have to blame the government as often as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague from Richmond—Arthabaska indicated that there is a 
major precedent in this House that should govern us, that should 
inspire those who, for several years now, have been addressing 
the issue of sending troops abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague said that his party will be supporting our motion, 
and we appreciate it. However, he also mentioned that he will 
not be voting for the amendment. 
Why will he not support the amendment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, his party ensured that debates and votes would be held 
before troops are sent in. The Bloc Quebecois would like the 
vote to be held before troops are sent abroad and that can be 
done, as we saw in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Madam Speaker, I will be very brief. The 
fact is there was a UN mandate in the case of the war in the 
Persian Gulf. The security council had agreed on certain 
resolutions and on the need for military intervention, and 
parliament was then consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, if we use words like prior to the possibility of, this 
means that before we go to the UN, we need to reach an agreement 
here. The logistics of it all become a bit difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do understand my hon. colleague's concern, and after 
the conflict, we will eventually have time to review the whole 
matter and improve the system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, today, we are 
having another debate on the very important issue of Kosovo. 
This time, we wanted to make sure our demands would be crystal 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 20 days, in fact since the very beginning of the 
crisis in Kosovo, we have asked many questions. And each time, 
we have been given answers that were incomplete or evasive, 
answers that were not answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are asking the government to give us an opportunity to 
vote clearly. Obviously, this requires that the government give 
us the relevant information, because, before we can make an 
informed decision, we need to have all the available 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government still has a long way to go in that regard and 
this is why we ask the government, in the case of new 
developments regarding the commitment of ground troops to 
Kosovo, to hold a debate and a vote on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said no. This morning, its representative, the 
secretary of state, told us that the government's refusal was 
based on considerations of convenience and availability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can members of parliament officially express their opinions 
in the House and speak on behalf of their taxpayers and 
represent them well, if not by a vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a democracy, the only way members of parliament can make 
their positions known officially and without ambiguity is by 
voting. 
Of course, we can always deliver speeches, which is what I am 
doing right now. That is what the government has allowed us to 
do so far on the issue of Kosovo. The government said it would 
consult parliament by giving members an opportunity to express 
theirs views on the issue. So far, more than 130 members have 
taken advantage of this opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But a speech is quite different from a vote. In a speech, we can 
always qualify our statements.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can always make sure there is a way out. But when time comes 
to vote, you either say yes or no. This is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the taxpayers each of us represents in our 
respective ridings have the right to know where their member of 
parliament stands. Does he agree or not with what is coming next 
in Kosovo? Yes or no, does he support ground military action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a speech, the member can always say “I agree as long as” or 
“I disagree because of such and such event or because such and 
such condition was not met”.  But this is not voting. 
You cannot vote conditionally. You either vote for or against a 
proposition. The taxpayers to whom we are responsible are 
entitled to know how we feel on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are taxpayers entitled to that type of respect? First of 
all, because it is the very essence of our democratic system. 
Taxpayers are entitled to know what we came here to say on their 
behalf. Secondly, because this Kosovo crisis is far from being 
over. It is not only about the actual crisis and its bombing 
raids that are not over yet. Besides, we do not know when all 
this will end. There might be ground attacks or not. We do not 
know. But what we do know is that it will be long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And even when a peace agreement is reached, many weeks, months 
and even years will pass before the Kosovo problem is settled. 
Canadian taxpayers will therefore certainly be involved again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They might be asked to make sacrifices to help the government 
respect the commitments that will have been made during the 
Kosovo war. Taxpayers are entitled to know right now what these 
commitments are, how far we are prepared to go, how far we are 
able to go, and what choices they will eventually have to face 
because of the decisions that we are making now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers are entitled to know if today in Canada decisions are 
made in the minister's office or the cabinet, without a vote in 
the House. Cabinet is ready to commit astronomical amounts. They 
were talking about $100 million just to take in 5,000 refugees. 
That was simply for bringing 5,000 Kosovars here. Needless to 
say that has been put on the backburner for now, but the amount 
forecasted was $100 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it costs $100 million to take in 5,000 Kosovars, how much 
more does it cost to provide 18 CF-18s, in addition to the troops 
already deployed and the humanitarian assistance already 
provided to the refugees still in Kosovo, Albania, Macedonia and 
other adjacent countries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We figure that several million dollars have been committed to 
date. We are asking that the government tell us the truth, be 
transparent and allow us to vote for or against this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, we have not hassled the government too much. So far, we 
have supported its positions. We have supported them because we 
thought it was essential that help be sent to Kosovo, where 
children, women and entire families live under the threat of 
being killed, harmed or deported. These people are sick, they do 
not have a home or anything to eat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was therefore essential that we give our support.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But now that the process has been initiated, we can take the 
time to ask ourselves other questions. The decisions we make are 
made for humanitarian reasons, but they must be made by laying 
everything out on the table, so that we can all give to the 
taxpayers of this country, our fellow citizens and constituents, 
information about the positions we all agreed on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no reason to prevent us from debating this 
issue and voting on it. Why would it deny us this right? The 
readiness argument does not hold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Armed conflicts do not break out every six months. 
And if ever there was another one, our motion is not asking the 
government to settle things for all times to come. It is asking 
the government to ensure that we will have an opportunity to 
vote on the sending of troops for peacekeeping, or for other 
purposes, in Kosovo and in the Balkan region. This is what we 
want to vote on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not committing ourselves for other times to come. We are 
not asking the government to promise us anything for other 
times. We are saying: “We have this situation. In this 
particular situation, we are asking the government for the right 
to fully exercise democracy, for the right to be informed and, 
mostly, we are asking it to give us an opportunity to express 
our opinion, to give our approval with a full knowledge of the 
issue”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the least the government should commit to.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the government stands against the motion on the floor 
for pretty solid reasons.  It breaks with Canadian parliamentary 
practice.  It deals with a hypothetical question which is clearly 
stated in hypothetical terms.  It would set an unworkable 
precedent in tying the hands of the government when it comes to 
the timeliness and effectiveness of future deployments of 
Canadian forces whether in a combat or peacekeeping role such as 
in the Balkans or anywhere in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Canadian parliamentary system the responsibility for 
deploying Canadian forces lies with the government.  For example, 
there was no formal parliamentary resolution in our entry into 
the Korean war.  Even in 1939 there was no specific resolution 
declaring war on Nazi Germany.  Parliamentary approval for the 
government's policy was shown through support for the Speech from 
the Throne and the defence estimates.  There was no vote at all 
in the declaration of war against imperial Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1950 there have been over 50 peacekeeping support 
operations of varying sizes.  In many of these cases parliament 
was not consulted at all.  In the case of roughly 20 major 
missions which were debated in the House, there were only five 
recorded votes and three motions were agreed to without a 
recorded vote.  Only three of these occurred prior to deployment: 
the Congo in 1960, Cyprus in 1964 and the Middle East in 1973. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the opposition party really disagrees with deployment it 
should not hide behind procedural motions.  It should have the 
courage to introduce a motion of non-confidence in the 
government.  Our government has delivered on its— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid I must 
interrupt the hon. member.  We are on questions and comments and 
not on debate.  I trust the hon. member is aware of that and can 
ask his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have a question of the member who spoke? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  I question my position to speak 
being given to the Bloc Quebecois.

colleague's comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made comments because it was our turn to do so. We have not 
taken anybody's turn. We have 20 minutes to make 
comments but we agreed to share our time. My comments were of 
normal duration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the comment the member of the Liberal Party started 
making to tell him I find it surprising that he would invoke 
parliamentary practices to deny the House such a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is time to send a delegation of 5, 6, 7, 8 or 10 members 
abroad as part of a parliamentary association or other group, 
the House is asked to authorize the required funding. It is 
deemed important for the House to vote on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are talking about eventually sending soldiers to risk 
their lives in Kosovo, and it is deemed not necessary for the 
House to vote on this. We are told that a cabinet decision will 
be sufficient. 
If it takes the approval of the House for 10 members to travel 
abroad, its approval should also be required to send hundreds or 
thousands of soldiers abroad.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I followed with great interest the hon. member's 
presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remind the hon. member, as my colleague mentioned 
earlier, we have sent our peacekeepers overseas many times and we 
never had a debate.  Over the last five years I can remember five 
or six debates and the hon. member participated in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, last week when the Minister of Foreign Affairs was 
asked the same question he replied that none of the European 
nations debated or discussed the issue.  The U.K. is sending 
thousands of soldiers to Kosovo and has never debated it.  The 
U.S. has sent many troops and aircraft and it has never had a 
debate.

their opinions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, I would ask my colleague to 
check his information. A debate was indeed held in Germany, the 
country that put forward the peace plan. In the U.S. too there was 
a debate. The American government has been keeping its citizens 
better informed on these matters than we have here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> They are not on top of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> It is obvious that Canada is not comfortable 
with its response. As I recall, since the last world war, Canada 
took part in military interventions on three occasions only—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I think it 
is extremely important to speak to the motion today, and I will 
take a few moments to read it again: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House demand that the government submit to a debate 
and a vote in the House the sending of Canadian soldiers to the 
Balkans who may be involved in military or 
peacekeeping operations on the ground in Kosovo and the Balkan 
region. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has been calling from the start for a vote in 
this House on the possible deployment of Canadian troops to take 
part in a peacekeeping mission, and even more so if they are to 
take part in a ground war which would certainly be a dirty war. 
The Bloc Quebecois has not said that it is against such a 
deployment, but it wants to have all the information. It wants 
this issue to be debated by the representatives of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear a lot in the news about what is going on in Kosovo. 
However, in the House we do not debate the issue with 
the benefit of all the information available to the government. 
We had evidence of that on several occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we did not hear about the conflict in Kosovo until 
some time ago, it is not a recent one. Last year as 
representative of the Bloc Quebecois at a meeting of the Council 
of Europe—where colleagues from other parties were also 
present—I attended debates on the crisis in Kosovo on two 
occasions. These debates were between parliamentarians from all 
European countries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were disturbing and harrowing debates. Over there, there 
are many parties. Parliamentarians are divided in five blocs 
that have existed since the foundation of the Council of Europe 
in 1949. Europe has experience in this matter. The debates were 
disturbing and harrowing, because everybody wanted a peaceful 
outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Calls for a peaceful settlement, for good will, for the 
intervention of observers, for third party negotiations were 
heard ad nauseam. However, what was mostly heard is that 
Milosevic could not have care less and was deaf to the pleas by 
the rest of Europe, which has had more than its fair share of 
wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote only a few sentences, but I heard people like Lord 
Russell-Johnston, who is now the president of the Council of 
Europe, speak in the name of the liberal group and express his 
profound sadness and pessimism. This was on April 22, last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Barsony report is a good report— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report dealt with what was going on. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—but there should not be any preconditions to the negotiations 
between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Kosovo. As long 
as both parties do not move in this direction, the situation 
will not change and violence will continue. 
In Northern Ireland also, problems were complex and the 
situation was serious, but external mediation proved to be 
useful. Nothing should be excluded from the talks. The Council 
of Europe does not have to choose between Albanian Kosovars and 
Serbs. Its only wish is that all citizens live in peace and 
tolerance. 
A Liberal is not <I>a priori</I> in favour of an ethnic state, but when 
the will of a people is so clear— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was referring to the Kosovars. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—they are entitled to express it. This international principle is 
recognized in the Charter of the United Nations. Human rights 
affect everyone. Serbs should recognize the rights of those who 
have been living in Kosovo for centuries now. They do not have 
the right to impose anything on anyone. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Solé Tura, who spent many years in prison under Franco, 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening in Kosovo is definitely not a Yugoslav 
domestic problem. Nothing that affects human rights can be 
reduced to a mere domestic issue. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And I could go on and on. This was a year ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took part in the other debate held in September. A lot was 
learned from that debate. 
The Council of Europe was concerned about the hundreds of 
thousands of Kosovars who had already been displaced and were 
bracing themselves for a harsh winter in the woods without 
enough support. Everyone was calling for pressures to be exerted 
so that peace agreements could be reached. It did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there were the Rambouillet talks, where NATO threatened 
air strikes, which many were already calling and wishing for. 
Many argued that NATO had to get involved. What did Milosevic do 
regarding Rambouillet? From what we were told, he massed 40,000 
troops at the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now 26 days into the air campaign. Yesterday, we learned 
that 150,000 soldiers were fighting under Milosevic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO got involved without waiting for the support of the United 
Nations for humanitarian reasons. 
We do not know what will come of this situation, but one thing 
is sure, we are far from a resolution, far from peace.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, for the sake a consistency with our first campaign, which 
has been waged without a UN resolution—which is a first since the 
creation of the UN—and with our initial intent, which was to 
prevent the expulsion of the Kosovar people from its land, NATO 
should decide that ground troops are needed, hopefully with the 
involvement of the UN, we must hold a debate in the House, 
because this will not be a walk in the park. Other European 
countries have not yet decided to get involved. Only 19 
countries are NATO members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know who would be ready to get involved. We need to 
know all the facts and have all the information. 
We need to know what the particulars would be. And the UN should 
be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that some pressure is being put on Russia. We should 
keep the pressure on. We know that Russia is in a very 
precarious situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sending ground troops into Kosovo would not be business as 
usual. We certainly would not know ahead of time how long this 
operation would take. And there definitely would be some danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleagues opposite should be in complete agreement with us 
on our motion that there be a debate in the House. If there is 
one important issue in this parliament, in the previous one and 
even in others before that, it is bound to be this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have expressed my views with some feeling, but it is 
impossible to look at this issue objectively and not get 
emotionally involved. Soldiers are human beings, and when they 
go, there is no guarantee they will return. I am not saying we 
should not go, but the House should debate this issue as if it 
were the most important one to be put before us.

Why?  It is because the Ontario government has gutted its

stopped enforcing environmental laws, thus allowing Ontario to 
become North America's third worst polluter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has failed to put into place a fair and effective car

burning dirty coal to go up by 60%.  It has cut spending on

on the road and generating more pollution.

him move on the following year to the World Hockey Association.

are being lost and the costs related to waiting are increasing,

</I></B></P><P align=left>The need to increase the organ donation rate in Canada is an 
urgent priority.  It will not happen by focusing only on public

organ donors to increase the pool of potential donors and a clear 
simple mechanism for expressing wishes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to what I said in the House many times before.  First, 
the test uses a minute portion of the fuel to determine its

I would like to ask a question of the Minister of Foreign Affairs

for a diplomatic solution and for people getting back to the

</I></B></P><P align=left>In that respect, I am sure the minister is aware that President 
Clinton has reiterated that President Milosevic has to meet 
NATO's five points. Given the minister's support for the German

President Clinton with respect to the threshold for getting back 
to the table and say that NATO's five points are themselves 
negotiable, with the exception of course, of—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member would look at the declarations by 
the UN secretary general, by NATO ministers at the last meeting, 
by the president and by the German plan, they all contain the 
basic essentials.  There has to be a withdrawal of Serbian 
government troops.  There has to be a stop of the exploitation 
and violence against the refugees.  There has to be a peace 
agreement. There has to be real protection of the integrity and 
human rights within that area.  It is on that basis the 
negotiations are going ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention that as part of that process the Prime

the minister has talked about the essentials.  I want to ask the 
minister if one of the essentials continues to be the use of a 
NATO force post-settlement.  That was obviously one of the 
stumbling blocks at Rambouillet.  It is in the five point plan. 
Is the Canadian government prepared to say when it talks about 
essentials, that element of the five point plan is no longer part 
of the essentials.  That would considerably change the threshold 
for getting back to the table and we think increase the 
possibility of a diplomatic solution which I think—

could have a broad international force applying the verification 
and monitoring inside Kosovo.  That is the basis on which the 
discussions are now proceeding, to determine what would be the 
composition but most importantly to get Milosevic to agree to 
something so we can start serious negotiations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
following question will be answered today: question No 221. 
.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 221—<B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the total number of agriculture and agri-food businesses 
in Canada that have declared bankruptcy since the start of the 
1996-97 crop year as a direct or indirect result of the falling 
commodity prices during the farm income crisis, listing the names 
of those businesses? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food, 
Lib.):</B>  Bankruptcies are caused by a combination of factors that 
can include declining prices, production problems, marketing 
problems, and high debt 
levels.  Loss of off farm employment can also be a contributing 
factor for some farms.  Attibuting a bankruptcy to one factor 
would not be accurate.  Further, most agri-food businesses such 
as restaurants and grocery stores would not be dramatically 
affected by swings in the price of farm commodities and it would 
be inappropriate to include them with farm bankruptcies.  The 
total number of farm bankruptcies from the beginning of the 
1996-97 crop year to the end of 1998 was 596.  From January 1, 
1996 to the end of 1998, there were 762 farm bankruptcies.  This 
represents the lowest three year average of farm bankruptcies for 
the last two decades.  In the 1980s the three year average ranged from 
1,013 to 1,547 and has been declining since 1992 when it reached 
1,231. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada does not have a listing of the 
names of agri-food businesses and farms which have had to declare 
bankruptcy.  Additional information on bankruptcies may be 
available from the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy at 
phone number 613-941-1000.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—THE BALKANS 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK215">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the hon. member's speech.  I am a bit 
concerned about the phrasing of the motion, which is vague to say 
the least and creates a bit of a precedent.  It is an area of 
precedent that the hon. member needs to think about very 
carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We entered into World War II without the resolution of this 
parliament.  We also declared war against Imperial Japan without 
the resolution of this parliament and we entered into the Korean 
conflict without the resolution of this parliament.  The motion 
appears to imply that before we enter into war in this instance 
the government must get a resolution from this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that this motion is imprecise at best and is really on 
whether we should have a vote, and given that it talks about 
possibilities and a variety of things which could be interpreted 
in a variety of ways, I wonder whether the hon. member is 
concerned, given the precedential nature of this matter and the 
foundational aspect that it has to our democracy, namely the 
right of parliament to direct government.  Is she at all 
concerned that this motion is not nearly as precise as many 
members would like it to be before voting on such a foundational 
issue of our democratic process? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the 
hon. member. I am sure that, in giving the example of the 
resolution by which our country got involved in the second world 
war, he was not suggesting that it would have been better for 
Canada to agree to go to war without having a resolution from 
parliament. I will not remind the House of the painful memories 
Quebecers have of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why the government is saying our motion is 
vague. What we see right now in the news is the possibility of 
sending ground troops. If this is not necessary, that is good. 
But a solution is not in sight right now, despite the weaker and 
weaker reminders that air strikes would be sufficient. 
We do not see how NATO could succeed, how the countries that 
decided to take on this humanitarian cause could succeed without 
sending ground troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat what I said before. If troops were sent, it would 
not be for a parade. This parliament has to vote on it, has to 
decide, with all the information available, if it should 
maintain troops within a framework that would be uncertain and 
that could also deteriorate. This is true not only for members 
on this side, but also for members on the other side, because we 
will live with this decision for a long time. A vote must 
absolutely be taken in this House.

have an excerpt from a letter sent to me by a constituent.  There

this House.  It states:

the roar of wind drawn into<BR> 
vast fields of immaculate flames<BR> 
that once were schools, homes, families.

expressed in a different way the answer I have just given the 
member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international situation is serious. It would have been 
preferable to have this vote before the air strikes began but, 
in the name of democracy, we must have it now, before getting 
ourselves into something that we do not know how and when it is 
going to end. No other decision will be more important, for all 
kinds of reasons. The situation will never be the same again. It 
is the first time NATO does such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Important changes will have to be made to international 
institutions. 
We do not have time to debate this issue any further right now, 
but this dirty war—because if there is war it will indeed be 
dirty—requires a vote before any final decision is made.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While in Brussels I met with NATO Secretary General Solana, the 
Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Clark, and the 
Chairman of the NATO Committee, General Naumann.  I also had the 
opportunity to consult with my Belgian counterpart, Mr. 
Poncelot, and in London I met with my British counterpart, Mr. 
Robertson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On each occasion we discussed the full range of issues 
pertaining to NATO operations, both the air campaign and efforts 
to address the dire humanitarian situation that continues to 
unfold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the House that NATO's resolve remains 
unshakeable.  NATO's steadily intensifying military operations 
are destroying, step by step, Yugoslavia's military capabilities. 
The air campaign supports the overall political aims of NATO 
countries; objectives which are widely supported by the 
international community, by this parliament and by the citizens 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the weekend I also had the opportunity to visit our men and 
women stationed in Aviano, Italy.  I am pleased to report that 
their morale is high.  They understand the importance of the 
mission they have been given and they are proud that Canada has 
acted.  They are a long way from home and they appreciate the 
support they have from the government, from parliament and from 
their fellow Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The air campaign is now in its 27th day.  Progress has been 
steady and as each day passes the cost Mr. Milosevic is paying 
for his policy of humanitarian degradation rises.  His military 
forces are being hit around the clock and their losses are 
mounting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As each day passes the infrastructure that supports his forces 
of oppression is diminished.  There is less fuel, fewer bridges 
and more broken lines of communication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO is again intensifying its air operations by adding more 
aircraft.  As I announced on Saturday, Canada will make available 
six more CF-18s, bringing the total in Aviano to 18. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new contribution shows our government's firm commitment to 
this operation. We will continue to exercise the necessary 
leadership to ensure its success.

of them.  Another is the will to make choices based on the

to increase consultation with parliament. 
We were determined to offer Canadians strong leadership, informed 
by the views of their elected representatives in parliament.  We 
have done just that.  Since being elected, time and time again we 
have consulted the House on major decisions concerning the 
Canadian forces and national defence.

that kind of peacekeeping force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate I announced that Canada would be prepared to 
contribute 500 to 800 personnel.  Although we are currently 
engaged in an air campaign, our objective is to bring about 
conditions whereby the Yugoslav government will allow for the 
deployment of an international military force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then the 500 to 800 strong force, including an armoured 
reconnaissance squadron and a helicopter unit, has completed its 
training and is now preparing for possible deployment.  Debating 
this again would be a step backward.  In a crisis like this, when 
grave human issues lie in the balance, moving forward is the kind 
of leadership which Canadians expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's record of consulting parliament speaks for 
itself.  We are determined to exercise the kind of decisive 
leadership in crisis that Canadians expect.  Canadians would not 
accept any measure that undermines the authority of the 
government they elected to take quick action to protect Canada's 
humanitarian and national interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion, aside from ignoring the actions that have been 
taken and the many debates, appears to suggest that without the 
very precise vote which it suggests the voice of parliament will 
not be heard.  Kosovo illustrates the falsehood of that argument 
perfectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the three debates on Kosovo, 131 members of this House have 
spoken.  Many voices have been heard and the consensus has been 
striking.  Clearly, parliamentarians have expressed their views 
and given legitimacy to Canada's actions.  Parliamentary debate 
is an important tool, but it should be used to facilitate action, 
not to undermine it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the hon. minister.  The minister 
indicated that the House has debated the question of Kosovo seven 
times.  The question that we are asking today is very simple. 
The Canadian people elected members of parliament to this place. 
Why are the Liberals afraid to put the question when we commit 
ground troops to a fighting force?  Why are the Liberals scared 
to put the same question to the House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that good government should lead.  I would 
remind the minister that the Liberals were elected with 
approximately 38%.  Therefore, my question to the minister is: 
Why not let the Canadian parliament vote on the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, whatever percentage 
we received was a lot more than members on the other side 
received.  We have a majority government in this House and that 
is the will of the Canadian people.  Canadians elected a 
government to make decisions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This parliament has every opportunity to express no confidence 
in the government if it does not think it is making the right 
decision.  Members opposite have not moved a motion of no 
confidence.  No, because they know Canadians believe in what we 
are doing.  Canadians believe we should be doing all that we can 
to save those people who have been pushed out of Kosovo, those 
people who have been subject to ethnic cleansing.  People believe 
that is the right and humanitarian thing to do, so we are doing 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not hear people disagreeing with what we are doing.  In all 
these debates, seven on Yugoslavia and three of them specifically 
on Kosovo, I have heard general agreement from all sides of the 
House.  What is the problem?  If hon. members do not think we are 
doing the right thing, if they do not think we are making the 
right decision, move a motion of non-confidence. But I do not 
think that they will.  I do not believe they will because they 
know that we are reacting to what Canadians feel is the right and 
just thing to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
ask the minister two questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, he is right when he says that members have had 
ample opportunity to express their views in the House and that 
over 130 members have already done so. However, when we have a 
vote, it is not 137 members out of 301 who express their views. 
When we have a vote, it is 301 members out of 301 who take part 
in that vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every soldier in Kosovo can say that his or her member in the 
House of Commons has supported our involvement or not. Every 
soldier supports his or her MP and is ready to do the job he or 
she is asked to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My other question is this: can the minister tell us whether or 
not troops are engaged in a ground operation in Kosovo at the 
moment? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, parliament should 
have every opportunity, has had every opportunity, and will 
continue to have every opportunity to express its views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I visited with our troops in Aviano, I told them that the 
government of this country, the parliament of this country and 
the people of Canada were behind them.  They believe that and 
they believe they are doing what needs to be done in the name of 
all three of those entities.  I believe that to be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are taking this decision in a responsible fashion.  The 
government has to be able to do these kinds of things, to take 
quick action when these dangerous situations arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no ground troops being deployed to the region.  We 
have said before that the only troops we are preparing for 
deployment to the area in terms of ground operations would be 
peacekeepers.  That still stands. We have said that if that 
changes in any way, then we would come back to this House again 
for further debate and discussion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today is a very important day in the life of Jewish people. Today 
is Yom Ha Zicharon, the day of remembrance.  It starts tonight 
and continues tomorrow. It is a day to remember what took place 
in Europe from 1933 on and in particular Yom Ha Shoah, the 
Holocaust that took place. Last week was Yom Ha Shoah at which 
time the survivors told their stories.  This week is Yom Ha 
Zicharon which is a remembrance of our soldiers who perished 
during that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have watched this whole question of ethnic cleansing, 
genocide and crimes against humanity, I can only say that we all 
watched with wrenched hearts and with an unfortunate reminder 
that this world has not learned. Following the end of the second 
world war in 1945 we said that never again would anything like 
this happen and passed a law on genocide. It is very unfortunate 
that the never again has not been realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard criticism here of the United Nations.  I would 
suggest that there is something wrong in the security council and 
with the way the veto vote works, but there is not something 
wrong with the UN itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know there have been approaches time after time in the 
security council for action to be taken and for the United 
Nations to become involved. 
It was turned down each time.  Our Minister of Foreign Affairs 
has raised the issue on at least three occasions.  There was a 
prior vote that indicated that the world approved of what we were 
doing but there were internal interests that prevented a move 
forward.  The Russian vote or potential veto was a very important 
factor.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just returned from a week in Brussels.  We devoted our 
time to issues about nuclear weapons and about the problems that 
confront the major cities.  The major concern and attention was 
on Kosovo.  Over 130 nations expressed their concerns.  Yes, 
there were a few that supported the Yugoslav position, Mr. 
Milosevic's position.  For the most part there was unanimous 
agreement that this war must stop.  Not once was there a call for 
ground troops at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is such an evolving situation and it is a very difficult 
one. I heard the remarks made by Mr. Stroyev, the leader of the 
Russian delegation who suggested a joint commission for refugees 
and a special role for the parliaments of the NATO countries.  He 
also said that the Yugoslav people should not be punished for the 
actions of President Milosevic.  But if Mr. Milosevic is not 
stopped, the people of the region will continue to be punished by 
him.  We cannot stand by and let this happen. The NATO action is 
not designed to punish Milosevic according to the Russian 
speaker, it is designed to put a stop to his abhorrent policy of 
ethnic cleansing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure we all recognize the major role Russia has to play in 
reaching a settlement to the crisis.  We hope it will play a 
major peacekeeping role in the area when the fighting is over. 
We share a common interest with Russia in reaching a political 
solution to the crisis, and the sooner the better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listened to the discussions, there were many expressions 
of serious concern.  Why are hundreds of thousands of people, old 
men, women and helpless children fleeing in terror from Kosovo? 
Are they fleeing from the NATO bombs?  I would say no.  They are 
fleeing from President Milosevic and his ethnic cleansing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young male Kosovar Albanians are being forcibly separated from 
their families.  This is a cause of great concern.  Where are 
they?  What will happen to them?  What are they doing?  Some of 
us have just seen that they are digging graves.  That is quite 
disturbing. We know what happened when similar events occurred in 
Srebrenica.  All the men were massacred.  This question demands 
an immediate answer from the Yugoslav authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some parliamentarians say that a terrible human tragedy has been 
inflicted upon the people of Kosovo and Yugoslavia due to the 
brutality of their leader Milosevic.  This was a situation that 
could not be tolerated and indeed demands were made for a 
resolution to the plight of the Kosovar people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we all know as the debates in the House have 
demonstrated, that the Canadian people, Canadian parliamentarians 
and the Canadian government, as well as all NATO partners, would 
have preferred that the conflict be resolved through dialogue and 
negotiations.  But President Milosevic has frustrated every 
attempt to find a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no quick fixes in Yugoslavia and in Kosovo.  We know 
that.  NATO's air campaign will continue until Milosevic agrees 
to an international military presence in Kosovo that can ensure 
the safe return of the refugees created by his program of ethnic 
cleansing.  He has systematically violated international 
humanitarian law by launching a campaign against civilians which 
includes killing and torturing, arbitrary detention and the 
denial of basic rights based on ethnicity.  That is what happened 
in 1933.  The world did not react then.  We have evolved.  We are 
in a position to see change.  For that we should all be grateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Milosevic is also contravening two security council resolutions, 
resolutions 1199 and 1203 which impose a clear obligation on the 
Yugoslavian federation to respect a ceasefire and protect the 
civilian population.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has lobbied intensively over the past year for greater 
United Nations Security Council engagement in Kosovo.  Clearly it 
would have been best if the UN could have facilitated an end to 
the conflict in Kosovo.  However, the Russians have made it clear 
that they would have blocked any UN Security Council's condemning 
of that ethnic cleansing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so NATO moved ahead, and thank God it did for the ethnic 
Kosovars in Yugoslavia.  NATO was able to save at least most of 
that population.  The refugee situation is very disturbing.  That 
is true. That country was challenged by a misguided leader.  We 
know this is not his first attack on the people there.  Bosnia, 
Croatia, Slovenia; a lot of history has gone on in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would sincerely hope when this government comes to a 
conclusion that it has no choice but to consider those ground 
troops and it asks for our opinion on that matter, we will all be 
of one voice and support that move in the interest of the ethnic 
Albanians.  With respect to the plight of the Kosovar Albanians, 
please note that the overall Canadian policy and goal is a 
negotiated settlement based on the Rambouillet agreement and that 
our overriding concern is humanitarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interests of international humanitarian law, the right 
and the obligation to go into a country not because it has its 
own sovereignty but because its population is at risk is an issue 
we must support.  This world over the last generation has been 
one of serious problems whether we are looking at Africa, Asia, 
Latin America or right now as we see in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO's role was a vital one.  I am most pleased we have 
supported it to date.  I sincerely hope the wish of Kofi Annan, 
the wish of this parliament, the wish of our minister and the 
wish of our Prime Minister is realized through negotiation, and 
that if we do send ground troops that they will be peacemakers 
and peacekeepers. I hope we do not have the kind of intervention 
that is so dramatic, so dangerous and so costly both to our own 
people and to the people who are suffering right now as ethnic 
Albanians in Kosovo, in Albania, in all the countries in that 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this parliament and its members will understand why we 
are not taking a vote right now.  The situation changes daily. 
The promise of the Prime Minister is one I know he will respect 
and keep.  Let us hope for a peaceful solution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the hon. member's speech.  It was very well put.  I 
certainly agree with the contents of what she said.  A drastic 
thing is going on.  Let us all hope it comes to an end soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned when it comes to the debates that take place in 
the House.  I have expressed this before and I will express it 
again. Does the hon. member agree with me that debates should be 
open and transparent and that they should be used to help make 
decisions regarding issues?  If she does agree, could she explain 
why in the last parliament when we were debating whether or not 
to send troops to Bosnia we learned that the troops were already 
on their way, that the decision had already been made?  Does she 
agree that sometimes these decisions are made without the debate? 
Does she agree with doing that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very 
interesting question and it presents a dilemma.  I do believe in 
transparent and open democracy and I do believe for the most part 
that has been the history of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exception is in circumstances of the nature the member was 
talking about, when it involves serious ground troops and the 
lives of our men in the air, on the land and on the sea. That is 
a very heavy responsibility cabinet must look at, evaluate and 
weigh.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the most part the changes we have made recently to have open 
debates have been a demonstration of a great step forward. 
Perhaps it is not to the degree some would have liked, but every 
statement that has been made in the House has been looked at by 
cabinet and has been evaluated by the Foreign Affairs Department. 
Good overviews of the views of the House are presented for their 
consideration.  That is a big improvement over what we had in the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in the House when we had a different story during 
the course of very serious interventions and fear on the part of 
the people who were at risk, and we did not say anything.  It is 
time now to never again be silent and to know what is going on. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to what the hon. member 
had to say. I want to tell her that, in this area, it is 
important that we have all the information available before 
making decisions and that we use every means to restore peace as 
soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her speech, the hon. member said something like “We need to 
be able to influence what is going on”. Would a vote in 
parliament not be a way to support the position taken by the 
government, to show that this is no longer just a partisan 
position, not only the position of one party, but of the entire 
House of Commons, where hon. members have the opportunity to 
vote, while keeping in mind their responsibilities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not help to ensure that the peace plan put forward by 
Germany, but that could become everyone's peace plan, is 
approved as quickly as possible? People from our ridings could 
be involved in this war. Would it not be helpful for them to 
know how their members of parliament voted on this issue? On 
such an important and serious matter, would the influence of 
parliament not help to restore peace in Europe? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague for his question. If there is one thing that has 
changed a lot in the last hundreds of years, it is that we now 
have television. We can watch hour after hour, day after day, 
what is going on in Kosovo and, more importantly, in all of 
Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in Brussels, at the meeting of the 
Inter-Parliamentary Union, I asked why the Yugoslavs blocked 
access to television so that the Serbs were unable to know what 
was going on. It is sad. When people do not know the truth, it 
is difficult to know what to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I believe we know what we are doing. Members from 
this side of the House are just as interested as the member and 
all other parliamentarians. I am convinced that we will make an 
open and transparent decision in due course. I hope the hon. 
member will be satisfied, because the conditions we are setting 
are very clear and obvious. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to again rise to speak on this, our opposition day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The war in Kosovo is now in its 26th day.  Who would have 
believed that the conflict would have gone on this long?  With 
NATO and all the new military technologies involved, we might 
have expected it to be over in a few days at most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we underestimated Milosevic and the Serbian 
government.  In particular, we had not predicted how fast and 
efficient that government would be in its ethnic cleansing 
operations against the population of Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always regretted this war, and all war 
moreover, yet intervention in Kosovo was necessary, 
unfortunately. 
Necessary because Milosevic and the Serb army are engaged in 
literally depopulating Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest figures on the massive exodus of the Kosovar 
population are terrifying.  The UNHCR is now talking of some 
400,000 Kosovar refugees in Albania, 150,000 in Macedonia, 
75,000 in Montenegro, and 32,000 in Bosnia. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not taking into account the 260,000 Kosovars refugees 
within Kosovo itself, nor those who have taken refuge in the 
mountains.  To date, NATO estimates that this war has claimed 
3,200 lives.  NATO also believes it has found 43 mass graves. 
This is not even taking into account the rapes, the physical 
atrocities and the psychological sufferings of an entire people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of these reasons, all available resources must be 
deployed in order to relieve the sufferings and improve the 
living conditions of the Kosovar refugees in Bosnia, in 
Macedonia, in Albania and in Montenegro. 
It is therefore important to provide the High Commissioner for 
Refugees with all the humanitarian aid and logistical support 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end, we are still awaiting a clear response from the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to the question I asked 
here in the House last week.  Members will remember I asked her 
if the government was prepared to commit to using the $100 
million set aside to take in the refugees here in order to 
provide additional support to the NGOs on location in the 
Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responded at the time with banalities 
such as “the situation is stabilizing at the borders there”. 
However, according to the HCR, Macedonia alone expects an 
additional 100,000 refugees in the next few days.  No need to 
point out that the needs are urgent in the various refugee 
camps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister be announcing that this $100 million will 
go to refugees in the Balkans?  It is a matter of life and 
death, and the money is available here and now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that the minister and the government will show 
compassion as soon as possible, before it is too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that we are now facing new realities and that 
the NATO forces should reassess their strategies in this war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where the problem lies.  The Government of Canada's 
haughty attitude toward the members of this parliament, drawn, 
it must be said, from the Liberal leader's arrogant treatment of 
the opposition members, prevents us from having a clear picture 
of the situation in the Balkans. 
This deplorable attitude is reflected in this government's lack 
of transparency in releasing information on this war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of this House democratically elected by the people 
of the riding of Laurentides, I am very frustrated by the Prime 
Minister's refusal to allow a debate followed by a vote on the 
possibility of sending Canadian troops in the Balkan region or 
on any other initiative, whether military or diplomatic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, according to an Angus Reid poll, 59% of Canadians would be 
willing to support the deployment of ground troops, and 61% 
would agree to the involvement of Canadian soldiers in this 
ground operation, if it became necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government still stubbornly refusing to allow a vote 
on this issue here in the House? Considering the Angus Reid poll 
results, it would be in the best interests of the government to 
vote on this issue. The government would then come out stronger 
in its support, as would the Canadian democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember the Gulf war in 1991. At that time, Liberals 
were in the opposition. Despite the three votes taken in the 
House of Commons about that war, the hon. member for Shawinigan 
had openly criticized the government for its lack of willingness 
to fulfil its duty of having a consultation and a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eight years later, the Liberal government is trampling not only 
on Canadian democracy, but also on its own ideas. 
Even Yves Fortier, the former Canadian ambassador to the UN, 
publicly blamed the Prime Minister for his lack of transparency 
regarding Canadian positions and actions in the Kosovo crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of the war in the Balkans, the government 
has been providing information on the conflict in dribbles. It 
is time the government stopped acting that way. Quebeckers and 
Canadians as well as members of parliament have a right to know 
the different military or diplomatic options to which the 
Canadian government and NATO are giving priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this day, the Bloc Quebecois and other opposition parties 
have all supported the decisions of the government, but this 
does not mean that the Bloc Quebecois is ready to sign a blank 
cheque. 
We demand a substantial debate followed by a vote, to allow 
members of parliament to take a just and informed decision on 
the opportunity to send ground troops to Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why such lack of transparency compared to other governments? 
Germany has voted twice on the advisability of air strikes in 
Kosovo.

allow NATO aircraft to fly over its territory. The Czech 
Republic voted on the same issue. What is the Canadian 
government waiting for to show the same openness? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of democracy created by the silence of the Liberal 
government could have a negative impact on the consensus we now 
have in this House. 
Indeed, how are we expected to be able to assess NATO's 
diplomatic or military initiatives if the government does not 
think of providing us with adequate information, which would 
encourage this House to debate and vote on these initiatives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually, the Bloc Quebecois might be forced to raise serious 
concerns on the advisability of those initiatives, which could 
bring the present consensus to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, during the gulf war, members of the House received 
excellent information on the state of the conflict and 
governmental initiatives but this time we are better informed on 
the crisis in Kosovo by the medias. This is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I remind all members of the House that the Bloc 
Quebecois is deeply disturbed by the atrocities and ethnic 
cleansing activities directed against Kosovars.  To put a stop 
to such atrocities, all diplomatic and military alternatives, 
including sending ground troops to Kosovo, must be debated in 
this House and approved through a vote. What is at stake is the 
health of our democratic system, the legitimacy of this 
government, and perhaps even the survival of a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude with a short poem written by a pupil at 
the École des Ursulines de Québec.  Her name is Sarah-Émilie 
Mercier.  Her poem is about peace, and I will read it now: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does peace elude mankind?<BR> 
Why not put our hate behind?<BR> 
With fighting and poverty all round the earth<BR> 
Peace has retreated for all it is worth<BR> 
And though I seek it near and far<BR> 
It has become like a distant star<BR> 
What is so hard to comprehend?<BR> 
Love one another, and wars will all end.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that was a very nice poem and I commend the Bloc member for 
reading it to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member feel is the reason that the government 
is not willing to put this debate to a vote for the members of 
parliament?  Is it afraid at this point that we will be 
questioning its commitment, or does the member think the 
government will bring the debate forward after it is committed, 
should it ever come to that situation?  Hopefully it will not? 
What would be her opinion? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that in any parliament democracy must rule. What is 
happening in this parliament is worrisome for the future and the 
decisions that will have to be made, especially when we are 
asked to send in soldiers to defend the interests of people who 
are at war and in a desperate situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated in my speech, even opinion polls are in favour of 
sending troops. Therefore, I do not see why the government would 
not consult members from all parties. The House could reach a 
consensus, which would provide stronger moral support to our 
troops who would be deployed over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is disappointing because we are here to represent the 
people. 
I represent every single constituent in the riding of 
Laurentides, and these people might have liked to see me take a 
stand here in this House on sending troops to Kosovo.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope, because I doubt the government's decision is

letting us debate the issue in the House so that all parties can 
eventually vote on this decision. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
after question period, many questions were raised on the 
opposition side, mainly by the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Progressive Conservative Party. We are concerned, and rightly 
so, that the national defence minister may have already 
committed ground troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member for Laurentides is this: could 
the government act in secret and deploy troops in Kosovo without 
consulting parliament and without a vote in the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, the government 
could certainly send troops without consulting the House. 
However, I think it would be ill-advised. The government would 
have a heavy price to pay for making decisions without 
consulting the members of this House. It would be undemocratic 
to send in troops without informing us. This kind of decision 
should be discussed and made in the House. Members have views 
they want to express. There are members from all over Canada who 
also have an opinion on the matter and who are certainly getting 
phone calls at their riding or Ottawa offices from people who 
take a stand and want to know what their member really thinks of 
this war, but who may not have all the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a role to play, and we should be allowed to play it in 
the House. Otherwise, what is the use of electing members of 
parliament? To act like a bunch of yes-men and women just 
supporting the government? That is not what we are here for. We 
are here to represent our constituents and vote on important 
issues like sending in troops to participate in the ongoing war 
in Kosovo. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
early last Tuesday morning, I had the opportunity and the 
privilege to speak in this House to explain why I am personally 
in favour of the current military intervention in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we have to debate this issue again today? I would say or 
I would be tempted to say that it is because of the government's 
bad faith. But I will not talk about bad faith, but rather about 
clumsiness. I do not want to presume right from the start that 
the government is acting in bad faith, so I will say that it is 
being clumsy. 
Why is it being clumsy? Because, despite the consensus that was 
expressed spontaneously regarding the intervention in the former 
Yugoslavia, despite the fact that all parties in the House have 
spontaneously supported the government in its intervention, the 
government is acting in a mean-spirited way toward the opposition 
parties by giving them very little information, voluntarily 
creating confusion and giving an impression of improvisation. I 
think shows the government as well as Canada's and NATO's 
intervention in the field in a bad light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only hope that there is no such improvisation in reality. 
I would even go as far as saying that I am convinced there is no 
such improvisation, which leads me to think that the government 
is indeed hiding information from the House. 
We only get spurious answers to our numerous questions. We are 
being told that the question is hypothetical, that NATO 
officials have made no such request, that the question is 
premature. In fact, we have been given that type of answer at 
virtually every stage of the conflict since the beginning. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence minister insidiously stated that we had to consider 
sending ground troops, then backed down a few hours later, 
saying: “We have yet to reach that stage”. When we enquired 
about the opportunity of sending peacekeepers in Kosovo we were 
told that “the situation is hypothetical, we have not received 
any request so far, we have yet to reach that stage”.  However 
we learned a few days later that the government was preparing to 
send 600 troops for a peacekeeping mission in Macedonia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing happened when we heard that additional CF-18s 
could be sent because the U.S. president wanted to double NATO's 
air capability. 
We asked: “How many additional aircraft will be sent to satisfy 
this request?” The government replied: “We have not received any 
request so far, we have yet to reach that stage, this is a 
hypothetical question, it is premature”. At last, we learned 
that 6 additional CF-18s have been sent or are about to be sent 
to the theatre of operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we learn that Canadian troops are probably already in 
Kosovo. Again, we ask the same question and we are told once 
more that it is a hypothetical question and that we are not at 
that stage yet. We got the same old answers we have been getting 
for some time now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that in a conflict situation, strategic constraints 
prevent us from disclosing the details of operations and 
preparations. This would certainly be against the national 
interest and that of the allied forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that case, why not be a little more open and frank and say 
“As things now stand, we cannot, for strategic reasons, give the 
House a clear answer to this question”. This would be better 
than misleading the House and its members by stating “It is a 
hypothetical question. We have not received any request to that 
effect. We are not there yet. It is premature”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somebody famous once said that war was too important an issue to 
leave it to politicians. 
I believe this saying applies to the government and the military 
staff that stands behind it in this conflict. Indeed, it seems 
universally recognized that members of parliament are not 
knowledgeable, credible or serious enough to be able to deal 
with matters as important as wars and conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By its mean attitude, the government is jeopardizing the strong 
consensus that had spontaneously formed around him on the issue 
of the military intervention in the former Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is taking this consensus for granted, as the 
Prime Minister made very clear today. He allows himself to treat 
the opposition in a very condescending way by saying “Anyway, 
they all agree”. We are not throwing back into question our 
position on the intervention in the former Yugoslavia. 
Unfortunately, some kind of mistrust of the government is 
emerging and that is unhealthy during a conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the government's attitude could give the 
impression that it is improvising to some extent. This 
improvisation takes many shapes, including that of appearing to 
let others take the lead. We could have expected that Canada, 
with its long peacekeeping and peace-seeking tradition and its 
seat at the UN Security Council, would have shown leadership in 
trying to reach a negotiated solution to the conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, Canada kept silent. It embarked in military operations 
without necessarily looking for a political solution or giving 
the impression it was looking for one. Our German friends have 
come up with a very detailed peace plan, which, of course, we 
support, but Canada seems to be dragging its feet.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also said that, as far as military operations are 
concerned, Canada was trailing behind NATO and the USA. On that 
point, allow me to put into perspective this so-called 
submissiveness to American interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that, in 1991, during the Gulf war, many of those 
opposed to the conflict told us that it was somewhat shocking to 
see the USA, and the international community behind it, launch 
military operations in Kuwait while doing nothing about the 
conflict that was breaking out in Bosnia at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These bleeding hearts were saying “Of course, there are economic 
interests at stake in Kuwait; there are oil fields. 
If there had been oil in Bosnia, they would have intervened”. 
Now, these same people often wonder why Canada is following the 
United States. The same people who criticized the United States, 
NATO and the international community for not intervening in 
Bosnia are now condemning this intervention in Kosovo. I think 
the situation must be put in perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Bloc Quebecois colleagues and myself have explained at length 
why it had become absolutely necessary to intervene. At the end 
of World War II, we believed that mankind had changed, that it 
had learned from its mistakes. Unfortunately, the tragic events 
in Rwanda showed us that this was not the case, that we had not 
learned from our mistakes, that we had not changed as much as we 
thought we had. 
At that point we told ourselves that we would never again let 
the situation deteriorate to the point of witnessing such mass 
killings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we intervened in Kosovo. The former Yugoslavia 
refused the German peace plan, and the United Kingdom's defence 
minister, the NATO secretary general and the U.S. secretary of 
state are suggesting that Milosevic must be removed from office 
in Belgrade. This leads us to think that the conflict will be a 
long one and that it will probably require the sending of ground 
troops. Should this be the case, it would be totally 
unacceptable for the government to decide to send Canadian 
troops to the theatre of operations without first consulting 
this House. We are talking about the lives of our fellow 
citizens, and we are accountable to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I heard the minister say “We have the support of 
Canadians”. This government seems to be governing by polls. It 
should remember that its legitimacy lies only in the general 
election that led to this parliament and that, consequently, it 
must consult the House before sending ground troops. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to call on the hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes, 
who has been sitting in this House for six years and who has a 
masters degree in political science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to tell us why parliament should really have to 
deal with an issue such as this one? Why is it not enough to let 
the government decide, on such an issue? Why is it critical to 
call on parliament, as other parliaments have done—and my 
colleague could provide examples of other parliaments that 
debated the issue and voted on it—to have a decisive say on this 
issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a bit embarrassed at 
having to answer such a relevant question by my hon. colleague 
from Beauharnois—Salaberry, an eminent law professor.  Such a 
question risks leaving me stunned and incapable of responding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, despite all, I will try to respond and trust my answer 
will find favour in the eyes of my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that, 
under Canada's Constitution and its National Defence Act, the 
government is not obliged in theory to seek the approval of the 
House before acting in such matters.  However, it goes, I would 
say, a little beyond the legal principle.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are moral principles.  There is the government's right to 
send soldiers to take part in an armed conflict that puts their 
lives at risk, without first taking a vote in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, my colleague from Joliette said appropriately that we 
did indeed have debates in this House.  It is true that many 
parliamentarians have had the opportunity to speak on this 
important question, but what Canadians and Quebeckers want to 
know is whether their particular MP is in favour of sending 
ground troops and this they can know only if the government 
takes the trouble to consult this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Beauharnois—Salaberry pointed out rightly 
that, among the NATO member states, a number of governments have 
had the decency, drawing on this principle of legitimacy and on 
these moral principles, to consult their parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in fact there is a debate in the British House of Commons, 
and there have been two votes in the German parliament on the 
issue of intervening in the former Yugoslavia.  The two houses 
of the Czech Republic are preparing to vote today on such 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the members of the government, that at the time 
of the gulf war in 1991, the official opposition at the time 
called for a vote in the House on an armed intervention.  I call 
on the government majority to recall the remarks it addressed to 
the government in 1991 in calling for consultation of this 
parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time 
with my colleague from Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel it is essential for me to address the House and comment 
on the critical issue we are grappling with today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain members of this House seem to feel it would be 
appropriate for the government to allow not only a debate but 
also a vote on the decision to deploy Canadian ground troops to 
the Balkans who might become engaged in military operations 
and/or peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and the Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to say that I am opposed to this 
motion, just as I was when we debated a similar motion on three 
occasions during the past year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remain convinced that by adopting such a motion we would 
paralyze the government for no good reason in the midst of 
situations which often require a rapid and effective response. 
We also believe that in adopting this position we are respecting 
the wishes of the Canadian people.  Finally, we persist in our 
belief that parliament is capable of making an important 
contribution under such circumstances through the process of 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that the government is taking into account the 
vital role played by parliament in this crisis.  We obviously 
feel that obtaining the support of all members of this House is 
essential.  Government decisions can only gain further 
legitimacy in the eyes of the international community when they 
receive the unanimous support of parliament.  And it is in this 
spirit that we have decided to hold three debates on this issue 
thus far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1998, the House held a special debate on the 
humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and the special measures the 
government planned to implement in concert with the 
international community in order to resolve the conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1999, when we were hoping to see a peaceful end to 
this crisis, we held another debate, this time focusing on the 
possible deployment of Canadian troops to Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And last Monday, April 12, we again debated the issue, allowing 
every MP who wished to comment on this serious humanitarian 
crisis to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would respectfully point out that on every one of these 
occasions we fortunately saw our policy receive unanimous 
support from members of every party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister himself has pointed out several times, it 
is critical that we speak with one voice and that Mr. Milosevic 
be in no doubt as to the position of the Canadian government. 
Peace, respect for human rights and democracy constitute values 
that are unanimously respected and supported by the Canadian 
people and their parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current situation is so serious and so important that we 
must not allow him any openings whatsoever.  Mr. Milosevic must 
understand that our position is unwavering.  This is no time for 
playing political games.  To act otherwise would only display a 
lack of respect for Canada's democratic institution par 
excellence, the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government remains committed to consulting parliament. 
It has undertaken to ensure greater parliamentary involvement in 
reviewing major issues relating to foreign and defence policy, 
and it has held a significant number of parliamentary debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994, the government has consulted parliament regarding 
many of the internatinal missions carried out by the Canadian 
forces.  For example, we held two debates, in April 1998 and 
February 1999, regarding the deployment of a peacekeeping force 
to the Central African Republic.  We held a debate on potential 
military action against Iraq in February 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1996, we debated Canada's role in alleviating the 
suffering in the African Great Lakes region.  We also held more 
than one debate on Canada's role in implementing the measures 
taken by the international community to maintain stability and 
security in Haiti, in 1995 and 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to our involvement in Yugoslavia, we have held 
seven parliamentary debates so far.  I will not list the 
innumerable sessions of the House of Commons defence and foreign 
Affairs committees at which Canadian participation on a wide 
variety of peacekeeping forces was discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, a series of joint committees were specially organized 
to take an in-depth look at Canada's foreign and defence policy. 
These committees held unprecedented and comprehensive public 
hearings.  Their work has led to the adoption of a new defence 
policy and the review of Canada's foreign policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has also played a major role in many other aspects of 
foreign and defence policy. 
For example, the expansion of NATO, the renewal of the NORAD 
Agreement that provides for the security and defence of North 
America, and Canadian policy on the non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons, arms control and disarmament have all been the subjects 
of consultation with parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, the Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs, 
which I had the honour of chairing, carried out an unprecedented 
study on the social and economic challenges confronted by 
Canadian Forces members.  This study contributed significantly 
to the development of a government quality-of-life program 
designed to meet the challenges posed by military life. 
Furthermore, this committee is currently examining the federal 
government's procurement policy and holding hearings with the 
defence industry across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these measure testify to the government's willingness to 
consult parliament in shaping Canada's foreign and defence 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like as well to reaffirm the position taken by the 
Minister of National Defence: the government is fully committed 
to consulting with parliament and, as I have shown, has proved 
repeatedly that it has kept its promises in this regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Canadian government, which is duly elected by the 
Canadian people, must not relinquish its ability to govern 
responsibly and to make hard decisions where necessary.  To do 
otherwise would be irresponsible and would be viewed as such by 
the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any additional steps in the deployment process would undermine 
Canada's ability to respond rapidly and effectively to 
international crises.  Requiring a vote on the deployment of 
Canadian forces abroad could even impose pointless delays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I must underscore the fact that the situation is so 
serious and the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo 
so great that it cannot be used as a pretext to serve political 
agendas.  Even if we were to agree to consult the Canadian 
people and the members of this House, we would still be as 
determined as ever to do whatever possible to maintain, and in 
some cases to re-establish, peace and freedom.  We have listened 
to Canadians and we have consulted parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government and the Canadian people are proud of the role 
played by Canada both as a world leader in peacekeeping and as a 
faithful partner in times of crisis. 
We will continue to consult parliament, both through debates in 
the House and through the testimony of ministers and other 
spokespersons before standing committees.  Anyone who wants 
government to remain sensitive to the opinions of the elected 
representatives of Canadians will understand that this must be 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But those same Canadians will understand how misguided it would 
be to adopt a motion that might compromise Canada's ability to 
respond when events call for immediate intervention.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
find the words of the parliamentary secretary interesting when it 
comes to pointing a finger at the opposition.  When I say the 
opposition, from one party to the other, they are actually 
supporting the government on this issue.  They are actually 
supporting the government on this Kosovo crisis and our 
involvement with NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accusation coming from the parliamentary secretary is 
accusing the opposition of political jockeying.  Because the 
opposition has basically unanimously sought to have a vote on a 
very important issue it is being accused of political 
manoeuvring or political jockeying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is incumbent upon this House to show unanimously 
that Canadian troops have our total support, that we stand behind 
them morally and that they know this from their elected 
representatives right across the country.  What is happening now 
is that the Liberal government is accusing the opposition of the 
very opposite, which is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am curious as to why the parliamentary secretary would use 
such damaging words about the opposition and its support for our 
troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said in my speech, 
I have mentioned on a number of occasions that opposition parties 
support the government in sending our troops.  I mentioned that I 
appreciate that.  However, what they also seem to be saying is 
that we are closing off debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it has been mentioned before, but I am going to mention 
it again.  This is the fourth debate we have had on Kosovo. 
According to the Minister of National Defence, over 131 
parliamentarians have spoken on the subject.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that this afternoon a few of the 
members, and I know it was probably done accidentally, seemed to 
be suggesting that we have soldiers in Kosovo right now.  I would 
just like to mention that as the Prime Minister and the Minister 
of National Defence have said, we have no soldiers in Kosovo 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter before the House and part of the debate of course 
centres around the vote as the Bloc motion clearly indicates.  It 
has nothing to do with what question period information was 
brought forward about troops burying some— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry, but I do not think the 
hon. member is raising a legitimate point of order.  He asked a 
question and he is getting an answer.  While he may not agree 
with the answer, I am afraid he is stuck with it.

not convincing, sir— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry  must address his remarks to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary's 
arguments are no more convincing than those of his counterpart 
at foreign affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons they are even less convincing is that this 
morning one of his colleagues reminded us that this House had 
voted on several occasions on sending troops, not only to Iraq, 
but also to the Congo, Cyprus, and the Middle East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are examples when the House voted. Why is the government 
refusing to change the practice it brought in when it came to 
power, according to which it refuses to hold a vote after a 
debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should learn something from this war, a lesson in 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not understand at all the 
attitude of the members across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said it over and again in my speech as well as before when I 
answered the question put to me by my colleague from Calgary 
North, I know neither how many debates were held nor how many 
members rose in this House to discuss the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not forget either that every day, technical briefings 
are given at National Defense Headquarters by people from DND 
and the Department of Foreign Affairs. There is an awful lot of 
information out there. People only have to go and get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Halifax West, National Defence; the hon. member for 
Acadie—Bathurst, The Budget; the hon. member for Markham, The 
Economy; the hon. member for Frontenac—Mégantic, Black Lake BC

hon. members know I do not believe in fighting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I would like to congratulate the Bloc for using 
this opposition day in a constructive manner to put on the floor 
of this place an issue that really should be debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said last week that I thought the opposition day was misused 
by the official opposition when in fact Canada is at war.  If 
somebody wants to put an issue forward to discuss a vote, why not 
do it this way? 
Why not use the opposition day which is parliamentary tradition 
and put this issue to a vote instead of standing up and saying 
one thing in question period and doing another at a time when the 
opportunity presents itself to have an opposition day?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I can say that I congratulate the Bloc, which is not 
something I would do often, for taking the opportunity to put 
forward this motion to allow for constructive debate, it would 
probably not be surprised to find I cannot support the motion as 
it stands.  But I do support the concept of having debates in 
this place, particularly when it involves the three words we have 
heard in the media lately that really are foreign to this 
country.  Canada at war.  Those are the three words.  I believe 
there is a show on CBC tomorrow evening.  It is an astounding 
thing to think about in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Are we? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, clearly we are.  We are 
involved aggressively with our allies in a war to try to resolve 
a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think anyone in this place would question the 
intentions or the desire to bring peace to that region.  Part of 
the reason I have difficulty with the concept is that we would 
have a debate in here about whether or not the next step in our 
military deployment should be this or should be that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about it.  There is a potential of putting our armed 
forces at risk.  We are going to say to Mr. Milosevic “Hold on. 
We are going to have a debate in parliament.  Don't do anything. 
We will get back to you. We have all our men lined up and ready 
to go with weapons cocked but we have to have a debate in this 
place called parliament in Canada and then we have to have a vote 
and we will decide whether or not we are going to deploy our 
troops”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never before in the history of this country would that kind of 
process have been undertaken.  It was not undertaken in 1939 when 
this country joined forces to fight the Nazis.  It was not 
undertaken when we declared war against imperial Japan. It was 
not undertaken when we declared war on Korea.  It is unbelievable 
to think that a responsible parliamentarian would want us to have 
some kind of debate and a vote.  Imagine what would happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of message would we be sending if for some reason the 
vote was extremely close?  We know with a majority government we 
could carry it.  I do not believe that the official opposition or 
anyone in opposition wants to send a message of instability or 
mixed messages to the people who are putting their lives on the 
line.  I just do not believe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a quote and then say who said it.  “It is also our 
view as I wrote the Prime Minister on March 31 that once the 
decision was made to commit Canadian air forces to the NATO 
effort in Yugoslavia, we in this parliament should not engage in 
second guessing the mission when it has scarcely begun. Rather, 
we should offer our steadfast support, our political support, our 
moral support, our vocal support to those brave Canadian 
personnel who are involved”.  The Leader of the Official 
Opposition said that on April 12, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have to say that is a responsible position to take. 
Once again it is not often I throw accolades to the official 
opposition. I think it makes sense to take a position such as 
this when people are putting their lives on the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another quote which was made in this place.  “I would 
say right up front on behalf of the NDP caucus that we certainly 
support the idea that Canada should fulfill its international 
obligations and should take every measure possible to try to end 
the suffering, to end the senseless bloodshed that occurs in a 
lot of these countries and to bring about some humanitarian 
efforts and to try to stabilize the countries”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was said by the New Democratic Party critic, the member for 
Halifax West.  Again, I think that is a responsible position that 
an opposition party should take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To politicize this war into the opportunism we hear during 
question period or that we hear members opposite making is 
frightening. Frankly it is dangerous.  We are not going into a 
war by committee.  We are not going into a war where we have to 
say “Hold on, we will get back to you.  We have not had a vote 
yet.  There are 301 people in our parliament who need to vote on 
this”.  We would be tying the hands of the military leaders.  We 
would be tying the hands of the government to require such a 
thing to occur.  I do not think Canadians are fooled by the 
rhetoric which would suggest that somehow we should do it that 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of points about what is going on in the region. 
Many will recall a debate in this place that was somewhat 
rancorous.  It was about whether or not members of parliament 
should have a small Canadian flag on their desks.  I recall it 
rather well.  There were cars painted with the Canadian flag 
driving around Parliament Hill; all kinds of my nationalism is 
bigger than your nationalism; all kinds of attempts at 
one-upmanship.  Frankly, I think we were as guilty as some 
members opposite who engaged in that debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member from Owen Sound, made a very 
interesting remark to me.  He said “What really bothers me about 
this is it is nationalism and it is dangerous”.  There is a 
difference between being proud of our country and standing up and 
shouting and yelling we are the best or we are the strongest. 
What we are seeing in Kosovo and in Yugoslavia is nationalism and 
tribalism gone mad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 as a member of the provincial legislature I was part of 
a parliamentary delegation that witnessed the first free 
elections since the second world war in Croatia. I spent time in 
Zagreb and went down the coast and met with many Croatian people. 
I remember on election day people queuing up to vote with tears 
in their eyes because they had not had that freedom under Tito. 
This was their opportunity to say “<I>Zivjela Hrvatska</I>”. 
This was their opportunity to vote for independence, to vote for 
a strong Croatia. We are in the same region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other night when I was watching a newscast I heard one of 
the commentators, I think it was Henry Kissinger say that what we 
have in this part of the world is irreconcilable hatred.  We have 
to think about that.  It is absolutely true.  I do not know how 
we resolve the hatred and the passion that people feel.  I am not 
sure we could even understand it, never mind resolve it.  I do 
not know how we can suggest that we are going to magically sit 
down at a peace table and resolve a conflict that is not 10 or 20 
years old but hundreds of years old, perhaps thousands of years 
old.  That conflict is there in such a personal fashion it is 
hard to conceive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In no circumstances could I support putting our soldiers at risk 
in that theatre. To suggest that we have a vote on this issue 
would do that and it would send the wrong message.  We should be 
supporting our personnel. I support them as I hope all members 
will.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques,

</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe he does not know it, but there have been votes in the 
House to decide whether our troops would take part in military 
missions abroad. I will not give a list of these votes since 
somebody else did it in a previous speech.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So there is a precedent in the House where parliament was used 
as an important tool in the area of foreign policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member if he thinks that, considering the 
seriousness of the current situation in Kosovo and in the 
Balkans, a vote in parliament would be an important tool that 
should be used by the government to tell the international 
community that not only do the Government of Canada and the 
parties represented in the House of Commons agree on this issue, 
but that all members of the House of Commons share the same 
position with regard to the need to send in ground troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not have some political weight and would it not advance 
the cause of democracy if we showed all Canadians that the 
members they elected to represent them in parliament had the 
opportunity to vote on this most important issue? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the sentiment, the 
principle or the idea that the Canadian parliament should vote on 
matters of national and international interest is valid. However 
the practical reality of having a vote and having some kind of 
potential for the opposition perhaps to use it for political 
statements, or for an opportunity to try to somehow embarrass the 
government, is the wrong kind of issue to do that with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that what they are doing is absolutely 
appropriate.  They are putting forward a motion that will 
generate a vote on an opposition day so that we all have the 
opportunity to stand in the House and put our position forward as 
to whether or not we support the government on the actions that 
are being taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to be careful and we have to depoliticize as 
much as possible the issue of whether or not ground troops are 
sent in.  I pray to God that will not have to happen, but I fear 
that looking at the situation that it might well have to happen. 
We have to give them flexibility and the ability to deal with 
that at the military level. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a comment or two followed by a short question. It seems like 
the member for Mississauga West often engages in demagogic 
attacks at important times when we should be discussing matters 
of national interest.  We are not under any imminent threat of a 
strike by Serbians or anyone else, so there is lots of time to 
debate the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has not been given the full opportunity to debate it. 
No opportunity for a vote was given.  His own prime minister, his 
own leader, when the war was going on in Kuwait accused the 
previous prime minister of being an American stooge for not 
bringing the issue before the House for a vote when he supported 
the Americans in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he think of the situation now that his party is in the 
position of being the governing party of the country?  Do they 
want to be thought of the same way, or will they allow a vote 
finally to take place on the issue because there is time and a 
real need? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will accept the fact 
that I have stood from time to time in this place and thrown 
castigations at the opposition parties.  I did not do that in 
this speech, precisely for the reason that the hon. member 
mentions.  This is much too serious an issue for us to be 
worrying about partisan shots at one another.  We can live to 
fight another day on those issues, and I am sure we will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I even quoted the Leader of the Opposition in a positive light 
from <I>Hansard</I> and congratulated him for his statement.  I 
quoted the New Democratic member for Halifax West.  I 
congratulated the Bloc for using an opposition day in what I view 
to be an appropriate manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is much too serious an issue for us to be politicizing it 
and taking cheap shots at one another.  I certainly did not do 
that and have no intention of doing that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to address the motion proposed by the 
Bloc Quebecois.  It does not happen often on this side of the 
House that the Bloc would receive congratulations from the 
official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the debate is certainly well timed.  It could be 
carried a bit further, but so be it.  The fact of the matter is 
that it is before the House for debate and actually for a vote to 
encourage, if nothing else, the government to take the right 
steps, that is to take a vote on the issue of entering or 
escalating our presence in the Kosovo crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening to some of the comments on the issue of 
voting on this motion.  I will read the motion again for anyone 
who may be viewing or listening: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House demand that the government submit to a debate and 
a vote in the House— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also include the amendment of the hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry: “prior to the possibility of”. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the sending of Canadian soldiers to the Balkans who may be 
involved in military or peacekeeping operations on the ground in 
Kosovo and the Balkan region. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the short time I have been sitting in the House listening 
to the debate, the comments from that side of the House toward 
the opposition or toward anyone seeking to have a vote on the 
issue are amazing.  It has nothing to do per se with the events 
happening over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, alarm bells have been sent out:  “We will not have time 
for a debate in the House on this issue because it could be an 
emergency”.  It is not an emergency.  There is ample time to 
debate the topic about sending ground forces in.  There is plenty 
of time for the government to prepare and for the opposition to 
receive pertinent information so that all hon. members of the 
House could be well informed about a vote.  As well there would 
be a substantial show of support throughout.  There is no way out 
once members stand in the House to take a vote on an issue as 
important as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition has again been accused of trying to turn the 
House into a congressional system.  What on earth does that mean? 
To have a democratic process involved in the sending of troops, 
or whether or not one supports sending troops or escalating our 
presence in the Kosovo crisis, what on earth does that have to do 
with turning the House into a congressional system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  It means where one person does not make 
all the decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Yes, as my hon. colleague said, it means 
that one person does not make all the decisions.  That is what 
seems to be the point of greatest fear on the other side of the 
House and the government has clear support, if a vote is taken, 
even from the opposition members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case I inform the other side of the House that the 
Reform Party, the official opposition, supports the government's 
role and the troops in NATO thus far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Mississauga West made a very accurate 
statement about our leader and his position, that we did in fact 
support the government.  He could have continued on to inform the 
House and those viewing the debate that our leader also advised 
the Prime Minister and the House that if any escalation were 
contemplated which might require ground troops being sent in, the 
Leader of the Opposition clearly stated that we would seek to 
have a vote in the House on the matter and another debate.  That 
is the conclusion of the opposition leader's statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also a statement from the Liberal side relating to the 
issue of the vote, that to vote on this issue would put the 
troops at risk.  Can anyone on the other side of the House tell 
me how a vote would put our troops at risk?  I cannot understand 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would we be jeopardizing their safety by having a vote on 
this issue?  I would like to be shown how we would place our 
troops at risk by the mere fact that we would debating and voting 
on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell members that our troops would feel very supported if 
the majority of members in the House rose in support of their 
action over there.  I believe they deserve our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence 
brought forward a statement accusing the opposition of political 
jockeying.  What are we jockeying for?  The majority of 
opposition members support our role and the government's role in 
this NATO crisis.  Where is the political jockeying? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are seeking is to have a vote on the issue in parliament. 
It is that simple.  There is no political jockeying involved. It 
is a simple declaration that we support this initiative but we 
want a vote on it in the House.  That is democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these matters have been raised in the last few minutes. 
Another statement was directed from the Liberal side toward the 
opposition, that the opposition was using this issue and this 
motion for political statements and posturing.  Is this the 
actual view of the Liberal government of the opposition that has 
claimed time and time again that we are supporting the action 
over there just because we are asking for a vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other underlying reasons the Liberal government 
is accusing the opposition of all these things.  The 
parliamentary secretary to the foreign affairs minister stated, 
as reported in <I>Hansard</I>, that historically successive 
Canadian governments had maintained that it was best to present 
unanimity from all sides of the House on a decision of this 
gravity and magnitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would it even know that?  Since when has the government side 
been speaking for every member in the House?  It is not speaking 
for every member in the House.  There is an opposition here which 
has a role to play in the parliamentary system.  It is not 
speaking for every member in the House, in spite of what the 
foreign affairs parliamentary secretary had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are all the reasons brought forward in the last two hours 
of the debate.  The accusations have been plentiful on that side 
trying to discredit or put down the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not speaking for every party but I certainly am speaking 
for our own.  We support the government action in NATO on the 
Kosovo crisis.  Why would the government side continually want to 
shut down the issue of a vote?  There is only one reason I can 
think of.  It does not want votes on important issues to take 
place.  It does not want the democratic process to actually— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt, but did the member for Calgary Northeast indicate he 
was sharing his time with the member for Fraser Valley? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  I am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member has one 
minute to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  My apologies, Mr. Speaker, for not 
letting you know earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the government does not want votes on important 
issues, even if it means having to send ground troops into Kosovo 
and place the lives of men and women in the military in possible 
danger.  It does not want to vote on it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the history.  We could go through a list of other things 
like hepatitis C compensation.  There was no vote on that issue 
and it was an important issue.  The issue of APEC funding 
consumed much debate in the House.  There were many questions 
from the official opposition and other opposition parties to the 
government, but there was no debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also talk about the issue that brought some infamy to 
the secretary of state for financial institutions, which is the 
taxing of single parents or single income families.  It is 
shameful.  We could talk about the banning of kiddie porn.  The 
list goes on and on.  That is the real reason this government 
does not want to have a vote on the issue of Kosovo.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to explain to people watching that this is an 
opposition day.  Each year each of the four opposition parties 
receives a certain number of days on which they can pick any 
topic they want to debate.  Today we are debating a motion by the 
Bloc which has to do with Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just listened to the third speech made by a Reform member. 
In that speech, as in the ones we heard this morning, there was 
the usual criticism of the government and much sanctimonious talk 
about democracy and how we should be dealing with Kosovo.  By the 
way, this is our fourth debate on Kosovo. What people watching 
may not realize is that the Reform Party had an opposition day on 
which it could choose any topic it wished. That opposition day 
followed the all-night debate on Kosovo.  The Reform Party picked 
a Mickey Mouse motion.  It was a tragic-comic, partisan motion 
about alienation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the Reform member is this:  If he is so keen on 
this issue, as he purports to be, why is it they picked the comic 
strip motion the day following the Kosovo debate instead of 
supporting the Bloc motion today?  That is not a party which 
normally supports the Bloc.  It is the party which says “No more 
prime ministers from Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from the member, up to a point.  I think he has been rather 
unduly critical of our party; in fact, very much so in his 
statements.  I believe that nothing is comic in the House, 
including our opposition day motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the issue of the vote is clear.  We asked for unanimous 
consent to have a vote on this issue the day it was debated in 
the House.  We had an all-night debate on the issue.  What 
happened?  The Liberal side said no.  The next day it was the 
same thing; the Liberal side said no.  We asked for that vote and 
they would not agree to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the hon. member not to hurl these kinds of 
statements back to the opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. Reform member undoubtedly heard the hon. Liberal member who 
spoke before him quote my words, in which I indicated that we 
felt very strongly that every avenue should be pursued to try to 
bring an end to the useless bloodshed.  One of the avenues we 
have been pursuing quite rigorously in light of that is the 
uniting for peace resolution.  We feel that it is important to 
get this issue before the general assembly of the United Nations. 
That seems to be constantly shoved aside by the government.  It 
is almost as if it does not want to bring the matter before a 
larger international body other than NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member what his views are with respect to 
that suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe that every effort 
should be pursued diplomatically while the issue of this attack 
is ongoing. 
Diplomatically it is incumbent upon our government to pursue it 
at great length.  I applaud the member for taking that 
initiative.  I will tell him personally that I will support the 
initiative to see that it does go to the UN as one more step in 
attempting to bring a reasonable resolution to the crisis in 
Kosovo.

whether we have the United Nations or a united nation, I believe 
that a vote in this House would mean that we would be speaking 
with one voice.  We would be a united nation, uniting behind our 
troops for their morale and our allies for support.  It would be 
more than just the largest party in this House— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Calgary Northeast has 15 seconds to wind up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague 
for that question.  That is exactly what it shows, that this 
House, on a standing vote, with everyone being accounted for, is 
supportive of our troops and the initiative we have embarked upon 
with NATO.  I agree with him and I thank him for the question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the House for the opportunity to debate this very important 
issue.  A very important motion has been brought forward by the 
Bloc Quebecois today.  It basically boils down to whether the 
House of Commons should not only be consulted but also have an 
opportunity to vote on any deployment of troops, especially 
ground troops, in the Kosovo region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the House back to 1995 when I brought forward Bill 
C-295.  That bill would have provided an approval process for any 
deployment of troops overseas in a combat role.  I was on the 
foreign affairs committee at the time.  What triggered this bill 
was an all-party defence committee report which was tabled in the 
House in the fall of 1994.  Part of that report stated that 
defence policy cannot be made in private and the results simply 
announced.  Canadians will not accept that, nor should they.  Nor 
should the government commit our forces to service abroad without 
a full parliamentary debate and accounting for that decision.  It 
is our expectation that, except in extraordinary circumstances, 
such a debate would always take place prior to any such 
deployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the unanimous decision of an all-party defence 
committee report of 1994, which followed the major defence and 
foreign policy review.  I see some members here who took part in 
that report.  One of the conclusions they came to was that not 
only should parliament be consulted, but that consultation should 
take place, except in extraordinary circumstances, prior to any 
deployment of troops overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The all-party committee which recommended that would be 
saddened, as I am today, to see that six fighter bombers went 
over to Kosovo, then twelve and now eighteen.  We do not have any 
idea of what other commitments the government will be making 
because we take note in our debates but we never vote and we 
never know before the government acts.  This is in complete 
contradiction to an all-party decision, which I think is even 
more powerful than the government, which says that is not the 
right way to do it, and the government does not enjoy broad 
Canadian support when it acts unilaterally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought up other things that are very germane to the debate we 
are having today.  If this bill had been adopted we would not be 
having this debate because it would not be necessary.  The member 
for Red Deer brought forward two similar motions since Bill 
C-295.  They were all along the same line and all of them were 
defeated by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefit of having a vote in the House of Commons is that 
through this political process Canadians would decide Canada's 
role.  Our reason for sending ground troops must meet the 
satisfaction of the Canadian people.  Many people in this debate 
and in the previous take note debates have talked about the 
necessity of military intervention.  On this side of the House we 
are not denying that it is a necessary role and that Canadian 
troops need to be and are a part of it. 
However, the political process, the approval of the House before 
those troops are actually deployed, is the very least that the 
opposition demands on behalf of Canadians.  We all should be 
involved in sending troops overseas when they are put in harm's 
way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I believe that asking for that vote, not just the debate 
but the vote, would allow the government to gauge support for the 
mission before Canada actually commits troops.  I think it would 
be unanimous.  I have not heard a single member stand to say that 
we should not be over there doing what we can to stop the ethnic 
cleansing.  I think it would be a unanimous vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This an opportunity for the government to gauge the level of 
support.  Parliament should be the instrument.  We should not be 
reading the <I>National Post</I> or the <I>Globe and Mail</I> and 
waiting for Léger & Léger to do a poll.  That is not the way to 
do it.  If the government is as sure as it says it is, and in 
this case I think it is reading the tea leaves pretty well, it 
should put it to parliament, let all of us vote, and go forward 
with the confidence of knowing that the House and not just the 
government supports the move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, a vote would strengthen the ministers' hand.  When the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs goes to Brussels and enters into 
negotiations with our NATO allies, and when the Ministers of 
Foreign Affairs and National Defence deal with cabinet, it 
strengthens their hand to know they are going forward with the 
confidence of the House behind them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This an opportunity for them to say to cabinet “We have to move 
and this is why we have to move.  You saw the vote.  You saw the 
House.  The House brought its decision down and we had better 
listen”.  It is not just us, it is the Canadian people who are 
represented.  This is an opportunity to strengthen the ministers' 
hand by having a vote in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a corollary to that, I have some fears with the government 
having made this decision.  What would happen if sometime down 
the road one of the parties opposite started to criticize the 
decision?  What if, heaven forbid, someone was killed?  It could 
happen.  It is a war zone.  If someone was killed, a member on 
this side of the House could get cold feet and say, “I sort of 
supported it in my speech, but I sure never would have voted for 
it”, which is probably malarkey.  However, by asking members to 
stand and vote, to actually stand in their places and tell us 
what they think, there will be no turning back.  They would be 
saying “I supported the decision.  We sent our men and women 
overseas and I am behind them all the way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to my fourth point.  A vote sends a message to 
the troops like nothing else can.  We bring forward motions.  It 
was tried last Friday to bring a motion forward regarding Wayne 
Gretzky.  There was a member today who talked about Wayne 
Gretzky.  We bring forward motions of support about things which, 
frankly, are not terribly life threatening.  I am a great hockey 
fan, but it does not stir me like the very deep, troubled 
emotions I have over what is going on in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could send a message to our troops by standing and voting in 
support of a measure that the government could bring forward. 
Then we would be sending a message to our troops that not only 
did we stand here literally, but we are standing with them 
symbolically as they do Canada's work abroad, putting themselves 
in harm's way, to who knows what kind of detriment in the months 
to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I spoke to this topic I told the story of a person 
from my riding, Mark Isfeld, who was killed in a land mine 
accident in Bosnia.  It was a very sad moment in my community. 
There was a huge funeral and a terrible outpouring of grief that 
followed in our community, which is not that large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heaven forbid that would happen, but before it could happen I 
would hope that members of the House would be able to stand and 
say “We are with you, members of our armed forces.  We are 
standing here, and by standing here we are standing with you.  We 
appreciate what you are doing for peace, what you are doing to 
prevent more slaughter and more ethnic cleansing. 
We are with you as you stand to represent the values that 
Canadians hold dear about truth and peace and trying to do the 
right thing in a very difficult situation”.  However, we cannot 
do that in the same way unless we vote.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to support the motion.  It is a half measure, given 
that we are already involved in the Balkan conflict, but I think 
all Canadians would like to see their members of parliament stand 
and be counted.  I for one would stand and say “Ready, aye 
ready” along with our men and women of the Canadian Armed 
Forces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, just 
as the Reform Party did, we have many criticisms of the 
consultation and discussion process. This process will not end 
in a vote as it should. This should have abeen voted on long 
time ago, especially since the Standing Committee on National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs has recommended it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just received a document that shows how little the government 
wants to inform us and how much it lacks transparency. 
I have just received a note by a person responsible for the 
Standing Committee on External Affairs and International Trade 
that informs us that the briefing on Kosovo that was scheduled 
for 10 o'clock tomorrow at National Defence Headquarters will 
not take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague of the Reform Party what he 
thinks of the last minute cancellation of this briefing. Also 
what does he think about the meeting tomorrow at the Standing 
Committee on External Affairs and International Trade. That 
meeting should last all of 30 minutes, and that is going to be 
the only briefing the members of the House will get. Will we 
have a briefing on Thursday, as promised? Maybe it too will be 
cancelled. So, can my friend from the Reform Party say what he 
thinks about these cancellations and this lack of transparency 
on the part of the government? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can sympathize with the 
member who brings up the problem of trying to get all the 
information on the table in a short, 30-minute briefing in a 
formal committee structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen so often, a minister might make a 10 or 15 
minute presentation which leaves other parties—not to mention 
government members who may or should have questions about the 
same issue—with maybe two three-minute questions, maybe the same 
amount of time for answers and then no follow-up.   It is a very 
inadequate briefing for something that appears to be escalating 
quite rapidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sent six fighter bombers, then twelve and now eighteen. 
Negotiations are taking place in NATO circles regarding numbers; 
50,000 to 100,000 ground troops.  It is a huge discussion and 
should be part of a huge debate that should, I would argue, 
eventually lead to a vote, and not a vote just in committee where 
eight or ten people might be well informed for 30 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A motion should be brought forward by the minister with a 
proposal in hand giving the House the situation and the military 
and political objective.  We all know the moral objective is to 
stop the ethnic cleansing.  However, the minister should come to 
the House and let all of us be briefed, not just the few who are 
fortunate enough to attend committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
know the hon. member has been following the debate in the House. 
I am sure he is aware that over the course of the past century we 
have entered into quite a number of conflicts all of which have 
primarily been done without a resolution of this House.  We 
entered into the second world war, the Korean conflict and so on 
without a resolution of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the hon. member read the resolution?  I am curious as to 
what it is he is actually voting on.  The resolution states that 
this House demand that the government submit to a debate 
beforehand with a vote in the House of the possibility of sending 
Canadian soldiers to the Balkans who may be involved in military 
or peacekeeping operations on the ground of the Kosovo and Balkan 
region. 
Is he voting on whether we have a vote?  Is he voting on whether 
we are hypothetically sending troops?  Is he in effect 
sanctioning what the government is already doing, namely having 
already committed airplanes to the conflict and to bombing 
missions?  Is he sanctioning a military operation, in which case 
is he prepared to—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do have the motion in 
front of me as amended.  It is pretty straightforward. It says 
that this House demand that the government submit to a debate and 
a vote in the House prior to the possibility of sending Canadian 
soldiers to the Balkans who may be involved in military or 
peacekeeping operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my point of view and taking this at face value, we are 
asking the government, prior to sending people in as peacekeepers 
or into combat in a military zone, to submit a proposal to the 
House for debate and a vote.  It is straightforward, it is the 
same in both official languages and it is easy to understand. I 
encourage all hon. members to support the motion.  It is a step 
forward for democracy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to join in the debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposition before the House today is very interesting. It 
is as if there was not already precedence in the House of 
Commons.  The House of Commons works on the concept of 
precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government and governments before it have allowed soldiers, 
sailors and airmen to go offshore, either to act on behalf of the 
United Nations in peacekeeping or peacemaking; or, in the case of 
the second world war, to go to war; or, in the case of the Korean 
conflict, to go into another area of live fire and face death. 
These conflicts were not voted on and have never been voted on in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at a precedence.  We have given this subject many 
hours of debate.  As a consequence, we keep hearing “Why do you 
not do this?”  We are following the practice of the well-worn 
and well-tried system of the British House of Commons theory 
which is to practice by precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This breaks the parliamentary practice.  The proposal put 
forward by the sponsoring member is hypothetical.  If we ask a 
hypothetical question it is generally turfed out.  We do not work 
on hypothetical situations in the House of Commons.  We work on 
real situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking at the situation as presented, it would and could be 
unworkable.  I do not want to get into a debate on it. I feel it 
is ultra vires because it breaks the precedence in the House.  We 
believe the energies of the House are best directed toward 
considering ways of resolving the crisis in Kosovo not engaging 
in procedural wrangling like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian parliamentary system responsible for deploying the 
Canadian forces lies with the government.  It is the 
responsibility of the government, through the Speech from the 
Throne, through the empowerment of the defence minister and 
through the government as such.  We should not go off trying to 
invent a new form of style in the government at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition should remember that we sent troops to Cyprus, to 
the gulf war and to the Golan Heights.  We have sent troops 
offshore and many of them at the request of the United Nations. 
In this case there is an explicit commitment involved.  We are a 
member of a security alliance which has asked us to participate 
in the action in Kosovo and thereabouts.  As legitimate alliance 
members, we are being asked to participate on that team and we 
are doing that. 
As members of this group, and through information from our 
foreign affairs committee and defence committee, we know it is 
our solid commitment to take part.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why we are coming up with all of this cobweb 
stuff, with a little bit of angel dust on it, when it is not the 
reality. The reality is that we have a commitment in writing to 
participate with our defensive alliance.  We should make that 
commitment and we will make that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention at this time that I will be splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government delivered on this and we said it would have take 
note debates and have an airing.  If there was an airing where we 
were doing something wrong, it would have been picked up 
sufficiently by the opposition and the opposition's commitments 
would be there.  However, there has been no such identification 
of somewhere that we are off on the wrong track.  We are on track 
by being with our allies.  We are on track by trying to bring 
peace to a bewildered and beleaguered country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no plans to deploy any armed soldiers on the ground in 
Kosovo at the moment.  That does not eliminate the possibility of 
this happening.  We always have to keep paratus in front of us as 
the model of readiness in the infantry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few of our NATO allies have put the Kosovo incident to a 
vote. The United Kingdom has not voted nor debated this issue. 
France has not voted.  President Chirac decided to intervene and 
consult the legislature but has had no vote.  We are not off 
centre with our allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us could be a very unworkable precedent if it 
passed.  It suggests that it would be appropriate for the House 
of Commons to micromanage the aspects of troop deployment in the 
Balkans, even on simple housekeeping items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian forces members are currently deployed on nine missions 
of varying size in the Balkans, each of these managed on a day to 
day basis by established Canadian forces policies with respect to 
personnel rotation and replacement. Under the terms of the 
motion, all of these decisions would be subject to House 
approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The BQ would have the House convene to vote on whether a cook 
could be dispatched to Croatia.  Even deciding to dispatch a 
rescue team for a downed Canadian pilot could be subject to a 
House vote.  The motion would slow down Canada's ability to 
respond swiftly and flexibly to the kind of rapidly developing 
humanitarian crisis that has become so much the norm in the past. 
The cold war conflicts, of which Kosovo was just the latest 
example in the Balkans, would draw us in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of our current missions in the Balkans were voted on by the 
House.  There is no question that the swift deployment saved 
innocent lives and, for us, saving lives will always be the 
priority over procedural wrangling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Milosevic's unacceptable conduct predates the current crisis 
in Kosovo.  His use of the Yugoslav army to support fellow Serbs 
during the war in Croatia and Bosnia materially contributed to 
the ethnic cleansing that occurred during those conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to Mr. Milosevic's rise to power, Kosovo was made up 
mostly of ethnic Albanians who had a constitutional autonomy 
within Yugoslavia.  This right was stripped away by Mr. Milosevic 
in 1989 and from that point forward he has deliberately worked to 
impoverish the oppressed Kosovars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since early last year his security forces have mounted a 
campaign in which innocent civilians have been subjected to 
ethnic atrocities similar to those we witnessed in Croatia and 
Bosnia. 
We were part of the European community monitoring mission for the 
United Nations protection force from 1992 to 1995. More than 
1,300 Canadian forces personnel remain in Bosnia at this time as 
part of the NATO led stabilization force.

longstanding policy of promoting international peace and

</I></B></P><P align=left>A diplomatic solution to the Kosovo conflict has always been the 
course preferred by Canada and its allies.  In March 1998 the 
United Nations passed resolution 1160 calling on all parties to 
reach a peaceful settlement.  This was followed in September 1998 
by UN resolution 1199, that both sides cease hostilities and 
improve the humanitarian situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding parliamentary consultation, on October 1, 1998 all 
parties agreed that Canada should join our NATO allies on air 
operations.  They proved necessary.  We had a second meeting on 
February 17, 1999.  There was hope that a peace agreement could 
be signed and that our involvement would be consistent with that 
of a peacekeeping force. On April 12, 1999 when the House once 
again discussed the events in Kosovo, all parties supported 
Canada's position to participate in the NATO led air operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, both the defence and foreign affairs standing 
committees held a number of meetings on the developments in 
Kosovo.  There was a joint meeting on March 31 of the ministers 
of foreign affairs, national defence and international 
co-operation and they outlined the government's response to these 
crises. On April 15 the Minister of Foreign Affairs appeared 
before the foreign affairs committee to discuss the developments 
in Kosovo. All interested members were invited.

excessive to me, and which would not bind the government in the 
future, although it might be interesting that parliament be 
called upon to debate and vote on the issue of sending large 
contingents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's other argument, actually the second argument I 
heard today, is that we should not change the established 
practice, based on the British House of Commons' model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, this practice has not always been followed, 
because there have been votes in the House prior to sending 
troops abroad. If the hon. member had listened to the speech of 
the hon. member for Richmond—Arthabaska, he would know that votes 
have been asked for by his party, by the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs who was the foreign affairs critic at the time his party 
was the official opposition, and that this practice had been 
changed from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, practices can be changed and I would add that it is 
even advisable to do so. 
I would like to know what the hon. member across the way thinks 
of what Mr. Clinton said today, when he asked Congress to 
unanimously and immediately support a supplementary budget bill 
authorizing additional funds for the American action in Kosovo. 
President Clinton said that these funds are required urgently 
and immediate lynecessity and that Congress would clearly serve 
national interests by dealing with the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the Canadian parliament not vote on this issue, like 
the U.S. Congress?

proposition put before us is not in line.  It is a hypothetical 
situation which the hon. member should know well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Americans have often gone back to congress when they 
need more money for offshore fighting.  There is a precedent. 
This is nothing new.  It is a typical redressing and refuelling 
of the number of people they will send over there by making a 
budget increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A hypothetical question is something we should not vote on. Also 
the American analogy does not work. That is a precedent, an 
American practice in their politics when the president asks for 
more money to aid in a situation such as has taken place with the 
NATO operation in Kosovo.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to what the member had to say.  His 
contributions to this debate on the opposition motion by the Bloc 
were very useful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the Reform Party vigorously support this motion. 
We know that the Reform Party has had its own opposition day 
since the all night debate on Kosovo.  Does my colleague have any 
thoughts on why it is the Reform Party chose to debate a very 
trivial motion for an entire day following the Kosovo debate, 
rather than put a motion of this type forward itself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party does a 
number of things that do not always make sense. I was not here 
when that motion was put forward so I cannot speak with any

question with qualified authority.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

positions rather than asking the Reform Party.  Can he explain 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize the member has only just joined us, but I did ask the 
same question of the Reform Party earlier this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not think that is really a point 
of order, but perhaps the hon. member for Perth—Middlesex would 
care to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again I do not feel I 
am in a position to make a response to that question.  I would be 
working in the dark on that one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to recognize that excluding 
the last several hours of debate, this House has already had the 
opportunity over the last couple of months to have 26 hours of 
debate on the important issue of Kosovo.  Over 100 members have 
participated.  There has been 20 to 25 hours of work in 
committees.  There has been a major examination during the study 
of the estimates by the committee to determine the responsibility 
and accountability of the government on this important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a little strange that there has been these great calls 
about lack of information, lack of consultation.  In fact if we 
look at the record of many of the other countries in the NATO 
organization there has been no debates, no votes whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point that out not for reasons of comparison, but simply to 
point out that in this parliament we have established very 
important advances in engaging members of parliament in the 
decisions relating to foreign policy and international 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I heard the previous question to my colleague, the 
parliamentary secretary.  I want to point out one thing.  I was 
here during the time of the gulf war.  The warships were sent 
from Canada in August.  Parliament was not even reconvened until 
the end of September, almost five weeks later. There was not any 
parliamentary involvement whatsoever.  There was not even a 
debate for another month beyond that.  We went almost two and a 
half months without any kind of parliamentary consideration, even 
though Canada had committed itself to a major enterprise in the 
gulf war.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the vote did come a month or two later, it was not to 
authorize troops or ground involvement, it was simply a vote to 
endorse a UN resolution.  That was the vote, pure and simple. All 
precedents that have been cited by hon. members opposite simply 
do not conform with the parliamentary history or the 
parliamentary facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is important. I always pay great deference to my 
predecessors.  I point to the statement made by the Rt. Hon. Joe 
Clark who was the Minister of External Affairs at that time. I 
notice that he took occasion this morning to talk about 
parliamentary responsibility.  On September 25 he said that we 
cannot always wait for deliberative bodies to deliberate and act, 
which is why he said he would not guarantee a vote in the House 
of Commons on the use of Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go back and cite history and precedent, it is important 
to get the facts right.  What we decided when we became the 
government was to change all that, to open up the format so that 
parliament would have the opportunity to be heard, to hear the 
voices.  We already have.  Over 100 members of parliament have 
expressed themselves very clearly on the most unmistakable 
commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to acknowledge the fact that the House has made itself 
unified on the question of the reprehensible terrorism that is 
being wrought on the people of Kosovo by the Milosevic regime. We 
have made ourselves heard on the need to come to the aid of the 
hundreds of thousands of refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed I would say we have recognized that as we go through a 
transition in world affairs, we are also making a very major 
statement as Canadians toward the acknowledgement that new 
humanitarian standards are being established in the world.  We 
are establishing new norms of behaviour which say that even the 
so-called sacred altar of national sovereignty should not stand 
in the way of protecting the lives of innocent human beings, of 
civilians who are being repressed and terrorized by their own 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge that that is a change.  Just as the world has 
changed in geological terms, there is a shifting of the plates of 
international relations.  I am pleased to say that as Canadians 
over the last several years we have increasingly been on the 
forefront of establishing a need for new standards and new norms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say innocent people should not be killed by those weapons. 
Whether it is the land mines campaign, advancing the work of the 
international court, or standing up against the trade in small 
arms, it is all part of the same fundamental, elementary process. 
This is to say that we now must begin to provide higher levels 
of protection for the safety and security of individuals, of 
human beings, of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it strikes me as somewhat curious that the House 
would spend so much of its time on the question of a vote as 
opposed to getting down to the essentials, which is how does this 
country prepare itself to take the action required for that 
protection of human life, of individual security, of human 
responsibility and safety?  That is what Canadians are interested 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister said in the previous debate last Monday, 
each circumstance will present itself.  The government will make 
a choice as to what the nature of that parliamentary consultation 
and that parliamentary role will be.  But to insist now on a vote 
on something that has not happened yet simply runs contrary to 
the very essence of relevance of the House.  Please do not expect 
us to vote on proposition, speculation, what might be, what could 
be, what should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want a government to make a decision and bring it to the 
House.  That is what it is about. Under the cabinet parliamentary 
style of government, we assume that we give responsibility to 
confidence of the House, of parliament to a government.  If the 
House does not like it, then it has every right to take that 
confidence away.  It can put a motion of non-confidence in the 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. friend pointed out earlier, there have been occasions 
when the opposition has done that.  The Reform Party did not do 
it in the last motion, but it had the opportunity to do it as it 
has done in economic matters and other matters.  That is the way 
parliament works.  Those are the fundamentals of parliament.  It 
is not to suggest that somewhere, someplace down the road, there 
may be a commitment and that we should therefore tie our hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the incredibly fluid situation that we are in, we are finding 
out that a decision one day may not be what we need the next day. 
Changes have to be made.  There has to be a flexibility of 
response. There has to be the capacity to make judgment calls 
because we are also working inside an alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not acting as a sole agent.  We are not in this by 
ourselves.  We are members of a broad alliance of a wide range of 
countries.  We are engaged on a number of fronts.  There is the 
military campaign and the incredible commitments to humanitarian 
assistance that we are making.  There is active diplomacy going 
on.  That requires the responsibility and capacity to be able to 
make those judgments, to be able to make those assessments, and 
to be able to try to respond to the circumstances as they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that any hon. member of the House would want to 
provide a handcuff on the capacity of the Government of Canada, 
representing Canadians, to make those judgment calls and to be 
able to respond, but to do so in the full recognition that 
parliament has a role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no other place in the world in which governments show 
up every day to be questioned by members of the opposition.  When 
we talk about accountability, where else would it take place as 
it does here every day?  President Clinton does not show up in 
Congress every day.  The British Prime Minister goes once every 
two weeks.  Our Prime Minister is in his seat every day to answer 
questions on where they come from and who provides them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the role of parliament, I suggest to members 
opposite that it is a vital role, a critical role, and a role 
that is being exercised very well by parliament.  Hon. members on 
both sides of the House are deeply engaged in this critical 
issue.  Whether it is through caucus meetings, their questions in 
the day, by showing up for briefing meetings or by making their 
commentaries known, parliament is engaged on behalf of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a serious mistake if we all of a sudden tried to put 
a restraint or limitation on what parliament can do, adapting day 
by day to the changing circumstances.  We have had the 
opportunity to debate the principles, the fundamental objectives 
that Canadians do not want to see a government repress its own 
people and deny them the dignity of their rights.  It is prepared 
to take action necessary through a broad based alliance to 
establish a new standard of human security which provides the 
sense that individuals in the world, someday, somewhere, will 
know that they can count upon the international community to 
protect their integrity as human beings and their rights as 
members of the human family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, before I proceed with my 
intervention, in recognition of the minister's appearance in the 
House this afternoon I wonder if we could seek unanimous consent 
to extend the period for questions and comments by 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if anybody from any other democracy, I might say any 
real democracy, were to read the motion, it would give him or her 
cause to pause and reflect that we would actually be debating in 
the House a motion calling upon the government to let us have 
votes on matters of grave national importance.  This is unheard 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have lived in countries where parliaments always operate this 
way, where the government puts forth legislation and it is 
immediately approved by all and sundry because that is the only 
choice they have.  I would really hope for something better in 
the Parliament of Canada. 
As I read this motion, what is being proposed is simply that this 
House have a voice—

if he wishes to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to use 
this opportunity to respond to my hon. colleague.  He asked what 
people in other democracies would think.  In the United Kingdom, 
the mother of the parliamentary system, there were no debates or 
votes; in Belgium, no debates and no votes; in France, no debates 
and no votes; in the Netherlands, two debates and no vote; and in 
the United States of America it is a decision made by the 
president. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the circumstances there is the Canadian record of coming 
to the House for debate which authorized the mandate to 
participate in the Kosovo mission; a debate which authorized, 
through the expression of views of members of the House, a 
peacekeeping implementation; and a debate last Monday night that 
went into all hours of the morning.  We had these briefings.  I 
think Canadians can stand proud.

<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the foreign 
affairs minister has mentioned countries where there has not 
been a vote. I could mention one where members voted twice, and 
that country is Germany, the peace plan sponsor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada could have shown leadership and put the matter to a vote 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members change sides in the House, they tend to forget 
certain things. I wonder if the minister will recall the 
following statement “As we now stand, in the present situation 
we are looking at very long-protracted sanctions in the gulf—which could 
take months. We are looking at a very major military build-up... and 
we are looking at a potential military option. 
We would like to get some assurance specifically from the 
government that we will not 
engage in any offensive action in this region unless there is a 
consent of parliament”. This is a quote from the current foreign affairs 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is what the parliamentary 
process is designed to do: to give parliament an opportunity to 
state its position and consensus in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that 100 members of this House have expressed their 
opinion, and that we have had a 26-hour debate and three briefing 
sessions for members. It is a great example of what I said 10 
years ago. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. minister mentioned that the only vote before was to endorse 
a UN resolution.  We would certainly welcome that.  At the risk 
of sounding like a broken record, I would ask the minister if he 
would use Canada's seat on the security council to formally 
present a uniting for peace resolution to get this matter before 
the General Assembly of the United Nations.  Then we might have 
something to vote on by way of endorsing that resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member and I 
have had some very good exchanges about this matter over the last 
week or so.  That is a demonstration of how parliament can work, 
of how members of the opposition can make their contributions and 
recommendations known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply point out to the hon. member that today the secretary 
general appointed a special representative.  He has been working 
assiduously to try to develop a resolution of the security 
council.  Why that?  It is because under the charter an article 7 
resolution does carry a broad mandate that will apply to all 
members.  If we can achieve that, and there is a lot of work 
going into it, it would clearly be the preferable option.  That 
is what we are backing right now.  That is why we are working so 
hard along with the secretary general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said to the hon. member, if it does not work then the kind 
of recommendation he is making should be actively considered. Let 
us give the best shot we have right now to help the secretary 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
foreign affairs minister for being in the House to listen to my 
speech. I know that he came straight from his office specially 
to listen to me. I am glad he did because I will remind him of 
some of his famous statements. I quoted one a few minutes ago 
but I will repeat it for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. members to identify who made the following 
statements. The first statement from the minister that I would 
like to quote was made on September 24, 1990: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we now stand in the present situation, we are looking at very 
long, protracted sanctions in the gulf which could take months— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was talking about the gulf war. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—We are looking at a very major military build-up ... We are 
looking at a potential military option. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And most importantly, this last comment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to get some assurance specifically from the 
government—the Progressive Conservatives were in office at the 
time—that we will not engage in any offensive action in this 
region unless there is a consent of Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the present minister stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same minister, who was in opposition at the time, also 
wanted—I will quote him, if I may, and he can say so if he 
disagrees—to propose an amendment to have the House reconvene 
earlier than it was supposed to after the Christmas break. He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a way in which parliament will be allowed to present 
itself as the forum for decision making, not the Cabinet, the 
ministers or the Prime Minister but the people of Canada, 
through their elected representatives. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present minister of Foreign Affairs introduced that motion 
on January 15 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, speaking of Canadians, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know that there are no decisions more crucial for a 
government than those concerning war and peace. 
It is up to each state to make its own decisions. They want to 
make sure these decisions are made by all Canadians and that 
this forum, the Parliament of Canada, is respected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The distinguished author of this quote is the current foreign 
affairs minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go on as the members opposite had some good ones. On 
January 15, 1991, they said, still concerning the Persian gulf 
war: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I maintain that the government does not, in the circumstances, 
have the moral authority to put this country into a war 
situation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the foreign affairs minister who said that, but the 
current Prime Minister of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still regarding members of this House, and chastizing the 
government for recalling the House too late, that is two days 
before the beginning of air strikes, and for asking the wrong 
questions, a Liberal member said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, just like the voters, I was entitled to being consulted 
on this fundamental question, which would have enabled all us to 
vote on the issue. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the current government House leader, a member with a lot 
of experience, who asked in 1991 for the right to vote on the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last quote concerns a Liberal amendment to the government 
motion. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This support shall not be interpreted as approval of the use of 
Canadian Forces for offensive action without further 
consultation with and approval by this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, can we get assurances from the minister in the 
spirit with which we have been approaching this to have 
Parliament consulted before any final decisions are made as to 
these plans relating to our forces in the gulf area? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a question asked by the current Minister of External 
Affairs on October 23, 1990, which was before the start of the 
conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is the Prime Minister, the Minister of External 
Affairs, the government House leader or other members who 
unanimously supported a report from the national defence and 
veterans affairs committee, they were all requesting, when they 
were in the opposition and even before the start of the 
conflict, that members be allowed to vote. How can we explain 
this about-face in the Liberals' position? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a lot of nonsense. I will quote a few of those 
comments. One of the last Liberal speakers before the Minister 
of External Affairs was saying “We will vote against the Bloc's 
motion because, for example, if we want to send a cook to Kosovo 
to prepare food for the soldiers sent there as peacekeepers, we 
will have to submit the question to a vote in the House”.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also said “We will vote against this motion because if CF-18 
pilots are killed, we will need a vote to send a rescuer to 
retrieve their bodies”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals said “We will vote against this motion from the 
Bloc because we have to act quickly to send ground troops to 
Kosovo to fight for us, without the proper training”. They might 
decide during the night that 1,000 soldiers will leave for 
Kosovo tomorrow morning at 5.15 a.m. Nobody will have been able 
to vote then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has not given any good reason to oppose 
the motion. 
It has not given any good reason that would invalidate the 
position taken by the Minister of External Affairs when he was 
in the opposition. It has not given any good reason that would 
invalidate what the present Prime Minister said when he was the 
Leader of the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can ask why the government absolutely refuses to vote for 
this motion. We were also told that no vote was ever taken in 
the House concerning the deployment of ground troops. However, 
we know that a vote was taken in the case of the gulf war, 
another during the 1970s and yet another during the 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned earlier a few countries where no vote was 
taken. I answered that votes have been taken in Germany, and 
that two votes have been taken in the Czech Republic to 
determine whether the country ought to get involved in such a 
conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A vote was taken this afternoon in the United States for the 
granting of several billion dollars to continue to defend the 
interests of Kosovars in this conflict. It is interesting to 
recall that a vote was held today in the United States 
concerning the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twice, last week and this week, we have asked the Minister of 
National Defence to say what the estimates are, what it would 
cost Canada, at this time, to take part in this conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time when the U.S. Congress is voting on a budget that 
could amount to $4 billion or $6 billion, the two answers that 
my colleague for Joliette got from the Minister of National 
Defence were the same “We do not know”. We asked how many planes 
have been kept in reserve. At present, we have 18 planes over 
there. How many do we have left, if NATO calls for more? We were 
given the following answer “We do not know”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are entitled to wonder about the apparent improvization by 
the Liberal government with respect to this conflict.  How much 
is it costing?  We do not know.  How many more planes can we 
send?  We do not know.  Are these state secrets?  Is it a secret 
for national defence not to know, not to disclose, a budget like 
this one?  That would be surprising, however, when at the same 
time the Clinton administration is voting on a budget for this 
same conflict, while the Minister of National Defence and the 
Prime Minister are telling us “It is a national secret, whether 
this will cost Canadians $40 million, $50 million, $100 million 
or $200 million”.  We ask these questions but we cannot get any 
answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition parties are unanimous, a rarity in the House, on 
the Bloc Quebecois motion concerning a vote in the House. This 
is one of the constructive and positive things the Bloc 
Quebecois has undertaken.  We asked— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> One of many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Yes, one of many.  There are others, 
including asking the Minister of Foreign Affairs to take 
advantage of Canada's position as chair of the security council 
to co-sponsor the peace plan presented by Germany.  The response 
we got was: “We do not know.  We will look into it.  We are 
waiting”.   Just like the answers on the aircraft and the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a speech, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois proposed that a 
conference of the European Union be held in order to define the 
future of small nations, those in the Balkans in particular. 
The Liberal side turned a deaf ear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Joliette ironically referred just now to the 
fact that, if we want to send a parliamentary mission of 5, 6 or 
7 MPs outside the country, to Geneva for instance, in order to 
discuss the future of the WTO, we need unanimous consent in 
order to free up a budget of $25,000, $30,000 or $40,000. 
That is a rule currently in force in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet if they want to send 2,000 or 3,000 soldiers to fight in 
Kosovo, there will be no vote in the House because parliament 
wants this to be decided by the PMO and the cabinet, while 9 
years ago we were told that was not the right way to make a 
decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a 
matter of fact, the hon. member for Repentigny has quoted the 
constitutional example of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not forget that, ever since the declaration of war on 
Japan, in 1941, the U.S. Congress has never used the rule set 
out in the U.S. constitution. Committing U.S. troops is always 
left to the president, to the executive branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way, Canadians have borrowed the British system inherited 
from the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Vancouver 
Quadra, a leading constitutional and international relations 
expert, is probably at least partly right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I can say that his colleague, the foreign affairs 
minister, when he was sitting on the opposition benches, did ask 
for a vote on the sending of troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, a vote has been held on this in the House. I was not 
referring to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, as late as last year or two years ago, Bob 
McNamara, a former adviser to John F. Kennedy, apologized for 
the tragic mistake of the Vietnam war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we want the Minister of Foreign Affairs or the Prime Minister 
to be in a position, after the conflict, of having to apologize 
to the Canadian people? We are asking that members of parliament 
be allowed to exercise their responsibilities and to vote in the 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a question 
for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he agree that, in our democracy, what the government is 
suggesting here is that we democrats not use the most powerful 
tool we have to express our democratic views, namely our right 
to vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying “You can talk all you want, we will 
allow that, we will organize debates. We will allow you to talk, 
but when the time comes to really say what you want to say, you 
will not be allowed to do it”. A parliamentarian expresses his 
or her point of view by using his or her vote. What the 
government is proposing is the opportunity to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree that the government is violating our 
most sacred right, the right to vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Joliette for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the Liberals' red book talked about restoring public 
confidence in the institution of parliament. One of the ways to 
achieve that is precisely to respect this historic right, the 
right to vote. It is difficult to understand why the Liberals 
want to violate such an important right as the right to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In every riding, there are voters who are fed up with politics. 
They often tell us “Canada is a dictatorship elected every four 
years. We vote for a prime minister and a parliament, but after 
that we have no decisions to make. Everything is decided by the 
prime minister and his cabinet”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately and ironically, with the example it is giving to 
Canadians, this government is proving these voters right. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
consent of parliament was requested by the former foreign 
affairs critic, now Minister of Foreign Affairs, as my colleague 
mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, any consent must first and foremost be an informed one. 
One must be well informed before one can give consent and, on 
matters of such importance as the deployment of troops abroad, 
in countries such as Kosovo or Yugoslavia, the consent must not 
be implicit.  It must be quite explicit, and it will be only if 
we vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague if he considers, in this case, 
that the consent to which the<B> </B>Minister of Foreign Affairs, the 
Minister of National Defence and even the Prime Minister refer 
is an informed consent, given that the meeting scheduled for 
tomorrow, where we were to be briefed on the situation in 
Kosovo, has been cancelled?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs has told us that 130 members have spoken on the 
issue of Kosovo.  I do not believe that constitutes explicit 
consent on the part of members of parliament.  The consent must 
take the form of a well informed vote, taken after meetings with 
the main stakeholders, that is the Minister of National Defence 
and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often, they announce at the last minute that a briefing has 
been postponed or cancelled and, as my colleague from 
Beauharnois—Salaberry said earlier, now these briefings will last 
only 30 minutes. With all the small talk, we will not even have 
time to ask questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I speak in 
this House, NATO planes are carrying out air strikes against 
Serbian military targets in Yugoslavia and Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the international level, diplomats from around the world are 
trying to find a negotiated solution to Serbian attacks on 
Kosovo's Albanians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In neighbouring countries, the staff of non governmental 
humanitarian assistance organizations are doing everything they 
can to facilitate the arrival of hundreds of thousands of 
refugees, whose numbers have been rising since the beginning of 
this crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, however, no one can or wants to tell us whether or not the 
Canadian armed forces are getting ready to send ground troops to 
the Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this afternoon, the Minister of National Defence 
refused to indicate if senior officers were planning Canada's 
involvement in ground operations. These statements were not made 
a week ago. They were made today in answer to questions put by 
opposition members to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today, during question period, the Minister of National 
Defence said and I quote “The only thing I can confirm is the 
breakdown of Canadian troops already in the Balkans.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a minister refuses to provide clear answers to questions 
put by the opposition and uses carefully phrased statements—and 
that is a rather strong word—such as “the only thing I can tell 
you is”, one has to wonder if the government is not about to 
make a far reaching decision behind closed doors, without 
consulting parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly what we want to avoid in this motion. The motion 
is clear. It says, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House demand that the government submit to a debate 
and a vote in the House the sending of Canadian soldiers to the 
Balkans who may be involved in military or 
peacekeeping operations on the ground in Kosovo 
and the Balkan region. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is simple: we want such a decision, which may put the 
lives of fellow citizens at risk, to be taken in a transparent 
and democratic manner. Because the government has so far refused 
to commit itself to holding a vote before sending ground troops 
to the Balkans, we have no choice but to bring forward this 
motion, which asks this formally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is astounding that we have had to go this far something that 
just makes sense. A few people cannot decide alone to send 
Canadian ground troops to take part in a conflict that could 
still last for months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that parliament must have a say in the Canadian policy 
regarding Kosovo. So far, the opposition parties supported the 
government's decisions in favour of air strikes against the 
Serbian aggressors in Kosovo, but that does not mean—

</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that before I found my way back to the House there 
was a request to extend the sitting by approximately five minutes 
to allow the last spokesperson to complete his or her remarks. I 
know that unanimous consent was sought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if there might be a willingness on behalf of the Chair 
to ask one more time for that unanimous consent with the 
condition of course that there be no question or comment period 
following that five minute conclusion of the debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to 
continue the debate for five minutes to permit the hon. member 
for Rosemont to complete his remarks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> But there will be no questions or comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I also thank my colleagues in 
the House for allowing me to speak to this important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision to involve ground troops can be heavy with 
consequence, and I think we must also not ignore the fact that 
it could well lead to loss of life.  There is no doubt that 
parliament must be much better informed than it is at the moment 
before it makes a decision.  A true debate must be held before 
parliamentarians can make an enlightened decision on such a 
serious matter.  Then this debate must necessarily be sanctioned 
by a vote, which will give the government a clear mandate on the 
relevance of sending ground troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois is 
not to take a stand on a possible military engagement on the 
ground in Kosovo, but rather to force the government to have a 
debate and a vote on this issue in the House should this 
possibility arise. To avoid thinking about it right now would 
just postpone a problem we will have to face sooner or later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear to us that the government cannot claim to have firm 
democratic approval if it does not have a vote on this issue in 
the House of Commons. Moreover, without a vote, the position of 
the various parties carries no real weight. All day, government 
members avoided taking a stand on this issue claiming it is only 
a hypothetical question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I want to say that, as the situation progresses, 
the chances of a ground intervention becoming necessary are 
increasing constantly. 
Also, even though it is just a hypothetical question, nothing 
prevents the government from making a commitment today to 
consult parliamentarians before sending in ground troops. In 
fact, to us, it is impossible to justify the government's 
current position, which is simply undemocratic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the government is probably worried that some members 
or some parties may express their opposition to the deployment 
of ground troops, which would be perceived as dissension and 
would send the wrong message to the Yugoslav leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, by acting the way it is acting now, that is by keeping 
information from the House of Commons and by refusing to let it 
play an important role, the government forces members and 
parties to be more and more critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, in fact, members of the House are not informed of diplomatic 
or military initiatives and if the reasons for decisions made by 
NATO or the Canadian government are not explained and discussed 
in the House, this cast doubts in the Bloc members' minds as to 
the appropriateness of these decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the government to refuse a vote for misleading reasons would 
send a negative signal to all members of parliament. That would 
be denying the House the possibility to play its role and would 
jeopardize the present consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should not be afraid of having a real debate and 
of answering certain critical questions. It would be stupid to 
act as though 100% of Quebeckers and Canadians agreed with 
Canadian participation in the present NATO operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it is important to stress the fact that many Canadians 
are concerned and critical of the situation. The government must 
be accountable to them. Taking a serious decision without the 
consent of parliament would amount to a denial of our democratic 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that our riding offices receive many 
calls from citizens asking questions. They want their elected 
representatives to debate the question. They also want their 
member of parliament to represent them well and, for that, there 
obviously must be a democratic vote.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Halifax <I>Herald</I> ran a cartoon in February 1999 of a T-shirt 
with a slogan “I survived Buchenwald and all I got was this 
lousy T-shirt”.  The caption below refers to the latest efforts 
from veterans affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the experience of 26 prisoners of war is certainly no 
laughing matter, their treatment by this callous Liberal 
government is a joke. On February 12, 1999 I asked the Minister 
of Veterans Affairs to offer these survivors of Buchenwald 
concentration camp a just and honest settlement.  I pointed out 
to the minister at that time that the compensation paid by this 
government of barely over $1,000 each was an insult in itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pathetic inability of this government to succeed where 
others have failed in securing just reparations from the German 
government is a testament to this government's misplaced 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister had the gall to respond that these survivors were 
delighted.  Then he seemed to contradict himself with the next 
statement, saying that the Canadian government had raised it 
again with the German chancellor.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A constituent of mine who survived the horrors of the Buchenwald 
concentration camp sent the cheque back to the Liberal government 
with the word “refused” across the insulting payoff of $1,098. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments of Australia and New Zealand reached a 
satisfactory settlement with their veterans who faced similar 
horrors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These veterans were interned in the Nazi Buchenwald 
concentration camp instead of a prisoner of war camp where they 
should have been sent under the Geneva convention.  Other 
governments have had the the ability to convince the German 
government to provide an appropriate reparation. Our government 
has failed itself and failed these brave Canadians miserably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand the inability of the government to secure a 
just settlement for these Canadians.  Is it a matter of 
incompetence or simply that the government cares little for the 
plight of a small handful of 26 veterans? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of the United States recently arrived at an 
enviable settlement with Germany for United States veterans in a 
similar position to our veterans.  In his letter to the Minister 
of Veterans Affairs, my constituent William R. Gibson expressed 
the following sentiments: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hopeful that the Government of Canada can still come up with 
a just and honourable settlement.  You may be interested to see 
that the American government has negotiated a settlement with 
Germany for its veterans ranging in benefits from $10,000 to 
$200,000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps even more insulting than the cheque to these Canadians 
from the government were the words of the Minister of Veterans 
Affairs in his accompanying letter.  He said: “I am delighted to 
be able to close the chapter on this longstanding issue”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Delighted indeed.  It is now over eight years since the plight 
of these veterans was discussed in the January 1991 report of the 
subcommittee on veterans affairs entitled “It's Almost Too 
Late”.  Over eight years later I should say that it is almost 
too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue was raised again in committee in August 1994 and in 
letters to the ministers of veterans affairs, defence and foreign 
affairs in 1997.  I have raised this issue time after time for 
over a year now and the government still admits defeat where 
other governments have succeeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A letter from the office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs to 
my office admits failure with these words “Canada has embarked 
on several démarches requesting prisoner of war compensation from 
Germany, but we have had no success”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I attempted to get to the root of the matter in the 
interest of these veterans, I was told that the Liberal 
government abjectly refused to make public its correspondence 
with Germany on this issue.  Why is the government afraid of 
exposing its ineptitude where others have succeeded? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government should take this opportunity right now to 
do the honourable thing and agree before the House and all 
Canadians that it will immediately begin to negotiate a just 
settlement with these veterans and commit to succeed in 
finalizing appropriate negotiations with the German government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans 
Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am astonished that the hon. 
member for Halifax West wishes to condemn the government's action 
on behalf of Canadian veterans held at the Buchenwald 
concentration camp. Let us get the facts on the table right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some countries, Australia and New Zealand in particular, opted 
in the 1980s to make a one time payment of $10,000 and $13,000 
respectively to their Buchenwald veterans. Canada had already 
chosen a different path in the mid-1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We opted for the payment of monthly compensation for life with a 
continuing benefit for the veteran's surviving spouse.  Those 
indexed payments are equivalent to a minimum of $45,000 in 
today's dollars for each veteran with at least 89 days of 
captivity. Compensation payments, as in the case with all 
veterans benefits, are not subject to income tax.  If the veteran 
incurred any disability as a consequence of the imprisonment, 
that is separately compensated for through disability pension 
awards which again are tax free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the compensation payment announced on December 11, 
that arose because attempts in the 1980s and 1990s to gain 
compensation from the German government did not succeed.  The 
Government of Canada therefore decided that these veterans had 
waited long enough and decided to pay compensation on exactly the 
same basis as was awarded to the Hong Kong prisoners of war, 
namely $18 per day of captivity in Buchenwald, although the 
payments to our Buchenwald vets were considerably less than the 
payments to our Hong Kong veterans who suffered three and a half 
years of unspeakable captivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A final point is the Minister of Foreign Affairs made it clear 
on December 11 that the government payment of compensation to the 
Buchenwald veterans did not close the door for further 
representation on their behalf to the German government.  Those 
representations were made by the Prime Minister personally to the 
new chancellor of Germany.  The chancellor agreed to look into 
the question and the Department of Foreign Affairs has been 
following up on that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, everything has been done that there is to be done 
right here.  I think the hon. member should acknowledge that.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>THE BUDGET 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on February 
17, 1999, I asked the following question in the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, this budget confirms the Minister of Finance's 
continuing dependency on the EI fund. He is using the surplus in 
the EI fund to fill his coffers and line the pockets of 
millionaires. 
While the minister is paying off his debt on the backs of the 
unemployed, there is nothing in his budget for those who do not 
qualify for employment insurance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put the question to the Minister of Finance and the Minister 
of Human Resources Development was the one who answered.  I 
asked what was the amount of the surplus in the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister told me it was $4.9 billion.  He went on to add: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am amazed that, on the opposition side, they keep 
pushing a pitiful and simplistic solution as the best way to 
help the unemployed, and that is to keep them on EI as much and 
as long as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side want to give the unemployed hope, a global 
strategy that will enable them to join the workforce. Unlike 
members on the other side, we want to give them hope, not 
dependency. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to dependency, it is the Minister of Finance who 
is dependent on employment insurance.  Workers who have lost 
their jobs can no longer rely on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Liberal member for Fredericton was reported in <I>Time 
Transcript</I> as saying  “We want him to be generous with the EI 
system”.  The Liberal members said that, after April 12, they 
would meet with the minister to tell him how badly the EI 
program was hurting Canadian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know it hurts and they are even discussing the issue, but 
they are not ready to discuss with members of the opposition and 
try to find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the bishop of Moncton said last week in <I>L'Acadie nouvelle</I> 
that the so-called black hole could not be allowed any longer in 
southeastern New Brunswick. Across the country, everyone knows 
that changes to employment insurance have hurt people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly give an example. I got a call from a voter in my 
riding who was part of the Atlantic groundfish strategy. He had 
accumulated more than 850 hours. He made an application for 
employment insurance because representatives of the groundfish 
strategy had told him he was eligible for employment insurance 
benefits. He was told that, no, he was not, and that he would 
have to go back on the groundfish strategy. 
He appealed the decision, but he lost his appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he returned to the groundfish strategy, he was accepted. 
Later, he made another application for employment insurance 
benefits with the number of hours supposedly needed, and was 
told that there had been a mistake the first time and that he 
would receive employment insurance benefits. So he received his 
money, plus the benefits of the groundfish strategy. But he had 
also worked a certain number of hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He found himself in another income bracket, so he now owes 
Revenue Canada more money than usual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He tried to have the problem settled at Revenue Canada, but he 
never succeeded. He was not able to obtain a solution from Human 
Resources Development Canada nor from anybody else. The system 
no longer works.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the money of 
which the member speaks belongs to Canadians.  Canadians expect 
us to make intelligent choices in deciding how to spend their 
money effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working to help the unemployed, but we are also committed 
to investing in health care, skills and higher education, job 
creation and helping young families through such measures as the 
Canada child tax benefit and changes to the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well as spending wisely, Canadians want us to report clearly 
on how their money is being handled.  That is why EI funds are 
tracked openly in a separate column in the government's books, 
just as the auditor general recommended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the EI program covers most people who recently lost their 
jobs or quit with just cause, there are also many unemployed 
people looking for their first job or those who have been out of 
work or out of the labour force for a long time. 
For these Canadians EI is supported by a number of other programs 
to help them get a job.  For example, there is $2.1 billion for 
those who need help re-entering the workforce; $155 million to 
help youth obtain experience; $110 million every year in 
communities with high unemployment; and $430 million a year with 
the provinces to help Canadians with disabilities find work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The careful management of public funds is important, but getting 
the government's books balanced is just the starting point.  Our 
goal is to help Canadians achieve secure futures through good 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must remind my hon. friend that unemployment is at an eight 
year low, at 7.8%, and that the deficit has been eliminated.  I 
hope most Canadians will say that we are going in the right 
direction.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>THE ECONOMY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the federal 
Liberal government continues to be the number one obstacle to 
growth in this country.  Today we were reading about the latest 
evidence of Canada's weakening economy.  According to an internal 
federal report, hikes in personal incomes taxes have contributed 
to a significant decline in the after tax income of Canadians. 
Stagnant family incomes, a poor middle class and rising poverty 
were identified as the consequences of Canada's high tax policy. 
In short, the report concluded that Canadians on average have 
become poorer in the 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the lesser told stories is the negative impact on the 
economy brought about by the Liberal government's cost recovery 
program.  There is nothing wrong with a cost recovery program 
based on reasonable fees, increased efficiency and smarter 
performance, but credible evidence suggests that the present 
program is the Liberal government's latest attack on the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent report prepared by the Business Coalition for Cost 
Recovery, which represents small, medium and large size firms 
that employ 2.2 million people and contribute $330 billion to the 
national economy, detailed the devastating impact the federal 
cost recovery program has had since 1994.  Canada's manufacturers 
have been subject to a massive 153% increase in regulatory fees. 
User fees charged through cost recovery are among the fastest 
growing costs of doing business in Canada.  The $1.6 billion in 
regulatory fees charged to businesses in the 1996-97 fiscal year 
cut Canada's GDP by at least $1.3 billion and cost at least 
23,000 Canadian jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost recovery fees, as currently structured, are undermining 
the productivity and international competitiveness of Canadian 
businesses.  For of all the problems caused by cost recovery the 
government is only gaining 20 cents in revenue for every dollar 
in fees charged to businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have noted on numerous occasions in the House in recent 
months, if the Liberals were truly concerned about productivity 
and increased business investment they would have used this 
budget to place an immediate moratorium on new or increased 
regulatory fees until a complete overhaul of the cost recovery 
program were complete.  Instead they chose this complicated and 
inconsistent cost recovery structure that unduly interferes with 
the very private sector we need to grow for a stronger economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These regulations and fees comprise a hidden form of taxation 
and their excesses need to be curbed to guarantee sustained 
growth for Canada's economy.  I challenge this government to 
start addressing the root causes of low productivity such as the 
heavy regulatory burden of the federal cost recovery program. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this 
opportunity to respond to the hon. member's question concerning 
productivity.  The available evidence shows that Canadians can 
improve their productivity performance relative to other major 
trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improving our productivity performance matters because the more 
efficiently we can combine our resources to produce goods and 
services, the more easily Canadians can use some of those 
resources in other areas of endeavour they believe are important 
to improve their standard of living, including health, education 
and the environment.  For this reason the government is committed 
to building a stronger, more innovative and more productive 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 1999 underlined this commitment by continuing to build 
the fiscal base for long term growth.  It also provides for 
substantive new investments undertaken in partnership with the 
private sector in the creation, dissemination and 
commercialization of knowledge.  Just a few examples of these 
investments are:  $200 million for the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation to build research infrastructure; $60 million over 
three years to establish smart community demonstration projects 
that will broaden access to the information highway; and $90 
million over three years for the networks of centres of 
excellence to support partnerships among world class researchers 
in the private sector.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These and other investments will help improve foreign activity 
and ultimately our standard of living.  They are vital at this 
time, but they are not the complete answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together we must tackle the multifaceted elements of the 
productivity challenge, such as strong business investment, 
research and development performance, the commercialization of 
innovation and encouraging higher levels of training in areas 
appropriate for the demands of the new knowledge based economy, 
and improving our trade performance.  We must work together on 
productivity in the House, in the committees and in our 
constituencies.

<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to condemn an injustice with respect to the former BC Mine 
workers of Black Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the BC asbestos mine was closed, on November 1, 1997, 300 
workers lost their jobs. Two thirds of them were over 52 years 
of age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development reacted very timidly 
to support Quebec asbestos miners with only $4 million, whereas 
the same minister finds considerable amounts for the miners from 
Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Minister of Human Resources Development, the 
Minister of National Defence answered this to the question I 
asked on this issue on March 19, 1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case a workforce adjustment package of $111 million will 
be provided to workers with fair severance and early retirement 
packages. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the generous $111 million compensation package I just 
mentioned, $148 million will be added by two other departments, 
apparently to accelerate Cape Breton's economic expansion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I condemn this double standard. The people in Black Lake feel 
the Minister of Human Resources Development is treating them 
unfairly. 
The Thetford Mines region feels unfairly treated by the Liberal 
government of Canada. Quebec is not getting its fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the $111 million have been added $68 million from economic 
development and $80 million from the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, for a total of $259 million to the miners 
of Nova Scotia, while hardly $4 million has been provided for 
the people of Black Lake, in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the fairness of this Liberal government. Four million 
dollars for Quebec, and $259 million for Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Minister of Human Resources Development to correct 
this injustice by reopening the file on the BC Mine workers. 
Everyone in Canada must be fairly treated. Why $259 million for 
coal miners in Nova Scotia and only $4 million for asbestos 
workers at the BC Mine in Black Lake? There is the injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, in response to a question from the hon. member for 
Acadie—Bathurst, said earlier that the surplus from the 
employment insurance fund, which exceeds $20 billion, belongs to 
everyone, and not only to millionaires. If this money belongs to 
everyone, a good share of the $20 billion should be given back 
to the BC Mine workers. That is—

government shares the hon. member's concern for the workers 
affected by the closure of the British Canadian mine operation at 
Black Lake, Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He compares the situation of the BC mine workers to that of the 
Phalen mine workers in Nova Scotia.  While the workers in these 
two cases faced different circumstances, the government treated 
both groups with equal fairness and equal consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain the measures we have undertaken to help the 300 
BC mine workers in Quebec.  We reacted quickly and, in total, 
provided some $4 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As early as September 1997, close to $3 million was set aside to 
help the 300 workers quickly re-enter the labour market and this 
help is showing some signs of success:  nearly 70 workers have 
found work; nearly 60 are pursuing training and skills 
development to help them find different work; and half a dozen 
are trying to establish their own businesses.  We know these 
people want to work and we hope our assistance will continue to 
help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in June 1998 the government also announced $1 
million in funding intended to help workers between the ages of 
55 and 64.  The Government of Quebec gave its approval to move 
forward and put this program in place for older workers from the 
BC mine last fall.

Emploi-Québec and federal officials to exchange information and 
accept applications.

early retirement benefits, cost shared by the two governments, in

support to all Canadian workers through programs to help them 
participate fully in the Canadian labour market.
