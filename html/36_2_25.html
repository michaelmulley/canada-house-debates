<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>REGULATORY BUDGET 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the 
government should implement a “Regulatory Budget”, parallel to 
the traditional spending budget, which would detail estimates of 
the total cost of each individual regulation including the 
government enforcement costs as well as the cost of compliance to 
individual citizens and businesses; and include a risk/benefit 
analysis of each regulation, to enable cost/benefit analysis of 
regulation by parliamentarians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise today to 
debate my private member's Motion No. 207 concerning the 
introduction of a regulatory budget which would achieve a great 
deal in a number of realms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there has been a secular decline in the role of the 
member of parliament over the past 30 years and a reduction in 
the meaningful role that private members play in conducting and 
legislating those things that are really important to Canadians. 
This regulatory budget would go a long way toward restoring some 
of the traditional authority which members of parliament had back 
in the days when the estimates were debated on the floor of the 
House of Commons and before the days when there was such 
tremendous control and concentration of power, in particular in 
the PMO and to a certain extent within the cabinet.  This would 
help reverse a certain amount of that.  It would also 
redistribute power that is currently with the bureaucracy and put 
more of that power in the hands of elected representatives.  That 
would achieve a great good on behalf of Canadians, Canadian 
parliamentary systems and democracy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two ways the government can change the way Canadians 
do things.  For instance, if a bureaucrat determines that it is 
in the public interest to have a lawn sprinkler on every lawn in 
Canada, there are two ways the bureaucrat can achieve that.  One 
way is to whisper in the ear of a cabinet minister that this is a 
good thing and that the government should buy those lawn 
sprinklers and distribute them to Canadians, which would entail a 
tax.  Of course, the government would increase taxes, buy the 
lawn sprinklers and distribute them to Canadians to put on their 
lawns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second way, which is far less transparent and more 
concealed, would be for the government to introduce a regulation 
which would force all Canadians to buy lawn sprinklers with their 
own money and put them on their lawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the difference?  The only difference is that of 
transparency and accountability, because effectively the same 
result is achieved with either alternative.  Canadians are forced 
to sacrifice some of their scarce resources in the interest of a 
public good which is somehow determined by the bureaucracy. 
Somehow it is determined by big government and by this nanny 
government state that something is in the interests of Canadians 
and the government has made a decision that this will be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a bureaucrat believes it is in the public interest that a 
certain end be achieved, there needs to be transparency and 
accountability in parliament prior to that change being effected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effectively what would occur with a regulatory budget would be 
that each new regulation introduced by a bureaucrat, before it 
was actually implemented, would have to pass once a year through 
a regulatory budget in the Chamber.  We would be debating the 
efficacy or importance of each regulation in the House of Commons 
in the same way that we debate provisions within the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A regulation is virtually the same as a tax.  While we debate 
tax issues in the House all the time, we rarely debate the 
regulatory burden that is playing such a significant role in 
Canada and to a considerable extent is reducing the efficiency 
and competitiveness of Canadian business and individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some examples.  Between 1973 and 1996 federal 
government regulations grew significantly.  In fact we have seen 
in recent years, during the 1990s, 650 to 1,000 new regulations 
introduced every year, requiring 4,000 to 5,000 pages of detailed 
explanation.  Furthermore, in the past 20 years there have been 
over 100,000 new federal and provincial regulations passed.  The 
average, combining federal and provincial, has been about 4,000 
new regulations per year in the past 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the number of regulations continues to expand, so do the 
costs of designing, implementing and administering these 
regulations. The expenditures on federal regulations over the 
past 20 years have grown in real dollar terms from $2 billion to 
$2.5 billion, an increase of 26%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do these regulations mean to consumers? 
It is very important to recognize that there are three costs with 
every regulation.  The first two costs, which are borne by the 
government, are the implementation costs and the enforcement 
costs.  The third cost, the largest cost, which is borne by 
consumers, is the cost of compliance.  These regulations for 
consumers have cost the average Canadian family about $11,000 per 
year, federal and provincial regulations combined.  That has been 
an increase in real terms from about $10,000 20 years ago.  Total 
compliance costs to the private sector have increased from $58 
billion in 1974 to about $84 billion in 1995-96.  That increase 
has a significant impact, in particular on small business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies suggest that escalating regulatory costs are responsible 
in part for our lagging productivity growth in Canada relative to 
the U.S. and other OECD countries.  The 1994 small business 
working committee set up by the federal government shared these 
thoughts:  “Too many regulations are developed and administered 
with little consideration given to the impact on the 
competitiveness of small business.  Government must regulate 
less, simplify paperwork, limit information requirements and get 
out of the way so that small businesses can focus on creating 
wealth and jobs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, Ottawa has abandoned its attempt to make 
compliance requirements more efficient for business.  In their 
first term the Liberals introduced legislation aimed at allowing 
companies to propose more cost effective ways of complying with 
regulatory requirements.  However, this legislation was redrafted 
and ultimately scrapped.  It is now necessary to revisit some of 
these initiatives.  We must find ways to encourage more 
innovative market driven responses to the issue of compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. is having a similar experience relative to regulations. 
The cost of complying with American federal regulations has risen 
to 47% of the federal budget, up from 40% in 1988.  There has 
been an increase in the regulatory burden, both in the U.S. and 
Canada, with our other trading partners.  It is important that we 
also look at the examples of Japan and European countries in the 
EU which are also moving to reform regulatory burden issues 
within their countries.  It is important to view what is being 
done in other countries with respect to tax issues, social 
investment issues and regulatory issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a very competitive global environment and we cannot 
afford to sit still in Canada while other countries adopt more 
innovative approaches to some of these very important 
competitiveness issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of costing regulations, taking those three costs that 
I mentioned earlier, the two government borne costs and the 
private sector compliance cost, and combining them with the 
actual benefit of those regulations would provide 
parliamentarians with an ability to actually debate in the 
Chamber the importance or the efficacy of individual regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefit of a regulation could be provided through a 
risk/benefit analysis, the methodology for which is very 
sophisticated and exists within insurance companies and 
underwriting agencies.  We could use that type of methodology to 
determine the actual benefits of a regulation in order to compare 
the benefits to the costs of implementing that regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to realize that there would be cases with a 
regulatory budget where the costs of implementation and 
enforcement would exceed the numeric value number of the benefit, 
but we would still pass that regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example, which is not a federal regulation.  Some 
provinces and municipalities have bicycle helmet laws.  How could 
we put a price on the prevention of a head injury to a child?  It 
would be very difficult to quantify that kind of benefit.  There 
would be a political will and the recognition of a social good to 
passing that regulation, even though the numbers may not add up.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asked questions relative to environmental issues. 
Some would say that it is difficult to quantify the benefits of 
environmental policy.  I would argue to the contrary, that any 
economic policy which ignores environmental impact is bad 
economic policy.  We should be taking into account environmental 
costs with every piece of regulation.  If we fail to do so, the 
economics simply will not work because we will fail to 
internalize the externalities and to take into account the real 
cost to individuals, both consumers and non-consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things can be taken into account.  The bottom line is 
that elected members of the House would have the power to pass or 
to vote against individual regulations as part of this budget. 
This would lead to greater diligence in the bureaucracy in 
introducing regulations, greater scrutiny both by the bureaucracy 
and within the elected Chamber of these regulations, and 
ultimately a more effective and efficient regulatory burden which 
would provide greater benefit to Canadians and wreak less havoc 
with Canadian enterprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I received a letter from the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business.  I will read some excerpts from it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous surveys of our members carried out over the years have 
consistently identified government red tape as a major problem 
for small and medium size businesses. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent survey of the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business found that 60% of over 10,000 respondents identified 
government regulations and paper burden as serious issues for 
their businesses.  Government regulations and paper burden were 
ranked as the second most important issues behind the total tax 
burden and just ahead of employment insurance and government debt 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When asked to identify what government priorities should improve 
their productivity, 44% of respondents identified easing 
burdensome government regulations.  The survey also found that 
one out of four respondents said that government fees and 
penalties needed to be made more equitable.  Both responses were 
ranked in the top five actions the government should take to 
improve small business productivity.  They were directly behind 
payroll, income taxes and paying down the federal debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paper burden and regulations that are present at the federal, 
provincial and municipal levels saps productivity and wastes 
valuable time and money, not only for small and medium size 
businesses but also for the taxpayer and for government.  A past 
survey carried out by the CFIB found that 40% of Ontario small 
business owners spend more than six hours per week simply filling 
out forms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of red tape to the Canadian economy is staggering, 
costing tens of billions of dollars annually.  Some provinces 
have already taken steps to reduce red tape with the full support 
and active involvement of the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business.  In 1995 the Ontario government set up the red tape 
commission which has so far removed or amended more than 1,300 
regulations.  More recently the Ontario government announced its 
intention to set up a permanent red tape watchdog that will 
subject all new regulations to a strict business impact test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This summer the New Brunswick government announced that it was 
setting up a red tape review committee to eliminate regulations 
that are a barrier to economic growth and job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Garth White, senior vice-president of national affairs for the 
CFIB, said in his correspondence to me that the CFIB applauded 
our initiative and urged the federal government to take swift 
action to cut unnecessary regulations and red tape which hamper 
productivity and competitiveness and kills badly needed jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the support of the small business community in this 
regard.  If Canadians were aware of this initiative we would have 
the support of the majority of Canadians who understand quite 
clearly that a regulation is nothing more than a tax.  As such we 
should be debating in the Chamber the importance and 
effectiveness of individual regulations.  I look forward to the 
comments of my hon. colleagues on this important issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise today to 
speak to the motion introduced by the hon. member concerning the 
important matter of regulations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1120

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion actually touches on two key issues.  The first issue 
concerns the role of parliamentarians in assessing regulations 
and making sound judgements as to their value and benefit.  The 
second issue is equally significant.  It involves the 
appropriateness and effectiveness of the existing regulatory 
governance regime within the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his motion the hon. member calls for the establishment of a 
regulatory budget.  In essence this would involve the tabling of 
detailed cost estimates identifying the total cost of each 
proposed regulation.  Such costs would encompass the government's 
enforcement costs in addition to those incurred by individual 
citizens and businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion further calls for the submission of a cost benefit 
analysis pertaining to each regulation.  The intent of this 
information would be to enable parliamentarians to assess the 
benefits in light of a realistic understanding of the costs. 
However, it is unclear what purpose the proposals would serve or 
at what stage in the regulatory process such a budget would be 
considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a system of government based on the rule of law, the laws and 
regulations created pursuant to its authority to give structure 
to society have a far reaching and profound impact on the daily 
lives of citizens.  A well governed society must have both laws 
and regulations in order to provide the essential framework 
within which individuals, companies, organizations and 
governments can function both fairly and efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament's legislative power is exercised through passing 
statutes which explicitly set out the authority to make decisions 
by regulation delegated to the government.  Regulations can be 
made only to the extent authorized by parliament in the enabling 
legislation.  They represent the specifics, the details through 
which the spirit of the law can be applied in practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In approving laws parliament also makes provisions in them for 
making regulations where they are needed to carry out the 
purposes of the laws and how such regulation making power should 
be delegated.  However, once a law is passed with delegated 
authority it is the responsibility of the government of the day 
to make every effort to ensure that supporting regulations are 
not unduly burdensome or costly, that Canadians as individuals 
and as a society are better not worse off as a result, and that 
Canadians have a say in these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be recognized that not every individual, every group or 
other interest in society can be expected to agree as to the 
definition of what better or worse off may mean.  In seeking to 
protect Canadians health, safety or the environment, regulations 
may be developed that some groups or businesses may find 
burdensome. Such are the trade-offs with which governments must 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the motion before the House today the first issue 
to which I referred a few minutes ago was that of parliamentary 
review and oversight.  In the motion the hon. member appears to 
be seeking the establishment of a mechanism to ensure that 
regulations do not deviate in practice from the intent of the 
laws they were created to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion seeks to create a new mechanism where 
an effective alternative already exists.  Regulations flow from 
the laws passed by parliament and cannot be inconsistent with 
those laws.  Regulations are by definition limited by 
parliamentary role that grants or denies approval for the legal 
foundation upon which they rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What then of the issue of the cost benefit analysis called for 
in the motion?  Without question regulations impose costs.  To 
the greatest degree possible it is important that such costs be 
known and minimized at the time regulations are first enacted. 
However we must also keep in mind the benefits of a specific 
regulation before it is actually applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, instruments such as those made under the Canada 
Business Corporations Act help companies to create wealth and 
jobs and to take risks by establishing the concept of limited 
liability.  We have bankruptcy regulations which are essential in 
enabling companies, both large and small, to obtain credit on 
reasonable terms and exercise the right to repossess goods.  Such 
instruments make it possible for a measure of order and control 
to be applied to the bankruptcy process as well as to the entire 
process of credit granting and business financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me use other examples.  Regulating that there must be 
seatbelts or adequate anchors for baby seats in motor vehicles, 
regulating some emergency or safety features in our airports, or 
regulating to protect the health of Canadians through careful 
drug approval imposes costs which can generally be well 
documented and quantified.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would deny that these regulations also bring significant 
benefits to our society and our citizens?  The fact is that it is 
often much easier to identify anticipated costs associated with 
regulations than the benefits they may eventually provide.  This 
suggests that the remedy being proposed by the hon. member to 
allow for a cost benefit assessment would be very difficult to 
achieve or have experts agree on.  The point is that the benefits 
are undeniable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulatory budget idea proposed by the hon. member 
represents a very rigid approach which would do more harm than 
good.  It could result in a cap being placed on a number of new 
regulations passed, thus depriving Canadians of significant 
additional benefits in such areas as health, safety and 
environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the second key issue relating to the hon. 
member's motion.  I am referring to the capacity of existing 
federal regulatory law and procedures to serve the best interest 
of Canadians.  All regulations approved by the federal government 
must meet the federal regulatory policy requirement calling for 
consultations involving all relevant stakeholders.  An example of 
this consultation process would be active participation by 
industry in the 1996 regulatory review.  This review resulted in 
almost 1,000 modifications to or revocations of regulatory 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough this comprehensive review of our stock of 
regulations, undertaken with the active participation of 
industry, still left some 2,000 regulations in the books, another 
evidence of industry agreeing that regulations do bring benefits 
to industry as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulatory approval process is rigorous.  In developing 
regulations the government considers what burdens may be created 
by a proposed regulatory change as well as the corresponding 
social and other potential benefits.  The government also 
examines the results of consultations by officials, noting who 
was consulted, what views were expressed and what reasons have 
been presented as to why dissenting views could not be 
accommodated by the sponsoring department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government analyses alternative regulatory solutions to 
ensure that the most effective and efficient is chosen, and it 
assesses compliance and enforcement issues.  All this information 
is presented to the public for comment in the regulatory impact 
analysis statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulatory policy also helps ensure that proposed 
regulations or changes do not result in adverse impact on the 
economy's capacity to generate wealth and employment.  Final 
decisions on regulations are made by a committee of cabinet 
ministers.  Cabinet as a whole is responsible to parliament and 
therefore to the public for the application of regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to a regulatory government 
that demonstrates balance, fairness, transparency and 
accountability.  While the government does not accept the 
proposition that the action proposed by the hon. member is 
necessary, it does recognize the need to remain vigilant in 
ensuring that our regulatory regime is the best we can make it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to work toward this goal.  We will continue to 
devote our energies to ensuring that the best possible regulatory 
decisions are being made in serving the interest of the people of 
Canada and in conformity with the legislative authority conferred 
by parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to speak to the Motion No. 207 brought forward by the Tory 
member of parliament for Kings—Hants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like so many other ideas of the fifth place party, when we strip 
away the veneer we are left with another Red Tory irresponsible 
socialist nightmare.  About the only positive thing I can say 
about the motion is that it is not votable, so we will not be 
wasting three hours of parliament's time debating it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if it had been deemed votable, I would have voted 
against it and encouraged fellow MPs to do the same.  I say this 
not so much for what the motion attempts to accomplish but for 
what it does not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion tries to introduce increased accountability into the 
regulatory process.  However, it deals with accountability in 
terms of costs and forgets about the regulatory process itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense the hon. member has put the cart before the horse. 
Reform's approach, as outlined in our blue book policy, states 
that the Reform Party supports restrictions on the number and 
types of orders in council permitted by a government during its 
term in office.  It goes on to state that until we form 
government Reform Party MPs will strive to make parliamentary 
committees effective in reviewing any regulation before 
implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the official opposition, my Reform Party colleagues and I 
believe that by changing the regulatory process to make it more 
accountable we get cost effectiveness.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will elaborate later on how this is achieved.  However, I 
first want to provide context and background on how the 
regulatory process works or, more accurately, does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regulations, or as they are also described statutory instruments 
or delegated legislation, are passed through order in council or 
governor in council.  As all members know, this is done under the 
auspices of the minister's authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not kid ourselves.  They are drafted, vetted and the 
product of bureaucratic thinkers.  There is nothing wrong with 
this per se.  Indeed, with British parliamentary democracies 
having evolved the way they have, legislative authority must be 
delegated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as a consequence and with little or no accountability, 
unelected people are making what are effectively laws.  The 
authority to do this is legitimately contained in every bill that 
comes before parliament.  But that is not where my concern is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that any government bill tabled contains the words “the 
governor in council may make regulations”, the bulk of a bill's 
legislative intent is not in the legislation itself but in the 
regulations that follow after a bill's passage.  This is where my 
concern is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it into perspective, think of a government bill.  I see 
the justice minister is in the House, so let us use the 
government's flawed Firearms Registration Act as an example, 
otherwise known as Bill C-68.  That bill was and is an attack on 
the fundamental property rights of Canadians.  Yet the most 
offensive part of the bill comes from the potential of governor 
in council regulations that may be passed at future dates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enabling legislation for Bill C-68 contains a regulatory 
proviso that allows the justice minister to arbitrarily declare 
any class of firearm prohibited.  The firearms can then be 
confiscated from law-abiding owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the regulation itself, there is no debate, no vote in 
parliament and no accountability.  Sure there is a weak promise 
to table any such regulations before the justice committee, but 
that is a meaningless, token gesture.  In fact, the tabling of 
order in council documents before any parliamentary committee is 
rarely done.  It is even rarer for the government to place draft 
regulations, along with the bill itself, before a parliamentary 
committee for consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point here is that a government bill is a lot like an 
iceberg; 10% comes in the form of the bill and the other 90% 
lurks beneath the surface in the form of regulatory authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does my Tory friend offer as a solution to problems of 
accountability and cost effectiveness?  In true Liberal and Red 
Tory fame, he offers to set up a bureaucracy to watch the 
bureaucracy, spending money to allegedly save money.  When I see 
and hear that type of impaired logic, I can safely say that 
Liberal or Tory, same old story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Am I being overly unfair?  Let us look at the record of the red 
Tory government when it was in power.  Does it differ from its 
Liberal clone on the subject of regulatory accountability? During 
nine tortuous years in power, did members of the fifth place 
party do something to make the regulatory process more 
accountable?  Unfortunately, no.  Like their Liberal friends 
before them and in government now, the Tories did nothing.  In 
fact, the statutory measure that would allow for a parliamentary 
committee to disallow a regulation is still not in place.  The 
Tories could have done it while they were in power and did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, their Liberal counterparts are no better and somewhat 
more hypocritical than the Tories.  The Liberals actually pushed 
for a statutory disallowance procedure while the Tories were in 
power.  Curiously though, now that the Liberals are in power, 
they are not quite as eager to implement it.  Then again, it is 
not all that surprising if one thinks back to the Liberal GST 
promise, but I digress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous reasons why the Liberals will not enact a 
statutory disallowance procedure.  Political opportunists say one 
thing in opposition and do another thing in government. 
Arrogance, disrespect for democracy and the list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, a great deal of what he proposes is contained in 
the RIAS which accompanies the regulation.  The regulatory impact 
analysis statement deals with much of what the hon. member is 
trying to do here with the motion before us.  I encourage him to 
actually pick up a copy of the <I>Canada Gazette</I> Part II and 
read through the RIAS for any given regulation.  It does offer 
valuable insight into the impact of a regulation.  However, I 
reiterate that the key to accountability lay elsewhere, not in 
the financial bottom line but in reform of the process itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A regulation should not just be given a parliamentary rubber 
stamp once the Clerk of the Privy Council has been given a copy, 
as is the case now.  Instead, there should be mandatory review by 
a parliamentary committee before a regulation comes into force. 
As a preventive measure, this could be done by tabling draft 
regulations at second reading or during committee consideration 
of a bill. 
If the regulation is found to be flawed, then it would be 
referred to scrutiny of regulations immediately instead of after 
the fact.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once there, if the regulation is still found to be flawed, a 
statutory disallowance procedure could then be used to strike 
down the offending regulation. My Liberal friends will say that 
there is already room in the standing orders, but this procedure 
is not useful because there is nothing compelling the minister to 
strike down the offending regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that Britain, Australia and New Zealand all have 
statutory disallowance procedures, the question is, why do we 
not?  The answer is a refusal by cabinet to act on the issue, a 
refusal by the executive to relinquish absolute power over the 
regulatory process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, this comes from the profound mistrust that government MPs 
have for the role of parliament and its members.  And, like the 
motion before us, it also demonstrates a deep misunderstanding of 
the regulatory process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, if MPs on both sides want to make regulations more 
accountable, hence cost effective, this is not the way to go 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House and Canadians would be better served by a regulation 
making process that increases parliamentary scrutiny. Contrary to 
what is being proposed here, it does not mean creating another 
bureaucracy which functions outside of parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in 
the debate on M-207. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, I want to acknowledge the work of the member for 
Kings—Hants in bringing the motion before the House and to thank 
him for the work that he has done on a very important matter. 
Contrary to my colleagues in the Reform Party, I do see a purpose 
and a point to the debate from the point of view of 
accountability and open, transparent government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should not be a surprise for us to hear Reform members talk 
in such strong terms against the motion because what this party 
is really interested in is no government.  The least government 
is the best government from the point of view of Reform members. 
Anything that comes in the way of that is certainly a negative 
from their perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly support the spirit of the motion before us.  What 
the member for Kings—Hants is trying to do is to acknowledge the 
fact that today we have a government by stealth, a government 
that has basically found a secretive, underhanded way of 
advancing public policy without the full benefit of parliamentary 
debate and public scrutiny.  I certainly acknowledge the root 
cause of the motion and appreciate his attempts to address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the spirit of the motion.  We also support that 
aspect of the motion that deals with the principle of ensuring 
financial impact assessments on regulations.  I support that 
proposition because it does give us one way to ensure scrutiny 
and accountability here in this place of elected representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do, however, have some problems with the member's suggestion 
for a regulatory budget.  We are concerned about that particular 
aspect of the motion because we know those words have become a 
flag waving idea by extreme right-wing elements in the United 
States.  If we cut through all the rhetoric of the Reform Party, 
we will find that it supports that concept as well because it 
allows it to advance the agenda of reducing government and the 
whole role and responsibility of government for ensuring a 
society that is more equitable and based on fairness and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the idea of a regulatory budget has been advanced 
by some pretty extreme characters in the United States.  We think 
back to Pat Buchanan who, in the 1960s, was advocating such an 
idea and did so in very open terms.  He felt that this kind of 
idea would create the optimal situation for reducing the role of 
government. 
His objective would in fact be zero regulations and a zero budget 
situation.  We are very leery of giving any credence to this kind 
of idea.  We will speak consistently against that approach.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to what I think is the spirit of the motion before 
us and the real intentions of the member for Kings—Hants is 
accountability with respect to regulations.  It ensures that we 
are able to measure the effectiveness of regulations and hold the 
government accountable for any endeavours or initiatives that 
exceed its obligations under existing laws and statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples where the government has advanced its 
own agenda and ideas in ways that appear quite contrary to the 
legislation that has been approved without it being held 
accountable to parliament.  We certainly think that the financial 
impact assessments of regulations would allow for all of us to 
have a more open public debate and better scrutiny of public 
policy.  Having financial impact assessments on regulations would 
be an important tool for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kings—Hants mentioned that it will not always be 
possible to make decisions strictly in terms of a cost benefit 
analysis.  There will be times, if we have all the facts before 
us, where we will recognize that the costs of enforcing and 
implementing regulations may far outweigh the cost to our budget 
and the mechanisms required to enforce those regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, in the House, would appreciate opportunities to assess the 
compliance costs of environmental regulations.  We on this side 
of the House would like to see a way to assess the GST compliance 
costs on small business. We would like to find a way to assess 
the financial impact of regulations pursued by the government 
when it comes to patent medicine.  We would like to fully 
understand how a government can proceed with decisions made 
behind closed doors without the benefit of public scrutiny.  We 
would like to understand how it justifies those decisions in 
terms of the entire health care system and the Canadian taxpayer 
as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think specifically of the issue we have dealt with in the last 
few months with respect to the Minister of Industry.  In the dead 
of this summer, he brought forward regulations without warning, 
without any kind of heads up to the generic drug industry, about 
the government's plans to make further changes to the notice of 
compliance regulations which make it harder for generic drug 
companies to have a foothold in the country and get their 
products to market.  At that time, we raised concerns about the 
whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from a letter I wrote to the Minister of Industry 
on September 9: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through recently announced amendments, your government has 
surreptitiously introduced changes that will certainly add to the 
drug costs faced by Canadians.  These changes further entrench 
the virtual monopoly guaranteed to the international 
pharmaceutical cartel through the ill-advised Canada Patent Act 
at the expense of the generic drug industry and the Canadian 
health system. 
I am particularly concerned about the arbitrary and undemocratic 
way in which you have chosen to proceed with these latest 
amendments to the Patented Medicines Regulations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go on to call for the minister to slow down the process to 
allow for all players in the field to scrutinize the proposed 
regulations and to bring them to parliament to be accountable to 
this body of elected representatives in terms of cost benefit 
analysis, in terms of consistency with existing legislation and 
in terms of consistency with the public's interest in ensuring a 
more cost effective system where people have access to drugs when 
they need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government chose to ignore these concerns.  It chose to 
ignore the strong positions presented to it from the Canadian 
Drug Manufacturers Association.  I can cite reams and reams of 
documents where that organization appealed to the government to 
slow the process down, hear its input and to truly look at the 
financial impact for all Canadians and our entire health care 
system if this was allowed to go through.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry and the entire cabinet ignored those 
concerns.  They proceeded to ratify those regulations at the 
beginning of October.  It is now a done deal.  That is a perfect 
example of government by stealth and a government that advances 
its agenda which is tied to the big pharmaceutical corporations 
and other big industry interests in order to pursue its 
objectives.  That is precisely what needs to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion provides us with a way to debate and discuss these 
concerns.  In part it goes a long way toward addressing a very 
serious situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I would like to congratulate and thank the member for 
Kings—Hants for his motion.  We support the spirit of it.  We 
support that part of it which deals with financial impact 
assessments on regulations.  We regret that we cannot support the 
regulatory budget approach.  However, given the sentiments in the 
House for more government accountability to parliament, I believe 
that this would provide the basis for future motions and 
legislative work that we can pursue as members in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I should advise the 
House that if the hon. member for Kings—Hants speaks now, he 
will close the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, again it 
is a pleasure that I rise to debate Motion No. 207.  I appreciate 
the interventions by the representatives from the other parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister raised some 
concerns relative to my motion and to the notion of a regulatory 
budget.  I want to clarify a couple of things.  I should clarify 
what this motion is not, what we are not representing with the 
regulatory budget idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are certainly not saying that there will be times that we 
would be opposed to all regulations.  In fact, there are times 
that we would still support regulations although the government 
borne costs of implementation and compliance and the citizenry 
borne costs actually exceeded the benefits provided by the 
regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I used the example of bicycle helmets.  In dealing with 
a priceless issue in terms of the safety of children against head 
injuries, it could be very difficult to quantify that. Even if we 
were to assess some level of cost it could very well be the case 
that the elected members of parliament would still support that 
particular regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are examples where the House would support a regulation 
even though the cost benefit analysis numbers did not 
quantitatively support that regulation.  It would provide an 
increase in the role of the member of parliament in evaluating 
these very important regulations in the same way that we evaluate 
taxes and other public policies in this chamber, or at least we 
should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister also said that 
this could result in a cap on regulations.  Nowhere does the 
motion mention there being a cap on regulations. We believe that 
every regulation should have a sunset clause. Periodically we 
should be revisiting pieces of governance or regulations to 
determine their efficacy in the current context. That would make 
sense.  But in no way, shape or form did we ever mention a cap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform member initially described me as being a socialist. 
That is the first time I have ever been described as a socialist. 
I guess that is why we are a centre right party as opposed to a 
far right party.  I guess most Canadians are somewhere in the 
centre.  Certainly the recent polls indicate that more Canadians 
are closer to where we are than to where the Reform Party is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, I was surprised that the Reform Party would be 
opposed to increasing the role of the member of parliament and 
increasing the accountability of parliament.  I assumed on past 
utterances by the Reform Party that the Reform Party would 
support greater scrutiny over initiatives by unelected people in 
the bureaucracy.  I guess that is no longer the case.  Perhaps 
hypocrisy is only half a mortal sin, so a party that looks 
seriously on those kinds of things may not be as constrained as 
we would have expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also surprised that the Reform Party would be so opposed 
to something that has been endorsed by the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business.  I am frequently surprised by the Reform 
Party and perhaps eventually when I become less jaded I will 
become more inured to some of the inconsistencies over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. NDP member for her thoughtful intervention.  It 
is obvious that she considered the issue very carefully and gave 
a qualified approval of the intent of the legislation.  I 
appreciate her intervention today, and on other days as well. She 
is a very skilled, adroit and thoughtful parliamentarian. She 
compared this piece of legislation to something that Pat Buchanan 
was supportive of sometime ago. Be assured that my intentions 
with this legislation are far different from what the far right 
in the U.S. would support, particularly people like Pat Buchanan 
of the U.S. Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the New Democrats say that I am too far right and the Reform 
Party says I am a socialist, that probably makes me just right. 
We like the centre right position. More and more Canadians are 
becoming increasingly comfortable with where we are at.  We 
certainly expect that enough Canadians in the next federal 
election will be so comfortable that we will be on the other side 
of the House implementing this types of visionary legislation 
that will improve the quality of life for Canadians and the 
competitiveness of Canadian enterprise as we move bravely into 
the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK15">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the federal government 
should conduct a province-wide referendum in British Columbia on 
the Nisga'a Final Agreement prior to the consideration of any 
further stages of Bill C-9, an Act to give effect to the Nisga'a 
Final Agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I would like to advise the Chair that I 
will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will confine my remarks today on the Nisga'a treaty to 
process.  The reason we moved this motion for debate in the House 
regarding a referendum in British Columbia on the treaty has to 
do with the fact that the process that has brought us to this 
point with the treaty has been wrong.  It has been wrong for many 
years.  It has led to a treaty which, right now in British 
Columbia, enjoys at best questionable support.  In our view it 
does not pass the judgment of the people of British Columbia. 
Indeed, we do not believe it would pass the judgment of the 
people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the House a bit of background as to what has 
happened up to this point in time.  It has often been said that 
the Nisga'a leaders for more than 100 years have tried to get a 
treaty with Canada and with British Columbia.  That is in fact 
the case.  There is a lot of documentation which shows that the 
Nisga'a leaders have tried since before Confederation to have the 
Government of Canada, and prior to that the Government of 
Britain, enter into a treaty.  They were steadfastly refused for 
more than 100 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also true that in 1973, with the Calder decision of the 
Supreme Court of Canada being a split decision, the Government of 
Canada became alarmed that the Nisga'a had come close to winning 
a land claim case in court.  At that point the government decided 
that it would enter into negotiations.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia refused on the basis that in 1871 when it 
joined Confederation the terms of that union, which was called 
the act of union, expressly provided that the federal government 
would be responsible for all existing and future obligations to 
aboriginal people, except for the narrow requirement of the 
province of British Columbia to set aside lands known as reserve 
lands and to have those registered with the land title office and 
conveyed to the federal government, which B.C. did.  British 
Columbia has about 1,600 such reserve lands that were registered 
between 1871 and 1926 when the federal government ultimately 
passed legislation which recognized that B.C. had lived up to its 
full obligations under the terms of the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia refused to join the discussions regarding 
treaties, taking the position that Canada was rightfully the body 
to be negotiating with the Nisga'a and if Canada required land or 
resources to complete those negotiations Canada would have to 
come back to British Columbia and make arrangements to 
compensate, to buy the land and the resources to be conveyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, however, there was a change taking place in British 
Columbia.  The provincial government at that point said it would 
sit down as a party to the negotiations.  It also indicated that 
it would be prepared to put land on the table as a provincial 
government on behalf of the people of British Columbia to resolve 
the outstanding claims.  What it also did, the first major flaw 
in the process that has led us to the great problem we have 
today, was that it signed a secrecy agreement with the federal 
government and the Nisga'a negotiators wherein it said that it 
would be party to negotiations that would take place behind 
closed doors.  The negotiators were all bound by the secrecy 
agreement not to discuss anything outside the negotiating room. 
The public of British Columbia for many years was not even aware 
that these negotiations were taking place and certainly had no 
idea of the ramifications of the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994-95 the Reform Party of Canada found out that these 
negotiations were taking place.  It held a series of public 
meetings and tried to bring to the attention of the public that 
this was taking place.  It also tried to create some kind of a 
mechanism for public input.  The negotiators for the federal and 
provincial governments fought the Reform Party of Canada tooth 
and nail.  They did not want to have anything to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 an agreement in principle was announced.  It was 
released publicly.  At that point the provincial government 
decided it would have its standing committee on aboriginal 
affairs travel the province of British Columbia to consult with 
the public.  I attended several of those meetings and I have the 
minutes of proceedings of all of those meetings.  People who 
showed up to voice concern or express any kind of opposition to 
any of the principles or any of the facets of the agreement in 
principle were routinely belittled and their character and 
motives were called into question.  The provincial members, 
dominated by NDP MLAs, took the position that people who 
questioned the wisdom of the agreement in principle were not just 
wrong but were somehow lesser people; evil people, if I can use 
that term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final agreement was released publicly last year.  We note 
that in the final agreement there was no substantive change from 
the agreement in principle, so all the committee work that was 
done by the B.C. standing committee was obviously just a big PR 
exercise so the government could say it had consulted with people 
when in fact it had not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the final agreement was released the provincial government 
spent $8 million of B.C. taxpayers' money in an effort to sell 
the agreement.  In a highly emotional appeal it routinely 
belittled again anybody who questioned the agreement, and it 
routinely indicated that this was a good deal and it would not 
change one word of the agreement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then saw the ratification process take place in the 
legislature of British Columbia where debate was cut off after 
less than half of the agreement was debated.  Even though the 
provincial government had promised British Columbians a full 
debate on the treaty, it guillotined the debate after less than 
half the treaty was actually debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the federal ratification process.  We will recall 
that the minister of Indian affairs signed the treaty in June of 
this year, before the legislation or the agreement had even been 
introduced in parliament.  Again we see a perverted process.  We 
now have the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and 
Northern Development travelling to British Columbia because, as 
one Liberal member who was in Terrace last week said:  “We are 
only in B.C. because of a tactic by the Reform Party to hijack 
parliament.  In fact we came here on the white knuckle route.  I 
have not been on a train yet.  I have been on every other mode of 
transportation.  This little song and dance is costing the 
taxpayers $500,000 directly by the Reform Party”.  He said that 
the only reason he was there was because of a tactic of the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the only reason the Liberal members came to 
British Columbia, and they made it very plain to the people who 
were testifying before the committee, which was a stacked 
committee, was because they were forced into it.  They had no 
real intention of listening to British Columbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is further evidence of the flawed and perverted process 
that has been used to date to try to ram through a treaty which 
we do not think enjoys the support of the public of British 
Columbia.  Certainly all of the indications we have are that it 
does not.  This is not a minor matter.  This is, as broadcaster 
Rafe Mair said, a huge change in the social contract of British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians deserve to have the right to vote on this 
treaty to decide whether the kinds of principles expressed in the 
deal are principles which they can support, because they will, 
for sure, be reflected in 50 or more treaties yet to be 
negotiated. Because of the flawed process that has been used to 
date, it is absolutely imperative that this parliament in the 
debate today come to the conclusion that British Columbians have 
a right to vote in a referendum, that they have a right to take 
part in the ratification process, and that they have a right to 
express their opinions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member for Skeena has talked of the importance 
of consultation on the Nisga'a treaty.  I certainly do not think 
anyone disagrees with that.  Some of us would argue that there 
has been extensive consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought as well that he would have been concerned 
with consultation with the Nisga'a people, with the people he 
represents as the member of parliament for Skeena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member for Skeena could tell the House when 
it was that he last had a meeting and not a debate in front 
television cameras.  When was the last time the member for 
Skeena, who represents the Nass Valley and the Nisga'a people, 
sat down face to face to have a dialogue with the Nisga'a people 
on this important treaty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question.  I do not know who he means by the Nisga'a 
people because I talk to the Nisga'a people all the time.  I meet 
the Nisga'a people face to face.  The last time I had a face to 
face meeting with a Nisga'a individual was about a week ago.  I 
met with Frank Barton and talked with him extensively about his 
concerns over the Nisga'a treaty.  There have been many more like 
Mr. Barton with whom I have met face to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member that not only do I have the 
responsibility and the privilege of representing the Nisga'a 
people, I also have the honour and privilege of representing the 
Gitksan and Gitanyow people, people who say they have never been 
consulted by the federal government, they have never been 
consulted by the provincial government, and they have never heard 
from this member over here or his party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that there are many parties to this debate.  I 
would ask the member not to focus on four or five Nisga'a leaders 
as being the only example that he can raise in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I know where the NDP member is coming from.  I think we 
will probably hear today a lot of rhetorical advances coming from 
the other parties.  I want to get something out on the table in 
the House through my hon. colleague.  It is about the role of 
opposition parties in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four opposition parties in the House of Commons.  When 
there are obvious concerns, not just by British Columbians but by 
Canadians about the implementation of such a template agreement, 
why is it that it is only the Reform Party which is not only 
standing up in the House of Commons in opposition but also in a 
critique of the bill on the agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, the best answer I can give 
my colleague is to refer him to a book that was written by Thomas 
Sowell, an American author who wrote a book called <I>The Vision 
of the Anointed</I>.  What we have here is a very similar 
proposition.  We have a vision that is expressed through 
government policy that is adopted by all the other opposition 
parties in the House.  It is a failed vision.  It has been a 
demonstrated failure for over 130 years.  My goodness, look at 
the results that it has represented for aboriginal people on 
reserves.  Look at the dire circumstances that many of these 
people live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are so enraptured with this vision that they 
insulate themselves from the reality of the policy decisions that 
they make.  They refuse to accept the fact that the failure and 
the abject poverty that many aboriginal people live in is as a 
direct result of these policies.  They continue down the same 
path without being able to question or even engage in an honest, 
intellectual debate about what the government ought to do and 
ought not to do in terms of rectifying the situation and trying 
to improve things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in my view is the failure of the opposition and the 
government for that matter in this entire debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the motion before the House today calls for a referendum 
of the people of British Columbia.  In view of the fact that 
something like 80% of the cost of this treaty is in fact coming 
from federal taxpayers from across Canada, if the hon. member is 
serious about a referendum why is it that he is calling for a 
referendum just of the people of British Columbia?  Why is he not 
calling for a referendum of the people right across Canada?  Of 
course that would be outrageous because in that case— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  The Reform Party is applauding. It 
wants the people of Ontario to be able to tell the people of 
British Columbia what is best for them.  Shame on the Reform 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is interesting to see 
the member pirouetting around and changing positions in a 
heartbeat.  On the one hand, he says the people of British 
Columbia should not be the only ones to have a referendum and 
then he says they should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to that question, it is the change to the social 
contract, the self-government provisions in this treaty, not the 
cost of it that people should be focused on.  That is the real 
essence of the debate here today.  It is the self-government 
provisions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in favour of the motion before the 
House which calls for the federal government to conduct a 
province-wide referendum in British Columbia on the Nisga'a final 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 26 in the House, I fully expressed my own views on 
the Nisga'a treaty itself.  The focus of today's motion, however, 
is not so much on the treaty as on the democratic right of the 
people of British Columbia to register their opinion on this 
treaty; their support for it or their opposition to it through a 
province-wide referendum. The point at issue, in other words, is 
the democratic rights of the people of British Columbia.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other members of the official opposition today will put 
forward the main reasons for a referendum.  In our judgment, 
those include economic and financial reasons because this 
agreement and future agreements modelled on it will have a major 
financial impact on British Columbians and on other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are, of course, social reasons why this should be 
subjected to a referendum because this treaty and others modelled 
after it will have a profound effect, as the member said, on the 
social and community relations between aboriginals and 
non-aboriginals throughout the entire province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also constitutional reasons for having a referendum on 
this issue because the agreement establishes a new order of 
aboriginal government with jurisdiction over many areas of 
activity which were formerly the exclusive prerogative of the 
federal and provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to spend my time on these reasons, important as 
they are.  What I would like to do is to recognize that all the 
parties in the House, with the exception of the official 
opposition, have chosen to co-operate with the government in the 
unseemly task of pushing this treaty through the House with a 
minimum amount of discussion and a minimum amount of consultation 
with the people of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, I would like to make some arguments as to why 
members of the respective parties in the House, regardless of 
their position on Nisga'a itself, should consider supporting the 
motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion tests the commitment of various members and parties 
to uphold democracy, the democratic rights of British Columbians 
to affirm or withhold their support for a major piece of 
legislation with economic, social and constitutional 
ramifications for the entire province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How members vote on the motion will tell voters a great deal 
about the commitment of those members and their parties to 
democracy, the democratic rights of the people themselves to 
decide certain major issues rather than have solutions forced 
upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be specific, I first appeal to the Bloc members.  The Bloc 
Quebecois members never tire of telling the House about the 
democratic rights of the people of Quebec to decide their own 
future on constitutional matters.  Surely, if they are that 
committed to democracy and the use of referendums to settle 
issues democratically, they cannot turn around and deny that same 
right to the people of British Columbia with respect to a quasi 
constitutional issue of great importance to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appeal to members of the New Democratic Party.  The New 
Democratic Party professes to have a special commitment to 
democracy.  It is embodied in the name of the party.  In the old 
days when it was still the CCF, it purported to be the party for 
the little person, the party that wanted to give ordinary people 
a voice and a say in the great decisions affecting their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old CCF supported such measures as greater use of 
referendums, citizens initiatives and recall, not unlike those 
that are currently in the platform of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appeal to New Democratic Party members, for the purpose 
of this motion at least, to return to their democratic roots and 
regardless of their position on the Nisga'a treaty itself, to 
give ordinary rank and file British Columbians a chance to 
express themselves on this matter through a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appeal to the federal Conservative members in this way: 
It was a Conservative federal government which brought in the 
Federal Referendum Act of 1992.  Section 3 of that act reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the Governor in Council considers that it is in the public 
interest to obtain by means of a referendum the opinion of 
electors on any question relating to the Constitution of Canada, 
the Governor in Council may, by proclamation, direct that the 
opinion of electors be obtained by putting the question to the 
electors of Canada or of one or more provinces specified in the 
proclamation at a referendum called for that purpose. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the B.C. referendum legislation requires an actual 
constitutional amendment to trigger a province-wide referendum, 
the federal legislation, enacted by a Conservative government, is 
much more inclusive, permitting a referendum “on any question 
relating to the Constitution of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While some members may dispute the official opposition's claim 
that the whole Nisga'a agreement is a de facto constitutional 
amendment, no one, regardless of their position on this issue, 
can deny that it certainly raises questions relating to the 
Constitution of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the preamble of the treaty makes reference to 
section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT17"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT17"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225
<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first provision in chapter 2 of the treaty defining the 
“nature of the agreement” says that the agreement is “a treaty 
and a land claims agreement within the meaning of sections 25 and 
35 of the Constitution Act, 1982”.  The Nisga'a agreement is 
described within itself as being by definition a constitutional 
document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 8 of chapter 2 makes specific reference to the 
Constitution of Canada itself.  Section 9 refers to the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms which is part of the constitution. 
Section 23 of chapter 2 elaborates on Nisga'a rights as provided 
for in section 35 of the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Nisga'a final agreement obviously raises questions 
relating to the Constitution of Canada and the Conservative 
Referendum Act of 1992 specifically provided for the use of 
referendums to obtain expressions of public opinion on such 
matters, I would therefore appeal to Conservative members to 
uphold the principles and the spirit of their own referendum act 
and support the motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is evident to the official opposition that a majority of the 
members of the Liberal government have simply written off the 
opinions and interests of British Columbians.  The government is 
at odds with the people of British Columbia on everything from 
the handling of illegal immigrants, to the collapse of the west 
coast fishery, to aboriginal issues in general, to the Nisga'a 
treaty in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, therefore, do not expect a majority of the government 
members to have any respect for the democratic rights of the 
people of British Columbia to express themselves on this issue, 
even though the provincial Liberal Party in B.C. under Gordon 
Campbell has explicitly called for a referendum on the Nisga'a 
treaty in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House, however, does provide a specific 
opportunity for the last remaining Liberal MPs from British 
Columbia to declare where they stand when the democratic rights 
of the people of that province conflict with the position and 
party line of the federal Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of B.C. expect that when there is a conflict between 
the Liberal Party line and the position of the electors of B.C. 
that the position of the electors should prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A majority of the people of British Columbia would therefore 
expect the following members to support the motion and will be 
watching with keen interest tomorrow night to see if, in fact, 
they do.  I refer to:  the member for Victoria, the member for 
Richmond, the member for Vancouver South—Burnaby, the member for 
Vancouver Centre, the member for Vancouver Kingsway, the member 
for Vancouver Quadra, and the member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eyes of B.C. are upon these members.  Will it be the Liberal 
Party line or the democratic rights of British Columbians?  The 
vote on the motion will tell the story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to all members, regardless of their position on the 
Nisga'a treaty, who profess to value the democratic rights of the 
people of British Columbia to decide for themselves whether the 
Nisga'a agreement is in the interests of aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal people in that province to support the motion 
before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I move: 
<A NAME="LINK20">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by inserting after the words “British 
Columbia on” the words “the ratification of”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the Leader of the Official Opposition has indicated that 
he supports a referendum on this Nisga'a treaty.  He has also 
spoken on a number of other occasions about the use of a 
referenda in a variety of contexts.  He said, for example, that 
on the fundamental issue of freedom of choice on abortion that he 
supports, personally, a constitutional amendment, as I understand 
it, to make abortions in Canada illegal, but that he would be 
prepared to have that issue put to the people of Canada in a 
referendum. 
I assume that is the position of other Reform Party members.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the leader of the Reform Party could indicate where 
he draws the line on the use of referenda.  Many of us are 
concerned that if we subject the rights of minorities to a 
majority referendum, this could lead to a very dangerous abuse of 
the rights of minorities.  I wonder if the Leader of the Official 
Opposition could indicate where he would draw the line. Is he 
prepared to use referenda with respect to the most fundamental 
and basic rights of minorities in the charter of rights?  Would 
he have used referenda with respect to Japanese Canadians during 
and after World War II?  Would he have subjected their rights to 
a referendum?  Would he have subjected the equality rights of 
gays and lesbians to a referendum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just where does the Leader of the Official Opposition draw the 
line in the use of a referendum with respect to the most basic 
and fundamental rights of Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question.  I am glad he has paid attention to our 
demands for referendums. I wish he would pay attention to 
everything we say on this subject because we have answered this 
question at least a hundred times before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in the use of a referendum to allow people to express 
their opinions.  We also believe in legal definitions of rights 
and constitutional provisions for bills of rights which provide 
some constraint on the other side so that rights cannot be simply 
trampled by majorities at their whim. We support the use of the 
courts to uphold those rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a balance. This country hardly ever resorts 
to referenda.  This is a country which professes to have great 
respect for majority opinion and it hardly ever goes to the 
public on any issue.  Even to make changes in the Constitution of 
Canada itself as profound as the ones in Meech Lake and the 
Charlottetown accord took enormous public pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country is hardly overdosing on referendums.  We have had a 
national referendum on conscription, a national referendum on 
prohibition and a national referendum on the Charlottetown 
accord.  Canada has had three referendums in 135 years.  The 
country is not overdosing on referendums.  There ought to be more 
occasions where the public gets a chance to have its say.  The 
Nisga'a treaty particularly in its all pervasive effects on 
British Columbia is one of those instances.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, my comment is for the Leader of the Opposition. I do not 
think he answered the question put to him by the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made an argument about why there should be more 
referendums and why it could be argued we have not overdosed on 
referendums, to use the member's phrase.  However, he did not 
answer the question as to how he sees the role of referendums 
when it comes to things which arguably have to do with minority 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the Leader of the Opposition could address that as 
he did not in his answer to the member for Burnaby—Douglas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Madam Speaker, I believe I did 
answer the question at the beginning of my remarks.  The Reform 
Party believes in constitutionally entrenched rights.  We include 
and believe in the use of the courts to uphold those rights. We 
also believe in the opportunity for people to vote on 
constitutional amendments.  There should be a balance used 
between the referendum mechanism and constitutionally entrenched 
rights and use the courts to enforce them.  That is how we 
achieve the balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our view that this country is going to have to achieve 
that balance or it is going to get increasing disrespect for the 
charter of rights and freedoms and the legal mechanisms used to 
enforce it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time 
with the member for Vancouver Quadra. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to respond to the motion by the member for Skeena. 
The member has asked that the government ignore years of 
consultation, negotiation and goodwill and extend the uncertainty 
even longer by sending the Nisga'a final agreement to a procedure 
heavy referendum in British Columbia.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no requirement for a provincial referendum.  The three 
parties to the Nisga'a negotiations agreed on how they would 
ratify the final agreement early on in the process.  Honourable 
governments follow through on commitments negotiated in good 
faith.  To change the rules now would be wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty has been many long years in the making. 
During this time every issue has been examined in great detail by 
the experts in the relevant fields.  Third party advice has been 
sought and considered.  Provisions have been carefully and 
painstakingly crafted to achieve the most clarity possible. 
Negotiations of the Nisga'a final agreement have included one of 
the most extensive consultation and public information exercises 
ever conducted in the context of treaty negotiations in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the ratification of the Nisga'a treaty, we will resolve 
this outstanding matter which dates back to the time of Queen 
Victoria, a solution that is fair, equitable and in accordance 
with the laws of Canada.  True equality recognizes that not all 
individuals start in the same place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that aboriginal peoples' prior presence has given 
them unique rights as the original inhabitants of this country. 
The government believes that the aboriginal people of Canada have 
an inherent right to govern themselves which can be implemented 
through practical and workable agreements.  The existing rights 
of aboriginal people recognized under section 35 of the 
constitution have been affirmed again and again by the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to re-emphasize to members of the opposition that this is 
not a constitutional amendment.  This is a reaffirmation of 
rights that have existed since historical times.  We are 
recognizing them in a modern context under the treaty we are 
talking about.  The Nisga'a final agreement recognizes this fact 
and embodies practical solutions specific to the Nisga'a people. 
This agreement identifies a Nisga'a land base, resources and a 
system of government that reflects their cultures and their 
values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleagues are aware, the treaty contains reasonable 
self-government powers that will enable the Nisga'a to manage 
their internal affairs.  They will be able to make their own laws 
on things like Nisga'a citizenship; language and culture; the 
administration of their land and other assets; marriage; child 
and family social and health services; child custody and 
adoption; and education.  It is critical to understand that even 
where the Nisga'a can make laws, those laws must still operate 
concurrently with federal and provincial laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a laws can be challenged—and this is a test of our 
democracy—under the charter like laws passed by other 
governments in Canada.  That is because the treaty right to 
self-government is a right to govern in accordance with Canada's 
charter values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our constitution is sensitive to the fact that this country is 
made up of people with different backgrounds and cultures.  It 
also guarantees that all individuals will be treated equally 
under the law.  It is this guarantee of equality within society, 
this diversity within unity which make us distinctly Canadian.  I 
understand that the opposition wants to change the values of 
Canadians and go more to an American model.  Obviously, that is 
not the wish of Canadians and the governments of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is precisely because the Nisga'a treaty was negotiated within 
the constitution that the rights of those people who are not 
Nisga'a citizens but who live on or within Nisga'a lands are 
secure.  For example, even though those who reside on or within 
Nisga'a lands but who are not Nisga'a citizens may receive 
certain benefits of services from the Nisga'a government, the 
treaty does not allow the Nisga'a government to tax them. I 
repeat that it does not allow the Nisga'a government to tax them. 
Neither does the treaty prevent anyone from accessing their 
interests on Nisga'a lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to these assurances, those who are not Nisga'a 
citizens but who will live on or within Nisga'a lands will have 
extra measures to safeguard their interests and opportunities to 
participate in Nisga'a society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, they will be able to stand for election or vote for 
elected Nisga'a public institutions such as education and health 
boards. They will also have special rights to consultation and 
appeal. These are guaranteed rights which will give them a strong 
voice in the community they inhabit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who may not believe me, I am pleased to refer to the 
testimony last week of Mr. Bill Young.  He owns a sizeable piece 
of property surrounded by Nisga'a lands.  Mr. Young stated that 
he of course started with some questions and he is very satisfied 
with the answers.  He believes that he will enjoy ongoing peace 
with his Nisga'a neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party talk about listening to grassroots 
people.  It is funny how they listen only to the people who 
oppose the government.  As has been said elsewhere, we listen to 
all sides.  That is why there were amendments to the agreement in 
principle.  That is what governments are all about, making 
decisions and being accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty, achieved after years of complex 
negotiations, has enabled us to achieve a just and balanced 
settlement that respects the needs of the Nisga'a people and all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like all Canadians, the Nisga'a people want to be contributors 
to their communities and their country.  This fair and reasonable 
settlement will finally provide a much better chance for them to 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits generated by this treaty are not limited to the 
Nisga'a nation.  This agreement will yield significant long term 
dividends to other British Columbians as well.  I can give some 
examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty will finally lay to rest the divisive debates 
surrounding what we mean by aboriginal rights and how they should 
apply to the Nisga'a people.  It will enable all residents in the 
region to coexist in harmony fully cognizant of each other's 
rights and responsibilities.  Perhaps most beneficial is that 
ratification of this treaty will give the business community 
confidence to invest in the northern corner of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous other advantages to area residents resulting 
from this treaty.  Chief among them is that there will be 
millions of dollars in settlement payments invested in the Nass 
region.  Much of the new treaty money is likely to be spent in 
communities immediately surrounding the land claim area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another benefit is that the Nisga'a people will pay taxes in the 
same manner as other Canadian citizens and will contribute to the 
cost of running their government.  It is estimated that 15 years 
from now, when transition periods are complete, the Nisga'a 
contributions from tax and own-source revenues will amount to 
one-quarter of all government transfers.  These arrangements are 
unprecedented in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty will be good for the Nisga'a people, the 
people of British Columbia and all Canadians.  Yet there is an 
even more persuasive argument for supporting the treaty. At the 
most fundamental level, the treaty signifies our willingness as a 
society to reconcile historical and cultural differences.  It 
provides an avenue for positive change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty will enable us not only to honour the past 
but to move in partnership into the future.  This was our 
government's promise in “Gathering Strength: Canada's Aboriginal 
Action Plan”.  We promised to address historic grievances and to 
develop mechanisms for healing, reconciliation and renewal that 
would make a measurable difference in the lives of first peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pledged to resolve longstanding land claims, to improve 
governance and to address capacity building and accountability 
issues to prepare aboriginal communities to assume more control 
over their own affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We committed to defining a new partnership in shaping a common 
vision that would carry us all forward into the next millennium. 
The Nisga'a treaty symbolizes this new partnership.  It stands as 
a practical and workable arrangement which supports the core 
principles espoused in “Gathering Strength:  Canada's Aboriginal 
Action Plan”.  Mutual respect, recognition and reconciliation; 
that is what Canada is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to move forward with this treaty 
as soon as possible so we can get on with this new arrangement 
and partnership with the Nisga'a people in the Nass Valley.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a comment and a question.  In his statement the 
minister said that we could not have a referendum because it 
would constitute changing the rules after a long process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Quebec case this is precisely what the government is 
arguing, to change the rules in the middle of the game.  I wonder 
how the minister squares his position that it is not proper to 
change the rules here to give people a greater say, yet it is 
possible to change the rules in the other case.  That is my 
comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is on the agreement.  Even the process described by 
the minister is essentially an agreement among governments.  It 
has been negotiated between the Nisga'a government, the 
provincial government and the federal government.  People from 
rank and file Nisga'a to other aboriginals in B.C. and to rank 
and file other British Columbians have not been involved in this 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this treaty is so good, if this agreement produced at the top 
by governments talking to each other is so good and has so many 
benefits for all these people who were not involved in the 
negotiations, if this is so good that it will carry their 
judgment, why is the minister afraid of putting it before the 
British Columbian people in a referendum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a fair and 
appropriate question as it relates to the difference between this 
party and the party opposite.  I did not run as a member of 
parliament, and I do not think any of the members on this side 
did, to take the easy way out whenever there is an issue that 
needs to be dealt with.  Whenever there is a difficult issue of 
accountability and responsibility, they may as well just put a 
little computer where the Leader of the Opposition is and have a 
referendum every time we have a policy decision to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point of view, and I hope the Leader of the Opposition is 
listening, is that I take my responsibility very seriously.  The 
public at large voted for all members to come into the House of 
Commons in a democratic fashion, obviously, with the abilities 
and the rights to do the work that is necessary to make the 
country work for the betterment of everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I stand here I represent the people of Kenora—Rainy River. 
I am not afraid to stand up in front of people in Kenora—Rainy 
River and tell them that I support the Nisga'a agreement and that 
I will be supporting it when it comes to the House for a vote. 
That is the way our democratic process works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member wants to change it he can continue to espouse 
that, and that is why he is at 9% in the national polls.  People 
do not accept his argument.  Maybe he should get off that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue.  The member continues to say to the 
people of British Columbia that the reason we need a referendum 
is that there is a constitutional change.  In fact that is wrong, 
wrong, wrong.  He continues to say it.  I understand the reason 
Reformers stick to process.  I would if I were them because so 
far in this debate I have not been able to get out of the Leader 
of the Opposition what he would do if he were the Government of 
Canada as it relates to aboriginal people's rights in section 35. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been waiting now for weeks to ask that leader to give me 
some assurance that he will tell us before the debate is over, if 
his party were ever to form the government, what it would do 
relating to aboriginal rights and the kinds of agreements we need 
to sign for reconciliation of our historic differences. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if 
we are talking about voting machines it is on the government side 
of the House where members are told what to do.  They may as well 
stay home, frankly, and phone in their votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crux of the debate today is whether or not people believe 
this treaty will work to the benefit of everyone involved, not 
just the Nisga'a but everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just look for a moment at the Nisga'a and whether it 
would work for the benefit of them.  If we look at a band with a 
treaty, the Stony Plain band or the Samson Cree band, the Samson 
Cree has annual income of close to $100 million.  Yet 85% of the 
natives on that reserve live in poverty and are on welfare.  The 
Squamish band in my riding has $31 million in annual income.  If 
we compare the standard of living off reserve with on reserve 
there is no comparison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister name a single reserve in Canada governed by a 
treaty where the standard of living is as high as it is off 
reserve? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is the exact 
point we have been trying to make.  The abilities of “Gathering 
Strength” to change the relationship between the Government of 
Canada and treaty relationships are in order to get out from 
under the Indian Act.  That is what the Nisga'a agreement does.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member keeps using examples of first nations that are 
under the Indian Act.  That is the point.  The Nisga'a people 
will be outside the Indian Act.  They will have property rights. 
They will be under the charter.  All those things are not allowed 
by the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to give the House one small point because it is very 
important to the whole debate.  The whole debate so far has 
revolved around process.  I hope that leader will somewhere down 
the line tell us what is his aboriginal policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke the other day for two whole hours and danced around 
like he was doing a pirouette over and over again.  He told us 
about one aboriginal woman, whom he seemed to have met some time 
in his travels, in two speeches in the House.  It is time for him 
to tell us what his party really believes in. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
when I approached the Nisga'a treaty I wanted to satisfy myself 
on one point in particular.  Was it a good treaty in terms of the 
people it was dealing with?  I went to the facts and I am 
astonished by the results I obtained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very remote area of British Columbia, with a very tiny 
population: the aboriginal and the even smaller non-aboriginal 
population.  In a period of three years leading up to the treaty 
296 public meetings and colloquia were held in that area. If one 
considers the problems of distance and communications, it is an 
astonishing record.  I do not think city seats could do better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also found that it is not simply companies doing business.  It 
is not simply government agencies that impinge on this, but 
ordinary people.  There is a little group called the Nass Valley 
Residents Association, representing predominantly non-aboriginal 
people.  There were 13 successive meetings with this group.  It 
raised the issues of effect on isolated fee simple titles, 
continued replacement tenures, access to water, and access to 
forestry and firewood supplies.  These sorts of issues go to 
grassroots concerns, grassroots democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why there were 13 meetings in a row.  The people would 
come back and say they wanted answers.  They would get the 
answers.  At the end of the day there were no countervailing 
claims in the concrete in relation to the Nisga'a treaty.  That 
is a very important fact when we talk of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the referendum the minister has quite properly 
commented on changing the rules of the game at the end of the 
day, but I would raise more importantly the constitutional 
principle that we operate within a constitutional system of 
government which includes the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has had a stern rebuke.  One can read the judgment 
carefully on the rehearing of Marshall and find that it refers to 
intemperate and ill-informed comments by members of the House in 
relation to judicial decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can it seriously be suggested that the federal government 
should hold a selective referendum in a province that is itself 
before the courts?   With the Attorney General of British 
Columbia and Attorney General of Canada, a decision by the 
Supreme Court of British Columbia in the first instance still 
moot and under appeal, how can we possibly, with proper respect 
for the courts and proper respect for a constituent province, 
intervene and hold a selective federal referendum?  It would be 
more consistent if the Leader of the Opposition had responded to 
the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas and said “Yes, I will hold 
a nationwide referendum.  That is what I am proposing”.  However 
he did not do it.  The inconsistencies frankly do little credit 
to the study of constitutional law and show a complete disrespect 
for the courts with a pending process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get back into the issue of participatory democracy.  I 
issued four very well documented newsletters to my constituents 
since the treaty was published.  Each contains a 2,000 word 
summary of legal issues and constitutional issues, and I have 
asked for responses.  Over a period of six, nine and twelve 
months I have had 3,000 or 4,000 responses of various sorts. 
People are coming in, phoning me and writing thoughtful letters. 
As a result I was in touch with the minister, the predecessor of 
the present minister, to say here are some concerns.  Let us take 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this a template?  The point we made was no.  Every treaty 
rests on its own particular society which has its own particular 
social and political facts. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1255

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is right and proper for a remote thinly populated area of 
the province may not work in the city where there are 
countervailing interests that will be presented.  The template 
concept must be rejected.  Good sociological jurisprudence is 
when each treaty is considered and negotiated on its own facts. 
That was in spite of the opposition.  It would be some 
considerable time before the Premier of British Columbia accepted 
that Nisga'a was not a template but a special treaty negotiated 
on its own facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue is of the so-called constitutionalizing of the 
treaty.  There is a possibility of confusion here.  I discussed 
this point with the then federal Minister of Justice in 1983.  He 
was not the man who drafted the charter of rights but he was the 
successor.  I raised the issue of the effect of applying section 
35(1) to future treaties, not the known quantity of already 
existing treaties.  I raised the issue that these were 
constitutionalized treaties and not in my view constitutional 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we clarify and make this assurance clear?  In the Nisga'a 
treaty it is made very clear that the treaty is subject to the 
constitution and the charter of rights.  I went to the 
predecessor of the present minister and said that there were 
still concerns and could we not put it in the federal enacting 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the federal enacting legislation it is clear.  It 
establishes the supremacy of the constitution and the charter of 
rights.  Do not be afraid of changes to sections 91 and 92.  Do 
not be afraid of a third level of government.  Do not be afraid. 
Due process of law applies.  The principles of equality before 
the law and equal protection of the laws are there.  They are in 
the charter and the courts can apply them.  There is no reason 
for this fear which is based on misconception and lack of study. 
It is all there in the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue arises that it is not a template.  It is still the 
first treaty.  It is an historic event for people who negotiated 
in good faith and in good spirit, which shows it is in the 
absence of countervailing claims re the concrete.  The spirit of 
good neighbourliness of the sort the supreme court and the world 
court have spoken of is basic to the common law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What of future treaties?  It is clear, and I have had 
discussions on this with members of the B.C. Liberal Party, which 
has the same name but is legally separate and distinct from the 
government.  I have spoken to some of the critics who have 
appeared and attacked the Nisga'a treaty on the basis of a lack 
of information of the changes being made in the federal enacting 
legislation which are now there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that for future treaties we will re-emphasize they 
are individual treaties to be negotiated on their own facts. It 
is also clear that all future treaties must be made expressly and 
in terms subject to the constitution and the charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we may need better fact finding facilities in relation 
to these treaties.  I speak of the federal court with all 
respect, but I have difficulty in reconciling two judgments at 
two different levels of the federal court in a cognate but 
distinct case on the basis of the economic evidence in this area. 
There needs to be better lawyermanship by lawyers, the federal 
justice and other parties presenting the case.  The supreme court 
made this clear at the Marshall rehearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There also needs to be perhaps more use of the provincial 
supreme courts.  They are closest to the people.  The federal 
court, and I am not speaking of the Supreme Court of Canada, is a 
body that often has few local roots or little access to local 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those elements are there.  I also think we should take up the 
suggestion made by members of the Vancouver city council when the 
treaty process approaches the city of Vancouver and involve 
elected municipal representatives in the negotiating process. 
They have a lot of knowledge and a lot of practical wisdom.  They 
can help us in this path to what is an historic process for B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the rest of Canada has treaties.  We have to begin in B.C. 
It is a learning process and it is a difficult process, but what 
is the choice?  We want to live in peace in British Columbia.  We 
want a society in which people feel safe to invest.  We want a

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made clear to the minister that in negotiating treaties 
we expect good faith and good neighbourliness.  If we do not find 
it, that treaty should put to the bottom of the pile.  That is a 
good principle of operation.  The choice is 19 long summers of 
discontent in British Columbia or a process in which everybody is 
actively engaged, and that I think is the real choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the fact that the predecessor of the minister of 
Indian affairs made these changes to the federal enacting 
legislation which I think settle any remaining constitutional 
doubts.  I have no doubt the new minister accepts in full spirit 
the engagements made by his predecessor.  We will build on what 
we have learned in the process to date.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know of 
the member's great concern for democracy and I know he looks at 
these issues in great depth.  Is he not aware of how this is 
setting the stage for something that will be much greater than 
just the Nisga'a treaty itself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how he goes back home, as I know he does, and meets his 
constituents when a recent poll done in his riding showed that 
91.45% of his constituents said that there should be a referendum 
on this treaty.  I wonder how he answers them when he says that 
the government of the day in Ottawa says that there should not be 
and that he really does not have to listen to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I once had a member do that to me in my riding in 1991.  He said 
that he knew what we people thought but that Ottawa knew better, 
that his party knew better.  I wonder if this member does not 
have a few concerns that some of the members of his constituency 
might not say the same thing when 91.45% of them said that we 
should have a referendum on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would wonder whether 
the hon. member and his poll takers are not smoking pot when they 
come up with these figures.  I am in constant touch with my 
constituents.  I receive hundreds of letters every week and we 
answer them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the member one thing that will restore his faith in 
democracy.  We have only had two mean minded letters that had a 
John Wayne conception of the aboriginal people and wanted to 
chase them across the frontier with muskets.  The people in my 
constituency are thoughtful, well educated, reasonable people. 
They are honest, decent people and they respond to facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the Nisga'a treaty, when we explain the facts 
they come back and they accept the facts.  They accept that there 
will be a large degree of public involvement, even larger than 
before in Nisga'a with their 296 public meetings.  The matters 
will get to the city.  We will have a stronger process for review 
of countervailing interests where there is a contest between 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal rights.  We should have a third 
party process and compulsory arbitration if needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the things my constituents work for concretely.  They 
do not talk off the tops of their heads.  They do not read Zane 
Grey or obscure novels from the 19th century.  They are moving 
into the 21st century.  We want a peaceful society in British 
Columbia.  We want to get through those 50 treaties on the basis 
of general equity and general public consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the process going and it is working.  That is what my 
constituents are saying to me.  They are not prophets of gloom 
and doom.  They are not afraid of the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
ask the hon. member a question about the referendum principle. 
There is a principle at stake that we continue to ignore and that 
we simply do not address, and that is somehow judging the rights 
of a minority by having a referendum of the majority.  How do we 
protect minority rights in that context?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I gave a more narrowly 
technical legal answer to that in my opening remarks.  The facts 
are before the Supreme Court of British Columbia.  There is a 
challenge based on the issue that a referendum is not being held 
within British Columbia and it is based on the B.C. provincial 
constitution.  My statement on that was that it was before the 
courts.  The deference that we owe to a court as a co-ordinate 
institution of government does not allow us to hold a selective 
referendum in B.C. while that process is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did pick up, though, the comments of the hon. member for 
Burnaby—Douglas who quite rightly raised the issue with the 
Leader of the Opposition about going for a nation-wide 
referendum, and the Leader of the Opposition retreated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the large issue, I have been arguing for 20 years for basic 
changes in the constitutional system.  If we want to go the Swiss 
way, Switzerland is a different society from ours—what was 
said—the country that built cuckoo clocks but what else. If we 
want an analogy there, let us do it, but let us do it as part of 
a comprehensive constitutional reform and not just pluck it out 
because it happens to suit us for a passing moment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you know, 
the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development, of which I am a member, has just come back from 
touring British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by saying that, when this decision was taken in 
committee—and it had been taken in the House earlier by the 
government House leader—I immediately accused the Liberals of 
doing the tango with the Reform Party. There are tangos that can 
be very graceful, with the two partners following each other's 
moves perfectly, and there are tangos that can be more 
difficult;  it is, after all, a fairly complicated step.  On 
this trip, the Reform-Liberal tango was a forced affair. 
The two partners found themselves forced to dance with one other 
and more than once stepped on each other's toes.  It was, I 
think, a painful exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what happened.  Simply put, the Reform Party invited the 
Liberals to come along on this tour in British Columbia, and the 
Liberals had no choice but to agree.  Otherwise the Minister of 
Finance would not have been able to put on his big economic show 
in London, Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first tango was quite a challenge for both partners.  There 
is another one in the works, which will be a far more graceful 
event, because the two partners are accustomed to each other.  I 
will read part of the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the federal government 
should conduct a province wide referendum in British 
Columbia...prior to [—] 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that Quebec is beginning to know something about 
referendums decided on by Ottawa.  This is paternalism taken to 
the extreme.  How can the federal government tell British 
Columbia that it is going to hold a referendum in this province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the official opposition raises a good point in 
commenting that the Liberal government is in the process of 
cooking up all sorts of things relating to a future referendum 
in Quebec.  We heard it last week, and we heard it again today. 
There is even talk of a motion or bill being introduced before 
the end of the week.  I believe Quebec is capable of deciding 
its future for itself.  Quebec does not need Ottawa to tell it 
how to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is in 
the process of looking at the possibility of having the 
percentage be 60% rather than 50%.  What next?  It may say “Here 
is the question to be imposed on Quebecers” and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party and the Liberals make a lovely couple dancing 
to the tune of paternalism taken to the extreme.  This country 
needs to accept the existence of people who are different.  I 
will get back to that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the question of a constitutional amendment, opponents of 
the agreement, particular the ones on the Reform side, are 
saying that this is a constitutional amendment, that it will 
create another level of government and that consequently, since 
it will shape the future of British Columbia, a referendum must 
be held in order to ask all of the people of British Columbia to 
learn about the issue, take a position, and vote on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem, in my opinion, is that this is not a constitutional 
amendment, any more than it was one when the people of the Yukon 
accepted their land claims and self-government—and this was 
debated here.  There was no referendum, either in Canada or in 
the Yukon, to find out if there was agreement on that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, the aboriginal nations affected hold referendums. 
The Nisga'a held a referendum, but not the Yukon nations or the 
James Bay Cree.  There was never a call in Quebec to vote or 
hold a referendum on the future of Quebec in relation to the 
treaty with the people of James Bay.  I am speaking of before 
1982, when we did not have the new Constitution.  The James Bay 
treaty dates from 1975. For us, therefore, this is not a 
constitutional amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing has been raised by our opponents. They claim there 
was not enough consultation. 
I have here a few notes on the consultations held.  In my 
opinion, the best consultations do not involve just statistics 
and reports of what went on.  When one is a member of a touring 
delegation—I had to go, myself—there are many ways of listening to 
people.  A person can just listen to the witnesses or take the 
opportunity, as well, at mealtime or after hearings, to go and 
speak with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not at all impressed by the Reform Party mobilizations in 
the five cities in British Columbia. A handful of people wanted 
to prevent witnesses from speaking and parliamentarians from 
deliberating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw a few in Prince George, very few in Smithers.  In 
Vancouver, there were a few more, because they made an effort. 
There were some 200 demonstrators outside. 
These people came in to disrupt the work of the committee for 
almost one hour on the last day, on the Friday. Unfortunately, 
this was not a popular initiative among the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these hearings had been televised in British Columbia, the 
Reform Party would have sunk to an all-time low. This is not the 
way to proceed. The way to proceed is to bring in witnesses— 
these people had the opportunity to send witnesses to the 
aboriginal affairs committee—and to let them testify. One does 
not gather people in a room to try to continually interrupt 
others, which is what went on all week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not impressed, either by the size of the protest or the 
way these people tried to defend they views which, in my 
opinion, are undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now take a look at the consultation process. 
I have some figures here. Since 1991, federal and provincial 
negotiators have held 250 public consultation and information 
sessions in northwestern British Columbia. This is quite 
impressive. The forestry sector held close to 30 meetings, while 
the fisheries sector committee held 25. The Nass Valley 
Residence Association also organized meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 30 public 
information meetings, including open houses, fairs, 
presentations to school boards and chambers of commerce, were 
held throughout the region. The Kitimat-Skeena regional advisory 
committee, the Nass Valley Residents Association and the Treaty 
Negotiations Advisory Committee expressed their views to 
negotiators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 50 consultation meetings took place during the negotiations 
on the Nisga'a final agreement. 
Also, the provincial legislature's standing committee on 
aboriginal affairs held hearings in a number of British Columbia 
communities.  In addition, our own committee held a week of 
public hearings there. I would remind the House that again this 
week another thirty or forty people will appear either in person 
or via videoconferencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, as I have already said, the British Columbia 
legislature debated for some 120 hours. This is the longest 
debate that has ever been held in the history of the Legislative 
Assembly of British Columbia.  So we do not want to hear it said 
that they are calling for a referendum because they want to 
consult people.  I did consult the people, in the various 
restaurants and other places we visited in British Columbia, 
both in the north and in the south of the province. 
Those people seemed fairly satisfied, and we have proof of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former union member myself, I can tell the House that, on 
the last day, representatives of Treasury Board and of unions 
came to the table to tell us that they had consulted their 
membership.  When unions use the word consult, that means a lot: 
consultations at the local, regional and provincial levels, 
usually.  CLC President Ken Georgetti told us “We debated the 
issue, and there was far from unanimity.  A number of points did 
not get past our membership very smoothly, but there has been 
consultation and there is union agreement on this”.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What struck me even more, however, was that many representatives 
of the economic community and the Vancouver chamber of commerce 
came to tell us that they had no problem with that, because it 
would finally resolve the whole issue of uncertainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a few minutes, I will talk to you of the problem of 
uncertainty, because it is another tactic our adversaries use to 
say things will be terrible, that it will be the end of the 
world for British Columbia.  I even heard it being likened to 
Bosnia and Chechnya a few minutes ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree with that.  I had given as an example the WTO 
negotiations, which are to begin this month, and our disputes 
with our major economic trading partner, the United States.  It 
is usual to have disputes with people, but they are resolved 
through negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, making statements that it will be like the cases of Bosnia 
and Chechnya is like saying the Americans will drop an atomic 
bomb on Canada if they are not satisfied with the WTO agreement. 
I do not think the discussions should be viewed this way.  It 
is not through litigation or confrontation but rather through 
negotiation and consultation that this is achieved.  And that is 
what has been done, in my view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our opponents keep telling us—and I heard them again this 
morning—the importance of equality, the great importance of 
equality.  For them, it is pretty simple: everyone should be 
equal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that at second reading and I repeat it.  Quebecers will 
not agree to being equal to other Canadians.  I have showed a 
schema to a number of witnesses and they agreed. In fact, they 
said that was the way it is, and I think we have come to an 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can I go about taking apart the whole argument of equality 
and uncertainty?  I would first like to explain something to the 
Reformers.  We have to start with the question “Do they 
recognize for the aboriginal peoples?” 
Do they recognize that there are aboriginal peoples and nations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Quebec have already introduced a motion in the National 
Assembly to recognize the 11 first nations.   But once the first 
nations are not recognized, because this is what the Reformers 
are calling for, once the distinct character of Quebec is not 
recognized, because according to the Reform Party, Prince Edward 
Island has the same power in Canada as Quebec and Ontario do, 
then we have many reservations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, there is not agreement on complete equality, and once 
that is the case, the same thing happens that is happening with 
the Reformers:  there is an attempt to frighten people, to tell 
them that some people have specific rights, but that they do 
not.  We are all too familiar with this scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one agree with recognizing aboriginal peoples, just as I 
would agree that Quebecers represent a distinct nation. 
Unfortunately, there are not many people in the House who are 
prepared to allow Quebec that recognition; not even among the 
Quebec members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if someone like myself or my party recognizes 
aboriginal peoples?  Automatically, not everyone is equal.  They 
have specific rights.  We are seeing quite a few such rights 
being imposed.  The courts themselves are imposing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day, when we debated the motion on Atlantic fisheries 
in relation to the Marshall ruling, I listed all the cases that 
we are losing one after the other. Calder, Sparrow, Delgamuukw 
are all supreme court rulings that support aboriginals and thus 
give them specific rights. Today, we as legislators have the 
opportunity to grant specific rights, and we will do so if we 
adopt the treaty that is now before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we give specific rights to aboriginals and recognize them as 
peoples and nations, then we must agree with them on some kind 
of partnership agreement, and the Nisga'a treaty is a perfect 
example of such an agreement. It sets out powers and determines 
which are Canada's and which will be the Nisga'as'. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must put this in an agreement if we want to reconcile 
everybody's interests and ensure that we will not get all 
tangled up in laws that contradict one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jurisdictions over areas such as culture or language are often 
delegated. In this case, we will even have a Nisga'a government 
and a constitution that will include provisions on citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the agreement goes very far. But I remind 
all those who are listening to us that other agreements have 
also gone quite far. Negotiations on self-government and Yukon 
land claims went very, very far. The agreement obviously goes 
beyond a private citizen joining with the Canadian nation, 
because this person already has every power. 
Here we agree to give these people partial powers and to see how 
it can all be reconciled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By negotiating a partnership between two nations, between 
Canadians and the Nisga'a, certainty has been created.  The 
final argument of our opponents has been done away with, that 
being that supposedly terrible uncertainty will result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty contains everything relating to natural resources, 
forestry and fishing.  Everything.  According to the witnesses I 
heard, including the biologists, there is no problem because a 
percentage is given for fisheries.  In a given area, the Nisga'a 
may have 26% of the take, but that 26% is not a set figure.  If 
the fishery resources decrease, it will be 26% of the take at 
that time.  The figure for the next year could be different.  It 
could be more, or it could be less, but it is always 26%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that we have found the way to negotiate between 
one nation and another, saying “This is the way we will go about 
things together”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for me to give this explanation, because I have 
heard all kinds of things said.  In my opinion, overall the 
witnesses were in favour of the agreement.  Some came to tell us 
that they were not, and why not, but I feel that their opposing 
arguments did not take them far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as this being a constitutional amendment is concerned, I 
say it is not.  As for saying that equality must come first, 
come what may, I do not agree with that as a Quebecer and I know 
the Nisga'a do not agree either.  As far as creating uncertainty 
is concerned, I do not agree because the treaty defines with 
certainty all areas of jurisdiction it has been agreed to hand 
over to the aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not change opinion on the Nisga'a.  We have told them we 
will walk with them.  The translation into Nisga'a of “We will 
walk with the Nisga'a” is: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[Editor's Note: Member spoke in Nisga'a] 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not changed our viewpoint.  We have heard the opinions 
of certain nations, such as the Gitanyow or the Gitksan.  It was 
in fact the Bloc that offered to mediate to see whether 
agreement was possible.  We are currently looking at various 
formulae with the Nisga'a as well, but we support the entire 
matter and the action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying at the start of my speech, the Reform motion is 
outrageously paternalistic.  We cannot agree with it. 
They cannot say to the Nisga'a, 61% of whom accepted the 
agreement “Now that that's all done, we will water it down in a 
massive referendum.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have raised the issue of the majority imposing it on the 
minority, but there is also the fact that the work was well 
done.  When they talk about nation to nation, there are 
representatives in parliament.  There are representatives in 
this parliament and there are representatives of the people in 
the British Columbia legislature.  I think these people have 
done a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also bear in mind that 50 more agreements are yet to be 
negotiated, and it is not true to say the Nisga'a agreement will 
create a precedent.  There may well be passages other nations 
will pick up, but my experience as critic for aboriginal affairs 
tells me that there are about as many agreements on 
self-government as there are nations, because each nation has its 
point of view.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people condemned the whole issue of taxation, because the 
Nisga'a will waive the tax exemption to which they are entitled. 
They will start paying taxes in 8 or 12 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many nations told us “We would not have accepted that”. Some 
might say this is a terrible precedent but, in my opinion, that 
precedent is no worse than what the Yukon nations or the Cree 
have negotiated. If we must hold a referendum each time a 
self-government agreement is concluded with a nation, the process 
will never end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will oppose the Reform 
Party motion, and I tell my Nisga'a friends who are listening, 
including Joe Gosnell, Harry Nice and Eric Grandison that we 
will certainly see each other again this week to try to see how 
we can work out the final details. They can rest assured that 
the Bloc Quebecois and myself will vote against the Reform 
Party's motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to respond to a few of the comments made by 
the Bloc member, much to my absolute disbelief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the House the exact truth of what happened. 
I was at that meeting in Victoria with the committee listening to 
the witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member stated that the Reform Party was blocking, 
preventing, or stopping the witnesses from speaking. The truth be 
known that every single witness on that list when I was there got 
their entire allotted time and more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He left us with the notion that he heard words spoken, such as 
Bosnia and Chechnya. He put that in the context that the Reform 
Party was this or that.  What he is not telling the House is that 
it was aboriginal people from the Nass Valley who used those 
words.  These were the words of aboriginal witnesses from the 
Nass Valley who testified before the committee, their words and 
nobody else's.  The House should take note of that.  That is the 
absolute gospel truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also used the words “a paternalistic motion”. Imagine that, 
a paternalistic motion.  Can anyone imagine that a vote is 
paternalistic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to leave the House with one last thought.  The sole 
purpose in this House of the member who just spoke is to divide 
this country in two, to create division.  That is exactly what 
the Nisga'a agreement is going to do and that is probably why the 
Bloc is supporting it.  It wants to create division and to divide 
the country in two.  The hon. member has no other reason for 
sitting in this House.  That is why he is here.  His party has 
stated that on the record. It is no wonder the Bloc is supporting 
the agreement, because it is going to create division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate part is that what has happened with the 
aboriginal people in Canada over the last 30 to 50 years has not 
worked.  They deserve to have a solution that does work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> What about the Indian Act?

preventing the witnesses.  Would the hon. member stand in the 
House and name one witness that was on the government invited 
witness list that did not get an opportunity to speak?  I do not 
think he can.

get it. Yes, some witnesses were prevented from testifying and 
yes we were forced to adjourn on several occasions. It just so 
happens that those who forced us to interrupt our discussions 
were all wearing a Reform Party button, or a T-shirt or big hat 
with the word “Reform” on it. These are the people who prevented 
us from holding discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the witnesses were given back the time originally 
allotted to them, but we were forced to adjourn on a number of 
occasions for several minutes. On the Friday, when we were in 
Victoria, we were forced to adjourn for almost an hour, and it 
was not Bloc Quebecois people who were in the room to boo the 
witnesses and members of parliament present.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As for paternalism, that is what it is.  If Ottawa decides how a 
province is to behave, or how the Nisga'a are to behave, that is 
paternalism.  It is just as I said earlier.  The government 
wants to adopt a paternalistic approach with aboriginal peoples, 
as well as in British Columbia.  I said that the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs wants to do the same in Quebec.  It is 
the same thing, and the same word applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the expression “nation to nation” and for our wanting to 
break up Canada, we have been saying for months and for years 
that we want a partnership agreement, like the one the Nisga'a 
will sign with the Parliament of Canada and have already signed 
with British Columbia.  We want the same approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only natural that we would be in favour of the approach 
taken by the Nisga'a in their quest for autonomy.  I say to all 
first nations in Canada and in Quebec that, should they need the 
support of the Bloc Quebecois in moving toward autonomy, they 
can always count on us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to take what my Reform colleague has said one 
step further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from the Bloc said clearly that Quebec does not 
believe in the equality of all Canadians.  The Bloc is here to 
promote separation.  The government said that there was a process 
whereby everybody was actively involved.  It now becomes obvious 
that was not the case.  Everyone was not actively involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have the Bloc members making it absolutely clear that 
they support this because it will lead to the separation of 
groups, and the government is also supporting this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Globe and Mail</I> put it very well when it said that the 
government's aboriginal policies would lead to separation, both 
political and economic. That is why the Bloc supports this.  Now 
the government goes along with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said very clearly that the minister consulted all 
sides.  It has in fact created the sides. It is responsible for 
dividing up our society into all of these various groups because 
of the improper process, because it does not allow the moving 
toward equality.  I think that is the problem.  That is probably 
why the Bloc is doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said that the courts are criticizing members of 
parliament for speaking up and criticizing some court decisions. 
Many Canadians are concerned that the courts are dictating 
legislation.  Do the courts have the right to tell members of 
parliament how they shall speak on an issue like this?  I would 
the member to answer that.  I would also ask him if he agrees 
with the Minister of Justice who says “We have one law for all 
but it is flexible in its application”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government makes a big point about treating everybody 
equally, but the Minister of Justice says “We have one law for 
all but it is flexible in its application”.  Does the member 
agree with the government when it makes those statements? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, the more I listen to the 
Reformers, the more I come to the conclusion that the problem I 
pointed out earlier boils down to this: they do not recognize 
the aboriginal peoples, and they do not recognize Quebecers as a 
people. They do not recognize that they themselves are part of 
the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not recognize Canadians in the Reform Party.  That is not 
what I saw in British Columbia.  Those who booed us and 
prevented us from speaking were sporting Reform Party T-shirts, 
hats and buttons.  Ordinary people in the street agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for flexibility, I am in agreement with that. 
Once it is acknowledged that there are aboriginal peoples, that 
there is a Quebec people, that devolution of responsibilities is 
going to be accepted, flexibility is needed.  This does not mean 
getting around the Criminal Code.  This is not what it means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that they may have ways of administering justice that 
differ from ours, the sentencing circles for one.  This shows 
that the aboriginal nations are different.  I find that this 
agreement acknowledges this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my Reform colleague that I hope he will always manage 
to understand the importance for Canadians and for Quebecers of 
recognizing the aboriginal nations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I, along with the hon. member, were in British Columbia 
last week at the Nisga'a hearings.  Last Tuesday, we were in 
Smithers and listened to presentations by the Gitanyow Band who 
expressed extreme concern over their land being put into the 
Nisga'a agreement.  The Bloc members at that time seemed to 
listen with great concern and indicated that they would be 
prepared to support an amendment to the treaty which would take 
the questioned land out of the Nisga'a treaty until such time as 
it was settled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously they would like the native people to see them as 
native friendly people so the aboriginal people in Quebec will 
not be concerned when the next referendum question comes up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the hon. member say that simply to seem friendly to the 
Gitanyow while he was there or will the Bloc stand by that and 
support at least an amendment to this treaty? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is absolutely 
right.  The Bloc Quebecois are the ones who told the Gitanyow, 
and even the Gitksan who have joined with the Gitanyow in some 
proposals. And that will occur this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That did not stop me the day after from picking up the phone the 
next day to call the Nisga'a and asking “How could we 
accommodate everybody?”  It is important to accommodate 
everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the Reform Party is trying to find all areas of 
tension and to focus on them to prevent this bill from passing. 
We can see what they are doing. 
But our way is a constructive one and, if necessary, we will sit 
down with the Gitanyow, the Gitksan and the Nisga'a, and we will 
eventually come up with a proposal that will be agreeable to 
everyone, with the additional information that the Nisga'a will 
have to provide to us on this issue. It is true that witnesses 
see things from their own perspective, but so do those who will 
benefit from this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois cannot be criticized for having a 
constructive approach on this issue and for ensuring that 
everyone's interests are taken into account. I must, however, 
condemn those who purposely draw attention to existing tensions, 
in an attempt to prevent the bill from being passed. The Bloc 
Quebecois prefers to have a constructive approach rather than a 
destructive one. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member neglected 
to answer the question I posed with regard to a statement the 
government made with respect to the courts being able to tell 
members of parliament how to speak on this issue.  Does he agree 
with the government's position that the courts should be able to 
dictate to us how to speak on these aboriginal affairs? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not agree with that. In 
fact, I say so every year when the Indian affairs minister comes 
before the standing committee. I ask him “Are you not tired of 
letting the courts tell you how to proceed?” It seems to me this 
government should display greater courage and settle fundamental 
issues, before the courts force it to change its policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member that the Liberal government should 
show much more initiative, to avoid having Canadian courts, and 
particularly the supreme court, tell us how to proceed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  I have another brief question, Mr. 
Speaker.  It really puzzles me that the Bloc members would oppose 
a referendum on this issue. They are very strong on a referendum 
deciding the separation of Quebec. Why do they oppose a 
referendum of the people of British Columbia with regard to this 
issue? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, regarding the issue of 
referendums, it is obvious that the Reform Party will tell us 
“Since you want a referendum in Quebec, why do you not want one 
for British Columbia?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member to take a look at the wording of his 
own motion, which basically asks the federal government to 
impose a referendum on British Columbia. As Quebecers, we do not 
want anything imposed on us.

to hold their own referendum, without Ottawa's intrusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is Bloc Quebecois position. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to just touch on 
that referendum question.  What is the difference?   British 
Columbians would not have it imposed, they are asking for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to the hon. member that I did a scientific poll in 
my riding on constituents' attitudes with regards to the Nisga'a 
treaty.  Not only did we ask straightforward questions, but also 
did a lot of other polling at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things this poll did was identify voter trends within 
the riding.  Of the people who voted NDP provincially in the last 
election, the NDP government being the one that put this treaty 
on the table, 70% of those people wanted a referendum on the 
Nisga'a treaty.  A referendum is not being imposed on B.C.  B.C. 
is asking for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member join with us in supporting the rights of British 
Columbians and their demand to have a referendum on this? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to instruct the 
members from British Columbia.  They know their corner of the 
country best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I can tell them their provincial colleague, Bill 
Vander Zalm, of the Reform Party, is not quite on the right track 
in saying we should buy the Indians “Let us give them $100,000, 
get rid of the reserves and that will be the end of that”.  I 
think that is a poor approach, and I would say to Mr. Vander Zalm 
that, if he wants to be elected, if he wants to be a Reformer, 
this is the right way to go about it, as he does not recognize 
the aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Buying people, telling them that we will assimilate them and 
saying “Let us pay out $100,000, and that will be the end of the 
aboriginal nations”, is not the approach to take.  That means 
they know very little about them.  That means they know very 
little about Quebec too.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to advise you that I will be dividing my time 
today with my colleague, the hon. member for Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the hon. member for the Yukon, who attended the 
hearings on this matter, unfortunately is not able to participate 
in the debate today.  She has played a very important and 
critical role on behalf of New Democrats on this very important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today on behalf of my colleagues in the New Democratic 
Party to strongly oppose the motion which the Reform Party has 
brought before the House of Commons. I regard this as a 
desperate, last minute attempt by the Reform Party to subvert the 
Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the hon. members from the Reform Party has talked about a 
scientific poll that he did in his constituency on the Nisga'a 
treaty.   The Nisga'a leadership made it very clear on November 4 
when they appeared before the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs and Northern Development that there are two treaties 
being debated in British Columbia today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Chief Joe Gosnell, one of the treaties was actually 
negotiated in a process lasting several years.  This is the 
treaty referred to by the government and by the other opposition 
parties other than the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second treaty, which is now the subject of debate, was what 
they called the make-believe treaty.  This is the treaty 
described by the Reform Party, by the British Columbia Liberal 
Party, by a variety of editorialists and by other individuals. If 
Reform Party members are polling their constituents about a 
make-believe treaty, a treaty that does not exist, a treaty that 
has been invented to try to scare British Columbians, it is no 
wonder they would vote against that treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the truth comes out, when British Columbians are informed 
of the actual content of this treaty, as I had the opportunity to 
do at a public forum in my constituency very recently, they will 
support the contents of this treaty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder particularly in some of the rural communities of 
British Columbia that there are British Columbians who are not 
getting the facts, when we look at where they might get those 
facts from.  There are Reform Party members of parliament who are 
engaged in a campaign of systematic distortion of the contents of 
the treaty.  What do they say about the treaty?  They say it is 
like apartheid. It is one of the most offensive and appalling 
distortions of history when the Reform Party talks about this 
treaty as in any way being akin to apartheid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked for many years, as did a number of members of the 
House, fighting against apartheid.  Indeed Your Honour was in the 
forefront of that struggle and will recall our visit to South 
Africa to celebrate the triumph of democracy in South Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who understand history will know that if anything, 
apartheid in fact was at least partly based not on this kind of 
nation to nation treaty, but on the reserve system in the Indian 
Act which this treaty would finally rid us of.  To talk about 
apartheid in the context of the Nisga'a treaty is totally 
dishonest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know as well that the media coverage in many of the rural and 
smaller communities on the Nisga'a treaty has been distorted.  It 
is no wonder when David Black who publishes over 60 community 
newspapers serving some of those smaller communities gives orders 
to his editorial writers that they are not allowed to write 
editorials in support of the Nisga'a treaty. David Black the 
publisher is forcing his newspapers to tell one story.  It is no 
wonder that kind of distortion takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party says that it believes in consultation. Yet the 
member for Skeena himself has not met in six years with the 
leadership of the Nisga'a people.  He represents that community. 
He has represented that community since 1993. I defy any member 
of the Reform Party to stand in the House today and tell me one 
occasion since 1993 when the member for Skeena has met with the 
leadership of the Nisga'a people whom he represents. Reform 
members are phonies when they talk about consultation.  The only 
consultation they believe in is talking to themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been extensive consultation with the people of British 
Columbia on this treaty.  Before the 1996 provincial election, an 
agreement in principle was signed.  That agreement in principle 
was signed and a 13 point mandate for provincial negotiators was 
presented. Where was the provincial Liberal Party then?  Where 
was the federal Reform Party then?  Were they calling for a 
referendum? No.  There was not one word calling for a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only was the Reform Party silent on any suggestion of a 
referendum but Mike de Jong, spokesperson for the B.C. Liberal 
Party, the kissing cousins of the Reform Party on this treaty, 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be unfair at this point to inject the referendum 
card into the ratification process involving the Nisga'a treaty. 
Those negotiations have been ongoing....  To say at literally the 
eleventh hour that it will now become a component of that 
ratification process would be, I think, unfair. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfair indeed it would be.  We in the New Democratic Party say 
that there has been extensive debate and consultation on this 
issue, including the longest debate in the history of the B.C. 
legislature, 116 hours.  No bill in the B.C. legislature has ever 
been debated longer than the Nisga'a bill.  There were extensive 
community hearings.  There was the aboriginal affairs committee. 
There were 116 hours of debate in the B.C. legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for parliament to respond not just to the 
historical rights of the Nisga'a people, but to respond to what I 
believe the majority of British Columbians who were informed of 
the contents of the treaty actually want. 
They want fairness and certainty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a Reform Party member of parliament who said, 
“Uncertainty directly related to the Nisga'a treaty is hurting 
the economy of northwestern British Columbia”.  That was said by 
a Reform Party member of parliament, yet Reform members want a 
referendum that would drag this out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say hypothetically that the referendum were to result in 
a no vote.  What then?  Would we go back to the drawing table and 
start the negotiations again?  Why would the Nisga'a people 
negotiate in those circumstances?  Why would any aboriginal first 
nation negotiate in those circumstances?  They would say that 
they would go to the courts. We have seen what happens when we 
leave it to the Supreme Court of Canada.  We saw the chaos which 
resulted in the east coast fishery. Let us negotiate in good 
faith as this Nisga'a treaty has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point is with respect to the notion of a referendum on 
minority rights.  In my view it is profoundly unacceptable and 
dangerous to suggest that the rights of minorities should be 
subject to a referendum of a majority.  In a democracy we respect 
minority rights.  We elect democratic provincial MLAs and federal 
members of parliament to reflect the views of their constituents 
and at the end of the day to respect the rights of minorities, 
and those should not be subject to the whim of a majority in a 
referendum vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party quite clearly does not believe in equality for 
aboriginal people.  That is very clear.  We know it does not 
believe in equality.  This motion is all about a last minute, 
desperate attempt by the Reform Party which is trying desperately 
to salvage some vestige of credibility as it slips away more and 
more.  We saw it slipping away in the byelection in Saskatoon. It 
was losing support there.  Reformers are desperately grasping for 
power, trying to press the buttons, but the people of British 
Columbia will say no to that kind of agenda.  They are saying no 
now and they will say no in the next election when that member 
from the Fraser Valley will be history.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that was an interesting speech, I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about respecting minority rights in this 
House.  I remind him of some of the less honourable aspects of 
how this House respected minority rights.  How about the Japanese 
during the second world war?  How about the Chinese once the 
railroads were built?  How about Indians being separated out from 
Canadian society and being put into the Indian Act? Where does he 
think those things arose from?  Out of the clear blue sky?  They 
came out of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member thinks Canadian people would have 
supported them at the time or had they been put to a referendum, 
might they have had more wisdom than parliamentarians. I suggest 
they have more wisdom on the Nisga'a treaty.  They also rejected 
the Charlottetown accord which separated people in this country 
one from another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thankful for the grassroots Canadians who oppose the 
special interest politics this House stands for so often, 
particularly through the NDP party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted the 
member for Prince Albert has given those examples because that is 
precisely the danger of the approach of the Reform Party today. 
What if there had been a referendum on the internment of Japanese 
Canadians in World War II and afterward?  The fact of the matter 
is that was popular at the time and it was precisely because of 
those populist whims that the government was prepared to move. If 
there had been a Reform Party back then, its members would have 
been standing up saying they wanted a referendum on the issue and 
they would have trampled the rights of Japanese Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the Chinese head tax and the appalling treatment 
of Chinese Canadians, if there had been a Reform Party back then, 
its members would have been up there on their hind legs braying 
“We want a referendum and to hell with minority rights”.  That 
is the position of the Reform Party.  It does not give a damn 
about minority rights.  It never has and it does not now for the 
Nisga'a.

I am delighted to be part of this vigorous, very historical and 
important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member to comment on what I think is the 
central question concerning the referendum. The Reform Party has 
argued that we, Canada and British Columbia, ought to have a 
referendum because there is a constitutional amendment.  The 
member for Burnaby, I believe, was a member of parliament 
throughout 1980 to 1983 when we were amending the constitution 
and bringing in the charter. He is very familiar with sections 25 
and 35(1).  If I recall, he played a role in the standing 
committee that was drafting some of those provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is particularly important not only because he is a 
lawyer and has participated in the House on those kinds of 
discussions, but because he is a member of parliament from 
British Columbia and represents the people that the other party 
purports to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he in his view believe at all that there is a 
constitutional change here in recognition of the Nisga'a treaty? 
If there is one, would that not necessitate a Canadian 
referendum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in response to the

Marcel de la Sablonnière, or Father Sablon to those who knew him 
well, died on Saturday at the age of 81. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Born in 1918, Father Sablon was appointed in 1952 to the 
position of director of the Centre de loisirs 
Immaculée-Conception, in Montreal, a function he performed wisely 
and capably for more than 40 years. 
He saw the potential of sports and recreation to provide a goal 
for certain troubled youth and to keep others from dropping out 
of the running.  His many achievements included founding the 
Auberge du P'tit Bonheur in 1962. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those working directly or indirectly with children will never 
forget Father de la Sablonnière.  At a time when our young 
people too often tell us they have no leaders, Father Sablon 
filled this void for many of them, and they will be forever 
grateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you, Father, for your generous efforts to improve the 
lives of our young Quebecers.

water, legal status of isolated fee simple titles and replacement 
tenures, forestry, mining, fisheries and wildlife.

Mr. Speaker, community dollars and staff resources in local 
employment centres are being shifted to higher populated areas as 
a result of the new funding formula adopted by HRDC.  As a 
result, communities such as Antigonish and Guysborough in Nova 
Scotia will be negatively affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new formulas will reduce funding to the very programs that 
assist individuals, youth, employers and communities in rural 
Canada.  Rural residents will be left with no option but to use 
electronic communication to access services currently delivered 
at the local offices.  This will result in further delays and 
complications.  The loss of revenues will be felt very severely 
by the poorest of the poor.  Mildly put, this is Robin Hood in 
reverse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the government did not consider the ramifications of its 
decision and the negative impact it would have on hundreds of 
rural citizens struggling just to get by.  Reallocating 
government services and resources from rural areas to more 
populated areas threatens the survival of many communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Liberal government to reconsider its position with 
regard to its restructuring plans.  This is a huge concern to 
many rural citizens and ignoring the seriousness of this problem

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we intend to put this deal to more than one vote in the 
House of Commons and the other place, a vote by elected 
representatives of the population of British Columbia and in fact 
all of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government's idea of democratic government makes a 
mockery of the very concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It uses closure and time allocation to choke off debate in the 
House.  It stacks committees and committee hearings.  It 
disregards results of democratic elections like the Senate 
elections in Alberta.  It denies free votes to its own members in 
the House and it denies votes to other Canadians through 
referendums like in the Nisga'a case.  How can such a government 
possibly be pretending to exercise democratic leadership in 
government when it behaves in that way? 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are the government because Canadians through our 
democratic process decided to elect more Liberal members than any 
other party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the hon. member wants to do something essentially 
undemocratic.  He wants to do something which he was not asked by 
Canadians to do, and that is to be the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we listened to the opposition.  It wanted to 
have, as did Liberal members, hearings in British Columbia.  It 
wanted to help choose the witnesses.  We readily agreed to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are having debates in the House.  We will vote on the results 
of those debates, so we are democratic in spite of the efforts of 
the opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is that kind of reasoning which led the people of 
British Columbia to reject the majority of Liberal candidates in 
the last federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 3 of the federal Referendum Act allows for “any 
question relating to the Constitution of Canada” to be put to 
the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a agreement, particularly in part 2, refers repeatedly 
to the constitution of Canada, in particular constitution 
sections 25 and 35.  The referendum law is on the books.  This 
issue pertains to it.  The mechanism is there.  Why will the 
government not simply use that law? 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is our position that this agreement does not change 
the constitution of Canada.  Therefore the hon. member's efforts 
to say that the Referendum Act applies are simply mistaken, to 
put the best possible colour on the depth of his error. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Nisga'a treaty is not only dividing Canadians.  It is 
dividing Liberals as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>B.C. Liberal leaders are opposing this deal.  Gordon Campbell 
called it “an unacceptable slight to all Canadians”, while his 
predecessor, Gordon Gibson, urged MPs to “say no to a separate 
government structure for Indians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government here is determined to ram through the 
Nisga'a deal without letting British Columbians have their say. 
Why will not the Indian affairs minister just admit that he is 
afraid of holding a referendum? 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to read a little 
referendum that just took place last week in the riding of the 
member for Skeena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a race for mayor and, as I understand it, the mayor 
was very much in favour of the Nisga'a deal.  There were 3,500 
votes cast and Mr. Jack Talstra got 2,056 of them, and he is big 
supporter of the agreement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
they had a referendum in Smithers too and it did not go exactly 
the way the minister would like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Indian affairs minister introduced the Nisga'a treaty 
bill in the House he said that he would invoke closure if he just 
did not happen to like the way the debate was going.  Now that is 
democracy in action.  He also said that he would not use a 
referendum because it is just too complicated for the people of 
B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the minister what part of the bill is a little too 
complicated for the folks in B.C. to understand.  What would that 
be?

elected, to make choices and decisions for Canadians.  We will 
not take the easy way out by going to referendum every time we 
have to make a policy for the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say something else to the hon. member. This particular 
party represents less than 9% of Canadians in the polling just 
done in the last few weeks.  Why is it that we somehow have to 
accept what it would like Canadians to do and what it would like 
us to do when the other 91% of Canadians say the government's—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 21, the Premier of Quebec said as follows  “When the

but to follow”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court has ruled that Quebecers have the right never 
to see their membership in Canada questioned, unless they

<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, by

while saying that he will not.  He is suggesting that the

democracy on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he realize that, ultimately, what he wants to do is once

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

the rules of democracy and on the need for a clear question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What gives the minister the right to think that the federal 
government is more credible than Quebec when it comes to 
formulating a question?  Is he basing it on the clarity of the 
question in the Charlottetown referendum? 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Charlottetown referendum question referred to a 
signed accord.  The accord was complex, and this is one reason 
Canadians did not approve it— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> —but it was a signed agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question in 1995 referred to an accord between Quebec and 
Canada that had not been signed.  A single question contained 
two issues: one on independence and one on remarriage with 
Canada.  That is not a clear question, in the opinion of the 
vast majority of Quebecers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
vast majority of Quebecers are represented by three parties in 
the Quebec National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before he imposes a referendum question, is the minister aware 
that all the parties represented in the National Assembly oppose 
intervention by the federal government on this issue? 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

induced into negotiating the break-up of Canada, the end of 
Canada for Quebecers, with a misleading question.

question, I would like to remind the House that on Saturday we 
celebrated National Child Day.  It was an important opportunity 
for us to meet with families, with children and with youth to 
talk about the issues facing our children and the strategies that 
we must implement to ensure they have a great future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind the House that it was a member of

thank him for this opportunity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is still avoiding the topic of child poverty altogether, 
just as the government has been avoiding the plight of poor 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have 1.4 million children living in poverty 
today.  That is the legacy of a Prime Minister who balanced the

that legacy?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

telling us that they want a vision on how we can increase our 
support for Canada's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne we said we would do it in a number 
of ways: through tax strategies, through balancing our 
relationship with the provinces, by increasing the income and the 
services we provide to our children, by increasing parental 
benefits, by looking at our laws and by making sure when we are 
dealing with separation and divorce that children's issues come 
first.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The war against poverty, begun barely ten years ago, has been 
such a total failure that the mayors of major Canadian cities 
describe it as a national disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anti-poverty programs are so confusing that no one can make any 
sense of them any more. Is the minister giving thought to a 
single program in collaboration with her provincial 
counterparts, a single program to assist the disadvantaged, 
which might be called a guaranteed minimum income?

<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

provinces in support of our children, it is absolutely clear that 
it will take a whole country to ensure that we have a bright 
future for Canada's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have begun that discussion in that debate.  We have the 
national child agenda.  We are building the national children's 
benefit.  We are on track to do in the next millennium what we 
have been able to do for Canadian seniors. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> There has been talk for six 
years now of new programs to inject funds, yet the number of 
poor children has risen from one million to one and one-half 
million.  Food banks are feeding 750,000 persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not enough to get the Minister of Finance or the other 
ministers to act within the framework of the social union? 
Nobody understands the social union.  The only way it could be 
made understandable would be to make it into a weapon in the 
fight against poverty.

that indeed it will take all of us to focus on the issues facing 
Canada's children and to build a platform of structures that will 
help them into the 21st century.  He is absolutely right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of particulars and in terms of taking action, let me 
tell the hon. member that as a result of the national child 
benefit, for example, by July 2000 families earning $20,000 with 
two children will get more than $3,700 per year in assistance. 
They can use that money for issues and needs of their children.

from visiting British Columbia on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 
One of the things I noticed was that the Reformers tried their 
hardest.  I have never seen them work so hard.  In a huge 
metropolitan city like Vancouver, they managed to get a whole 200 
people out to say that they were opposed to the Nisga'a deal. 
When I was in the labour movement, I could do that with one phone 
call and I would get 500 people out.  These people cannot get 
more than 200 people out in a big city like that.  I think that 
means that the people in British Columbia and Vancouver support 
the Nisga'a deal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the health minister has had ample time to review the 
Klein proposal which is clearly incompatible with the intent of 
the Canada Health Act.  In fact, it appears that the health 
minister was given a heads up almost four weeks ago by the 
Alberta government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also knows, because he has said so himself, that 
the best way to ward off the threat of private for profit health 
care is to ensure that we have the highest quality public health 
care system.  There is clearly a need for that kind of decisive 
action and urgent attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question again for the minister is what will he do to ward 
off the destructive Alberta initiative and when will he do it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I know the hon. member shares my conviction that Canadians 
support, want and are best served by a system of public health 
care in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said last week, it is the conviction of this government and 
this minister that we should have a strong public health care 
system which will guide us in reviewing the Alberta proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also say that this is not to suggest that the status quo 
is acceptable because it is not.  We all know that there are 
problems in the health care system that have to be resolved.  We 
will examine the proposal against the principles of the public 
system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how can the minister pretend to be the defender of 
medicare when it is his government that is the architect of its 
destruction?  This is the government that drastically cut 
transfer payments.  This is the government that signed a deal 
with the Alberta government in 1996 to open up the doors for 
private health care delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is really serious, he would act today by 
terminating that arrangement with Alberta.  He would promise, 
with the help of his colleague the Minister of Finance, to 
increase transfer payments.  He would take tough decisive action 
today.  Will he do that, yes or no? 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as the member knows, just a few months ago in this very House we 
tabled a budget which increased the transfers to the provinces 
over the coming five years.  It is the single largest investment 
the government has ever made, signalling the priority that we put 
on health and health care.  In the case of Alberta, that will 
mean very significant sums this year and for the next four years. 
We also said on that occasion that as our balance sheet improves, 
we will do more and we intend to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding is part of it, but also making sure that we have quality 
care and access to quality care is the priority.

</I></B></P><P align=left>During committee the multi-stakeholder group advising the

ready for three years.  In fact, the executive director of the 
Pest Management Regulatory Agency, Dr. Franklin stated “A new 
bill has been drafted.  I believe the bill has been ready since 
1997. The minister is actively considering the appropriate time 
for tabling of the amendments”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is quite simple.  Are we going to update a 30 year 
act today, tomorrow or ever? 
<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there may have been draft legislation five years ago, but the 
advisory committee that is made up of environmentalists, people 
from the industry and consumers was only created by this minister 
last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked that advisory committee to look at proposed legislation 
to make sure that we got it right.  We have to respect 
environmental concerns.  We have to keep in mind the point of 
view of farmers who are competing with Americans who may have 
access to materials which they do not.  We have to keep mind the 
point of view of the industry that is manufacturing products to 
bring to the market.  All of these—

<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last 
year the environment commissioner indicated that Canada and the 
Slovak Republic are the only two industrialized countries that do 
not measure domestic pesticide consumption.  In fact, in Canada 
there is no requirement to produce documentation to describe the 
potential hazards of pesticides to the environment or human 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the minister determines the appropriate time for tabling 
legislation, if he ever does, will this new legislation require

question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.

Mr. Speaker, I want to first underscore that the approach we are 
taking has been embraced both by the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage and the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade. We are leading the world in seeking a 
new cultural instrument to ensure that culture is not captured in 
the aegis of the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason Canada has taken this position and the reason we have 
worked very hard to bring together like-minded countries from 
around the world is precisely because we are a country that 
believes that respect for cultural diversity is part of our 
constitutional heritage.

freedom of conscience and religion in the Canadian Charter of

Canadian military through payment of income taxes is regarded by 
the petitioners as an infringement of the freedom of conscience 
or religion of those citizens who conscientiously object to 
participating in any way in the military and associated 
activities.  Therefore, they call upon parliament to establish 
peace tax legislation by passing into law the conscientious 
objection act which recognizes the right of conscientious 
objectors to not pay for the military, but to apply that portion 
of their taxes that was to be used for military purposes toward 
peaceful, non-military objectives.

Speaker, I rise under Standing Order 52(2) to seek leave to 
propose an emergency debate on Alberta Premier Ralph Klein's 
recently declared intentions to challenge the principles of 
medicare and the delivery of health care under the Canada Health 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday, November 16, Premier Ralph Klein went on the 
airwaves and announced his intentions to pursue contracting out 
to private for profit forces of in patient hospital services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Alberta has a record of privatization in many areas, 
this announcement on November 16 constituted a fundamental shift, 
a profound change, a radical departure from Canada's public 
health system and the principles of the Canada Health Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The action announced last week by Premier Klein is a threat to 
the fundamental public nature of Canada's health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the responsibility of the federal government under the 
Canada Health Act to address this threat and to ensure that the 
letter and spirit of the law are maintained. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In presenting my case today for an emergency debate I will state 
three points.  The first has to do with the urgency surrounding 
this issue.  I would simply suggest that the sentiments of 
Canadians and the comments by the architects of the Canada Health 
Act suggest to us that there may be a fundamental violation of 
the Canada Health Act.  We need parliament to take prompt action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canadians are counting on parliament to speak to this 
fundamental issue of national identity, a fundamental defining 
feature of our Canadian identity.  Canadians are looking to us to 
address this very serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third point has to do with the fact that in the views of 
many, Alberta's position actually may be incompatible with the 
Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real need to act immediately, especially given the 
fact that we have chapter 11 of NAFTA and the upcoming 
negotiations at Seattle around the WTO.  At any time any part of 
our health care system in any part of the country is opened up 
for involvement by a private sector force, particularly an 
American private sector force, our entire Canadian system is 
opened up to that possibility.  It is a very dangerous precedent 
setting move which must be addressed on a timely basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament need the opportunity to speak out on 
behalf of their constituents and Canadians everywhere in the face 
of this threat to the principles of medicare.  This is an area 
around which the government has administrative responsibility.  I 
am talking about an act which was passed in the House in 1984 and 
clearly outlined the principles of medicare, of universality, of 
accessibility, of comprehensiveness, of portability and of 
non-profit administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also related to the fact that the government may be 
responsible for some of the threats to medicare and the fact that 
Alberta moved in the first place.  I refer simply to the accord 
signed by the government in 1996 with Alberta that opened up the 
door to private health care.  I also refer to the very 
significant reduction in transfer payments by the government to 
all provincial health care systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have a number of important points to make.  I think 
nothing short of an emergency debate is in order today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I note the hon. member sent the letter 
to me earlier today in both official languages.  I also note that 
this was her first request for an emergency debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I left her a little more room than I usually do in 
making her case, but in my opinion it does not meet the criteria 
for an emergency debate at this time.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—NISGA'A FINAL AGREEMENT 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK225">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
was a few months ago that we had a debate in the House on another 
opposition motion from the Reform Party.  Reformers were jumping 
up and down in the House and demanding that the House of Commons 
approve a resolution to go to the Supreme Court of Canada to get 
a constitutional ruling on the Nisga'a treaty.  Here we are today 
with another opposition day motion from the Reform Party. They 
are jumping up and down today on what?  Now they want a 
referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing has become very clear in this debate, that the Reform 
Party wants anything but negotiation and resolution.  It will 
look at anything rather than sit down, negotiate and look for 
workable solutions such as has happened with the Nisga'a treaty. 
That has been its agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be very clear that today's debate on the motion from 
the Reform Party has nothing to do with any principle around this 
issue.  It has to do with a Reform Party agenda to create 
division.  It wants to seize on this issue because it sees it as 
a political gold mine to create fear, uncertainty, bias and 
anti-aboriginal sentiment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surprise, surprise.  It is now lined up with the B.C. Reform 
Party, the B.C. Liberal Party, and is on its little campaign with 
Mr. Campbell and Mr. Vander Zalm.  What a great alliance.  Let us 
make no mistake that it is really a campaign of political 
opportunism to systematically, consciously and deliberately 
conduct a campaign of misinformation, fear and opposition to 
entitlement of aboriginal rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were any doubt of that we just had to listen to 
question period today to hear the questions from Reform members, 
including those by the leader of the party who said that the 
Nisga'a treaty was an affront to equality.  The Reform leader is 
dead wrong.  He knows it.  Everybody knows that this treaty is 
actually about equality.  It is about social justice.  It is 
about restoring rights to aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today has nothing to do with democracy. The 
referendum just happens to be the flavour of the day that the 
Reform Party wants to use.  It has nothing to do with democracy. 
It is clearly a desperate attempt to derail a 20 year treaty 
process that has been negotiated in good faith by the Nisga'a 
people, the representatives of the federal government and the 
provincial government.  It has now resulted in an historic 
agreement that is just, that is fair, and that is a perfect fit 
with our constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not just my opinion.  That is the opinion of business 
leaders.  That is the opinion of labour leaders.  That is the 
opinion of thousands of people and hundreds and hundreds of 
groups in British Columbia that have come to the same conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended the aboriginal affairs parliamentary committee 
meeting last Friday in Vancouver.  I had the honour to hear some 
of the witnesses who came before the committee.  I heard Mr. Ken 
Georgetti, president of the Canadian Labour Congress; Mr. Jim 
Sinclair, president of the British Columbia Federation of Labour; 
Angie Schira from the British Columbia Federation of Labour; and 
Mr. John Shields, former president of the British Columbia 
government employees' union.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They laid out for us was how they as a labour movement had been 
very involved in talking to their members, the hundreds of 
thousands of members of the labour movement in British Columbia. 
They toured the province to get out information, to get feedback 
and participated in the advisory committee that existed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard from some very well known and high profile 
business leaders in our province, including the head of B.C. 
Hydro, a former Social Credit cabinet minister.  We heard from 
the chair of Vancouver Board of Trade and from the chair of 
Canadian National Railway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their message was very simple and very clear.  They too had 
observed and participated in the process.  They wanted to see 
this treaty ratified by the House because they understood that it 
brought about a certainty, an equality and a real partnership in 
the relationship between aboriginal people, between the Nisga'a 
people and non-aboriginal people which includes the business 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They told that committee very strongly in no uncertain terms 
that they wanted to see this treaty go through because they 
believed that negotiation and resolution was far preferable to 
conflict, litigation, and year after year of court battles, 
lawyers, uncertainty and economic chaos.  That came from the 
business community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it was a very good hearing, but I have to say that I 
was also ashamed to be at that hearing.  A bunch of people came 
in, apparently with their leader, Mr. Vander Zalm.  He sat there 
very smugly with a grin on his face as his members hurled out 
obscenities and all kinds of insults.  They were just a bunch of 
yahoos.  Their sole agenda was to disrupt a democratic process 
and to create fear and uncertainty.  Their agenda was the same as 
the Reform Party's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to know exactly Mr. Vander Zalm's 
position.  He is saying publicly that the treaty will perpetuate 
the old reservation system of isolated collectives and feudal 
overtones.  Mr. Vander Zalm, like the B.C. Reform Party, like the 
federal Reform Party, is dead wrong.  He knows that he is 
pedalling information that is a distortion of what is actually 
going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even today in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> the chief negotiator for 
the federal government has made it clear that the Nisga'a final 
agreement brings to an end the application of the Indian Act to 
the Nisga'a and to their lands.  The Nisga'a will own Nisga'a 
lands just as other Canadians hold title to their lands.  Through 
the final agreement all the individual Nisga'a homeowners will 
receive private property rights to their residential lots.  We 
can clearly see that Mr. Vander Zalm's assertion is dead wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that we heard from Reformers that they wanted a 
referendum.  It is important to note that when B.C. as a province 
joined the Nisga'a treaty negotiations the government of the day 
agreed that the province would ratify the treaty in the 
legislature.  There was never any mention of a referendum being 
raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, who was the government in 1990?  Surprise, surprise, 
It was Mr. Vander Zalm's government.  It was the Social Credit 
government that agreed and set the ground rules for the treaty 
negotiation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard that only through a referendum will there be 
consultation.  It has become very clear that a referendum is 
being used as a smoke screen and a ploy to derail the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to look at democratic process, if we want to look at 
consultation, we only have to see what happened in British 
Columbia and note that this legislation has had the longest 
debate of any legislation in the history of the province at 116 
hours.  There were 450 meetings with advisory groups and the 
public.  There were 31 public hearings in 27 communities.  There 
were 20,000 calls to a 1-800 information line and more than 
250,000 visits to the provincial aboriginal affairs ministry 
website. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has taken the time to objectively look at what this 
process has unfolded and to look at the information that has been 
provided to the public will be very clear that it has been 
transparent, democratic and open.  There has been real debate on 
the issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead what we see today is a motion from the Reform Party that 
is simply frivolous.  It is more than frivolous; it is 
destructive in its intention to sabotage what has been a very 
good model for a process for coming to a treaty.  Not that this 
treaty will become the template for all other treaties, but the 
process of negotiation and resolution is something we should 
abide by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to the Reform Party, shame on it for using the 
guise of a referendum to derail what has been a democratic 
process.  Shame on it for saying that it stands up for equality, 
yet it is here today to deny the Nisga'a people their equality 
under the constitution.  Shame on the Reform Party for distorting 
this treaty and for peddling all of its propaganda out to the 
communities so that people now are totally confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth must be told.  It will be told.  This treaty will be 
ratified.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
My apologies to the House for interrupting the question and 
comment period of the spokesperson for the New Democratic Party, 
but following discussions between the parties I believe if you 
were to ask, you would find unanimous consent for the following 
motion.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK228">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That at the conclusion of the present debate on today's 
opposition motion, all questions necessary to dispose of this 
motion be deemed put, and a recorded division deemed requested 
and deferred until Tuesday, November 23, 1999, at the expiry of 
the time provided for government orders. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The House has heard 
the terms of the motion.  Is it the pleasure of the House to 
adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I could not help but hear the absolutely incorrect 
comments, and that is putting it kindly, by the member from the 
New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the Reform Party stands alone in opposing the 
Nisga'a treaty.  It is not because we are against the Nisga'a 
people.  It is not because we want to keep the Nisga'a people or 
indeed aboriginal people under the hammerlock of separation and 
impoverishment that they have been subjected to for more than 100 
years.  Rather, the Reform Party wants to liberate aboriginal 
people and make sure they have the same powers, the same 
equalities and the same rights and responsibilities as 
non-aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1969 the then aboriginal affairs minister who today is our 
Prime Minister said very clearly that the aboriginal people stood 
at a fork in the road.  They could either pursue a course of 
separation and marginalization and of being treated differently, 
which I might add the Nisga'a treaty epitomizes, or they could 
move forward in the ability for them to live by their own 
cultural traditions and rights and responsibilities in the 
context of being equal with other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member from the New Democratic Party agree with the 
white paper on aboriginal affairs put forth by our present Prime 
Minister in 1969?  Does she agree that the rights and 
responsibilities that exist under the Nisga'a treaty, the right 
to own land and the benefits from the Nisga'a treaty, are accrued 
to the aboriginal leadership and not to individual aboriginal 
people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is the most 
ridiculous thing I have ever heard, that the Reform Party wants 
to liberate aboriginal people.  I guess talk is pretty cheap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we just heard from the Reform Party, that it wants 
to liberate aboriginal people.  Every single action I have seen 
in the House, every single example that is used by the Reform 
Party when it comes to aboriginal people, has been negative, has 
been allegations of what it perceives to be corruption, and has 
been divisive. If that is what the Reform Party calls liberation, 
I do not want any part of its liberation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know about the 1969 white paper.  I was 16 years old at 
the time and I do not know what it said. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I do know that the Nisga'a treaty was negotiated by the 
Nisga'a people.  If we are talking about liberation, then we have 
to understand that the representatives of those people sat down 
at the table, negotiated in good faith and came up with an 
agreement, while not perfect, is one they could live with. They 
did that in good faith. To me that is part of a just and 
democratic process and it is a liberation in terms of assertion 
of their equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might ask the Reform member why his party's position is so 
patronizing to the Nisga'a people to assume what they negotiated 
is somehow not right for them?  They are the people who did the 
negotiating.  The member was not at the table.  I was not at the 
table.  It was their representatives and they believe that they 
have treaty.  To me that is something they are willing to live 
with.  I think it should be ratified by the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member kept using the words “divisive” and 
“uncertainty”.  She said that our calls for a referendum on the 
issue would cause uncertainty and divisiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for her is how on earth could a referendum in which 
all the citizens could participate and exercise their democratic 
will, and after which there would be a clear result, possibly 
create uncertainty?  Would that not clarify the matter?  Would 
that not empower the people of British Columbia to determine 
their destiny on this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I believe that it would 
be a grievous error to submit this treaty and the issue of 
minority rights to a referendum.  Who would vote?  The Reform 
Party is saying that it would be everyone in B.C.  Some people 
may argue that all Canadians should vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that democratic expression and the substance of that 
is what is valued.  There are times for referendums.  There are 
times when a referendum can be appropriate.  Under our 
constitution our governments have the mandate and the 
responsibility to negotiate treaties.  That is what was done in 
this case.  That is what has been arrived at and that is what 
must be approved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have 
listened to the debate today.  I have spoken on this issue many 
times, have participated in the debate, have examined and 
cross-examined witnesses.  Having the information before me as a 
member of parliament, I really do welcome this debate today. 
Primarily, I welcome this debate for very selfish reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate will be on the record, further debates will be on 
the record and past debates on this issue are on the record. 
There has been a lot of reference to what has been said, what has 
not been said, who has said what, when and where.  I implore 
members of parliament and the listening public to see for 
themselves.  They do not have to take my word for what has been 
said.  Look in the records.  Check <I>Hansard</I>.  Look at the 
record of the committee.  See who said what, where and when. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All one has to do is look at the records to see what has been 
said by the members for Prince George—Peace River, Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley, Skeena and Calgary Southwest, and by the 
Leader of the Official Opposition, have said.  They have 
repeatedly said in the House that the treaty will lead to a 
fishery based on race, that it will take away the rights of 
women, that it will affect the constitution of Canada and that it 
will somehow change the charter of rights and freedoms so that it 
will not apply to this group.  Those statements are patently 
false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone wants to listen to the Reform wrecking ball approach 
to public policy debate, then they should check the record.  The 
record stands.  The written word is there for anyone in the 
country to check.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been a number of mistruths said in the House. I want 
to make a statement about mistruths.  I was thinking about this 
earlier while watching the debate.  A mistruth is not necessarily 
a mistruth if the speaker does not know any different or any 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a member of parliament has not done his or her homework, it 
could be said that her or she has been delinquent in his or her 
duty as a member of parliament.  However, if that member of 
parliament has done his or her duty as a member of parliament and 
does know the difference and does know how this treaty applies, 
and that member stands and deliberately leads the public in a 
mistruth, then that member is delinquent in his or her duty as a 
member of parliament. There is a dramatic difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about this treaty as it applies to Canadians and as 
it applies to the Nisga'a.  Some time ago we entered into a 
treaty process in Canada in good faith with all parties coming to 
the table.  We allowed first nations to sit down with the 
provinces and federal government and negotiate the best possible 
treaty we could work out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this treaty for very selfish reasons.  I support it 
because of the things it addresses, the inequalities and 
inadequacies of the old Indian Act, which on a good day is a 
colonial piece of legislation and on a bad day is definitely a 
racist piece of legislation. What this treaty does for the 
Nisga'a is it takes them out from under the umbrella of the 
Indian Act.  It forever takes away the right of the Indian Act to 
govern the Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a will govern themselves. They will govern themselves 
in a municipal style of government with some rights that are 
quasi-provincial and some rights that are quasi-federal. I have 
listened to Reform members of parliament talk about how these 
changes will have a detrimental effect on the good people of 
British Columbia and on the Nisga'a themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All anyone has to do is read the Nisga'a final agreement.  It is 
not a secret document.  It is a public document.  It is there for 
any and every Canadian who would care to take the time to read 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can certainly attest to the fact that I am one Canadian who 
has read the NFA.  It takes a little wading through.  Starting at 
the beginning one asks a lot of questions before getting to the 
end.  However, there is not one question arising from reading 
that document that cannot be answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it takes is someone who can read the document with an open 
mind, who can see into the future of the country and can accept 
some of the basic rules and laws that we all accept as Canadians. 
We would hope that some day those rules, laws and regulations 
would be applied to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information can be checked off.  The Reform Party has stood 
repeatedly and said there is something wrong with the process.  I 
cannot attest as a new member of parliament to everything that 
went on in the past regarding the debate of the treaty. I can 
attest to what has happened since I have been involved as the 
Progressive Conservative Party critic on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly we all know, and it is a matter of record, that there 
was debate in the British Columbia legislature.  I have heard two 
different numbers; one is 116 hours and the other is 120 hours. 
It should be duly placed on the record that debate in this House 
on the average for a piece of legislation that is fairly hotly 
contested may be eight or ten hours, but more often it will 
probably average five or six hours. 
We had 116 or, Madam Speaker, if you prefer, 120 hours of debate 
in British Columbia and somehow that debate was not adequate.  It 
was insufficient.  It is kind of like the old adage when one is 
on a job working.  If the first break is not sufficient, thou 
shalt have a second break of equal length.  That is not quite how 
it works.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had honest debate and fair debate.  Everyone who wanted to 
speak on this issue had opportunity to speak.  The debate 
collapsed after 120 hours, as it rightfully should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today is about referendum, about the fact that the 
majority of Canadians should establish laws and should judge laws 
for the minority.  It is never good, ever in any way, shape or 
form, to have the majority continually be in charge and make laws 
that apply always to the minority.  If we go to referendum that 
is exactly what happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a referendum.  It has gone through democratic 
debate in the province of British Columbia.  It has gone through 
democratic debate and is continuing to go through democratic 
debate in the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard many witnesses before committee and we will 
continue to hear them.  I think some 64 witnesses in total will 
appear before committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process has been a very long process and continues to get 
longer.  As part of that process, there are extremely legitimate 
views and opinions that deserve and need to be heard.  However, 
let us stop for a second and let us take a handful of the 
opinions that have been put forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those ideas and opinions just minutes ago was the fact 
that we are not going to have fee simple land management.  Quite 
honestly, I have spoken about land ownership until I am blue in 
the face talking about it.  Clearly stated in the NFA is that the 
Nisga'a will own their property fee simple.  We cannot make it 
any plainer than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the day that this treaty is approved some of the lands that 
the Nisga'a hold will be fee simple to the Nisga'a government. 
Some of the lands will transfer fee simple to individuals.  The 
rest of the lands that are owned now without any property 
ownership system at all can in the future be turned into fee 
simple and can be held fee simple by the Nisga'a government the 
same as any municipality holds its property fee simple.  It is 
the same as the province of Nova Scotia where I come from.  It 
holds its crown based property. To allude to it any differently 
is to mislead the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have debunked the myth of secrecy of negotiation.  We have 
debunked the myth of fee simple land ownership.  Let us go back 
to referendum.  Does B.C. have a right to vote but not the rest 
of Canada?  Does Canada have a right to vote but not B.C.?  Who 
decides?  Referendums in our constitution are there and can be 
used for items that change the constitution.  That is another 
myth of this treaty.  This does not change the Constitution of 
Canada. It is affected by the Constitution of Canada and 
protected by the Constitution of Canada but it does not change 
the Constitution of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can say it a million times, but if individuals have their 
fingers in their ears they will not hear it.  It is important, as 
long as we are debating the motion, to talk about the real 
issues, the substantive issues, the issues that concern Canadians 
and all of those issues which concern Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard time and time again the official opposition saying 
that it is not against the treaty process, that it supports the 
treaty process.  Well, this is the treaty process. This is the 
negotiated process entered into in good faith by three parties 
that came up with the negotiated solution.  Some people gave up 
items during the debate and the negotiations and some people 
gained some.  It is like any negotiated process, a process of 
give and take.  At the end of it, we reached the best possible 
agreement we could reach to the advantage of all three parties. 
That is what we have today with the Nisga'a final agreement.  We 
have the best possible solution reached by people working in good 
faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individual members of parliament may not like that.  They may 
want to vote against it for some obscure reason that I have not 
been able to identify.  If that is the case, they have every 
right to stand and vote against it, and I support that.  However, 
they should not stand and vote against it on the basis that we do 
not have fee simple land ownership.  They should not stand and 
vote against it on the basis that the charter of rights and 
freedoms does not apply.  They should not stand and vote against 
it because they say that the Constitution of Canada will not be 
effective. Those issues are very clearly laid out in the NFA and 
dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard the numbers 14, 15 and 17 areas where the Nisga'a 
will have greater jurisdiction than the province of British 
Columbia or the federal government.  Let us look at some of those 
areas.  We are talking about areas of environmental regulations. 
We are talking about areas of family and children's services. 
This is not a giveaway of unprecedented proportion in Canadian 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said to the Nisga'a that through negotiation they have 
the right to control family and children's services, which would 
ordinarily be a provincial right.  However, when the members of 
parliament rail against that, they forget to mention that it very 
clearly states in the agreement that those rights and privileges 
have to be as good or exceed existing provincial regulations. 
Therefore the Nisga'a cannot be less protective of families and 
children than the Province of British Columbia. They can be more 
protective if they wish but they cannot be less protective.  It 
is in the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said time and time again that members should read all of 
the Nisga'a final agreement.  They should get their 
constitutional experts and they should ask for legal opinions. 
They should talk to the province of British Columbia.  They 
should talk to all of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to the Reform debate on this until I am sick of 
it.  We have an expression at home, and if anyone in the House is 
a hunter they will recognize it.  When the debate has heated up 
and we have chest pounding, hair pulling, arm waving and 
squawking, it is like crows on a gut pile.  That is exactly what 
it is like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get beyond this.  We have to talk about the real 
issues in this treaty.  There is a very serious question of 
overlap.  The Gitanyow and the Gitksan are extremely troubled 
about overlap.  Again, it is dealt with in the Nisga'a final 
agreement.  It very clearly states within that agreement how the 
Nisga'a will deal with overlap.  It does not exclude a final 
settlement coming down in favour of the Gitksan or the Gitanyow, 
but what it does include is that if the the Nisga'a lose 
territory because of future land claim settlements, they will be 
given compensation of some form, either more land or dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process is there.  It allows for arbitration.  It allows for 
joint jurisdiction with other bands, the federal government or 
the provincial government in some areas.  Surely we have reached 
a stage in the evolution of the political life of the country and 
the provinces and territories that make it up, that we can 
embrace this type of legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely we have reached the point in the country where we can 
look at legislation for what it is worth to the nation and not be 
against it for what it is worth for a political party.  Those are 
entirely the wrong reasons to be against something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should take the politics out of this and talk about the 
treaty.  They should deal with the question of overlap. It is 
dealt with in the NFA.  They should make recommendations if they 
want to make recommendations, but they should not burn the barn 
down because they are not happy with the fact that they are not 
making a good living.  They should not just destroy it.  They 
should step away from this wrecking ball approach to public 
policy debate. They should be constructive by looking at the 
issues one at a time and deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went to British Columbia on committee and I welcomed the 
opportunity to go there. It was an interesting process in B.C. I 
have been out there several times so I feel very much at home in 
British Columbia.  I talked to a lot of people on the street and 
a number of shopkeepers.  Maybe these non-scientific polls that 
were done are a reality, but that was not the opinion I got on 
the streets in B.C.  It was not even close to the opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the hearings were marred by some protesters. 
Anyone has the right to protest and that is one of the great 
things in this nation.  However, no one has the right to 
interfere with involved, informative and insightful debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many issues and certainly one is the referendum issue. 
Do we in Canada want to establish public policy with a 
referendum every time we turn around?  Referendums are generally 
espoused and advanced by people who have already lost the debate. 
They took part in the process and they have lost the debate so 
they want one more kick at the can.  That is the referendum 
mentality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that we run out of time in the House.  Part of 
that, as I understand it, is because the Reform Party and the 
Bloc in 1993 really did not do their job as the opposition and 
allowed debate to be cut off after six or eight hours.

Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleague 
from the South Shore give a rather compelling, thought-provoking 
dissertation on this particular treaty, but one thing struck me 
very clearly.  It seems to me that the Conservative Party, which 
is perceived to be a bit right of centre of the political 
spectrum, is completely at variance with the loyal opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was wondering if the member from South Shore could fill me in 
on how members in his party could ever believe that they would 
ever come together with the Reform Party in some kind of a united 
alternative when it disagrees with something as fundamental as 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member for South Shore please inform those 
members present on all sides of the House why his party's 
position is so different from the loyal opposition, and 
especially from the position of the member for Wild Rose who 
seems to think that the member for South Shore is coming from the 
wrong side of the boat on this?

be a wonderful thing.  Sometimes it can be a marriage of 
convenience.  Sometimes it is arranged.  Sometimes it ends in 
divorce.  Sometimes it never happens.  I appreciate the hon. 
member's question and I will try to answer it fairly succinctly. 
It is difficult as I am trying to think of the proper answer to 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a Conservative.  I have conservative values.  I am a fiscal 
conservative.  That does not mean that when I was born someone 
cut out my heart and threw it away.  One can be conservative and 
still have a heart.  If there are inequalities or injustices in 
the world one can still stand up for the rights of people who 
have no one to protect them.  One can still look at legislation 
as it exists and judge it one item at a time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to agree with everything the government does, and 
quite frankly I do not.  We need to look at the merits in 
legislation and approve or disapprove it on its own merit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member for South Shore said that the opinion the Reform Party 
was expressing was not the opinion he heard on the streets of 
British Columbia.  I would like to bring his attention to a 
couple of facts and some questions which were asked of British 
Columbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question was:  “Do you believe the public has had 
adequate opportunity to provide input into the Nisga'a treaty?” 
There were 7,556 people who responded to that question.  Of those 
88.75% or 6,706 said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question was: “Do you believe that the people of 
B.C. should have the right to vote on the principles of the 
Nisga'a treaty in a provincial referendum?”  The number of 
responses in total were 7,556.  Those who said yes totalled 
6,923. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the few minutes the member for South Shore had to talk to 
people other than those on the gerrymandered witness list, I 
wonder what percentage he found, how many thousands of people 
from British Columbia he talked to, and whether it would add up 
to 90% disapproval as I have just pointed out to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, as I said at the 
beginning the great thing about this debate is that it is on the 
record.  We can look and see what people have said.  We can check 
it in 10 years time or we can check it tomorrow.  It is all on 
the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as public input in British Columbia is concerned, I want 
to ask the hon. member where it stops.  At the end of the day 
somewhere and somehow there has to be an end to the process.  We 
might not all agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are compelling reasons to have ongoing public debate, and 
120 hours is pretty serious public debate in B.C.  Numerous 
information sessions have been brought to my attention.  However, 
at the end of those sessions we might have a small minority or a 
small majority of people who are not satisfied with the public 
debate, are not satisfied with their public officials and want to 
throw it out and start over.  They want to forget the negotiation 
process, forget everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is like Reformers saying they can get rid of the Indian 
Act.  The Indian Act is protected by the constitution.  It is 
part of the constitution.  They cannot do that.  That will not 
happen.  It is false to insinuate and to lead people down that 
trail.  They cannot even begin to do it.  As far as the people I 
have talked to in B.C.— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  There are a few more than two.  I was 
surprised that ordinary men and women on the street were not 
pulling their hair and cawing.  There was hardly any cawing out 
there at all.  People were concerned.  They had legitimate 
questions and they wanted legitimate answers.  The trouble is 
that they have not been receiving legitimate answers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have been listening today to the comments and the back 
and forth dialogue across the House.  Would the hon. member not 
admit that what we are establishing within the treaty is a brand 
new level of government? 
Never before have we had such a level of government created in 
Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that said, is it not possible or is it most likely that 
once the treaty is passed there will be 130 or more across Canada 
who will want to follow almost the exact wording of this treaty? 
The treaty is probably the most socially important piece of 
legislation we will face in the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should not stand here and tell me that this is a 
bunch of nonsense.  People from coast to coast want to know where 
it will go next.  Will the government and this member justify six 
or seven treaties going on in my constituency within the next two 
years once this one is passed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is an excellent 
question.  It absolutely is not a bunch of nonsense. 
Categorically this is not a bunch of nonsense.  This is an 
extremely important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not setting up some type of brand new government.  A 
brand new government would imply that the charter of rights and 
freedoms does not apply.  It would also imply that the 
constitution of Canada does not apply.  Anything in the country 
that is under the constitution and under the charter of rights 
and freedoms is acceptable to the laws and the governments of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear.  It is not patent foolishness at all.  It is a 
few uninformed individuals who care not to look at the facts, who 
care not to enter upon debate, who want to call down, call names 
and wave placards every time somebody else has a different 
opinion.  I am frankly tired of it.  I am not exhausted but I am 
tired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes one want to fight that much harder.  It get one's blood 
up.  There are issues here we need to discuss. I am willing to 
stand here as long as the Reform Party of Canada cares to enter 
into this debate and debate it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
commend the hon. member on his speech.  Three-quarters of it was 
directed at the Reform Party.  I thank him for that.  I am glad 
he recognizes us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP people have done the same in their speeches.  They talk 
about the Reform more than they do about the Nisga'a.  I thank 
them very much for recognizing the Reform.  The Liberals are just 
renowned for that, especially the member for Mississauga West who 
cannot wait to get up and say something about the Wild Rose guy. 
Then there is the Bloc party from Quebec that constantly likes to 
try to conform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wonderful to be the official opposition in a House where 
nobody likes us.  That is good.  In 10 short years we got here 
and the reason we are here is the undemocratic processes that 
have been taking place for 130 years in the House.  The nation 
was brought to its knees with a $600 billion debt by the party at 
that end and that party over there.  They are just like brother 
and sister.  Why do they not unite? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will leave the uniting 
of brothers and sisters to the Reform Party any day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am going to be splitting my time with the member for 
South Surrey—White Rock—Langley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way as House leader I have witnessed a lot of things on 
process in the House.  I will talk about the process but I find 
it sad the way some of these parties are going on about this 
important Nisga'a debate.  I will talk a bit about what it is to 
be opposition in the House of Commons and about what it takes to 
stand up and have a little courage in one's convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process of debate in the House on this whole issue was not 
only shortened by time allocation after four and a half hours of 
our debate time.  The total time was around eight hours, but of 
course the other parties that are supposed to be in opposition 
here agree with the issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That may not seem much to the government but it is to the people 
we represent.  The issue has come up in question period time and 
time again.  Government references the official opposition by 
saying that all members from British Columbia should speak to the 
issue as they know what they are talking about.  It happens that 
a majority of them are in this caucus and should have had full 
opportunity to speak to this issue rather than have debate cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the government eliminates debate time through time 
allocation we go into committee.  The committee on aboriginal 
affairs did not want to go to British Columbia, so as House 
leader I basically said that we would not travel in any committee 
then, that all committees had to come through the House for 
approval to travel and we would oppose them all.  That encouraged 
the government to travel to British Columbia.  That is the only 
reason it ended up going to British Columbia.  Otherwise it was 
not going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said then we wanted to go to a number of communities in 
British Columbia.  No, it did not want to go where the Nisga'a 
agreement was opposed.  After hours of debate we finally got it 
to go to Victoria, Vancouver, Terrace, Prince Rupert and 
Smithers.  It did not want to go to Smithers because of the 
opposition that it knew it would hear.  It did not want to go to 
Kamloops so we sawed it off and went to Prince George. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was sitting in my office and members of the aboriginal affairs 
committee came in and said that a list of 62 names, all in favour 
of the Nisga'a agreement, were tabled in that committee.  They 
were voting to bring those names forward as they travel 
throughout British Columbia to support the Nisga'a agreement. We 
went back into committee and said there should be better 
representation, pro and con.  That seemed reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  A small minority of individuals were opposed to 
it and a vast majority were in favour of it.  The vast majority 
of people in favour of the agreement got to fly to British 
Columbia at government expense to make presentation as witnesses. 
Some of them were not even from British Columbia.  A minority of 
people who were opposed were allowed to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could ask what is the point of going to British Columbia and 
what is the point of even having witnesses at a committee.  Under 
those circumstances there is not any point, but what the 
government and people in the country do not understand is that 
this happens frequently with all committees such as the 
agriculture committee and the finance committee.  All the 
witnesses are voted on by a majority of government members. 
People think committees are travelling around the country getting 
input.  The whole thing is staged.  By and large the environment 
committee and all these committees are just staged events by 
government.  That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we have seen this with the Nisga'a agreement we are now 
about to change the rules on how committees work because I will 
no longer put up with this charade.  Committees will not travel 
if that is the way it is to be.  We will have to see about 
debating committee travel in the House if and when they want to 
travel.  That is fine with me.  I would sooner have it that way 
anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would not allow television.  No television cameras could go 
into the committee meeting because they said the rules were not 
set up ahead of time.  A committee is master of its own destiny 
and choices.  They could have changed it right there but they did 
not want to allow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are right.  This is probably the end of this debate because 
the government has a majority and can outvote us any time it 
wants, particularly when there are opposition parties that are 
more Liberal than on the right side of politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will we do?  We will have a referendum next, an opportunity 
to give people input in British Columbia.  They have told us time 
and time again they want it.  The NDP government in British 
Columbia would not allow it, even though the opposition parties 
and the majority of people in British Columbia wanted it. 
Tomorrow night there will be a vote in the House. 
All the Liberals will stand and say “no referendum”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not give the people their say through a referendum?  The NDP 
will stand and vote against the referendum.  I do not know where 
the Bloc stands on a referendum.  The Progressive Conservatives, 
the people who brought referendum legislation into the House of 
Commons, will not even agree to a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask myself, what does it take to be in opposition in this 
country when we have a bill such as this which has such 
ramifications and about which there are many questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question about the perpetuity of the financing, the 
more than $30 million a year for the rest of our lives, our 
children's lives, and our children's children's lives.  I have a 
question about that.  I thought the permanent financing would 
come to an end at some point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should I not have the right to debate?  Why should the 
people in my community not have the right to ask the question: 
What is $32 million in perpetuity?  How much is that in tax?  If 
this is only one agreement and it is the template for all other 
agreements and they are all going to have money in perpetuity, 
should we not ask the questions now instead of later?  I did not 
think there would be benefits in perpetuity, so why can I not 
have the right to ask the questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anybody in opposition has these questions, do they not have 
the right to ask them without the slanderous and ridiculous 
comments of New Democrats, the socialists in the House, and 
without the comments of the PCs, as few as they are in the House? 
What is wrong with asking questions in the House of Commons?  Why 
is it that these opposition parties will not even oppose or ask 
serious questions about these kinds of issues?  It is because 
they are too damn busy calling those who are asking articulate 
questions racists and bigots.  That is their problem.  They are 
afraid that if they stand to ask questions about this they will 
be labelled by that sort of talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought we were past that in this day and age.  What is wrong 
with the House of Commons that we have got down to the lowest, 
dirt level talk, this gutter talk?  There is something wrong when 
members cannot stand to debate an issue, no matter what the 
issue, without these people trying to make political brownie 
points by slandering others.  It is terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the kind of opposition that people watching this and 
listening to me today want, those comments which are nothing more 
than slanderous rhetorical statements, rather than getting down 
to the real problems that exist in legislation, then we are in 
serious trouble.  This government will be perpetuated along with 
those who support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here as an opposition member.  I am damn well here to ask 
questions and I am going to stay here to ask questions.  I am not 
here to side with these people.  I am here on behalf of many 
Canadians to ask questions; logical questions I hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is one other thing I want to say concerning all 
of the questions on the Nisga'a agreement.  Why is it that when 
the issue of public schooling and the Catholic school system in 
Newfoundland came up and there was a referendum in Newfoundland 
nobody had a problem with that?  That was the proper thing to do. 
The referendum was held, it was brought back to the House and we 
debated it.  No one was then saying that this is an important 
issue, but we have to push it through because there is a 
referendum.  In fact, the government wanted a debate on it.  It 
did not call time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to wonder what this is all about on all sides of those 
supporting the Nisga'a agreement, whether it is just rhetorical

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
statement that was made about political brownie points was made 
by the master of political brownie points.  There is no lesson to 
be taken there.  There is a lesson given and a lesson received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the referendum for religious schools in Newfoundland, 
I am not absolutely positive, but I believe there was a 
referendum on that issue because the constitution of Canada had 
to be changed.  That is why there was a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  So?  I need one of these lessons from 
one of these petty politicians from Joe what's his name and the 
other fellows down there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a referendum in Newfoundland.  The members should try 
to understand that there was a social responsibility.  There was 
an issue that was important to Newfoundlanders and the process 
was the right process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure it was wise on behalf of Premier Tobin to hold a 
referendum.  Whether it was entrenched in any agreement, it was 
the proper thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member does not really seem to understand what he is talking 
about.  I was saying that it is the right thing to do in British 
Columbia, much as it was the right thing to do in Newfoundland, 
regardless of whether the process is documented in legislation. 
Surely members on the other side can understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a referendum was permitted to be in the process in British 
Columbia, then the people would either say yea or nay and they 
would confirm either way for those who are attempting to get the 
agreement in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are overlapping land claims comprising well over 100% of 
British Columbia's lands.  This is the template.  It is not just 
about Nisga'a and the Nass Valley, it is about my community of 
Abbotsford and Langley.  It is about all of the communities of 
the people who live in British Columbia.  If the first agreement 
is going to be the template, then why are all the people in 
British Columbia denied a say in the template?  That is what this 
is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that Ottawa is a long distance from British Columbia.  We 
have known that for years.  The mentality in this place is that 
we live in the boonies.  What we are saying to the House is that 
we deserve a say.  All of our communities deserve a say, not just 
one isolated area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to enlarge 
upon the Newfoundland referendum a bit.  The member is talking 
about these overlays and templates and he is trying to put them 
on every public policy issue there is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a majority of Newfoundlanders who had religious goals, 
whether those goals happened to be Catholic or Protestant, who 
needed the vote on that very important and fundamental issue to 
Newfoundland.  It was not the majority trying to decide something 
for a minority right, it was the majority deciding for the 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, we can spin it any way we 
want.  The fact of the matter is that the people of British 
Columbia are asking the House to respect their wishes and hold a 
referendum.  That is what they are asking.  These kinds of 
arguments put forward by someone who obviously has not even read 
the agreement, much less knows much about what I am talking, is 
kind of sad.  We in British Columbia are asking for a democratic 
right we believe we should have.  All we are doing is asking the 
government to respect that in the vote tomorrow night.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, for the people who are watching the 
debate, I think it is appropriate that I read the motion so it 
can be clearly understood.  The motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the federal government should 
conduct a province wide referendum in British Columbia on the 
Nisga'a Final Agreement prior to the consideration of any further 
stages of Bill C-9, an act to give effect to the Nisga'a Final 
Agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is too much to ask, as my eloquent colleague 
has stated.  A referendum is the desire of the people of British 
Columbia because of the social implications and the long term 
implications that this Nisga'a agreement will have on the 
province of British Columbia and all of the people who live in 
the province of British Columbia, native and non-native. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians are concerned.  They are concerned about the 
long term financial commitment.  They are concerned about the 
responsibilities.  They are concerned about the template.  There 
are 50-plus agreements yet to be settled.  They claim over 100% 
of the territory of the province of British Columbia.  Of course 
the people of British Columbia are concerned that all of the 
issues need to be be clearly understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear to me from comments made by hon. colleagues 
from around the country that there is not a clear understanding 
of what are the implications of the Nisga'a agreement for the 
people of British Columbia.  There are people who support it and 
there are people who do not support it.  All the people of 
British Columbia are asking is that they be allowed to express 
their position on this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the negotiations that took place over a period of about 
10 years the people of British Columbia were excluded because the 
negotiations were held behind closed doors.  There was not an 
opportunity for the citizens of British Columbia to take part in 
the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the agreement in principle was made public a couple of 
years ago, the people of British Columbia asked to take part in 
that discussion.  They asked that there be a referendum.  They 
asked that there be a public consultation process.  That was 
denied them.  It was a very controlled exercise in government 
manipulation, both from a provincial level and from a federal 
level, manipulating an agreement through the system without being 
held accountable to the people of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just non-natives who are concerned.  There are a lot 
of natives within the Nisga'a community, the Gitksan and other 
communities who are concerned because of the way the agreement is 
written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that we have asked is for the government to lay open the 
agreement to the people of British Columbia and let them respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the government in turn tries to tell the 
House and Canadians who are listening that it is the Reform Party 
which wants this.  Let me assure the House that it is not the 
Reform Party, it is the people of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Months ago, before the heat of the Musqueam issue and the other 
issues came up, such as the Marshall decision, I asked them 
about the Nisga'a agreement and how they wanted it to be handled. 
I asked if they wanted to have a provincial referendum and 
78.66% said yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since other issues have surfaced and this debate has drawn more 
public attention, an official poll was taken.  It was a 
recognized poll done through the proper means, not a householder 
poll.  Some people would like to say that my householder polls 
are not legal or official. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans sitting here a 
minute ago.  In his riding this poll showed that 92.21% of the 
people opposed the Nisga'a treaty.  It will be interesting to see 
if he is going to respect his job to represent the people who 
elected him to sit in this House and show his opposition, or if 
he will do as he is told and support the government.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have tried to address this issue with the minister of 
aboriginal affairs, his responses have been, at the most, in 
contempt of the people of British Columbia.  When I asked him 
whether a majority of members from British Columbia showing that 
they did not support the government would be an indication to him 
that the people of British Columbia, who we represent, did not 
support the government on this issue, and would he recognize that 
and withdraw the bill, he made some derogatory comment, which 
seems to be his normal course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same man who after the supreme court Marshall 
decision announced to the country that it applied to logging, 
minerals and offshore oil and gas reserve.  When the supreme 
court subsequently announced that its decision did not apply to 
any commodity other than the eel fishery, it said that it would 
have been nice if people had actually read its judgment before 
making all sorts of pronouncements about its implication.  We 
would have thought that the minister would have been one of those 
persons who would have read the court's decision to clearly 
understand it, or at least have had somebody else read it to him 
if he was not capable of reading it himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this kind of contempt that the government has shown to the 
people of British Columbia, who are asking for nothing more or 
nothing less than the people of Newfoundland when it asked for a 
referendum on Term 17, a very serious issue that challenged their 
social structure and would have changed the way they lived with 
each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of British Columbia understand the ramification that 
this agreement will have on them in years to come. All we are 
asking is for British Columbians to have the opportunity to go to 
the polls and mark an X as to whether or not they can support the 
government's position.  All they are asking for is to exercise 
their democratic right to involve themselves in the governance of 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear from the attitude and actions of the government 
that it does not respect democracy.  It does not respect the will 
of the people. It does not think Canadians have any right to 
participate in the debate and in the decisions that are made on 
their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear ministers and government officials saying that they are 
in the House of Commons to represent them.  We then hear that 
they do not recognize that representation.  Even though the 
majority of the members of parliament from British Columbia will 
not support the Nisga'a agreement and the government, it will 
merrily win support with the majority that it holds from Ontario. 
The 101-plus members on the government side will make a decision 
for the people of British Columbia whether they like it or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting how some things never change in the country. 
It expresses the need for government members and all 
parliamentarians to really look inside themselves as to why they 
are here.  If they are only here to support a position by a 
leader or by a dogma, and if they are not here to represent the 
people who elected them to be their voice in the House of 
Commons, then they should look inside themselves to see if they 
really belong here.  We are in this place to represent the people 
who do not have the ability to speak out and who are now being 
denied the ability to even make a decision and vote on the 
Nisga'a agreement.  They send us to speak on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It upsets the people in the House that we speak on behalf of our 
constituents or that we challenge the sections in this agreement 
that are not right and are not clear.  They do not seem to accept 
the fact that we want accountability in the spending of 
taxpayers' dollars. 
I cannot be here in this place except to give my commitment to 
the people I represent to speak on their behalf and to make sure 
their voices are heard in this debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the other members in the House to look beyond their party 
line and to consider what the people of British Columbia are 
asking for, which is the chance to place their voice in this 
discussion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, when the hon. member was talking about people not 
feeling represented, I spent a week listening to the very people 
who were most affected, the Nisga'a people.  They said that they 
had not spoken to their particular member since 1993.  As an 
aboriginal person, I felt that I had to represent people who were 
not being represented by their own member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the week that I was in British Columbia, I also heard very 
many different views presented to us.  I do not think anyone of 
them completely said what they wanted the referendum question to 
be.  I heard many different views of what they thought the 
referendum question should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who does the hon. member think should write the question and 
what should the question be in the referendum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think it is quite 
clear that the government of the day would probably write the 
question.  It seems to want to write all the referendum questions 
that are being posed in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the question can be very clear.  It can be “Do you 
support the Nisga'a agreement?”  If the government feels that 
the people of British Columbia do not know enough about it, 
perhaps it should look at itself.  It is the one that denied 
British Columbians from being involved in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an agreement of this nature was being negotiated, the 
governments of the day, both governments—because I hold the 
Government of British Columbia equally responsible—should have 
understood from the very beginning that if they wanted it 
accepted by the people of British Columbia they had to include 
the people of British Columbia in the negotiations so that there 
would be an acceptance level there.  They failed to do that. If 
they had done their job properly, the acceptance of the 
negotiations would probably be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was because of the exclusion of the public in the debate and 
in the negotiations and of having those negotiations behind 
closed doors that the uncertainty is there whether they like it 
or not.  The Government of British Columbia and the federal 
government have to share the responsibility for that situation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had 
the opportunity to take part in two of the five days of 
consultation in British Columbia last week.  I noted a lot of 
individuals and groups, including native groups, supported the 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some aboriginal nations were concerned about issues of overlap. 
These concerns will no doubt have to be taken into 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What distresses me a lot in the position of the Reform Party is 
what my colleague, the member for Saint-Jean, tried to get this 
House to understand. 
They seem to want, for totally inappropriate reasons, to involve 
all British Columbians in a referendum the federal government 
would organize, whereas the provincial government, which 
represents all of the people of the province, has said and 
considered that this was not appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask my colleague from the Reform Party why the 
federal government should meddle in the affairs of British 
Columbia, impose a referendum and impose a question, when the 
B.C. government itself does not want to organize such a public 
consultation? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thought I had made it 
clear that the Government of British Columbia has to assume some 
of the responsibility.  It has denied the people of B.C. a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the federal government that would be imposing a 
referendum. 
It is the people of British Columbia who are asking for it to be 
held.  They have asked it of the provincial government which has 
turned its back on the people of the province.  The people of the 
province ask whomever.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Haliburton—Victoria—Brock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I find most interesting about the debate is 
that no one seems prepared to deal with the issues.  All we hear 
is people demanding a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  That's the most important thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Well, that may be the issue to the 
members opposite, but why can we not hear from just one member in 
this place what they object to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Because you cut the debate short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  We did not cut the debate. Quite the 
contrary.  I will give some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been over 500 public meetings.  Someone said that 
this was behind closed doors and in secret.  There have been over 
500 public meetings on this issue alone.  There have been in 
excess of 120 hours of debate in the provincial legislature in 
Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz:</B>  Closure there, too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I understand the role of opposition. I 
spent five years in opposition in the province of Ontario and I 
can say what the role is not.  It is not to create gridlock in 
spite of a clear democratic decision that has been taken through 
more consultation than any other issue I can think of since I was 
elected to this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been 500 meetings and 120 hours of debate.  There has 
been debate in this place.  This is at least the second of third 
time I have had an opportunity to talk about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They take the approach that because they are not getting their 
own way they will stamp their feet and throw a temper tantrum.  I 
heard the House leader for the opposition, who was trying to 
pretend he was being calm, cool and rational about this, say that 
perhaps committees will not travel.  Who does he think he is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the Canadian people be told that because one party in 
this place out of five does not agree with the democratically 
arrived at solution that they can no longer talk to committees 
and that the finance committee cannot travel?  If we want to talk 
about lack of democracy, that kind of attempted sabotage to the 
system that the Canadian people have a right to enjoy is totally 
undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What bothered me in the beginning, aside from the tactics, is 
that I have not heard anyone talking about the issues.  Someone 
over here said that this was about a new form of government and 
then someone else said that it was not.  I think it is.  It is 
called self-government for our native communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the real question here to anybody who opposes this—and 
I have no problem with people taking opposing positions—is for 
them to just tell us why.  We want them to tell us what it is 
that bothers them so that maybe we can debate it.  It is a very 
simple question.  Either one is for self-government or opposed to 
self-government.  Yes, it is a new form of government, perhaps a 
form of government that is so long overdue in the country that it 
epitomizes why we have all the problems we do have on our 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall a debate, and my hon. friend from Nunavut will remember 
it well, where instead of creating the new territory of Nunavut, 
the solution was just to give everybody up there a million bucks 
or something.  I think that is what they said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Vander Zalm, reborn as the leader of the provincial Reform 
Party in British Columbia, a man who had to resign in disgrace, 
is now being the champion.  His solution to the Nisga'a treaty is 
to tear it up and give them all $250,000.  Is that not just 
incredible? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The paternalistic attitude. They do not say to the Nisga'a 
people “We understand that for 100 years you have tried to 
negotiate with Victoria.  You have tried to negotiate with 
Ottawa.  We understand the problem out in the community that is 
false.  We are going to deal with the facts”. I have not heard 
the facts debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they object to the Nisga'a receiving title to the 2,000 
hectares of land?  Is that the problem?  Say so if it is.  I 
think Canadians would like to see somebody with the courage to 
stand up.  It might be something different than courage but I 
will not go there. They would like to see them stand up and argue 
that the Nisga'a people are not entitled to that land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to the newest Reform champion, Mr. Vander Zalm, who 
has criticized the agreement for perpetuating the old reserve 
system with no private ownership of land.  They want to have a 
referendum but people in the community like Bill Vander Zalm and 
others are perpetuating untruths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there is private ownership of land.  The Nisga'a 
people will be able to register the ownership of their family 
homes and lots in the British Columbia land system.  There it is 
exactly, fee simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would people come out and say that there is no private 
ownership of land?  Of the rest of the land that will belong to 
the entire Nisga'a community, they will be able to divide and 
sell land for commercial and other purposes.  Is that not 
amazing? What a right in Canada.  They can actually sell their 
land.  They can actually have it registered in their name, that 
it belongs to their families, that they can give it to their 
children.  The Nisga'a treaty gives these people an opportunity 
to perpetuate the history of their nation.  It is one of our 
first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that what the opposition objects to?  Is it that it would 
like not to recognize the first nations?  I do not know.  I have 
some quotes that members might be surprised to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised at this one because I consider this individual to 
be a fairly moderate and very intelligent member of the 
opposition party, the MP for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  He said 
the following in <I>Hansard</I> on June 3, 1999, not very long 
ago:  “We have created an institutionalized welfare state for 
aboriginal people by giving them things”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he mean by that?  Giving them their rights?  Giving 
them the rights that their people have fought for and negotiated 
and saying that we are actually going to give them an opportunity 
through this treaty for economic growth?  They can have certain 
rights over hunting, forestry, fishing, ecotourism and 
opportunities to grow their community and create jobs for their 
kids.  Is this giving them things? That is such a condescending 
remark for a member of parliament to make about something as 
important as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This quote is from the member for Athabasca and was in the news 
in 1995:  “The Europeans came to this country 300 years ago and 
opened it up and settled it and because we didn't kill the 
Indians and have Indian wars, that doesn't mean we didn't conquer 
these people.  If they weren't in fact conquered, then why did 
the aboriginal people allow themselves to be herded into little 
reserves”.  Goodness gracious, it makes my blood boil.  It makes 
my hair stand up on the back of my neck to hear a Canadian 
parliamentarian stand up in this place and talk about not killing 
the Indians but conquering them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely to God history has taught us the wrongs.  The way we have 
treated our aboriginal communities is not something we should be 
proud of as Canadians.  It is not something about which any of us 
should stand here and say that we did the right thing. We have an 
opportunity here to right some wrongs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important signals this treaty sends is that 
within the next 10 years, everybody involved in the Nisga'a 
community will become a taxpayer. The tax exempt status will be 
gone. 
That is outstanding in my view.  Canadians right across the land

celebrate it?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have a great deal more respect for any members of the 
opposition who would stand up and tell us the truth about why it 
is they oppose this instead of pontificating on an absolutely

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the member who just spoke talked about opposition from a 
provincial party to this treaty.  He should know that the B.C. 
Liberals oppose this treaty. I would like to ask the member, why 
does he suppose that might be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would question the 
definition of Liberal in British Columbia.  Having said that, I 
have a lot of friends, people I have known over the years in that 
party.  In fact my former executive assistant when I was on the 
city of Mississauga council is now an executive assistant to the 
leader.  I am a bit in touch with that party.  Frankly I do not 
agree with its position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not get up every day, contrary to what the opposition 
might try to paint, and say, “I am a Liberal and I am going to 
do this by rote”.  We have to have some people who think and 
disagree.  We have it in our own caucus, contrary to the opinions 
of members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess Mr. Campbell is the leader of the opposition and has to 
fight the Government of British Columbia any way he can.  If the 
only reason for opposing is to oppose, then I do not think that 
is effective opposition.  Tell us what the problems are with this 
treaty instead of hiding behind the falsehood of a referendum. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member said, “I am a Liberal and I don't do 
things by rote”.  Who on the other side of the House voted 
against this treaty when some 90% of the people in British 
Columbia are opposed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, this is the difference. 
I gave some of the quotes.  Unless the Reformers are prepared to 
stand up and denounce Bill Vander Zalm as being inaccurate or not 
portraying the truth in this matter, when we look at some of the 
things that he says, he is not putting it in a truthful way. He 
pretends that it is a $487 million payout plus 2,000 square 
kilometres of land when the truth is that it is half and half. 
It is $487 million including the 2,000 square kilometres of land. 
Something can be twisted around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to Mr. Vander Zalm, I say it to the members of the Reform 
Party here, and more important, I say it to Canadians, look at 
the truth of this agreement.  It is absolutely unprecedented.  It 
is fair.  It gives the Nisga'a people a chance to build on their 
heritage and to create something for their families in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not hearing the facts put out by these— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member did not hear my question.  He said that the 
Liberals do not vote by rote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that is 
debate.  The hon. member for Mississauga West may wish to 
conclude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would conclude by 
saying that there is a difference between voting with all of the 
facts on the table and voting while trying to skewer the reality 
of what is in the treaty. Just be honest, tell the people the 
truth and in my view they will support this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I watched the opposition leader, the member for Calgary 
Southwest as he gave his speech on this issue. 
He said that the provincial Liberals are against this deal.  Then 
he rhymed off the names of all the federal Liberals.  He said 
that the people of B.C. will be watching how these federal 
Liberals vote tomorrow night.  That is what he said.

is just Reform politics.  It is not an honest debate whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I could not agree more. 
Clearly the Reform members have a hidden agenda.  Instead of 
putting the issues out on the table and telling us what they 
believe in and what they stand for, they filibuster.  There is a 
lot of hot air. There is nothing of substance in their debate. I 
say tragically so, because they have an obligation as members of 
an opposition party to put the issues on the table and to have a 
debate of substance.  It is unfortunate that they have not got a 
clue how to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am honoured and privileged to stand here today 
having come back from the aboriginal hearings in British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We travelled extensively throughout British Columbia, to 
Terrace, Smithers, Prince George, Victoria and Vancouver in 
inclement weather and in awfully poor landing conditions on a 
small aircraft which we renamed.  We will not go into that 
because First Air is a very nice airline but hon. members can 
figure out what we renamed it. We celebrated when we were 
actually able to land in Terrace.  As beautiful as it is, it is 
very hard to get into at this time of year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about what happened there.  The Reform Party went 
out to try to whip up a crowd of protesters to show us that this 
treaty process was terrible and that they want to go back to the 
Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to some people on the streets of Prince George.  They 
had no idea what was going on, other than that finally we were 
giving back the land to the natives which we had away from them. 
They asked who had decided the Queen owned it. It was native 
land.  It always has been and it always will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is different to go out there and be spat on and to hear 
someone say to one of my colleagues from Nunavut “Go back to 
your reserve”.  It is sad, sad, sad that the Reform Party would 
stoop that low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then some guy at a radio station in Vancouver was giving out the 
room numbers of the members so people could call their rooms and 
threaten them.  My first call of the morning which I thought was 
a wake-up call was a lunatic saying that if I showed up at the 
meetings I would be dead meat.  Was it not great for members of 
the Parliament of Canada to be told to go back to the reserve, to 
be told one would be dead meat and to be spat upon?  I found 
these kind of tactics to be absolutely disgusting. There was even 
a lower one than that, but I will not talk about it because I do 
not think the Reform Party wants to hear about it. There was a 
lower one and I will keep that in my back pocket for another 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Is the hon. member accusing a member of the Reform Party 
of making these phone calls?  That member should 
be named. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I would like to tell 
the member for Souris—Moose Mountain at this point that maybe 
the hon. member will just wait for questions and comments and at 
that time he can ask the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly:</B>  Madam Speaker, I know that was not a 
point of order, it was a point of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is I said that it was Reform Party 
supporters who came out. One lady who came to me said she was a 
Reform Party supporter. 
She was asked by a member of the Reform Party to come out and 
demonstrate and disrupt the meetings as much as she could.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I gave over my time to the member for Prince George so that 
he was able to speak, he thanked me and said I was a gentleman. 
He did not think he would have enough time to express the views 
of his constituents.  I did not go out there with anything evil 
on my mind or any hidden agenda.  I went out there to hear 
evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote the evidence I heard from the B.C. Federation of 
Labour.  It said that provincial leader Gordon Campbell was 
against a referendum last summer when he said the people of the 
lower mainland should not be determining the future of the people 
of the Nass Valley.  Suddenly he is now in favour of a referendum 
because he is a Liberal-Reformer.  There is a whole pile of 
people who are just a bit to the right of Attilla the Hun and 
nobody playing left wing.  If one is a hockey player it would be 
a great place to be a left winger.  Vander Zalm and he are in a 
leadership race for votes.  It would appear as though they swim 
out of a very shallow gene pool when they are vying for votes on 
the right wing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The B.C. Federation of Labour also said that it was especially 
important for the labour movement to discuss the Nisga'a 
agreement everywhere it could since David Black who publishes 60 
community newspapers in B.C. had given instructions to his 
editors to publish only editorials opposing the settlement.  Is 
that freedom of the press? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the other Black.  If one is a Reformer I guess two 
Blacks make a right.  The press is skewered, narrow and biased. I 
challenged the press.  I said I would be more than happy to 
withdraw my comment that members of the press did not report the 
news in B.C.  They try to create the news in B.C.  They try to 
create it when 13 newspapers in my riding publish both sides of 
the story.  Generally the B.C. press is a very sick organization, 
promoting only bad news concerning the native population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the governor general asked the press to give good news a 
chance.  I challenge the press in B.C. to send me one item which 
shows something good being said about natives and native 
agreements, that they are not buying into scare tactics and 
fearmongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One organization on the Reform list, which was agreed to by both 
parties, brought in by that party was the Fraser Institute or the 
C.D. Howe Institute in British Columbia.  As a rookie in 1994 I 
went to the Chateau Laurier to hear the Fraser Institute tell us 
that the present Minister of Finance would destroy the country, 
that we would never get out of the $42 billion debt we were in. 
Everything was doom and gloom and would never work. Obviously two 
back to back balanced budgets have proven that statement wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my favour, I did not jump into the canal on the way back.  To 
say that we did not hear evidence to the contrary is just not 
honest.   We heard from Alpha Omega Capital Management which was 
hired by the member for Delta—South Richmond.  There was someone 
who owned a calculator and asked them to skew the numbers so they 
would look bad.  We listened to this group and asked questions. 
We received answers that had nothing to do with the truth.  If 
someone is buying the guy who owns the calculator, then there 
will not be much of a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What evidence did we hear from the B.C. Treaty Commission?  The 
B.C. Treaty Commission conducted hearings all over the place. The 
one question I asked at every meeting was for it to tell us what 
it would do to improve the treaty process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a treaty process.  It is not the old Indian Lands Act 
where we take a bunch of people, set them on a reserve somewhere, 
send a cheque every month and tell them they cannot do anything. 
One can see that by going to the Sheshatsui reserve in Labrador 
which has the highest suicide rate in Canada.  People have been 
taken and put 90 miles from nowhere.  They are sent a cheque 
every month and told not to bother us. 
They have no hope.  They have no future.  They have no history. 
They have no caribou to hunt.  They have no fish to fish.  They 
have no industry to lean on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that they want to do with these people?  Do they want 
to go back to that?  Is that what they are doing?  The treaty 
process is one that gives people fee simple, the right to own the 
land they build their houses on.  Is there something terribly 
wrong with that?  As a real estate agent for 30 years I say that 
it would be really nice for them to have fee simple as a basic 
right.  Why would that not be a basic right in the Nisga'a 
agreement?  Why would that not be something the Reform Party 
would adhere to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we hear out there?  We heard all kinds of evidence for 
and against.  We had demonstrations by the Reform leader, Mr. 
Vander Zalm screaming, yelling, calling us names, insulting us, 
trying to do everything to make us feel as unparliamentary as 
possible.  That was my 13th trip to British Columbia, by the way. 
I have skied there.  I have been at Whistler.  I have travelled 
extensively throughout British Columbia and it is the first time 
I have met people who were hostile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always found the people of British Columbia to be caring, 
to be people who used reason and logic.  They were basically a 
very friendly people with a very beautiful province.  There I was 
faced with all this hostility.  One of the people yelled out the 
name of the member for South Shore and said “Keddy, you are 
next.  South Shore, you are next”, as if they were going to get 
him next because he smiled at somebody in the audience.  That is 
how sad it was.  That is what we were dealing with out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To hear the evidence, to conclude from it, and to be told that I 
am less than a Canadian for even thinking that I could go out 
there and make an honest decision is beyond my scope of reason. I 
say shame on them for whipping up the crowd, for trying to skewer 
things so that we would not hear evidence, trying to manipulate 
the witness list and then trying to throw it back on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I am out of time but I could go on for a long time.  No, 
I do not have notes.  I speak from the heart. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, when the hon. member opposite talks about what is sad, I 
think it is sad when an hon. member of the House would get up to 
make all those types of accusations as he just did in his remarks 
and not have absolutely any evidence to back them up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made statements such as that he was appalled the Reform Party 
would stoop so low to these kinds of tactics.  He went on at one 
point to brag about the five minutes he gave up to my hon. 
colleague, the member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley, during 
the hearing in Prince George so that my colleague could address a 
certain witness who was appearing before the committee at a bit 
more length.  He is quite right.  My hon. colleague did thank him 
for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find appalling is that he obviously stooped to those 
types of tactics just so he could come into this place, stand 
before the television cameras and brag about how he gave up five 
minutes of his time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was present as well at the hearing held in Prince George 
because part of the beautiful city of Prince George is in my 
riding as well as in the riding of the member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley.  I had the good fortune, or the 
misfortune I guess is more closer to the truth, to attend that 
particular hearing.  I have a distinctly different view of what 
transpired and I will go into that in some length when I have the 
opportunity to speak and set the record straight during my 
remarks later today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member was quoted in the very first hearing held on the 
Monday of last week in the city of Terrace as saying “We are 
only in B.C. because of a tactic by the Reform Party to hijack 
parliament.  This little dance and song is costing $500 directly 
by the Reform Party”.

home— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  You had better stick with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I ask the hon. member through 
you—and obviously the viewing public will make this judgment—if 
that sounds like someone who went out to British Columbia for 
those five hearings on five consecutive days with the intent of 
listening to British Columbians with an open mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the type of comment that could be attributed to someone 
who went out there to listen with an open mind?  I think not and 
I think the actions of the hon. member and some of his colleagues 
clearly demonstrated that during the hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am always interested in 
the member's comments.  He is articulate and carries himself 
well.  He did so out at the meeting.  I do not think he asked a 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was asked to go as part of the committee.  I was also asked to 
stay home because of a vote that was to take place in the House. 
I said at that time, and I will say it again, that given the 
chance to go to Ottawa or British Columbia, no matter how bad the 
weather is, one bad weather day in British Columbia is better 
than five good weather days in Ottawa.  I was very anxious to go 
to British Columbia.  I went there with no preconceived notion 
other than from the evidence that I had heard from the Nisga'a 
and the treaty process in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt we did not have to spend $500, as the member said, but 
$500,000 brought on by the Reform Party.  I was glad to go.  I 
love British Columbia.  I will go back any time.  I would go next 
weekend if I could get away and the Reform Party would pay for 
it, which it said it would.  I went with an open mind.  I heard 
all the evidence.  I heard many things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the Reform Party would vote against the hate laws 
that it just voted against, knowing what it knows now.  Would it 
vote in favour of the Nunavik Act, knowing what it knows now? 
Would it not look at a treaty negotiated in good faith by the 
Nisga'a and debated for the longest debate in the history of the 
B.C. legislature and think that sends a signal that the treaty is 
a good thing, that the treaty grants fee simple? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about the vast regions of B.C. and that someone 
from Ontario would not know about them.  We are talking about 
2,000 square acres.  My area is 10,000 square acres.  I think I 
have a decent sized riding to be able to speak on rural Canada. 
I could go on.  I would like to ask more questions and receive 
some, but time does not permit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to begin by notifying the Chair that I am 
pleased to split my time with my hon. colleague from 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member across the way who just delivered his speech 
made some very serious allegations that I found quite disturbing, 
obviously since they were directed at me, at my party and at my 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start by noting that despite the claims to the 
contrary the reality is that the Liberal government in Ottawa 
shut down debate in the House of Commons on this piece of 
legislation after allowing the official opposition only four 
hours and 12 minutes of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I single out the official opposition other than the fact 
that obviously I am a member of it?  The reality is that in this 
debate we have the absurd situation where three of the opposition 
parties are in total agreement with the government. 
They are not opposing it at all, even though there are things I 
am sure they could find wrong with the legislation and the 
treaty.  They have to find something that they would oppose.  Yet 
to listen to them in debate, one would think that it was perfect, 
that the whole situation has been supposedly resolved, that it is 
a perfect piece of legislation and they have little to do other 
than to support the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, while we have had more debate than that, what is the 
point of debate or should we even call it debate, if speaker 
after speaker from the New Democratic Party, the Bloc Quebecois, 
and the Progressive Conservative Party are basically the 
mouthpieces for the Liberal government on the bill?  How is that 
a debate?  I think the people of Canada realize that it is not a 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only true debate taking place is by the official opposition 
in the points it is raising.  I pointed out to the viewing public 
that only four hours and 12 minutes so far have been allocated to 
members of the official opposition to bring forward these points 
of how the treaty, once implemented, is going to change the 
landscape of Canada for all time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that saddens me the most and which was really 
reinforced when the committee travelled last week to my home 
province of British Columbia is that democracy plays little or no 
role in this process.  In fact, if democracy was ever a part of 
our political system in Canada, it is certainly nowhere to be 
found in the debate on the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the members, as did my leader when he made his 
remarks earlier today, that this debate is not so much about the 
specifics of the treaty.  We have had the limited debate the 
government has allowed on that particular aspect contained in the 
treaty itself, the pros and cons.  Obviously, the government is 
not listening to the points being brought forward about some of 
the dire consequences once it is rammed through parliament. The 
debate today is about the process of holding a referendum on the 
issue and giving all British Columbians the opportunity to vote 
either to support or to reject the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the process that took place until now.  Hon. 
members from across the way, and I believe from some of the other 
so-called opposition parties, have stated that it was Reform that 
forced the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development to travel to British Columbia.  Contrary to the 
points of view put forward by some of the members across the way, 
it was not to try and orchestrate some huge protest or to try to 
demean individuals and their parties. We were hoping against hope 
that once the committee was in British Columbia it would actually 
listen to British Columbians about this legislation and treaty. 
Unfortunately, that did not happen.  Unfortunately, the committee 
chose not to listen. Unfortunately, it chose to prevent people 
from making presentations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to get the committee to spend more time in British 
Columbia.  We tried to get it to go to more locations than just 
the five: Monday in Terrace; Tuesday in Smithers; Wednesday in 
Prince George; Thursday in Victoria; and Friday in Vancouver. We 
tried to get the committee into Kamloops but there was no 
movement by the government.  It was opposed to letting the people 
of Kamloops come forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us review what took place at the meeting I attended.  It is 
the one I have firsthand knowledge of because I was there.  I was 
in the city of Prince George for that hearing. 
We started out with seven, possibly eight witnesses. A couple of 
possible or probable witnesses to appear were listed.  All but 
one were from out of the area, from the lower mainland, from 
Vancouver, Vancouver Island. As time progressed, people dropped 
off for various reasons.

George—Bulkley Valley and myself that we were left with four 
witnesses that would appear that day.  Three were from Vancouver 
or Vancouver Island.  Only one was from Prince George itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hearings began, my colleague from Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley and I attempted to raise a point of order 
with the committee chair.  We asked her, that since we had people 
who had dropped off the witness list and that since there were 
people who had taken time off work to attend that hearing that 
day who represented groups of local people in Prince George, if 
the committee in its wisdom could not decide to hear them.  We 
all know that a committee is the master of its own destiny.  It 
can make these decisions.  It can change the format.  It can 
change the witnesses if it so decides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chairman of the committee ruled that we were not even 
allowed to put forward that point of order.  The government did 
not want to hear the people from Prince George who had taken time 
off work to go to that hearing.  They were sitting in the 
audience, prepared to step up to the microphone and put forward 
their point of view on the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One group wanted to speak out in favour of a referendum.  It has 
a very special interest in holding a referendum. It was the 
organization that had spearheaded a local plebiscite in Prince 
George.  It was a voluntary plebiscite in which over 9,000 people 
participated.  Some 9,000 people in northern British Columbia 
came forward voluntarily to participate even though it had no 
mandate and even though they knew their vote would probably fall 
on deaf ears.  Nevertheless they came forward. People took the 
time to come from work or home to cast their ballot and 94% voted 
against the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That group, called B.C. in Focus is a non-partisan group.  They 
are not Reformers.  Certainly some of them are.  Both the hon. 
member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley and I are here as 
testament that we have pretty solid support in the city of Prince 
George so obviously some of those people who belong to B.C. in 
Focus, that lobby group and citizens group, are obviously 
reformers.  It is not some conspiracy concocted by the Reform 
Party of Canada.  It is an independent group.  It was refused the 
opportunity to put forward its point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other group was the Central Interior Logging Association.  A 
gentleman whom I know reasonably well, Roy Nagel, is the general 
manager. That group came with a brief to put forward to the 
committee.  The group asked for permission to do that and was 
turned away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some very unfortunate comments were made, I would agree with my 
hon. colleague from across the way.  On behalf of the citizens 
and people of Prince George, I would apologize to anyone. The 
hon. member for Nunavut is present today, and I offer that 
unconditionally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to look beyond the fact that those types of 
comments were made and look to why they were made.  It is the 
extreme frustration the people of British Columbia are feeling 
about this process and the treaty.  That is the problem.  It has 
been a closed door process from the very beginning. People were 
shut out yet again when this group came to Prince George. 
Unfortunately some people voiced their frustration in ways that 
were not very kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we have to turn a corner here. I call upon all members 
of all parties to exercise their right to vote in favour of this 
motion and give the people of British Columbia a referendum on 
this treaty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member from Prince George made a statement about something that 
happened in Prince George which I had no intention of bringing up 
in the House today.  I was there. I was at all the meetings.  I 
would like an answer from the member for Prince George—Peace 
River.  It would have been much more apropos to give the apology 
in Prince George, in the area the member represents with the 
people he represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we could debate all day 
whether it would have been apropos for me to make an apology.  I 
was not the one who made those comments.  I would never make 
those types of comments.  The fact of the matter is as I have 
said, that I think people were expressing their deep frustration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for South Shore was part of a process of sucking 
up to the Liberal government during the hearings.  That is the 
reality.  I cannot speak about the other four hearings as I was 
not there, but everyone who was present at the hearing in Prince 
George saw the type of opposition member that the member for 
South Shore is.  People were quite appalled by the fact that he 
supported the Liberal government in excluding people from Prince 
George who had taken time from work, had gone to that hearing and 
wanted to be heard.  He supported the Liberal government in 
excluding those people and in denying them their democratic right 
to be heard.  It has been pointed out that the committee incurred 
expenses with taxpayers' money to travel to British Columbia 
supposedly to listen to British Columbians on this important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the extent of their frustration and anger.  They had 
taken time off work to put their points of view forward. While 
sitting there they learned that the committee chair and the 
committee, supported by members like the member for South Shore, 
were going to deny them their right to be heard by the committee, 
yet their tax dollars had been used to fly in an author from 
Vancouver because he was the only person the committee could find 
who would support the Nisga'a treaty.  It could not find local 
people so it had to fly in somebody from Vancouver at taxpayers' 
expense.  This author was representing only himself. He was not 
representing a group.  He admitted that during his testimony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly that frustration bubbled over and some very unkind things 
were said.  As I already said I think the individuals who would 
have said those things, once they had calmed down, would 
apologize. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the member informing us of what took place in Prince 
George.  I was not aware of exactly what took place.  I have to 
admit that I am really saddened to hear that kind of a report 
coming from a group of people that claims to be a democracy 
travelling across the country listening to people.  What a farce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that I was in his riding and in the riding of 
the member for Skeena visiting with a lot of grassroots natives. 
Those people are suffering in squalor. They asked me if they 
would ever have an opportunity to have a word with the minister. 
I asked if they had every tried.  They have tried thousands of 
times but they cannot get to the minister.  They cannot get 
through to Indian affairs.  They are not listening to the 
grassroots people, the ones who are hurting the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Nisga'a matter came up and I became aware of the 
committee travelling to British Columbia, I alerted some of these 
people to attend the sessions and try to get a voice. Could the 
member tell me about Terrace and Prince George?  When the 
committee visited those areas, were grassroots natives trying to 
have a voice with the committee and if so, what was the result?

rightly pointed out, there were grassroots native people present 
who would have liked to have had a chance at the microphone. 
They were excluded and that was noted in the local paper.  It was 
not only non-aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a final point I would briefly like to make.  A 
referendum would not only give non-native or non-aboriginal 
people the right to vote on this.  Very clearly it is not just 
the Nisga'a who deserve a vote, but also the Gitksan, the 
Gitanyow, other tribes and other Indian bands in the province. 
They deserve a vote as well.  The referendum, were it to be 
supported by the House and put to the people of British Columbia, 
would accomplish exactly that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask for the unanimous consent of the 
House to divide my time with my colleague from Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent for 
division of the hon. member's time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed because 
my hon. colleague from Nanaimo—Cowichan had a very important 
intervention to make on behalf of Mr. Ken Conrad of his riding, 
which would have been very valuable since he was an RCMP officer 
who worked closely with aboriginal people in Saskatchewan for a 
very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a great many comments from members across the way, 
comments that were extremely egregious, comments that were 
extremely false, comments about the B.C. media being biased. 
This issue is not about stupid political rhetoric, it is about 
people. This is about the most impoverished people in our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to cite some examples from the first nation's 
aboriginal health task force which put together some information 
that I think would be very valuable to the House in understanding 
the scope of what we are dealing with, so that we do not have to 
listen to the idiotic comments coming from members on the other 
side which have no constructive basis whatsoever in trying to 
improve the health and welfare of the aboriginal people of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I have some comments from the aboriginal community. 
Fifty per cent of aboriginal people have a water supply that does 
not even meet the minimal safe drinking water guidelines within 
Canada.  Of the 613 water systems on reserve, 50% have no 
treatment facilities.  Of the 71,531 homes on reserve outside the 
Northwest Territories, 20,700 have no indoor plumbing and 16,900 
have no sewage system whatsoever.  Sixty-eight per cent of 
aboriginal people were on social assistance in 1990.  On reserve 
unemployment is greater than 30%.  Seventy-five per cent of 
tuberculosis cases were in aboriginal communities, and on and on 
it goes.  That is what we get for spending over $6 billion on 
aboriginal services today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If treaties are so good, then I think it is useful for us to 
take a look at where they have been employed, east of the 
Rockies.  If treaties are so good, and the Nisga'a treaty is 
something that the government and other political parties want to 
pursue, then they must have a good track record and they must 
improve the health and welfare of aboriginal people.  But that is 
not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we consider the treaties that have been signed east of the 
Rockies, if we look at what is happening to people in the 
trenches, if we look at aboriginal people on and off reserve, we 
see a deplorable situation.  They occupy the lowest social rung 
in our society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaties, in their current form, do not work.  They do not work 
because they further the separateness that is embodied in the 
Nisga'a treaty and the Indian Act.  The government was not always 
so fixed on its current platform.  In 1969 the Reform Party would 
have locked arms and pursued the course which the then government 
had agreed upon when the then aboriginal affairs minister, our 
current Prime Minister, produced a white paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time Prime Minister Trudeau said that aboriginal people 
stood at a fork in the road and they could do one of two things. 
They could either pursue the course embodied in the Indian Act of 
separate development, which has been like a boot on the necks of 
aboriginal people for more than 100 years, or they could pursue 
what the current Prime Minister said at that time.  He said that 
it was time for aboriginal people to move forward, to own land as 
individuals, to have equality with non-aboriginals, to have the 
same opportunities, goals, rights and responsibilities as 
non-aboriginals, and that it was time for integration, not 
assimilation.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the current Prime Minister said in 1969 with the 
support of Prime Minister Trudeau.  That is 180 degrees from what 
he is saying today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Reform Party that wants to get rid of the Indian Act. 
It wants to pursue equality and give every aboriginal person the 
same rights and responsibilities and hope for the future as we 
have in the House today.  The reason we oppose the Nisga'a 
agreement is not that we are against the Nisga'a people, it is 
because this treaty is an extension of the separateness and 
balkanization that is embodied in a 125 year history of separate 
development that has crushed the ability of aboriginal people to 
be the best they can become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year $6 billion is put into aboriginal affairs.  Where is 
that money going?  My colleagues from Wild Rose and Skeena have 
been listening to grassroots aboriginal people who have been 
telling them that they see money coming into the reserves but 
they do not know where it goes.  They say that their children 
still lie on cold floors in basements and they still commit 
suicide because they see no hope.  Where is the money going? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department of Indian affairs was forced in over 150 cases to 
intervene in the management of aboriginal reserves.  That is just 
the tip of the iceberg.  Most often the department does not even 
want to go to determine what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, who really gets hurt?  Is it the people 
at the top?  It is the people whom the government professes it 
wants to help.  They do not have a say.  The grassroots 
aboriginal people, the man, woman and child who are on the street 
on and off reserve, do not have a voice.  The Nisga'a agreement 
will not give them that voice because the power will be centred 
with the people at the top. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not want that for ourselves.  Why is the government 
trying to pursue a course that would cement this kind of control 
at the top without any municipal power for the people and without 
the people having a say in a meaningful way?  Why is the 
government continuing to support this course which has been 
proven to be an abysmal failure?  I cannot understand it and my 
colleagues cannot understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, our goals are the same.  Not a person in 
the House wants to see the state of affairs of aboriginals on and 
off reserve worsen.  We all want to see it improve.  Our 
objection is that this is not what the Nisga'a agreement will do. 
What is worse, it will be a template for other agreements that 
will be made in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the rest of the country does not understand is that in 
conjunction with Delgamuukw there will be an opportunity to open 
up treaties across the country.  If we think we have problems 
now, imagine what it will be like in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is even discussing who will pay for it.  In Alberta alone 
the cost of trying to resolve aboriginal claims is estimated at 
$107 billion.  Money does not grow on trees.  Where is the money 
going?  Would it not be better if we scrapped the Indian Act and 
made selective investments in aboriginal services so that 
aboriginal people would have the training, job opportunities and 
skills required?  People, regardless of their race, cannot have 
pride or self-respect if they are wards of the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For men and women to have self-respect and pride, they have to 
be able to provide for themselves, their families and their 
communities. 
That is the only way they will have the pride and self-respect 
which will enable them to stand on their own two feet.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What Reform wants is what the Prime Minister wanted in 1969, an 
opportunity for aboriginal people to exercise their traditional 
rights and responsibilities, to have the same rights and 
responsibilities as everyone else, to scrap the Indian Act and 
pursue a course of equality for all peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money that will go into this agreement and indeed the 
50-plus agreements that will take place in B.C. will create a new 
level of bureaucracy that was agreed upon by former Premier Clark 
of British Columbia.  It will also mean new bureaucracies at the 
provincial and federal levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than putting that money into bureaucracies, why do we not 
put it into the hard edge of making sure these people have the 
skills to provide for themselves, their families and their 
communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People cannot have pride and self-respect if they are wards of 
the state.  Over the last 125 years we have created an 
institutionalized welfare state.  If you visit many reserves, Mr. 
Speaker, you will see this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my time working as a physician on and off reserve I went 
to these reserves.  I saw people in the worst possible state of 
affairs.  I have not seen things like that since I worked in 
Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not have that in this country.  We should pursue a 
course that will empower and strengthen individual aboriginal 
people, rather than the leadership at the top.  That is something 
on which we would work with the government to pursue, but we will 
oppose the government if it tries to put the strength and the 
power of this agreement in the hands of a very few while 
excluding the majority. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened with care today to the member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask him questions in two areas.  The first concerns 
his suggestion that this is an agreement that does not respect 
the rights of the Nisga'a people themselves.  I believe that he 
said that the concerns of the grassroots Nisga'a people were 
being ignored in this particular process.  He talked about 
control from the top of the Nisga'a leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member is not aware of the fact that there was 
a vote among the Nisga'a people themselves.  I want to remind the 
hon. member of that.  There was a democratic vote among the 
Nisga'a people to ratify this particular treaty and 71% of those 
grassroots Nisga'a people voted in support of this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How on earth can the member suggest that this treaty does not 
have the support of the grassroots Nisga'a people when they 
overwhelmingly voted in favour of it?  I suspect that the hon. 
member himself got something less than 71% of the vote in the 
last federal election.  Is he suggesting that somehow his mandate 
was illegitimate because he did not get 71% of the vote?  I ask 
him that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second very brief question is this.  The member understands 
better than most members of the House the evils of apartheid in 
South Africa.  How could he possibly compare that to the 
ratification of this Nisga'a treaty, which is supported 
overwhelmingly by the Nisga'a people and the Nisga'a leadership, 
which will lead to a sense of pride and self-respect?  How could 
he so degrade and pervert history as to suggest that this has 
anything to do with apartheid whatsoever? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will educate the hon. 
member on one thing and that is what apartheid means.  Apartheid 
is separate development.  That is what the Nisga'a treaty is all 
about.  That is what this process is all about.  It is separate 
development.  I suggest that he look in the dictionary to prove 
that to himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to his first comment about what the Nisga'a said, 
he may be interested to speak to many Nisga'a people who are 
actually concerned that this is not representing their interests. 
Many of the Nisga'a people are going along with the flow because 
they do not see another option.  There are Nisga'a people who are 
saying very clearly to us that they have been excluded from this 
process, that they are not aware of what is going on and that 
they are not being told by their leadership what is going on. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened very closely to the 
hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  I know that his party, 
the Reform Party, is fighting tooth and nail against the Nisga'a 
bill.  I respect the hon. member's views very much.  Certainly I 
think he is always very sincere in the debates we have in the 
House. 
Just as hard as he is fighting now, his party fought very hard 
against hate motivated crimes.  Just this last week, we saw a 
tragic case in Surrey, British Columbia where a Sikh man was 
murdered.  The Reform Party in the House fought against the 
Liberals, the NDP and the Conservatives, and now it has voted in 
favour of increasing sentences for hate motivated crimes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think British Columbians and people who live in Vancouver 
would like to know from this member whether he and his party 
would vote the same way having seen what happened and having seen 
this law now work where the sentences were increased to those 
social misfits who murdered this innocent individual.   Would 
they still vote in the same way on hate motivated crime that this 
government and all members in the House, expect the members of 
the Reform Party, voted in 1995.  Would he still vote the same 
way and would his party still vote the same way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would first refer the 
minister to the comment by my colleague from Surrey Central, who 
is also a Sikh and who made a very eloquent, passionate statement 
in the House concerning that issue.  In our view, the scum who 
killed that Sikh gentleman should have been put away for a longer 
time.  That is the bottom line.  They committed an atrocious act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Reform Party is saying on violent crimes or hate crimes 
is that if somebody commits a crime against another person 
because of the colour of their skin, is that really worse than 
committing a crime, a random act of violence?  Is it worse if 
someone is hurt because of the colour of their skin or their 
religion, or if somebody happens to be passing by and their head 
is smashed in?   They are both victims and they have both been 
hurt.  They both have families that are hurt.  They both bleed 
equally and both feel the same amount of pain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the judicial system is not supporting the 
victim.  Right now the federal government should be pursuing a 
course where scum who commit an egregious act will be dealt with 
in a much stronger way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to be able to conclude the debate this 
evening on this motion put forward by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just returned to the House after a week of public hearings in 
the beautiful province of British Columbia.  I will begin by 
thanking all those citizens who participated, both directly and 
indirectly, in that process and for their views, which have been 
considered in the House and will be considered throughout the 
debate on this important process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand before the House today not only to show my personal and 
the government's support for the proposed legislation to ratify 
the Nisga'a final agreement, but also to clarify once and for all 
the many reasons why a referendum in British Columbia would be 
the wrong thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here to ask:  What Nisga'a treaty are the members of the 
opposition talking about, the real Nisga'a final agreement before 
us or the mythical one that they purposely continue to 
misrepresent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we can categorize any of the opposition party 
members as forward-thinkers, least of all their leader.  If they 
had their way they would subject their version of the Nisga'a 
final agreement to a British Columbia province-wide referendum. 
They claim that the treaty will be an amendment to the Canadian 
constitution and that it therefore triggers a referendum under 
legislation in effect in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they had read the final agreement, which my minister has 
suggested today, went out into the communities with those 
concerned citizens that they purport to represent and worked page 
by page and paragraph and paragraph through that treaty, they 
would have come to no other conclusion than that this was not a 
constitutional amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good treaty.  It is good for the people of Nisga'a. It 
is good for their neighbours who have said so.  It is good for 
the people of British Columbia and, therefore, I believe for all 
of us. 
They would see for themselves that section 8 of the general 
provisions chapter clearly states that the agreement does not 
alter the constitution.  In fact, we put that in the agreement 
specifically in anticipation of these questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I wonder if the member opposite can say that the Reform 
Party is purposely trying to misrepresent.  I would like to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  We are getting into 
debate right now.  The hon. parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am asking if the 
gentleman across the way is using parliamentary language when he 
accuses the Reform Party of purposely trying to mislead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  We are getting very 
close to the line right now.  I will ask the parliamentary 
secretary to please use his language very judiciously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would say that perhaps 
it was not purposeful, that it was not intentional but that it 
was perhaps systematic.  I think I will go to that safe ground 
and continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Bill C-9 affirms this provision of the final agreement 
and notes that our constitution is the supreme law of Canada. 
This agreement does not and cannot alter our constitution.  To 
suggest otherwise is nonsense. The rights contained in the 
agreement, including the governance rights of the Nisga'a, will 
be protected by section 35 of the constitution but the protection 
of these rights does not alter the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brian Slattery, professor of law at Osgoode Hall Law School at 
York University, agrees.  He says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in section 35 (or indeed elsewhere in the 
Constitution Act, 1982) to suggest that such treaties and 
agreements must be implemented by constitutional amendment in 
order to take effect or to receive constitutional protection. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peter Hogg, a recognized constitutional law expert and dean of 
Osgoode Hall, has also publicly said that in his opinion “it 
would be undesirable to hold a referendum every time a treaty is 
entered into with aboriginal people”.  It is worth repeating 
that at the beginning of the formation of our country, when the 
British crown signed treaties on behalf of the King of England 
there was not a referendum back in England or even a vote for 
that matter in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He continues by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These treaties are intended to provide clarity and certainty to 
aboriginal rights that have been held by aboriginal people since 
before European settlement. The treaties are long, complicated 
documents reflecting years of negotiation and much compromise on 
both sides.  It would be very difficult to communicate all the 
issues in a balanced way in a province-wide referendum. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was stated by Canada's leading constitutional expert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the opposition party propose to reduce a 500 page legal 
document to one question?  I can just imagine how loaded its 
over-simplified—and we have seen this after six years in the 
House—question might look, especially since it appears to be 
debating a different document than 80% of the rest of us in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point of negotiating treaties at all if the 
opposition party would have its way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Joe Easingwood wrote in the Victoria <I>Times Colonist</I> 
that “considering it has taken some 30 years, plus intense, 
complex and emotional negotiation to work out this proposed 
Nisga'a treaty, how can anyone with an ounce of credibility 
suggest that the issue can be boiled down to a single question on 
a referendum?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A referendum is a totally inappropriate way to deal with a large 
complex package of provisions such as the Nisga'a treaty.  And, 
the people of British Columbia have already had a voice in 
negotiations. 
The Nisga'a negotiations included one of the most extensive 
consultations and public information exercises ever conducted in 
the context of treaty negotiations in Canada.  Approximately 500 
meetings were held in relation to the negotiation of the 
agreement in principle and final agreement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the advice from these consultations is reflected in the 
document before the House.  For example, those consulted 
indicated that they wanted the treaty to represent a final 
settlement with the Nisga'a people.  The final agreement is a 
full and final settlement of the Nisga'a aboriginal and treaty 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third parties wanted conservation to be a priority in the areas 
of fisheries and wildlife.  The Nisga'a final agreement contains 
provisions to ensure that federal and provincial ministers retain 
their overall authority.  I will say that again.  The federal and 
provincial ministers retain their overall legislative authority 
to manage fish and wildlife.  Conservation, public health and 
public safety are identified in the final agreement as top 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other provisions contained in the treaty that allow 
Nisga'a lands to be registered in the British Columbia land title 
system.  We have heard a lot of hollering and yelling about 
communal systems.  This is not true.  These provisions are a 
direct result of third party advice that we have heard, listened 
to and acted upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also found through consultations that it was important to 
third parties that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
and federal laws such as the criminal code continue to apply. 
Those do as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third parties in advisory committees also indicated that they 
wanted all citizens to be subject to the same taxation regimes. 
Through the final agreement, the Nisga'a will pay taxes in the 
same way other British Columbians do after a transition period of 
eight years for sales tax and twelve years for income taxes.  And 
the Nisga'a government receives a tax exemption similar to that 
provided to municipal governments.  What could be more fair?  Do 
we not say that we want all people to be equal?  Is this not an 
important provision that the people of British Columbia would 
accept when we say that for the first time in Canadian history we 
have a treaty where the first nations people are saying to the 
federal and provincial crowns that they will pay those taxes the 
same way anyone else does?  I think that is an honourable and 
very dignified compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, the federal and provincial governments have entered 
into many agreements and passed many laws that have far more 
consequences on the majority of Canadians than will the Nisga'a 
treaty.  Let us take the North American Free Trade, the original 
Free Trade Agreement or the Columbia River Treaty.  None of these 
were subject to a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where referendums have been used in the past, they have been in 
respect of a single, or at least a relatively narrow set of 
issues.  Compare, for example, the complexity of the Nisga'a 
treaty with the single question that was posed to the people of 
Quebec in the referendum on separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is complex.  It deals with dozens and dozens 
of different issues.  Within each of these issues there are many 
complex provisions, compromises and specific arrangements.  This 
sort of package is not conducive to an all or nothing 
consideration demanded in a referendum vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Ken Georgetti of the B.C. Federation of Labour recognizes 
the ramifications of a referendum.  In his words: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a Final Agreement is one of the most important social 
and economic developments of the last century—A referendum on 
the Nisga'a Treaty would be analogous to requiring a public 
sector union to submit its collective agreement to a 
province-wide vote. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, to all Canadians this is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real goal for a referendum is to block the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leaders from all walks of life recognize that the Nisga'a treaty 
is the result of more than 20 years of intense negotiations.  The 
treaty represents a delicate balancing of interests and reflects 
the compromises and trade-offs made by British Columbia, Canada 
and the Nisga'a people.  It is not possible to re-open or attack 
one portion of the treaty without undermining the entire 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early on during the negotiations, Canada, British Columbia and 
the Nisga'a agreed at the negotiation table on a specific process 
they would use to ratify the final agreement.  We are now, 
thankfully, in the final stages of that process.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a have ratified the treaty.  The province of British 
Columbia has ratified the treaty with the historical debate in 
the provincial legislature, some 120 hours of debate, the longest 
in the history of that legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it is Canada's turn to go through the ratification process. 
This government is committed to concluding treaties with Canada's 
first people.  Treaty making is a federal responsibility under 
subsection 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1857.  The province's 
involvement is necessary in order to ensure that land and other 
resources are properly dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the legal reality is that treaty making is a national 
responsibility that transcends the interests of individual 
provinces.  This is reflected in the fact that the federal 
government is providing the great majority of money that 
represents the costs of the treaty.  The member for 
Burnaby—Douglas made that point earlier in the debate today. 
There is therefore no basis for a provincial referendum in which 
British Columbians alone would determine whether or not this 
national endeavour would go forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement represents a fulfilment of more than 
20 years of negotiations.  The opposition party would have us 
withdraw our commitment to it.  Honourable governments must 
continue to be honourable.  They must follow through on 
agreements negotiated in good faith.  Perhaps the opposition does 
not share this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community of Terrace is the closest neighbouring community 
to the proposed Nisga'a lands.  We heard this morning, this 
afternoon and throughout the debate that the mayor came to the 
hearings in Terrace.  He appeared before us and under 
cross-examination we asked him if it was only his view to support 
it because, as the the member from Skeena says, he is a Liberal. 
No, that was not true at all.  In fact, his six councillors 
debated a motion put forward by one of them several months ago 
whether to ratify or not ratify the treaty.  It was unanimously 
agreed to by the Terrace council.  It was unanimously agreed to 
by grassroots politicians to accept the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, Joanne Monaghan, regional chair of the district in the 
Nisga'a area representing 45,000 people and some 40 to 50 
politicians in that catchment area, appeared before the committee 
too.  Again under cross-examination, so that we could be very 
clear about the intentions of local people and grassroots people, 
she told us that unequivocally and categorically, having thought 
about it for years and originally not a supporter of treaties, 
that she supported it.  It was good for her, good for her people, 
good for the area and good for the Nisga'a people.  She believed 
as well that it was good for British Columbia and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A referendum would be just plain unfair to the Nisga'a people. 
When the negotiations commenced and when framework agreements 
were entered into among the parties, the understanding was that 
the final agreement would be ratified by votes of the Nisga'a 
nation, the provincial legislature and parliament.  We agreed to 
that and we will have our vote in parliament.  The Nisga'a 
agreement in principle included this understanding.  There has 
never been any suggestion that the Nisga'a final agreement would 
be passed outside that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we subject the Nisga'a to this process at two minutes 
before the hour?  No treaty or land claim agreement in the 
history of Canada has ever been subject to a provincial or 
national referendum.  By the time all land claims in British 
Columbia have been settled 30 to 50 treaties will have been 
signed.  Is the opposition saying that it would subject each one 
of these agreements to a provincial or national referendum?  What 
nonsense.  Reasonable people understand how unfair and how 
foolish it would be to arbitrarily impose such a hurdle on these 
first nations people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a parliamentary democracy.  The federal government is 
composed of members who are elected and accountable to our 
voters, including the decision that was made on how the Nisga'a 
treaty would be ratified.  The people of Canada elected this 
government to do the right thing, and we are doing the right 
thing. 
We are honouring the terms of the ratification we made with the 
Government of British Columbia, the people of British Columbia 
and the Nisga'a people.  We are honouring the obligations 
bestowed upon us by the people of Canada who elected us.

mythical treaty and renege on their word to the Nisga'a people 
and the Government of British Columbia.  What are they really 
asking us to do?  Are they asking us to perpetuate the status quo 
in continuing uncertainty in British Columbia?  The opposition 
has proven adept at creating myths and continue to fall flat in 
making its intentions known for clear and viable alternatives to 
present to the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just not fair.  We have an agreement that will work.  It 
is one that is fair and equitable.  It was negotiated in good 
faith.  We have every intention of keeping our promise to the 
Nisga'a people, to the mayor of Terrace and to the politicians in 
that region who support it.  We will keep our promise generally 
with the people of British Columbia through the legislature and 
through their due process where this was debated.  We will keep 
our promise to the House and the honour and dignity of the House 
to do the right thing through both substantive and procedural 
justice so the treaty will come to the floor of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Party members on the other side will be standing alone 
with the 21st century only 39 or 40 days away on one of the last 
pieces of business we will do before returning to our ridings 
throughout Canada.  They will wear the badge going into the new 
millennium as the only party in the House to oppose progress, to 
oppose peace among Canada and the first nations people, and to 
oppose moving them from the backwoods and the doorsteps into the 
front with all Canadians in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleagues I want to say that we will not have 
anything to do with it.  We are doing the right thing.  We will

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, last 
week I had the pleasure of participating in the work of the 
Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development with the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too noted that, contrary to what Reformers are saying, a 
number of individuals, groups and even other first nations 
support the Nisga'a agreement, although we should be concerned 
about problems of overlap that certain nations have drawn to our 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to comment on what the parliamentary secretary said, to 
note that the federal government does not appear to want to hold 
a referendum, to take the approach proposed by Reformers, 
because not only does it want to respect the will of the 
provincial government to consult and take the decisions it sees 
fit in this regard, but also, and particularly, because it wants 
to respect the decision of the Nisga'a nation, which has itself 
opted, through a referendum, for the new political status 
conferred on it by the Nisga'a Final Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore very pleased to note the will of the federal 
government to respect the popular and political will of the 
Nisga'a nation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think it was more of a 
comment by my distinguished colleague.  I thank him for his good 
work on the committee as we travelled through rural British 
Columbia.  I have great respect for the member.  Those watching 
television right now, including my friend Jeremy from Oakbank, 
would want to know that the member who just asked the question is 
an expert in these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We respect the wishes of the people.  We have done 
that with respect to the Nisga'a.  They held their own internal 
process which was outlined in the agreement in principle. 
They went through that ratification process, voting with members 
both off and on reserve, as was noted by the member from Burnaby 
and others today, with an acceptance of 71%.  I think that is a 
good number of to start with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this member just recently shut down some interventions in the 
House on behalf of Canadians.  I would like to ask him on behalf 
of my constituents if he agrees with the statement that Mr. Ken 
Conrad from my riding wanted to make to the aboriginal affairs 
committee when it travelled to Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with many other Canadians in B.C. he was not allowed to 
address his concerns.  I am told that members such as the one 
opposite simply mocked the people who had any concerns about 
Nisga'a.  That does not surprise me with the Liberal record on 
undemocratic methods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the hon. member about this comment.  Mr. Conrad says 
that all this is an ill-conceived creation of the federal Liberal 
and provincial NDP governments.  From all that he can gather from 
discussing these agreements with his native friends, governments 
made no efforts to reach out to the grassroots natives who must 
live with this decision.  The only people they have consistently 
consulted with are the persons whom they deem to be leaders of 
the communities.  He suggests that they not use the excuse they 
can submit their concerns directly to the department of Indian 
affairs, that it is common knowledge that any adverse 
communication ends back in the hands of those being criticized. 
They have failed to communicate with these people directly and 
have lost their respect in any process which they are currently 
undertaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this gentleman who has worked with native Canadians for a 
long time is correct then I am asking the member if this does not 
bode ill for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question.  The process with respect to the selection of 
witnesses was done in camera.  Although the Reform Party has 
chosen to put that in the public domain, I will not go there, 
only to say that I have gone on record on CBC <I>Newsworld</I> as 
commenting that the House leader for the Reform Party, after the 
selection of witnesses, thanked me for being very fair and 
reasonable in terms of including a number of people from the 
riding of the hon. member for Skeena who wanted to be included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To Mr. Conrad, whom he is allegedly quoting, I suspect some 
person from his riding, I would say that in fact we did hear from 
these kinds of people.  There was a Mr. Barton who is a Nisga'a 
person who filed a number of charges in the courts.  One of the 
courts, the court of appeal, heard the case in Kamloops and ruled 
against him although there were a couple of court cases wherein 
he brought charges against the Nisga'a people and was found 
seriously wanting in those charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can report that he would say that if there is anyone who is 
grassroots it has to be Mr. Barton.  We accepted him and embraced 
him to come before our committee in Terrace.  We heard him for 
about an hour and a half in his testimony and we understood very 
clearly where he was coming from.  I do not accept at all the 
suggestion or allegation that we are not listening to grassroots 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is quite right.  I have spent quite a bit of 
time in my professional life working with folks from first 
nations.  I think they would be quite surprised indeed to learn 
that the Reform Party somehow was their spokesperson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It being 6.15 p.m.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to follow up on a question I 
raised with the minister concerning agriculture in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are suffering the worst income crisis since the 
depression.  The reason is that the cost of production far 
exceeds in most cases the costs and revenues they receive when 
they sell their products.  Farmers are feeling very desperate and 
abandoned by the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw in the <I>Star-Phoenix</I> and the <I>Leader-Post</I> 
newspapers on Monday, October 25 headline stories, which by the 
way were during the Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar byelection, to 
the effect that the Minister of Finance said that there will be 
$900 million more provided to farmers in western Canada. When I 
raised the issue in the House of Commons, the Minister of Finance 
ducked the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the Liberals, egged on by the Reform Party, cut 
more agriculture subsidies than has any other country in the 
world in the last five years.  As a matter of fact the Reform 
Party wanted more cuts to agriculture than we have already 
witnessed.  This has brought a great deal of hardship to our 
agricultural economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 there was the elimination of the Crow benefit.  This was 
a transportation subsidy provided to farmers in western Canada, 
not for free but in exchange for billions of dollars of assets, 
land and mineral rights provided to the railroads so they could 
use that revenue and those assets to subsidize inland grain 
transportation to the ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals eliminated the Crow benefit and they supported the 
CPR in getting rid of all of the very high profit centres.  Like 
the oil business, the pan-Canadian company which is now a CPR 
subsidiary does not contribute to rail transportation whatsoever. 
There is Cominco, the mining company.  There is the land company 
from CPR.  They have all made hundreds of millions of dollars of 
profits annually, yet the farmers are continuing to be squeezed 
by CPR and CNR at the encouragement of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the newspaper the other day, the minister of government 
services was quoted as saying “The disaster financial assistance 
arrangements are a good example of the co-operation and 
solidarity which characterize so well our Canadian society”. 
This is in reference to yet $100 million more going to Quebec for 
the ice storm.  He talks about how proud he is to provide this 
financial help on behalf of the government to help Quebec farmers 
and others. Yet when it comes to the disaster of mega proportions 
in western Canada, the Liberal government is nowhere to be seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to find out today from the Minister of Finance if 
he was playing politics in the Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar 
byelection when he falsely announced $900 million more for 
agricultural aid.  Was he misinforming farmers?  Was he 
misleading the electorate in that byelection?  What was he doing? 
Obviously, he did not come forward with the money.  Or did he 
just not understand the hardship that the Liberal government and 
the Reform Party have inflicted upon western agriculture? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to having an answer from the Minister of Finance 
this evening.  Will he come clean and tell the people of this 
country and the people of Saskatchewan why he misled them with 
respect to agriculture assistance? 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, while overall the agriculture and food 
sector is strong and makes a significant contribution to the 
Canadian economy, the government knows very well that the past 
year has not been an easy time for many producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The updated projections which were released on November 2 were 
produced jointly with the provinces.  The Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food does not produce incorrect or 
misleading information.  The $325 million upward revision between 
the July and November projections for 1999 is mainly the result 
of an increase in NISA payments, cattle and durum wheat receipts, 
combined with a decrease in operating costs, in particular, 
pesticide and fertilizer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm income forecasts are not the most important issue here. 
Numbers are fluid and changing.  Whatever the numbers turn out to 
be, they are just that, numbers.  The real subject here is 
people, not income forecasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know it is an extremely difficult situation for many farm 
families, particularly in the west.  As a government we will 
respond to the human situation wherever that occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the current income situation, the government 
moved to the aid of Canadian farmers by introducing the 
agricultural income disaster assistance program.  Through AIDA 
the Government of Canada is making available almost $1.1 billion 
to those farmers facing severe income declines.  With provincial 
participation, the AIDA program would now put $1.78 billion into 
farmers' hands.  This funding is in addition to the $1 billion 
that federal and provincial governments contribute each year to 
safety net programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
today in the House when I asked the government what action it 
would take to face up to the horrible reality that child poverty 
has increased by 50% since 1989 as a result of the finance 
minister's policy, the only reply of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development was that I should read the throne speech as 
evidence of the government's attention.  I have read it many 
times, searched high and low, and it tells us nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the minister to read the recently released National 
Council on Welfare report that slams her government for its 
inaction on poverty.  The National Council on Welfare is actually 
appointed by the government and has produced excellent reports 
that document over and over the plight of poor children and their 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just think of it.  Since the unanimous resolution was passed in 
the House of Commons in 1989, there are now half a million more 
poor children in Canada.  On every front, government policy is 
the reason for the growing gap between poor and wealthy 
Canadians.  Whether it is the elimination of the Canada 
assistance plan in 1996, the elimination of social housing in 
1993, or the broken Liberal promises on 150,000 child care 
spaces, or the cruel and vicious cuts to unemployment insurance 
that have literally driven women into poverty, the government's 
record is awful, just awful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken many times in parliament about poverty.  I have 
met with many social justice and anti-poverty and housing groups 
across the country.  In fact I travelled across Canada in 
February and met firsthand with front line housing activists.  I 
met with homeless people and people who are one paycheque away 
from destitution.  I can say they are fed up with the 
government's pathetic excuses and so am I.  I feel quite ill when 
I hear the typical message box response, the sweet words of 
concern, while the poor are being hammered and pepper sprayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So again I ask the government, when will the Liberal government 
stop poor bashing?  When will we see a real commitment to the 1% 
solution for a national housing plan?  When will the government 
use its massive resources for people, for a national child care 
program, for fair taxation, for housing and for healthy kids? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the government, no more professed concerns.  We need 
real substantive action to end the war on the poor.  I can 
already hear the Liberal message box response.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to review today the Government of Canada's housing 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, our national housing 
agency, is responsible for carrying out the government's housing 
policy.  The policy involves improving housing affordability, 
accessibility and choice in housing for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure my hon. colleagues that the government understands 
the importance of helping Canadians meet their housing needs. Our 
commitment to housing is visible in communities right across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Government of Canada contributes $1.9 billion 
to support approximately 644,000 community based housing units 
for seniors, people with disabilities, and low income families. 
This includes support for non-profit and co-op housing projects 
in many communities, as well as support for low income aboriginal 
people in cities and on reserves.  My hon. colleagues are 
probably familiar with such housing in their own ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through CMHC's mortgage loan insurance, Canadians are able to 
gain access to affordable financing choices.  In the past year, 
CMHC has helped Canadians gain access to over 475,000 homes with 
the use of mortgage loan insurance at no cost to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its research activities, CMHC encourages innovation in 
housing design and technology, community planning, housing choice 
and financing to improve the quality, affordability and choice of 
housing available in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is well aware that in spite of its significant 
efforts in the housing field, our country is experiencing a 
problem with homelessness.  We are working in partnership with 
governments, community organizations and the private sector to 
find solutions to this extremely complex issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rest assured the government will enthusiastically support the 
activities of CMHC to ensure that our national housing agency can 
continue to carry out our housing policies in the most efficient 
and effective manner possible for the benefit of all Canadians.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, on 
May 15, 1998 and again on November 3, 1999, I asked the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs when he planned to introduce legislation to 
ban water exports and removals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the minister introduced Bill C-15, an act to amend the 
International Boundary Waters Treaty Act.  These amendments will 
only prohibit the removal of boundary water between Canada and 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these amendments would cover only boundary waters such as 
the Great Lakes and Columbia River, they would leave out most of 
our lakes, many water bodies, the entire province of Newfoundland 
and et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a most frustrating situation considering the fact that 
we are still waiting for the water export policy as well as for 
the comprehensive water policy as recommended by the Pearse 
report 15 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the question of the proposed voluntary accord. I 
with to congratulate the federal environment minister for taking 
a watershed approach that would ban the removal of water from its 
natural basin.  Clearly, this is more comprehensive than a simple 
export ban as it makes ecological sense to stop bulk water 
removal at the source and not only at the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Minister of the Environment intends to do so 
through a federal-provincial voluntary agreement to ban water 
removal from major drainage basins.  I submit this approach ought 
to be broadened to all Canadian water bodies and not limited to 
boundary waters.  I am saying this for three reasons or at least 
two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the proposed voluntary accord would be just that, 
voluntary.  It would not legally bind any province to protect our 
water resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the proposed accord would do nothing to prohibit export 
initiatives undertaken by municipalities, crown agencies, 
corporations or even private parties.  Even if the provinces 
wanted to ban water removals and exports, it is the federal 
government that has the constitutional authority to regulate 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Understandably, the federal government hopes that a province by 
province voluntary ban would treat water protection strictly as 
an environmental issue and that trade lawyers will not see the 
disguise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, water removals and exports are already a trade issue 
since there is a challenge under NAFTA brought by a water export 
company against the Government of Canada for compensation because 
of British Columbia's decision to ban water exports.  Through the 
proposed accord, the federal government is thus asking the 
provinces to take their own action on banning water exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's definition of basins as Canadian is weak 
because basin describes a geographical feature without regard to 
political boundaries.  The concept of basin is problematic for an 
accord or legislation intended to secure resources management for 
political institutions.  This is an essential concept for any 
legislation that intends to withstand trade challenges that are 
exactly intended to transcend political boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed accord will lead to a patchwork of provincial 
initiatives, thus making Canada more vulnerable to trade 
challenges.  The legislation tabled today is, it seems to me, too 
limited in scope to provide protection to most of our water 
bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems quite clear, that a meaningful protection of our water 
resources requires the federal government to face the reality of 
international trade agreements.  In search of the most effective 
strategy to protect our water resources from exports, I would 
recommend:  first, to enact federal legislation designed 
specifically for the purpose of banning bulk transboundary water 
removals from Canada; and second, to renegotiate international 
trade agreements to seek an exclusion or waiver of water from 
such agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the parliamentary secretary's comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, Canadians are looking 
to all levels of government to take action now to ensure that 
Canada's freshwater resources are secure as we pass into the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government recognizes the importance of this 
question.  Last February, we announced a three point strategy to 
prohibit the bulk removal of water from all Canadian water 
basins. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to announce that marked progress has been made in 
connection with the three components of our strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As promised, we have today introduced in parliament some 
amendments to the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act.  The 
Government of Canada is therefore acting within its 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these changes, the Minister of Foreign Affairs will have 
the power to ban the bulk removal of water from boundary water 
basins. 
This means that the vast resources of the Great Lakes and other 
boundary waters—for example, Lakes Champlain and Memphrémagog in 
my own riding—will be protected from bulk removal of water under 
the federal legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The international joint commission, responding to the joint 
Canada-U.S. reference on water uses in the Great Lakes, concluded 
in its August 1999 interim report that there is no surplus water 
in the Great Lakes, and recommended, pending the final report due 
next February, a very cautious approach to bulk removals or 
diversions of water.  This is precisely what the federal 
government is doing in its strategy and amendments to the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be providing a formal response to the international 
joint commission soon, and the federal government has called for 
a Canada-wide accord to prohibit the bulk removal of water from 
all Canadian water basins.  The Minister of the Environment plans 
to have the agreement of his provincial and territorial 
colleagues on the accord within the next weeks.
