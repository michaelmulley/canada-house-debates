	Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 52, I request
					 leave to move a motion for the adjournment of the House on Thursday, October 4,
					 for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter requiring urgent
					 consideration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The softwood lumber trade action started by the U.S.
					 against Canada is costing thousands of jobs and is threatening one of our most
					 important industries. In British Columbia alone there is an estimated 15,000
					 forest workers laid off as of today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimates run as high as 30,000 in British Columbia
					 by the end of the year and nationally we are looking at 40,000 to 50,000
					 unemployed forest workers. This is a very serious situation indeed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need to go into further detail at this
					 time but there is certainly much to discuss that would be usefully done in the
					 House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I respectfully and earnestly ask that you
					 grant this request.</p>

				  </b>

	The Chair has carefully considered the matter and
					 wishes to take a little more time to consider the request of the hon. member. I
					 must say that my initial inclination is to grant the request. I am leaning that
					 way but I will consider the matter for a while yet. I will get back to the
					 House before two o'clock with an answer. I will communicate to the hon. member
					 as to when I will come back to make that decision.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased and honoured to take
					 part in today's debate to adopt the report of the Special Committee on the
					 Modernization and Improvement of Procedures of the House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to acknowledge the excellent
					 co-operation of opposition House leaders, namely the hon. member for West
					 Vancouver--Sunshine Coast, the House leader for the Alliance Party; the hon.
					 member for Roberval, the House leader for the Bloc Quebecois; the hon. member
					 for Winnipeg--Transcona, the House leader for the New Democrats; the hon.
					 member for Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough, the House leader for the
					 Progressive Conservative representative coalition; as well as the hon. members
					 for Fraser Valley and Longueuil.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to recognize the Deputy Speaker, the
					 hon. member for Stormont--Dundas--Charlottenburgh, for the excellent guidance
					 and leadership which he demonstrated as chair of the special
					 committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also a word of tribute to all members who took part in
					 the debate in the House and to my own colleagues who attended the caucus
					 committee meetings of the Liberal caucus to contribute their views. Presumably
					 the same thing occurred in other caucuses, and I want to congratulate all
					 members for their participation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, the members of our committee had a
					 specific agenda, one which was collective. The agenda was to improve our
					 procedural rules of this great institution so that members, both present and
					 future, could do better what they were sent here to do: represent their
					 constituents and defend their parties' policies, whether government or
					 opposition; a delicate balance. That is why we adopted at the outset that our
					 report would only have those items on which we all agreed to unanimously. Every
					 clause in the report is unanimous. The report is unanimous. If it was not
					 unanimous, it was not in the report at all. That is the system we established,
					 and that is one of the reasons why it worked. I credit everyone who contributed
					 to that process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am encouraged by the outcome of the deliberations.
					 The report proposes substantive recommendations which focus on the need to
					 improve procedural tools, members need to promote good governments and
					 modernize the functioning of the institution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not the be all and end all of reports.
					 This is the first phase. I would like colleagues to consider having a second
					 phase of modernizations in which we could inspire ourselves from the work done
					 by other parliaments.</p>

	Let us examine some of the recommendations. For
						example, we have recommended increased ministerial responsibility. I will give
						a few examples of this. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a 30 minute debate on the use of time
						allocation and closure motions. Time allocation is necessary, of course, when
						debating legislation, so that the government can put through its legislative
						program. The opposition parties are, I am sure, aware of that necessity but
						they object when the government makes use of it. There will be what might be
						termed a formal protest in which members could express their grievances and
						explain why, in their opinion, time allocation was hasty, unnecessary or
						whatever, depending on the circumstances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the main estimates, there will now be a
						measure by which the Leader of the Opposition can refer two of the estimates to
						the committee of the whole. In the past there has been criticism in this area.
						I recall comments by the House leader of the Progressive Conservative Party in
						this connection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his opinion, certain ministers did not appear
						enough before committees to defend their budgetary estimates. If this occurs in
						the future, the Leader of the Opposition could require them to debate their
						budgetary estimates in the House before the cameras. This would be an incentive
						for ministers to appear in committee, knowing that otherwise they will be
						brought to the floor of the House. I think this is a good measure and I agree
						with those who wanted it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the workings of the House, a certain
						number of existing rules have been modified and new rules have been
						recommended. For example, votes held at the end of the day, which require a 15
						minute bell, and sometimes a 30 minute bell if the vote is unexpected, are not
						always necessary. If, for example, votes were held immediately following oral
						question period, when parliamentarians are already in the House, clearly we
						would not need to wait for 15 minutes since everyone would already be present.
						Therefore there will be a rule whereby votes may be held immediately following
						oral question period, as many parliamentarians have suggested. I thank them.
						This will now be part of the standing orders, when we return from the
						Thanksgiving break, a week from now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b>Regarding the timetable for government bills,
						there will now be a mechanism, to be tested for a six month period only because
						it is controversial in the eyes of the opposition, which will make it possible
						to establish a timetable for a bill. If the bill takes more time in the House,
						it will automatically be given less in committee. If the bill goes through the
						House more quickly, it will allow for a more in-depth study in committee. We
						could thus, if we so decide, establish a timetable similar to what exists in
						the British parliament. This measure will be tested for six months.</p>


	<A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are written questions on the order paper, a
						matter which again is a source of contention. I have had to deal with that in
						the many years I spent in opposition, too many if I could
						editorialize.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members want to have their questions answered. If
						ministers pass the deadline for answering them, the matter would now be
						referred to a standing committee in which a report would be required in
						addition to permitting an additional question for every one that remained
						unanswered. If a member was entitled to have four questions on the order paper
						and the minister did not answer any of them, at the end of the deadline the
						member could add a fifth one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One does not stall the process of answering questions
						by allowing the order paper to be overloaded. That will not be possible anymore
						in the unlikely event that any minister, or particularly their officials, are
						inclined to do that at the present time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ratification of the appointment of officers of
						parliament, the rules right now are a hodgepodge. The appointment of certain
						officers of parliament require a resolution of the House. Others require a
						study by a committee and the House. Others require a debate. Some are
						non-debatable and so on. On others the House is not consulted at all. Now there
						will be a uniform method.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An officer of parliament would now be appointed by a
						vote of the House in every case and there would not be a debate. It would
						simply be a non-debatable motion, but the House would always pronounce itself
						whether it be the appointment of a clerk, or the auditor general or any other
						officer of parliament. The system will be made uniform for all
						appointments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of opposition day motions was a bone of
						contention for government members in the past. They always felt that they found
						out the subject matter for debate at the last minute. The opposition group or
						party proposing the motion obviously knew what it would propose, so it had a
						head start and the government could not react because the minister was not in
						town to answer or had little time to prepare. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, one hour prior to opening on the sitting day
						prior to an opposition day, the government and Speaker would have to know what
						the subject would be. I believe that will be a good system. It will permit the
						government to hopefully provide better answers, although I thought the answers
						were already pretty good, to debates initiated on opposition days.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would be given a greater opportunity to
						participate in parliamentary debate and to be heard under the new mechanism. I
						thank everyone for agreeing with this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the issue of candidacy for speakership,
						something that is of interest to every MP, particularly new MPs in parliament.
						When they are called upon to vote for a speaker they may never have met or seen
						the candidates. Now, candidates would be able to speak for five minutes in the
						House to announce to their colleagues their candidacy, if they wish to do so.
						It is not obligatory for someone to do so but this opportunity would be given.
						We were informed that this procedure which exists in the U.K. House.</p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the topic of ministerial statements, the members
						of the committee agree to recommend strongly that the government make greater
						use of ministers' statements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will therefore change the order of the House to
						allow a minister to make a statement on a bill he or she will then introduce.
						At the moment the order is reversed and this is not allowed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the broadcasting of committee
						proceedings. If ever there was a good time to speak of this it is today. With
						the situation, national security and the unspeakable events that occurred in
						the United States on September 11, I think one committee room equipped for
						television is not enough. From now on there will be two.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that if this does not prove to be enough we
						can have a third, but at least we will double parliament's ability to televise
						committee hearings. This is more than double, if we count it, because it is
						exponential.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One committee monopolized the room almost all the
						time. This arrangement will make the room more accessible than it was in the
						past.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take note debates will now be conducted in committee
						of the whole. This will enable fewer members to join together to hold in the
						House of Commons a somewhat more intimate debate, rather than speak some 50
						metres away, which is often the case in evening debates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have in fact used this approach informally for
						several months now. Here again this is something I noted in the British
						parliament and suggested to my colleagues. Informally, we tried it on several
						occasions, and I think we are happy with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards private members' business, we know how
						important it is to members. We are aware of the impact of any change. In this
						regard, the House leaders agreed that we should hear from the Standing
						Committee on Procedure and House Affairs rather than deal with this ourselves
						because, after all, none of us, by definition, is a backbencher, but we do
						listen to comments.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the changes today would fulfill in
						part a commitment made by the government in the Speech from the Throne earlier
						this year to modernize the rules of the House. They would also fulfill an
						unwritten commitment, if I can call it that, that all of us have had for a long
						time: to improve the rules and the functioning of this place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes are part of the ongoing work of the House
						on parliamentary reform. They are based on all party and all member agreement
						and they reflect our goodwill and desire to make the institution
						work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will repeat something I said at the beginning. This
						is only the first phase. During the first phase I went to the U.K. with the
						then opposition House leader and we learned a lot from what it did. We should
						repeat the same exercise and learn what other parliaments do. We should have a
						second phase of modernization once we have had a few months to test how this
						round works. We could then adjust it if necessary with the consent of everyone,
						and hopefully proceed to the second phase.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I offer my sincere thanks to all hon. members for
						their co-operation. Although the rules are imperfect, having been made by
						humans, I am convinced they would make parliament work better.</p>

					 Vancouver--Sunshine Coast, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will start this morning by thanking all
					 members of the committee for the work they have done on the modernization of
					 parliament. I specifically thank the clerks, Audrey O'Brien and Diane Diotte,
					 for the great job they did in assisting the committee through all the work, as
					 well as our researcher, James Robertson. They did a commendable job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also thank the Deputy Speaker, the member for
					 Stormont--Dundas--Charlottenburgh, who acted as chair for the committee which
					 had to come up with a unanimous report. It is not always easy to be a chair and
					 deal with all the political parties in this type of debate. I congratulate
					 members for the work they did. I thank them on behalf of all parliamentarians
					 and all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democratizing government and improving its
					 accountability are bedrock Alliance principles. When the 37th parliament began
					 the Liberal government was not interested in reforming parliament in a
					 meaningful way. It started off on the wrong foot. The only reform pursued by
					 the government was the restriction of the ability of members to submit
					 amendments at report stage. The scheme was so unpopular it required the use of
					 closure to ram it through.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite that start the House established a
					 modernization committee. I commend the government House leader for agreeing to
					 the parliamentary reforms in the report. Most of the proposals tend to favour
					 the opposition. I think the government House leader recognizes that over time
					 the opposition has lost a great deal of procedural ground. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result parliament has been on the brink of
					 becoming dysfunctional. The government's powers are sweeping. If the opposition
					 is to provide the necessary checks and balances it must be accorded certain
					 rights. An opposing view is crucial to the functioning of
					 parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stanley Knowles, who was a fierce defender of the
					 rights of the opposition, said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

						  the rights and functions of the opposition to the government of the day. Only
						  in this way can you protect the rights of minorities. Only in this way can you
						  make sure that the force of public opinion will be brought to bear on the
						  legislative process.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another respected parliamentarian, former Prime

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal should be to work toward establishing equality
					 of strength between the government and the opposition. While the report is
					 moving in the right direction we still have a long way to go. I am pleased the
					 government House leader talked about digesting the report for a while and
					 looking forward to making further changes in the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the ideas and concepts in the modernization
					 committee's report came from the Alliance Party's parliamentary reform package,
					 building trust, that it launched at the beginning of parliament. We approved
					 allowing candidates for speaker to make speeches prior to their election. This
					 would let all members see and hear the candidates in the Chamber before there
					 is a vote.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another change pertains to the use of written questions
					 and the reference of unanswered questions to a standing committee. This would
					 increase the opposition's long term ability to hold the government accountable
					 for its actions, something we have not been able to do in the history of this
					 parliament. It is an important change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a requirement for the minister sponsoring any
					 bill whose passage involves closure or time allocation to justify the use of
					 closure in a 30 minute question and answer session. This would make the
					 government pay a political price each time it invoked closure. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would ensure Canadians received an explanation from
					 the minister. They would be entitled to an explanation not from the minister's
					 parliamentary secretary or the government House leader but from the minister
					 responsible. The minister would need to explain why the bill needed to have
					 closure in the House. It is an important move. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approval of the House of the appointment of the
					 clerk of the House and officers of parliament would recognize that they report
					 to parliament and not to cabinet or the Prime Minister. That is a positive
					 move.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requiring that annual reports of officers of parliament
					 be referred to and considered by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House
					 Affairs would ensure that elected parliamentarians gave them careful and timely
					 consideration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The televising of committees should be expanded.
					 Committees are where most of the real work of parliament happens. Up to now few
					 have been televised. The proposal would have them videotaped and made available
					 to CPAC and the press gallery.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this time of crisis due to terrorism and the
					 prospect of going to war it will be especially important that all major
					 committee hearings over the next few weeks are televised across the nation.
					 People should be able to see the head of CSIS, the head of our defence forces
					 and the ministers in charge being questioned by all members of the House. That
					 will be very important. It is a crucial part of the report.</p>


	<A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee recommended an improvement to the way the
					 estimates are considered. Each year the Leader of the Opposition, in
					 consultation with opposition House leaders, would be empowered to refer the
					 estimates of two departments to committee of the whole. Ministers would be
					 required to defend their estimates in the House for up to five hours. This
					 would improve and highlight the accountability process of the
					 estimates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is done in provincial legislatures now. When I was
					 minister of the environment in British Columbia I would sometimes be questioned
					 in the house by the opposition for hours and days on the estimates in my
					 department. That would happen here with only two ministers but it is a good
					 start. It would bring accountability to each minister. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witnesses in committee would be reminded that they are
					 required to tell the truth when appearing before a committee. They would be
					 informed by the chairman of the consequences if they do not. That is
					 important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be remiss not to mention the report's
					 unfortunate omissions. We have a lot more work to do. I am pleased that the
					 government House leader agrees with that. The committee did not consider
					 tackling the issue of free votes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The McGrath committee studied the confidence convention
					 and concluded that only explicit motions of confidence or matters central to
					 the government's platform should be treated as confidence. All references to
					 confidence were expunged from the standing orders that regulate the functioning
					 of parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these reforms most votes of parliament still
					 take place along strict party lines. Recently the opposition adjourned the
					 House on a Thursday afternoon. Some members wondered if that could be
					 considered a matter of confidence. This is a clear sign that members need to be
					 reminded about the confidence convention. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Calgary Southwest described this
					 point in a speech he delivered in the House in April 1998. He said: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>There is a myth in the House that
						  lurking out there somewhere is the fiery dragon of the confidence convention,
						  the erroneous belief studiously cultivated by the government that if a
						  government bill or motion is defeated, or an opposition bill, motion or
						  amendment is passed, this obliges the government to resign. This myth is used
						  to coerce government members, especially backbenchers, to vote for government
						  bills and motions with which they and their constituents disagree and to vote
						  against opposition bills, motions and amendments with which they substantially
						  agree. The reality is that the fiery dragon of the confidence convention in its
						  traditional form is dead. The sooner the House officially recognizes that fact,
						  the better for all. </small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not recommend changing any rules because there
					 are no relevant rules to change. We wanted to reaffirm what the rules are. We
					 could adopt a motion that says the House shall not consider the vote on any
					 motion to be a question of confidence in the government unless the motion is
					 directly related to the government's budget or the motion is explicitly worded
					 as a question of confidence. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were hoping the committee would recommend wording to
					 clarify ministerial responsibility. We have a lot of documents written by the
					 PCO and academics, but the House has never made a statement of its own. It is
					 ironic because ministers are responsible to the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.K. passed a resolution regarding ministerial
					 accountability. It can be found on page 63 of the 22nd edition of Erskine May.
					 We should come up with our own wording. The statement should include the usual
					 constitutional references and some additional statements to address recent
					 issues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House should urge the Prime Minister to make
					 important announcements in the House and not at Liberal fundraisers. The ethics
					 counsellor still reports to the Prime Minister instead of to the House
					 regarding the ethics of cabinet ministers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election of standing committee chairmen and
					 vice-chairmen by secret ballot were not included in the report. It would have
					 brought more autonomy to committees. The election of the Speaker by secret
					 ballot was designed to take the choice away from the Prime Minister and give it
					 to the entire House. Since committees are creatures of the House and the
					 independence of chairmen is as important to members when they are in committee
					 as when they are in the House, the secret ballot procedure used to select the
					 Speaker should be applied to the election of standing committee chairmen and
					 vice-chairmen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removing parliamentary secretaries from committees was
					 another proposal the government felt it could not live with. This would have
					 strengthened the independence of committees. Committees will continue to be
					 impeded by the interference of cabinet through parliamentary
					 secretaries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was progress on closure and time allocation.
					 While the committee recommended a 30 minute question period before a motion of
					 time allocation or closure is moved, it could have gone further. It could have
					 recommended that the Speaker be granted more authority to deny a motion from
					 being put if he felt the rights of the minority were being
					 infringed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee also failed to come up with an agreement
					 on adding a question and comment period to a minister's speech on second and
					 third reading stages of a bill. We will therefore have to continue the practice
					 of allowing ministers to drone on for 40 minutes without an opportunity to
					 challenge what they are saying. The most interesting and informative aspect of
					 debate is the question and comment period. The bill would deny us that on most
					 important speeches.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regrettably there is no progress on private members'
					 business, just the expression that the Standing Committee on Procedure and
					 House Affairs should deal with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our supply motion last June was designed to commit the
					 Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to come up with a workable
					 proposal allowing for all items to be votable by November 1. The recent survey
					 by the subcommittee on private members' business indicated that over 70% of the
					 members were unhappy with how the system works. An overwhelming majority wanted
					 all items in the House to be votable. We hope that will happen by November 1.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee did not see fit to come up with a
					 workable procedure to deal with omnibus bills. The way we presently deal with
					 omnibus bills is described on page 619 of Marleau and Montpetit. It suggests
					 that historically disputes over omnibus bills are brought about by political
					 interaction. It describes on page 618 how the opposition paralyzed the House
					 for 14 days in 1982. Surely there is a better way to resolve disputes of this
					 kind. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our most recent example of Bill C-15 was handled in a
					 similar although less severe way. Apart from the begging of all opposition
					 parties, the official opposition had to threaten the smooth and timely manner
					 that legislation is processed through the House. There must be a better way.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker could be given the authority to divide a
					 bill if in his opinion the omnibus nature of a bill prevents members from
					 casting their votes responsibly and intelligibly on behalf of their
					 constituents. I do not see why committees cannot be given the authority to
					 divide a bill without having to seek the authority of the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may also be a simpler solution. The government
					 could negotiate with the opposition what principles are to be lumped together
					 in an omnibus bill before tabling the legislation. This would eliminate
					 unnecessary procedural battles in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank all my colleagues and the House leaders in this
					 institution for the changes that took place. They are not perfect but we are
					 certainly moving forward.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by explaining to those who
					 are listening to us that it is extremely important, in a debate like this one,
					 in a job like the one done by House leaders, to be objective and
					 non-partisan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is quite simple. To amend the rules of
					 debate in parliament is not a partisan exercise and it must never become one.
					 On the contrary, it is a highly democratic exercise whose objective must be to
					 improve the quality of the discussions in a this Chamber and to allow members
					 to play a meaningful role in the management of public business and in debates
					 on bills. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is always from this perspective that the business of
					 the House is conducted. In this regard, I must salute the efforts of the Leader
					 of the Government in the House of Commons who, unlike his predecessor from the
					 same government, never wanted to make any change that was not fully supported
					 by the House leaders of each party. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any change to the rules of debate in parliament should
					 get the unanimous support of the political parties concerned, because it has to
					 do with the balance of powers held by the various members, by the opposition
					 parties and to the government party in parliament. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes we are making today are extremely limited.
					 As the House leader of the Canadian Alliance pointed out earlier, much remains
					 to be done. Many of us could, and indeed do with all our heart, wish for
					 amendments to the standing orders but what we must understand is that what I
					 hope we are seeing here is the beginning of an ongoing process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this process, we have all brought our objectivity,
					 our experience and our desire for quality debate in parliament and, as I said
					 earlier, the result, however modest, reflects not just consensus but
					 unanimity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some advice for the government should it ever
					 wish to change the rules under which parliament operates, as it has done in the
					 past, without the agreement of all parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a government proceeds in this manner, it uses
					 its majority to unbalance, as it were, the debates we hold in the House of
					 Commons. Even if the intention is sometimes worthwhile, even if the purpose of
					 the change is good and desirable, this should never, in my opinion, be
					 something decided upon by only one, two or three parties. There must be
					 unanimity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I pay tribute to the government House
					 leader, who had the courage and drive to follow through to the end. I also wish
					 to thank the colleagues from other parties who set aside all partisan
					 considerations in the interests of the quality of the debates we hold in this
					 parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I place such emphasis on this? Let me explain.
					 What one must understand is that whenever changes are made to the ways things
					 are done, the manner of debating, or the rules of procedure in a parliament
					 based on the British model, as ours is, not only does this affect the balance
					 within that institution but it also affects what is done in other
					 parliaments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those listening are entitled to know that, naturally,
					 we are not insensitive to what has gone on in the British parliament, in the
					 Australian parliament, or in other similar parliaments. </p>


	<A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, parliamentarians have made changes to their
					 procedures, in good faith and often by consensus. No one should accuse us of
					 wanting to reinvent the wheel just because we want to make changes. These must
					 be based on experience, precedent and rulings, in order to avoid actions being
					 taken with totally unexpected consequences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, therefore, be extremely prudent, but we also
					 need to compare what is being done elsewhere. Debates held in the parliament of
					 a country like Canada cannot be compared to debates held at the municipal
					 level, no matter how large the municipality, or in other types of deliberative
					 assemblies. Although we can occasionally take inspiration from good initiatives
					 elsewhere, we cannot model ourselves on anything other than parliaments with
					 the same task as our own.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, every time we make changes here, it has an
					 impact on provincial legislatures such as the Quebec national assembly, the
					 Ontario legislature and the like. It has impact on the British parliament, or
					 other types of parliaments, because it is a generally accepted practice for
					 parliamentarians anxious to improve the quality of their debates to look at
					 what others are doing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen in this light, our changes, no matter how modest,
					 are a step in the right direction. Some of them will allow MPs to play a more
					 significant role in the way things are done. Some will open up interesting
					 perspectives, so that we can continue what we have started.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must tell my colleagues in other parties that, in my
					 opinion, what we are doing today, and the report we are approving, is not the
					 end of the process but the beginning. We could not consider we had completed
					 our mission as House leaders by bringing in these changes to the way parliament
					 operates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many other improvements are needed as well but they can
					 all be introduced over time as the thoughts of each House leader and political
					 party evolve. We do not need an adversarial debate to explain to the government
					 that it is necessary to be more open, to allow the opposition to play a more
					 significant role. Nor can the government convince the opposition in an
					 adversarial debate that we have to accept the process operating more smoothly,
					 more rapidly and more efficiently.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone wants to hang on to their privileges. The
					 opposition wants to be able to stop unfortunate government incidents. The
					 government wants to be able to govern and make legislative decisions it
					 considers fair. The secret behind the job we have done and will continue to do
					 is to keep at all cost the balance we currently have while promoting the role
					 of the members and the opposition parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, at this point in time, the role of the
					 executive is increasingly important. This is what the analysts and the experts
					 in political science are saying: in our system, the Office of the Prime
					 Minister and the Prime Minister appoint all the ministers who sit here and draw
					 on the parliamentary majority. They pretty well hold all the power.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way the opposition gets to be heard is to
					 utilize parliamentary means to make the government pay the political price of
					 certain decisions we do not consider desirable. If the government is within its
					 right, public opinion will be the judge. The role of parliament is therefore to
					 alert public opinion to some of the government's decisions. Sometimes the
					 political cost forces the government to back down, to be a little more
					 conciliatory, even if all powers, in absolute terms, are in the hands of the
					 executive.</p>


	<A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain tools have to stay in the House of Commons for
					 reasonable use by the opposition to put a halt to undesirable government
					 activities. This is what parliament is all about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person does not need a lot of love for parliament to
					 recognize that a functioning parliament is an assurance of democracy.
					 Regardless of the difficult times we may face as a society, when parliament can
					 guarantee healthy and balanced debate between the various factions of the
					 opposition, the left, the right, the centre and the centre left and the
					 government, the public recognizes that the system works. Parliamentarians
					 recognize that their voters are being properly served.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a democracy where parliament is nothing more than a
					 pretence at democracy, we can expect the public to be discontent and totally
					 disdainful of an assembly where nothing happens other than members making
					 promises in speeches but powerless to change or influence the decisions of the
					 executive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is extremely important that our work,
					 which is well underway and which has led to non-partisan co-operation between
					 parliamentary leaders and political parties, can continue. We must go further
					 and benefit from other people's experience. We must improve the role of a
					 member of parliament and we must achieve an even better balance between the
					 opposition and the government to ensure that our debates can be conducted in
					 the most serene way possible, for the greater benefit of the people who elect
					 us--or members of other political parties--here every four years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this spirit that we must work. It is in this
					 spirit that we have worked and it is in this spirit that, personally, I have
					 always defended our participation in the parliamentary leaders committee. There
					 are two improvements that I find extraordinarily interesting and that I want to
					 briefly discuss. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one has to do with a member asking questions
					 to a minister after hours. There is now a better balance in the exchange
					 between the minister who provides a reply and the member, since the latter can
					 now respond. A kind of balance has been achieved and I think it benefits the
					 opposition, which is an excellent thing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the fact that an opposition day motion
					 cannot be amended without the agreement of the party that presented it. Under
					 the parliamentary system, such an amendment could change the nature of the
					 debate, since it could significantly change the nature of the issue debated.
					 The proposed change is a good one. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, when the government resorts to closure, the
					 minister who sponsors the bill will have to face a series of questions during a
					 certain period of time in the House of Commons. This will allow us to better
					 understand the reasons why the minister is using closure to pass his bill. It
					 will also give the opposition a better opportunity to explain why it is opposed
					 to a bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time a change is made to the rules of the House to
					 enhance the members' role and to hold those who are elected to this Chamber
					 accountable, we cast a vote of confidence in all those who cast their votes on
					 election day. As my role or the office I hold becomes more meaningful, so does
					 the decision made by my fellow citizens to elect me. By enhancing the role of
					 members and parliamentarians, we are paying tribute to the citizens who send us
					 here.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude by saying that this is but a
					 beginning. We must continue to work together. We must look to what others are
					 doing elsewhere in order to find the best possible approach. Beyond partisan
					 politics and beyond any political options, it is in everyone's interest that
					 the debates that take place in this parliament—as the ones that take place in
					 the national assembly in Quebec City and in the British parliament—be
					 constructive, positive, and earn it the confidence of the citizens that elect
					 the members.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this end in view, I affirm that this is a first
					 step, and we will continue the work. I offer my co-operation, and my colleagues
					 from the Bloc Quebecois also offer their co-operation. We need to do more in
					 this regard.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I did that for a couple of reasons: first,
					 because I am tired of seeing either no one or one or two members on the
					 government side, and second, it relates to one of the recommendations in the
					 modernization committee report which we are now debating, and that is the
					 recommendation to have committees sit at times other than when the House is
					 sitting, in the way that the House used to be run when I first arrived here 22
					 years ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we now have with this telescoping of the timing of
					 the work of committees and the sitting of the House into the same period of
					 time is a situation that is rendering this place increasingly irrelevant and
					 increasingly meaningless in terms of the sense one has when one is
					 participating in a debate on the floor of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should at least have the feeling, Mr. Speaker, and
					 we should in fact have the reality that we are actually speaking to somebody,
					 not just to you, with all due regard to the intensity with which you listen to
					 what we have to say. The fact of the matter is that if there is no one on the
					 government side to talk to, to even hear our--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member</b>: Out of order.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bill Blaikie</b>: There is nothing out of order
					 about referring to the government in the collective sense, I would remind the
					 hon. member. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no one on the government side to talk to,
					 then what is the point? What is the point of the opposition speaking? Who are
					 we speaking to?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one of the recommendations in the modernization
					 committee report, which is that the whips come up with a plan to have
					 committees meet at times other than when the House is sitting is in fact one of
					 the best recommendations in this committee report, because we cannot continue
					 like this. We cannot do our job properly if we have to be in two or three
					 places at the same time. While I am here I am not at the justice committee, of
					 which I am also a member and which is sitting right now, hearing witnesses on
					 Bill C-15. I cannot be in both places at once.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That may happen from time to time but it should not be
					 a regular occurrence. It should not be something that members have to deal with
					 all the time, constantly having to choose between the Chamber and committee. I
					 would certainly urge that after the passage of this report the whips get busy
					 right away. It may mean that committees would have to sit, God forbid, on
					 Mondays or on Thursday evenings or on Fridays. Committees always sat on those
					 days when I first came here. They sat Monday through Friday. We did not get a
					 week back in the riding after every three or four weeks either. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I am concerned, the whole place has become
					 kind of wimpy as far as work schedules are concerned. We should be making
					 better use of our time and not trying to telescope the work of the House and
					 the committees into this smaller and smaller period, which is getting to be
					 about two and a half days now. It just makes for a lack of quality time, shall
					 we say, here in the House of Commons and in committee. I am very much concerned
					 about it. One of the reasons I called quorum was to make that point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to read to the House something from the
					 committee report and highlight a few things. Let me read what the report says
					 under “Ministerial Statements”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear a cellphone, and that is another thing I do not
					 like, having cellphones in the House of Commons. We should have a rule against
					 it. We should not have to listen to cellphones going off when--</p>

					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying with respect to ministerial statements,
					 the report states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>First, it is important that more
						  ministerial statements and announcements be made in the House of Commons. In

						  made first--or, at least, concurrently--in the chamber. Ministers, and their
						  departments, need to be encouraged to make use of the forum provided by the
						  House of Commons. Not only will this enhance the pre-eminence of Parliament,

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironic that we should be debating and adopting
					 the recommendations of the modernization committee report that I just read, on
					 a day and in a setting where we have had major policy announcements repeatedly
					 made on topical developments. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could be more topical than the events of September
					 11? Major policy announcements have repeatedly been made, not in the House but
					 at Liberal fundraising dinners.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say to the government House leader that there is
					 something deeply ironic, if not hypocritical, about adopting this policy in the
					 context of a time when we have seen major policy announcements made, not in the
					 House but at Liberal fundraising dinners. I do not hold him responsible for the
					 behaviour of his Prime Minister or of the government entirely, and I hope that
					 in his heart of hearts he would agree with me </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister should have reported to the House
					 first after his meeting with George Bush as recommended by the modernization
					 committee report. He should have reported to the House first, not after or in
					 the course of fragmented responses to questions in question period. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However he did not. He is in violation of the spirit of
					 the report for not doing so, as is the Minister of Transport for whom I
					 otherwise have a great deal of respect. After a take note debate in the House,
					 which made the airline issue the property of the House of Commons, the Minister
					 of Transport did not come into the House and say that this is what we debated
					 last night and this is what he will do about the problem. No, the announcement
					 was made in the press gallery.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many times does this kind of abuse have to happen
					 before the Canadian public gets the message? Maybe Canadians already got the
					 message that parliament does not matter. It does not matter to the government
					 so why should it matter to them?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would hope against hope that the adoption of the
					 report would mean a sea of change in the way the government relates to
					 parliament through the increased use of ministerial and prime ministerial
					 statements. That would have been the statesmanlike thing to do. The prime
					 ministerial thing to do would have been to use the House of Commons in that
					 context. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question period, even at its best which it seldom is,
					 is too adversarial a context for delivering the kind of comprehensive policy
					 statements we would have expected of the Prime Minister in the context of what
					 happened in New York City on September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many good things in the report and I will not
					 have time to elaborate on them all. I have already alluded to the
					 recommendations having to do with ministerial statements and with the timing of
					 committees. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure that is recommended with respect to
					 closure or time allocation is a good one. We will see how it works. I hope it
					 will act as a brake on the government when it comes to time allocation.
					 </p>


	<A NAME="T1105"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1105)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When time allocation occurs I hope the government will
					 provide an opportunity for ministers to justify what they are doing, or at
					 least allow members of the opposition an opportunity to question the
					 appropriate minister. I am looking forward to seeing how it works.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was said by the Alliance House leader, I would have
					 preferred that the Speaker had been given some power independent of the House
					 to rule on whether motions of time allocation were in order, but that was not
					 to be. We could only do what was unanimously agreed upon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to enter a reservation on another item which may
					 turn out to be all right. It has to do with candidates for Speaker making
					 speeches to the House. The original McGrath committee, of which I was a member,
					 made a recommendation about how a Speaker should be elected. It was felt at
					 that time that it would be unseemly for members to campaign for the
					 speakership. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not a view shared by Alliance members when
					 they came here as Reformers. It is something they have managed to create a
					 consensus about, that there should be some opportunity for candidates for the
					 speakership to speak to members. I hope this will not lead to full scale
					 campaigning. I will wait to see whether or not the initial reservations of the
					 McGrath committee are borne out in this regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendation with respect to estimates is a good
					 one. We are going back to a former way of dealing with the estimates before my
					 time. It was in 1969 that the estimates were taken out of the House and sent to
					 committee in the way they are now. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not something that was done by all party
					 agreement. It was part of a package of so-called parliamentary reform imposed
					 through closure by the government at that time. The process may have worked for
					 a while, but it has not led to the kind of scrutiny of the estimates and
					 accountability in terms of spending that Canadians expect of their
					 parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to see we will return some of the estimates
					 to the floor of the House of Commons. As the Alliance House leader indicated,
					 this is something which is done regularly in many provincial legislatures where
					 ministers are accountable. Ministers have to answer for their spending in a way
					 that federal cabinet ministers do not have to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will comment on what the Alliance House leader said
					 with respect to the confidence convention. The whole issue about free votes has
					 been a preoccupation of his party since it got here. The Alliance House leader
					 pointed out that the confidence convention did not exist procedurally. However
					 it used to exist procedurally. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the language of confidence in the standing
					 orders prior to the adoption of the McGrath committee report in 1985. Members
					 were able to hide behind procedural language which said, for instance, that
					 because opposition day motions were motions of supply they were in fact
					 confidence motions. Therefore people had to treat them as confidence
					 motions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all gone. All the language of confidence has
					 been removed from the standing orders. The Alliance House leader is noticing
					 that in spite of that we have not had any significant change in the culture of
					 confidence. We have changed the procedure and the standing orders but we have
					 not changed the culture of confidence. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear what the Alliance House leader is arguing for.
					 At one point I would have hoped this would not be necessary. Maybe we do need a
					 motion in the House which lays out that only certain things are matters of
					 confidence unless they are deemed to be matters of confidence in the wording of
					 the legislation itself.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happens informally from time to time. A couple of
					 times the current Prime Minister has said something is a matter of confidence.
					 It is a way of signalling to his backbenchers that he will not tolerate any
					 dissent on the matter. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that should be regularized. If it
					 were regularized the possibility would exist for government backbenchers to
					 rein in their government when they feel it was going in the wrong
					 direction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of legislation could then be defeated without
					 defeating the government. That is what this is all about. However that was not
					 accomplished in this report. It waits for another day and will probably wait a
					 long time. I do not see the current Prime Minister or the current culture of
					 the Liberal Party as being terribly open to this kind of parliamentary
					 development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government House leader said that parliamentary
					 reform was an ongoing thing. I do not regard this committee report as reform.
					 It is well named when it is called modernization. Reform to me suggests a
					 redistribution of power between the government and the opposition and between
					 the Prime Minister and his backbenchers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much reform here; there might be a bit. I
					 am trying to make the government House leader feel better, but there is not
					 much that I would call reform. That does not mean that what is in the report is
					 not worth doing. However let us not go overboard and call it something that it
					 is not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still wait for the day when members of parliament
					 will have more independence from the government, particularly in committee. At
					 the risk of alienating the member for Fraser Valley because he sometimes
					 complains that I mention the McGrath committee too much, we recommended then
					 that committee members not be pulled off committees by the government when they
					 had the audacity to have independent thought, to think that the government was
					 not perfect, or to amend legislation in ways that had not already been
					 suggested to them by the parliamentary secretary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That raises another matter and another recommendation
					 in the McGrath committee which stated that parliamentary secretaries not be on
					 committees. Government members do not and should not need a coach in
					 committees. Presumably government members are able to exercise some kind of
					 rational, intelligent function and make decisions themselves without having to
					 take their cue from a parliamentary secretary. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had these kinds of things been included in this report
					 then I would call it parliamentary reform. I do not call this parliamentary
					 reform. Nevertheless I welcome it and I hope that we will be able to make the
					 best of what little we have before us.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the bill
					 today. I am sure the House leader of the NDP, who has long been an advocate of
					 parliamentary reform, will be in the House of course to listen to my speech
					 since he called us all in a few minutes ago to be part of that. I am sure he
					 will not be leaving momentarily to do anything else.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people have put a lot of work into bringing
					 this forward and they should be congratulated. Although these are tiny steps in
					 an effort to modernize parliament, they are good in the sense that something
					 has been done. I thank the members who sat on the committee for their work. I
					 know it is not easy to bring consensus on these kind of things, and they have
					 been able to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that maybe I had a small part in this as well.
					 In January of this year I brought forward a document called, “Building Trust”.
					 At the time, when I was House leader, we made 12 specific proposals that we
					 thought would at least help parliament be more responsive and help to build
					 trust between constituents, Canadians and the House of Commons. The immediate
					 reaction from the government House leader was that these were half-baked and
					 preposterous ideas, and that they could not be done. I do not know if he was
					 right or not but exactly half of the recommendations that I brought forward at
					 that time are included in the report. So maybe they were half-baked in the
					 sense that only half of them were accepted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that after the initial knee-jerk
					 reaction of nothing can change, it always has to stay the same, we did make
					 some progress with the report and the baby steps of change perhaps have started
					 once again. Perhaps under a different administration, and I think that is what
					 it will take, the important steps necessary for true parliamentary reform will
					 take place. It is very important that change does take place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Maclean's</i> magazine last year it did a poll
					 amongst business people and concluded that 7% of business people believe that
					 members of parliament have a significant impact on the actions of the
					 government. Only 7% think that what we do here makes a difference in the laws
					 of the land. When people want things changed do they go to their member of
					 parliament? Knowledgeable business people frequently do not bother. They go to
					 NGOs, business advocacy groups and to lobbying firms. They find that is more
					 effective than talking to members of parliament because members of parliament
					 are shut out too often from the important work of parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will read a quote from 1968 in which a person
					 lamented:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>So this is your Member of Parliament;
						  whipped by the discipline of the party machines; starved for information by the
						  mandarin class; dwarfed by the Cabinet and by bigness generally in industry,
						  labour and communications; ignored in an age of summitry and the leadership
						  cult.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was said by John Turner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that was a problem in 1968, I can assure Mr. Turner
					 that the problem is at least as severe now, perhaps worse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of parliament are often the last to know about
					 important government decisions and important government legislation. Time and
					 again, in the last parliament and again in this parliament, we see members of
					 parliament coming forward with points of privilege asking why it is that some
					 industry leader or some advocacy group got a copy of a piece of legislation
					 before it was tabled in the House. Why is it that ministers go to press
					 conferences and make announcements or ministerial statements without bothering
					 to even consult or tell the House or even announce it simultaneously in the
					 House? We just read about it in the newspapers. The Speaker frequently gets up
					 and says doing that is not good practice and urges the government not to
					 continue to do it, but of course it just continues to do it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important, for real parliamentary change, to
					 enhance the role of members of parliament. Enhancing the role of members of
					 parliament would not only allow us to recruit good candidates in years to come
					 but good people who are willing to give of themselves in public service which
					 would make this place more efficient, more effective and more relevant.
					 </p>


	<A NAME="T1120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1120)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would build trust again between our constituents and
					 parliament, a trust that I think has been broken. It would also allow for
					 better laws, regulations and communication between constituents, Canadians and
					 the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be a pipe dream, but many of us, from Mr.
					 McGrath on down, continue to believe it is a battle worth fighting for. The
					 changes we are talking about today are small steps. I am under no illusion that
					 they will break the log-jam of control that is currently exerted by the Prime
					 Minister's office and through the bureaucracy to the privy council.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few positive things have been done. I specifically
					 refer to a recommendation I made in January which was adopted by the committee
					 on the issue of closure. When the government wants to bring in closure it is
					 obliged now to at least get the minister into the House of Commons to talk
					 about why it had to do it. Is it time sensitive? Have there been hours, days
					 and weeks of debate? Have there been obstruction tactics on the opposition
					 side? He or she has to at least come into the House to explain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again that is a small step forward. Maybe the
					 government will be a little more reluctant to use closure. It has used closure
					 at a record pace, a pace that sets it in a class all its own, although not a
					 good class. It has certainly used it time and again and just after a couple of
					 hours of debate it shuts it down and we are forced to move on. The legislation
					 is basically rammed through here like sausages through a factory, and that is
					 unfortunate. This committee report will at least get the ministers to come
					 forward, and that is a good thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I hope will be good is that candidates
					 for speaker in the next parliament will be able to explain to parliamentarians
					 what it is they hope to accomplish: their style, their modus operandi, the
					 things they consider important, the things on which they want to do more. They
					 will be able to explain their position and we will be able to vote on that
					 position by secret ballot. It is important to know what we are voting on and
					 who we are voting to support. I believe that is another small step
					 forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment of important positions like the clerk
					 of the House and officers of parliament should be approved by parliament. That
					 is also a step forward and something that I recommended in January. I
					 anticipate no problems with that. In fact we have been blessed with good clerks
					 and good officers of parliament, but people should know and perceive that those
					 positions are non-partisan, that they have the support of everyone in the
					 House. Canadians need to know that those important technical officer type
					 positions are not partisan appointments in the sense of favouring one party or
					 one government over another.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some other things that could have been put in
					 the report, but one that is actually in the report is the greater use of
					 ministerial statements. I have to agree again, as I so often do, with the House
					 leader of the New Democratic Party on this particular issue. He points out how
					 this fall we started off with what I think is a disgraceful example of not
					 including parliamentarians in the important business of the day. That is why we
					 feel the frustration bubbling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are concerned about terrorism right now. It is
					 obviously dominating all our thoughts and prayers, but it is also dominating
					 the business of the House, or at least it should be. However, instead of the
					 government telling us in the House about the important announcements, decisions
					 and tactics that it may be employing or initiating, or about the consultations
					 that are going on, these things are told to Liberal fundraisers or told on
					 <i>Larry King Live</i>. Decisions are announced at press conferences maybe
					 coming out of a cabinet meeting but nary an important decision or announcement
					 is made in the House of Commons.</p>


	<A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1125)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think to myself how much I would have appreciated it,
					 and still would frankly because it has not happened, had the Prime Minister
					 stood up on September 17 and said that parliamentarians would be included in
					 this most important war of the 21st century. During the gulf war, for example,
					 he invited the leaders of all parties to sit down with him for some private
					 briefings about matters of the day so they would not have to stand in the House
					 of Commons searching for answers. Members should know when things are happening
					 and that security briefings are being given to the Prime Minister. We should
					 not have to read about those things in the paper. We do not need to know the
					 contents but we should know something about them because parliament is
					 included. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have loved if the Prime Minister had said that
					 he asked his House leader to take housekeeping legislation off the table and to
					 immediately bring in an anti-terrorism bill that the House could debate and
					 pass post-haste. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it not have been good to get parliamentarians
					 involved right away on the issue of the day? Instead we have debated, for
					 example, gopher control on the prairies. While that may be of some importance
					 to farmers, it is not what is gripping the nation. We should have put
					 housekeeping stuff aside and seized on the security issue until it was solved.
					 It would have been good for parliament and Canadians would have seen that
					 parliamentarians are as concerned as they are with security issues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have loved if the Prime Minister had stood up
					 and said that he had struck a special all-party committee to deal with the
					 relationship we were going to have with the new home security secretary of the
					 United States of America. That person is co-ordinating the entire security
					 activities of the most powerful nation in the world and we have no relationship
					 to him. We do not know what he is doing. We do not have a clue as to what our
					 response could be. Maybe we could even help him in his very important business
					 of making the United States safe, but by inference the world safe and certainly
					 North America safe. We will have no influence on that because we have no means
					 of talking to him, no committee, no structure other than what might be
					 happening at the bureaucratic level. We do not even know what that is because
					 we are not included in that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not ask for any briefings or any publication of
					 anything that could affect national security or any investigations of
					 terrorists, but certainly it is the business of the House to make Canadians
					 secure. We should be talking about the modernization of our military, about
					 long term military procurement contracts, how that will be done and budgeting
					 for that. We should be talking about the perimeter security issues of the
					 country in a way that dominates the House and dominates the
					 committees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead we run the risk, I see it already in
					 committees, of just following the regular course of events, regular business
					 that happened to be on the plate last June as if nothing has happened.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say a lot has happened. While the business of
					 the world must go on as far as the regular budgetary process and so on, right
					 now parliamentarians feel frozen out of the process. We have a system now where
					 instead of a budget that is brought in in a timely fashion--and that should be
					 another piece of modernization, something where we can at least know when the
					 next budget is going to come down--we are left here every day wondering what
					 impact the recession and the world situation will have on the budget of the
					 federal government. No one knows if or when we will have a federal budget. If
					 it does happen the finance committee has an obligation to be part of that, to
					 have consultations and to travel the country. Instead committee members do not
					 even know if it will happen so they cannot even start the process of talking to
					 people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not right. It is something again where
					 parliamentarians are sidelined. That is why only 7% of business people think it
					 is worth talking to their member of parliament, and that is
					 unfortunate.</p>


	<A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1130)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most parliamentarians I have met are willing, able and
					 thirsting for a way to impact the business of the House on behalf of their
					 constituents and Canadians but too often they find out that they are just an
					 afterthought. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the modernization report tinkers with a few
					 things, and they are good things which I approve of, it does not get to the
					 core of the issue which is respect for the role of the members of parliament to
					 represent their constituents here and be an advocate for those positions. There
					 is just not enough opportunity to do it. I do not think the report strikes at
					 the essence of it, which is that there is too much power given to too few
					 people who make all the real decisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year ago Gordon Gibson wrote an article in his
					 newspaper column lamenting about how it would not take too much to change
					 things. This was just before the last federal election. He said all it would
					 take to change things at that time was only six Liberal members of parliament.
					 Many have complained about how irrelevant they are, how they are trained seals
					 who have to vote as they are told, that they do not have real impact in
					 committees and that the committees are a sham. However, at that time it would
					 have taken only six Liberal members of parliament to stand up with the
					 opposition to change the way we do business in here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Canadian Alliance brought forward a
					 motion about free votes. If six Liberal members had stood up and said that they
					 thought that the defeat of a government motion should not mean the defeat of
					 the government unless followed by an explicit vote of non-confidence, history
					 would have been changed. True modernization would have happened in the House of
					 Commons. The stranglehold that the Prime Minister's office holds on this place
					 would have been broken. Instead, too often there is lip service about the need
					 to change but too much cache put in the fact that allegiance to the party or
					 the leader is paramount. I can speak with some personal testimony that while
					 loyalty to the leader is a good thing, blind loyalty is not. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If true change is going to take place in the House of
					 Commons, people are going to have to stand up and be counted. When they will
					 not stand up and be counted even when they know things are not right, when they
					 do nothing, then they are aiding and abetting the problem they are complaining
					 about. Instead of standing and demanding things of the Prime Minister and the
					 circle of people around him, they quietly go into the night. Then when an
					 election comes around they wonder why they cannot get quality candidates. They
					 wonder why they do not have any impact. They wonder why businesses just write
					 them off as a joke. Only 7% of businesses even think they have any impact. Why
					 even go to anyone? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a shame. What a difference it would make if we
					 could say, “I know some members of parliament and you had better have your
					 ducks in a row because when you go before committee and they give you a
					 grilling and you cannot answer their questions, they will change that
					 legislation and you will be behind the eight ball one way or another”. Instead
					 we all know what happens. Legislation comes forward. The minister meets with
					 people behind the scenes. They cook it all up ahead of time. They get it into
					 committee and have some hearings. Then whatever the Prime Minister has decided
					 just goes through that committee like sausages and it comes out just the way
					 they wanted it to. That is a shame. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no wonder that MPs go to committees and in
					 frustration walk away. They do not become experts in their field. There is
					 often no point to it because they feel all their work is for naught. There have
					 been committees where people have spent six months on a bill. They have become
					 clause by clause experts on it, but then at the last minute when the clauses
					 are actually voted on, the government whip has come in and changed the
					 membership of the committee. All of those people who have become experts are
					 taken off the committee and trained seals are put in their place for voting.
					 All of the amendments are tossed out and that bill goes through the committee
					 in a day. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder people on both sides of the House get
					 frustrated. It is going to take a few more people on the Liberal side since
					 they have 100% of the power in here, to stand up and say that this is not just
					 frustrating but it is unacceptable. Things like free votes in this place would
					 be a great step forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the government, and the government House
					 leader in particular, to consider looking at what other jurisdictions are
					 doing. It is not absurd to have important international treaties negotiated by
					 the government on behalf of Canada approved in the House of Commons. It is done
					 in Australia and New Zealand. It is certainly done in the United States of
					 America. Nothing can go through there unless the senate has given its approval.
					 The president negotiates and the senate gives final approval. Why is it those
					 sorts of things are considered taboo in this place? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about looking at British Columbia as an example?
					 Premier Gordon Campbell took office with a mandate to have fixed election
					 dates. He was not constitutionally obligated to do that, but what a novel idea.
					 Within 90 days of the election he said elections would be held the third
					 Thursday in November every four years. People can count on it and put it in
					 their diaries. If they want to take a holiday they can book it before or after
					 because that is when the election is going to be. There is broad support in
					 Canada for that kind of thing, yet for some reason those sorts of things are
					 considered taboo.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modernization committee steps are small ones. They
					 are not going to break the ice jam. They are not going to change the culture of
					 this place. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge members of parliament to consider that steps
					 that enhance the role of members of parliament are what will enhance our
					 reputations back home both with businesses and individuals. Canadians will
					 thank us if real parliamentary reform and modernization brings about an
					 important and increased role for members of parliament.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this is a critically important matter to
					 this parliament. Many members have described this parliament as dysfunctional.
					 The member for Toronto--Danforth has stated in the past that parliament does
					 not work, that it is broken and is like a car motor that is working on two
					 cylinders. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the member for Fraser Valley that this is
					 a great first step. I want to compliment him on the document entitled “Building
					 Trust” which he presented after the recent federal election. It deals with
					 trying to make parliament more functional.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern the House leader for the NDP and I have is
					 that it is fine to put all of this on paper but is it actually going to change
					 anything. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of September 11 were very important and
					 critical to every Canadian. Announcements were made by the Prime Minister at
					 events outside the House. The Prime Minister does not brief parliamentarians.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the member to comment on the things in
					 this report. Are they going to change things? Are we going to see a drastic
					 change in the attitude from cabinet to make parliament more functional? I have
					 concerns. It is great to put it on paper, but to actually change things or make
					 that significant a difference, we will need to see a great willingness on the
					 part of members on the other side to change their attitude.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is true that all organizations take on
					 the culture of their leadership. It does not matter whether it is one's own
					 home or business or in this case the Parliament of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culture that has been developed here over the last
					 several years is not one that rewards initiative, outspokenness, newness or new
					 creative ideas. It just does not reward that. In fact it penalizes that.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote what Gordon Gibson said in an article
					 about the powers that are already in this place and vested with the Prime
					 Minister: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td><small>The Prime Minister of Canada has the
						  powers of a despot, to a degree unmatched anywhere else in the developed world.
						  He or she appoints the head of state, and the heads of the military and
						  national police. The PM appoints the political and the permanent heads of all
						  government departments, plus the governor of the Bank of Canada and all
						  senators. He or she appoints all of the judges of the supreme court who
						  interpret the constitution, plus all other important judges, and the heads and
						  most members of all significant boards, commissions and crown
						  corporations.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> The PM writes or approves all
						  legislation, directs or approves all tax and expenditure decisions, approves or
						  controls chairs of committees and the actions of committees and even the office
						  space and the boondoggle-type travel of MPs. He or she calls elections at a
						  time of unilateral choosing, and then has a veto (by law) over whether this or
						  that MP can run again. Some countries have what they call “iron triangles” of
						  power. We have a fully closed circle. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is the culture. The culture is that if one
					 speaks out, to quote the chair of our caucus, it is like that whack a gopher
					 game at the fair. If someone puts his head up to say that he would like some
					 change, the Prime Minister smacks that gopher right into the basement. If a
					 little while later another brave soul peeks his head out and says that he would
					 like to have more independence on committee, he is driven into the twilight
					 zone. That is the problem. The culture is to do as one is told, take the orders
					 and do not rock the boat. That is the problem. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culture is never going to change under the Prime
					 Minister. I have a great deal of respect for him for some things. He has been
					 here for 40 years. However in a sense his strength is also his weakness. He is
					 so cautious and worried about what might happen that change is unthinkable.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That culture has been developed over many years. People
					 in the organization over there understand the culture. They do not rock the
					 boat. They do not speak out aggressively. They do not buck the big guy. And if
					 they do, he can refuse to sign their nomination papers. They will not get an
					 important job or they will be taken away from an important job. There are
					 important committees just begging for people like that, such as the Library of
					 Parliament and a couple of others that meet once a year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the truth and that is the problem. It is a
					 cultural problem. It is going to take a change of government to break that.
					 Until people start to believe that what they do here matters and they get the
					 gumption to stand up and say it is important that they speak out, then nothing
					 will change. That is unfortunate. It affects the type of people who can be
					 recruited into this place. People sometimes wonder why we cannot get people
					 with a big long pedigree of involvement in community service or extensive
					 business background or NGO experience. Those people look on and say, “What is
					 the point? I am more influential over here in my organization than I would be
					 as a member of parliament”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who fight for parliamentary reform fight
					 because we want members of parliament to matter. We want them to count. I think
					 of the former leader of the Reform Party who has basically said that he is
					 going to retire at the end of this calendar year. Why? He is a person dedicated
					 to reform and I do not just mean big <i>R</i> reform, I am talking about
					 changes, someone who breaks the mould, who steps outside the status
					 quo.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has basically said that he can have more influence
					 championing his position as the head of a university department and that he
					 could have more influence on the course of action in the House of Commons by
					 being a provocative speaker for the Fraser Institute. He has said that he could
					 have a bigger impact if he were free to speak his mind, and free from the
					 constraints of this place, as a regular editorial writer in national
					 publications.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a loss for this place that a man of that calibre
					 feels so constrained by the petty games that go on in this place that he would
					 take his interest and his love for this place and for parliamentary reform and
					 democratic representative government, his passion for that subject, and say
					 that frankly he has to move on. What a loss that he would say he has given 10
					 years of his life to it and it is time to ply his trade in other circles
					 because he has concluded, like too many other good men and women, that it is
					 more effective to be outside pressuring in instead of inside fomenting change
					 from here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That happens because of a culture, and the culture is
					 that the leader is always right. Second rule? Look at the first rule. That is
					 the problem and it will never change until we get somebody sitting in the Prime
					 Minister's Office who says that he or she wants to involve members of
					 parliament, that he or she has enough respect for this place that important
					 decisions, announcements, legislation and so on are made here, not at Liberal
					 fundraisers, not on <i> Larry King Live</i>, not at a press conference where
					 there is the possibility of winning votes at a special conference of some NGO
					 group, or not as happened a few years ago when a minister, and, Mr. Speaker,
					 you will remember my point of privilege, went over to China and announced the
					 creation of a Canada-China friendship group. He had no authority to do that.
					 Those groups are creations of parliament and he announced, as a minister in
					 another land, that parliament had approved something of which we had never even
					 been apprised.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until we break that culture, we will continue down the
					 path that says it is my way or the highway, and important decisions, important
					 innovative ideas and representing one's constituents will take third, fourth or
					 fifth row seats behind loyalty to the leader and to the Liberal Party of
					 Canada.</p>

					 (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, NDP):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Fraser Valley
					 for his speech but I will remind him, and he probably knows this, that it was
					 not just the Liberal government that invented that type of culture. Previous
					 Conservative governments also had that culture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I would like to reiterate in the House, and
					 my colleague for Saanich--Gulf Islands was on our committee when we did this,
					 is that the 1998 east coast fisheries report was a unanimous report by all
					 members of the committee, including the parliamentary secretary. The nine
					 Liberals and five political parties agreed to every single word in that
					 document. It cost us over $180,000. My colleague from Saanich--Gulf Islands can
					 easily say that people were out there pouring out their heartfelt emotions to
					 us. We had a unanimous report and brought it to the House. Nine Liberals signed
					 the document and then stood in the House on a vote of concurrence and voted
					 against their own report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the member's comments on that.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a good example. I remember that
					 report well, because there were also unanimous recommendations for the west
					 coast for ditch maintenance and other things that were important in my own
					 riding. I made submissions and I was pleased that it was a unanimous
					 report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not just the fact that the report was
					 rejected after they had already voted to approve it. That happens all the time.
					 It was like the ethics counsellor. They put it in their literature but when
					 they are given a chance to vote on it they reject it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important is the demotivation that takes place
					 when members of parliament are asked to spend months of their lives and all of
					 their political capital to come up with a unanimous report and then are told
					 that their unanimous report does not even matter. That is what is
					 wrong.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should acknowledge the objectives I consider worthy

					 also acknowledge the concern to incorporate changes in the rules of procedure
					 that govern us as representatives democratically elected by the people. I
					 recognize the merits of a consensual process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, the government House leader has
					 agreed with the House leaders of all parties that changes to the Standing
					 Orders would require not a majority but unanimous agreement, a consensus. I
					 think this is to his very great credit and I congratulate him on achieving
					 consensus on certain matters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this orchestra leader, the government House leader,
					 who was conducting a symphony--in which we were able to pick out the House
					 leaders of all parties--was unfortunately conducting Schubert's <i>Unfinished
					 Symphony</i>. The government House leader would have to agree that his symphony
					 is unfinished. Why? Because there are a few things missing from the report. If
					 we question all 301 members of the House, excluding the Speaker, it will become
					 apparent that there is consensus on what those things are.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to hold up adoption of this report,
					 because the member for Roberval, the Bloc Quebecois House leader, has very
					 clearly set out my party's position. I would not want members to interpret my
					 remarks as being inconsistent with those of my party leader. But it must be
					 admitted that there are a few things missing. Certain undertakings given did
					 not make it into this report. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, I would like to mention the Speech from
					 the Throne. The governor general, or the Prime Minister speaking through her,
					 told us:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>In this new session of Parliament,
						  the Government will make further proposals to improve procedures in the House
						  and Senate.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reference to “further”, to certain small
					 improvements. We could say that the government delivered only partially on this
					 commitment made in the speech. The throne speech goes on to say: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Among other measures, voting
						  procedures will be modernized in the House of Commons.</small></td>
</tr>

</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why am I saying that the symphony that the Leader of
					 the Government in the House of Commons was boasting about is an unfinished
					 symphony? Because, among other things, the report is silent on the recorded
					 division process that has been used in this House since 1867, since the first
					 parliament. This archaic system, which consists in getting up to vote when a
					 clerk calls our name, is totally obsolete in 2001. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister uses every possible opportunity,
					 even when visiting dignitaries are next to him during a press conference, to
					 boast about Canada being “the very best country in the world”, or something to
					 that effect. He says that in front of heads of state. I can just imagine what
					 these people think. It does make a visiting head of state feel very good to
					 hear that he is in the very best country in the world. Does this mean that his
					 own country is lagging way behind? So much for diplomacy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we still have this archaic roll call vote in
					 Canada, which claims to be a modern democracy? Why can we not record our vote
					 like they do in the United States, where they use a card about the size of a
					 credit or health card to record their vote at a station? Some of my colleagues
					 and myself have friends in the United States. We could go to specific stations
					 and insert our card to record our vote.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to clarify something. We discussed it
					 within our caucus and we do not agree with the idea of voting from our riding
					 offices, our cars, or by using our cellular phones. This is not the idea.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded that we are not allowed to use props in
					 this House. I apologize for what I did earlier. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we could have stations where members of parliament
					 would insert their card for identification purposes and where they could say
					 yes or no, as is done in modern democracies, such as the United States.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While acting as a representative for my party at the
					 Association des parlementaires de la Francophonie, we took part in a conference
					 on developing democratic rules and we had the opportunity to see how they are
					 being dealt with on a day-to-day basis in new, emerging democracies. I remember
					 visiting Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1997. It is known as a new democracy. When
					 Bulgaria cut the umbilical cord from the Eastern Bloc countries, it became a
					 new democracy. I believe it was January 1, 1991, if my memory serves me well.
					 So, we visited Bulgaria's National Assembly in Sofia. They have an electronic
					 voting system. I think there is a significant difference in the average annual
					 revenues of Canada and Bulgaria. It is an emerging democracy. The country had
					 to put in place new institutions. However, when Bulgarians set up a
					 democratically elected parliament in 1991, one of the mechanisms they chose was
					 an electronic voting system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous countries in Africa that I have not
					 had the opportunity to visit. We spoke with colleagues from all of the parties
					 while on parliamentary missions and in meetings of various international fora,
					 such as the Commonwealth and the Francophonie. Some emerging democracies in
					 Africa have electronic voting systems in both their parliament and their
					 national assembly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this is the first reason why I am describing this
					 symphony as an unfinished symphony. The report is incomplete. The second
					 reason, and I will speak fairly quickly on this point, is nonetheless quite
					 important.</p>


	<A NAME="T1200"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1200"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1200)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During certain discussions in the Standing Committee on
					 Procedure and House Affairs, the Bloc Quebecois suggested a different approach
					 to parliamentary proceedings, particularly on Fridays.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, you have sat here as a member. You have
					 been a member since 1988. You yourself have seen the parody of democracy that
					 takes place here on Fridays. It is a joke.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition parties do a responsible job, starting
					 very early in the morning--the Bloc Quebecois starts at 7.30 a.m.--so that we
					 can prepare a decent question period, with questions which are coherent and
					 which address the problems concerning Quebecers, and often even the problems
					 concerning Canadians as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We make an effort and we do a good job of getting
					 questions ready. However during oral question period on Fridays, from 11 a.m.
					 to 12 p.m., and this is also true for 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. during the business of
					 the House, and from 12 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. until the House adjourns, we find
					 ourselves looking at a House that is literally empty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that members are all on the golf
					 course or away at their cottage. That is not what I am trying to say. I am
					 trying to say that members are often either on the road, headed for their
					 riding or, on Fridays, actually in their riding offices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too bad that is not mentioned in this report, but
					 the Bloc Quebecois suggested that the whole issue of Fridays be given a second
					 look. The government could say that it is easy for us, that all we do is
					 criticize. Our answer to that is that yesterday, three Bloc Quebecois members
					 outlined specific measures for helping the economy to recover in the wake of
					 the events of September 11. These were specific, doable measures. That is
					 something concrete.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Bloc Quebecois are not content to criticize
					 for the sake of criticizing. We have constructive suggestions. One suggestion
					 for improving parliamentary proceedings on Fridays was to look at what is done
					 in the Quebec national assembly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it because the idea comes from Quebec that it is not
					 worthy trying or modifying? I trust that is not the case. There is a system in
					 operation for Fridays in the Quebec national assembly. The three parties in the
					 assembly can be asked for references on it: the Parti Quebecois, the Liberals,
					 and even the Action démocratique. Friday is question day. A minister is in
					 attendance and is subjected to a barrage of questions by MNAs of all parties to
					 answer for his actions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system merits serious examination but
					 unfortunately the report does not mention it. One of the suggestions might have
					 been--a suggestion I repeat here--to see what is being done in the Quebec
					 national assembly when it comes to questions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our productivity would be increased if we did so,
					 instead of debating to empty seats on Fridays, asking questions of
					 parliamentary secretaries who do not have the slightest clue about the issues
					 we raise and look as if they had just landed from another galaxy when asked
					 questions, as if we were saying to them “Earth calling. Welcome to our planet”.
					 That is how efficient Friday oral question periods are.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who are listening at present, I suggest they
					 put this to the test tomorrow between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. They will see the
					 quality of the answers given, and who is giving them”. Regularly, out of the
					 entire cabinet of 24 or 25 ministers, there are 16, 18 or 19
					 missing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we do an efficient job as parliamentarians?
					 Quebec's system for questions should be given serious consideration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my second last point, I would simply like to state
					 that I subscribe to the comments by the House leader of the Canadian Alliance
					 to the effect that this opportunity--changing the standing orders--ought to
					 have been taken advantage of to seriously examine the entire matter of electing
					 the chairs and deputy chairs of each committee.</p>


	<A NAME="T1205"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1205"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1205)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can tell that the orders, the directions, are
					 coming from the top. I have witnessed this in the standing committee on
					 transportation, where the candidate was imposed by the PMO, or by the office of
					 the whip, who gets all the dirty work to do. We had imposed upon us an MP who
					 was totally incompetent, ignorant, and undemocratic in his management. The
					 decision had, however, been made that this would be the MP who would chair the
					 committee, while the committee membership included fine candidates and, by
					 consensus, the opposition parties and government could have agreed on one to
					 fill the job. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serious look needs to be taken at the Canadian
					 Alliance proposal concerning the appointment of committee chairs and
					 vice-chairs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, this report is the work of the
					 parliamentary leaders only. If our Standing Committee on Procedure and House
					 Affairs is a real, efficient and meaningful committee, I trust that we, its
					 members, will be able to address certain matters and submit reports for system
					 improvements, which will also be adopted by the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have referred to certain matters that were not
					 addressed, but if I had more time there are a whole lot I would like to
					 suggest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our expectation is for the Standing Committee on
					 Procedure and House Affairs, of which I am a member, to do a proper job,
					 instead of the government leader, in consultation with his fellow leaders,
					 proposing amendments or changes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that something needed to be done, that
					 certain matters needed to be looked at seriously, but that does not prevent the
					 Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs from being allowed to do its
					 job effectively for the rest of this session.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, as all the leaders mentioned this morning,
					 this is but a beginning. This is the beginning of a dialogue, the beginning of
					 co-operation between the leaders in order to enable the Standing Committee on
					 Procedure and House Affairs to improve certain procedures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to congratulate the hon. member for Roberval in
					 particular, the Bloc Quebecois's House leader, who did an excellent job
					 representing the party on the committee and who argued the case for some of our
					 requests to improve the system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have managed to lay the groundwork, to pour the
					 foundation, and we hope that the government will not wait years before further
					 improving the system, or building the roof.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, the member for 
					 Beauport--Montmorency--Côte-de-Beaupré--Île-d'Orléans
					 as far as Saint-Tite-des-Caps, just made an excellent speech, in which he
					 touched on an element that interests me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke of electronic voting, and of voting stations
					 that use a magnetic card. I think that we could—at least, that is the purpose
					 of my question—take a step forward. We know that today, new technology, with
					 computers and other electronic systems, allows us to do many things, and I
					 think that it would be easy to vote from our seat. The best station is right
					 here, in our seats in the House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were elected by the voters in our ridings to
					 represent them here, in the House of Commons. With an electronic voting system,
					 members could vote for or against a bill from their seats in the House, without
					 having to stand up all the time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does my colleague not think that, for members, the
					 prospect of being able to vote for or against a bill from their seats in the
					 House of Commons is an excellent improvement?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we talking about individual stations in front of
					 each desk? Would this be a centralized arrangement, as I have seen in the
					 States? As the bells sound, for 15 or 30 minutes, we come along with our
					 magnetic cards, our vote is taken, we return to our seats for the result. I do
					 not know about the mechanics of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that the Standing Committee on Procedure and
					 House Affairs can look into having 300 individual stations or one or two
					 central ones. We are more interested in the mechanics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the member for Charlevoix joins me in wanting
					 primarily to have the principle debated and passed.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to congratulate my

					 and to congratulate the members of the Bloc Quebecois, who have proposed ways
					 to improve proceedings and the work done here in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps my reaction will appear naive. However, I just
					 realized—and I am a newer member—that important decisions are being made in
					 this House that affect Canadians and Quebecers, and we do not even have a
					 quorum.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find this situation appalling for the simple reason
					 that the House of Commons and all within it and all the work done here is paid
					 for by our constituents' taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this in all naivety. Women in Canada and Quebec—I
					 am speaking of the living conditions of women, since I am the critic for the
					 status of women—need to be heard, to be lent an ear. If they knew that, today,
					 in this House, we frequently had no quorum, they would begin to wonder.
					 Sometimes when a vote is called, members swarm in like flies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes no sense. It is totally ridiculous. I wanted
					 to say that. Perhaps I should not have mentioned it. I just want people to know
					 that changes are needed, and they are paying for changes to be made.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, when I go back to my riding on Fridays, by
					 plane or by car, I think about what I will do during the weekend. I miss my
					 family and my constituents, whom I am proud to represent. When I am feeling
					 so-so—I do not want to use the word down—when I become bitter, I think about
					 things such as those that the hon. member for Terrebonne—Blainville just
					 mentioned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We make speeches, we work, we have assistants and
					 researchers who work hard to prepare speeches that are interesting, good, well
					 researched and not just empty words. But unfortunately, these speeches are
					 delivered in front of empty benches, in front of 177 empty benches or so. Right
					 now, for example, there are two government members out of 177 who are listening
					 to us. This gets to be discouraging. This is a depressing part of our
					 job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we love our work and we try to do it as best we
					 can. We are human beings with qualities and flaws. I think each one of us here
					 will admit to not being perfect. We can all do better. But unfortunately, the
					 reality is such that we experience situations such as the ones referred to by
					 the hon. member for Terrebonne—Blainville, who was elected here on November 27,
					 2000. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell her that if Canadians and
					 Quebecers, to some extent, have lost confidence in politicians and in the
					 parliamentary system as we know it today, it is perhaps because of situations
					 such as these, because of speeches delivered in front of empty
					 benches.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who come to see us in the gallery.
					 There are people up there. Are these people going to be favourably impressed
					 after seeing 175 empty benches out of 177? Are those who are listening to us
					 proud of this situation? These people will go back thinking that this is not a
					 very good example of democracy at work. I appreciate the hon. member's
					 comments.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, this is probably one of the most important
					 issues in this parliament that is not dealt with often enough. I note that you,
					 Mr. Speaker, chaired the Special Committee on the Modernization and Improvement
					 of the Procedures of the House of Commons. I commend you for your efforts.
					 However, I will speak somewhat critically not about what is in the report but
					 what is not in it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues, including the hon. member for Fraser
					 Valley, spoke very eloquently about some of the positive changes. He also spoke
					 about some of the shortcomings of that report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that the first order of
					 business today is the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons motion
					 on the report of the Special Committee on the Modernization and Improvement of
					 the Procedures of the House of Commons. It is ironic that we are talking about
					 the modernization of this parliament. Yes, there are some positive steps.
					 However, I was elected in 1997. I have looked at some of the things that have
					 been said and some of the things that have happened since being elected, and
					 the fact that we increasingly hear from our constituents how dysfunctional this
					 place has become. It is true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have concerns that this report does not deal with
					 some of those issues. I will quote a few members. The Liberal member of
					 parliament for Toronto--Danforth said, “Parliament doesn't work. It's broken.
					 It's like a car motor that's working on two cylinders.” </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Lac-Saint-Louis, again another
					 government member, said, “Being in the backbench, we are typecast as if we are
					 all stupid. We're just supposed to be voting machines.”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are quotes from Liberal government
					 members.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Minister of Finance said last year “We have
					 been discussing the role of Parliament in enshrining the values of the nation
					 and its response to change.” This is very telling. He went on to say “This is
					 an empty debate unless it recognizes the role of the parliamentarians
					 themselves. MPs must have the opportunity to truly represent both their
					 consciences and constituencies.”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words speak volumes. There are things that are
					 not dealt with in this report and I will try to address some of them. I will
					 read from the document entitled “Building Trust” which the member for Fraser
					 Valley wrote in January 2001 and which has been widely circulated. I applaud
					 him as he put forward some very constructive changes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One change the hon. member talked about was free votes
					 in the House of Commons. I will read a quote from the Leader of the Reform
					 Party of Canada, the hon. member for Calgary Southwest. He said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>There is a myth in the House that
						  lurking out there somewhere is the fiery dragon of the confidence convention,
						  the erroneous belief studiously cultivated by the government that if a
						  government or motion is defeated, or an opposition bill, motion or amendment is
						  passed, this obliges the government to resign. This myth is used to coerce
						  government members, especially backbenchers, to vote for government bills and
						  motions with which they and their constituents disagree and to vote against
						  opposition bills, motions and amendments with which they substantially agree.
						  The reality is that the fiery dragon of the confidence convention in its
						  traditional form is dead. The sooner the House officially recognizes that fact,
						  the better for all.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not dealt with in this report. I would submit
					 that if there is a government bill and there are government members who want to
					 vote against it, it is probably a bad bill. It probably needs more work. It
					 probably needs more amendments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the Prime Minister should not come down
					 upon these members, as we have seen many times in the House. They are
					 threatened with not having their nomination papers signed or the possibility of
					 not being candidates for the Liberal Party in the next election. We have seen
					 examples of that. Members literally have left here in tears because they had to
					 vote against their constituents and their conscience. This a practice that has
					 evolved over years and it has to change.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A government should not be defeated if a government
					 bill is defeated. I would submit the only time there should ever be a
					 confidence vote is on a throne speech or a budget bill, and that is it.
					 Unfortunately, at the Prime Minister's own whim he can declare a confidence
					 motion and the trained seals stand up and vote against their
					 consciences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give some examples, and I believe this is a
					 serious matter. With respect to the ethics counsellor becoming a true officer
					 of parliament, I will quote what the government said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>A Liberal government will appoint an
						  independent Ethics Counsellor to advise both public officials and lobbyists in
						  the day-to-day application of the Code of Conduct for Public Officials. The
						  Ethics Counsellor will be appointed after consultation with the leaders of all
						  parties in the House of Commons and will report directly to
						  Parliament.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That comes right from the Liberal red book 1 campaign
					 in the 1993 election. Of course the Liberals had an opportunity to vote on
					 that. This was in their campaign promises. As we are fully aware, this was an
					 opposition supply day motion, which was written word for word from the
					 government promise, and the government members stood up one by one and voted
					 against it. That is wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to really empower parliamentarians, we
					 have to bring a change of culture. As the member for Fraser Valley so
					 eloquently stated, it is the culture that has to change. There are 301 members
					 of parliament elected to the House, coming from five political parties at the
					 moment. There is a lot of talent and expertise in so many areas on all sides of
					 the House which is so often ignored. We could be a much stronger country, if
					 these free votes and debates were allowed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One NDP member asked a question a few moments ago. I
					 was part of the fisheries committee when I was first elected in 1997 under the
					 chairmanship of the member for Gander--Grand Falls. He did an excellent job
					 chairing that committee. The fisheries committee wrote 13 reports. Eight of
					 those reports were written unanimously by five political parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sat down for hours of painstaking debate, making
					 compromises, asking what was in the best interest of the country and the
					 citizens in these fishing communities and how could we help them. We went to
					 those communities and listened to those people. Sometimes we sat up until 2.00
					 o'clock or 3.00 o'clock in the morning in community halls listening to their
					 concerns. Then those members sat down and wrote a detailed report with very
					 positive, substantial recommendations. It was a unanimous report that would
					 have made a difference in these people's lives and would have improved the
					 commercial fishing industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the report left the committee room and came into
					 the Chamber, the opportunity to vote arrived. Guess what happened? Government
					 members stood up one by one, including the people who wrote and put their
					 signatures to it as a unanimous report, and voted against the report. That is
					 not good for democracy. It is a scam. It is not good for the country. That is
					 what needs to change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I submit that if there are members on that side
					 or this side who want to freely vote for or against something because they
					 believe it is in the best interest of the country and their constituents, they
					 should do so. If they believe the bill is not right and needs further
					 amendments to make it right, then they should put them forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the immigration bill now before the Senate.
					 That is another example. It desperately needs more work. The government opposed
					 numerous amendments from the opposition members which would have strengthened
					 the bill. </p>


	<A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When that bill was before the House, we were told that
					 it was critical that it be fast-tracked through the House of Commons because it
					 was needed to deal with the boatloads of people arriving on the shores of
					 British Columbia claiming refugee status and changes to the immigration system
					 were needed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that very same bill is before the Senate and the
					 government is saying that the legislation needs to be put through to deal with
					 terrorists. This is the same piece of legislation. It needs to be strengthened
					 and the government needs to listen to some of the proposed amendments. It is
					 critical that we deal with that. It has not been dealt with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the culture that has to change. I encourage the
					 government to take the opportunity with the acceptance of this modernization
					 bill, as it is called, to modernize the culture rather than modernizing
					 parliament. Let us bring back what Canadians really want.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many other issues with which we need to
					 deal. We often hear of the importance of having an elected Senate to bring back
					 accountability and integrity. I fully support the need to reform the Senate,
					 but the members of the House need to look in the mirror. The House is more
					 dysfunctional than the Senate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk of modernizing parliament, we should talk
					 about empowering all 301 parliamentarians from all parties to bring these ideas
					 forward and make a difference. Some of the best work done in parliament is at
					 the committee level. There we have committees of 16 or 17 members of parliament
					 from all parties who bring in witnesses and have a great opportunity for
					 debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate there are some changes coming with respect
					 to the televising of these committees. I have to admit that I personally have
					 some concern with that recommendation. As opposed to concentrating on the
					 important work that is accomplished now, it may actually give rise to a desire
					 to grandstand before the television cameras. I feel that committees are very
					 effective. One of the highlights of my parliamentary career is my involvement
					 with committees and the work that we have been able to accomplish. Therefore, I
					 do have some concerns there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, I believe committees do some incredible work,
					 but the reports they write almost always sit on a minister's shelf collecting
					 dust and never see the light of day. There are millions of dollars every year
					 spent in committees. They go out and talk to Canadians, they research and study
					 these reports and listen to witnesses, yet the report never sees the light of
					 day. Everyone in the House knows that. There are numerous hard
					 examples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to modernize parliament, we need to
					 look at how we can change the culture in the House. How do we empower
					 parliamentarians from all parties? How do we remove the partisan chip that is
					 there? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that the government has a mandate to
					 govern and that cabinet has to bring forward this legislation. I understand
					 that, I accept it and I support that. However, that does not mean that it has
					 to gag its own backbenchers and all the opposition members. Nor does it mean
					 that it has to ram through closure to get a bill through.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reason why this is happening. It is because
					 there is an outcry from Canadians that this is not the direction in which they
					 want to go. When it comes from government members and they are completely
					 ignored, when they are forced to vote with the government or face the wrath of
					 the Prime Minister that they may not be candidates for that party in the next
					 federal election, that is wrong. That is what needs to change. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate there are some positive steps in this
					 document toward modernizing parliament, I feel it is important to stand up and
					 state that we must be willing to change the culture when parliamentarians bring
					 forward these excellent private members' bills.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the government do? It does not make them
					 votable. The committee has the power to deem which private members' bills are
					 votable. There are many good ones that have never seen the light of day. The
					 government votes against the ones that do. Once in a while it rewrites them
					 into its own legislation. Why does it not allow us to pass these bills?
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage a change in the culture, but I am not
					 convinced it can happen under the leadership we have now. I hope we will see
					 steps in that direction with this report. Whether the government is willing to
					 change the culture and make a difference in parliament will remain to be seen
					 in the years ahead.</p>

				Tribunal of Canada and to make consequential amendments to other
				acts, be read the second time and referred to a
				committee.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-54914"></A><a HREF="#Int-54916"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-54909"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill,
					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to
					 speak on behalf of the New Democratic Party as we give second reading to Bill
					 C-34. It is always a privilege to have the opportunity to speak on behalf of
					 the NDP and of my constituents in the Churchill riding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-34 would establish the transportation appeal
					 tribunal of Canada. The independent quasi-judicial body would be made up of
					 people with expertise in the transportation industry and would be an expansion
					 of the Civil Aviation Tribunal. The mandate of the Civil Aviation Tribunal was
					 provided for by part IV of the Aeronautics Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Aviation Tribunal has been extremely
					 successful and has been recognized as a model for the enforcement of the
					 Aeronautics Act. It makes sense that such a tribunal be available to other
					 areas in the transportation industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of interested parties the Civil Aviation
					 Tribunal holds review and appeal hearings with respect to certain
					 administrative actions taken by the Minister of Transport. Extending the
					 tribunal to other transportation areas is a move that I believe would be
					 welcomed. The creation of the transportation appeal tribunal of Canada would
					 provide the marine and rail industries and the aviation sector with an
					 impartial appeal and review system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transportation appeal tribunal would replace the
					 internal review process that currently exists. In the current system,
					 enforcement decisions made by inspectors are subject to review only by senior
					 officials or the minister. It would be preferable to have a separate and
					 impartial body to hear appeals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone does not think the Department of Transport
					 needs a separate and impartial body to oversee its decisions, we should look no
					 further than at what the department is doing to hours of service regulations
					 for the trucking industry. The bureaucrats responsible for that file are trying
					 to get Canada to adopt an 84 hour work week for truckers. In certain weeks
					 truckers would have to work 96 hours.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not get into the mountain of evidence from
					 scientific experts in the area of fatigue and sleep deprivation indicating the
					 sheer madness of the proposal. That can be done another time. My point is that
					 the minister can do this with no accountability. He can do it through an order
					 in council on the advice of his bureaucrats .</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truck driver hours of service regulations would not be
					 covered by the legislation. Nor should they be. However the issue serves as a
					 useful example of how it can be useful at times to have an impartial outside
					 agency in place to review ministerial decisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is to say that the New Democratic Party
					 supports the general principle behind the bill. We welcome greater scrutiny and
					 oversight into ministerial decisions. Bill C-34, by providing for an
					 independent quasi-judicial body to review decisions in the transportation
					 industry, is a step in the right direction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having an independent and effective review and appeal
					 process for the transportation industry quite frankly makes sense. The
					 tribunal, in helping deal with appeals and reviews of administrative and
					 enforcement actions, would prevent action from being taken in court. In short,
					 the tribunal would simplify and streamline the whole appeal and review process.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need to look more closely at some of the finer
					 details of the bill. It is important that the tribunal have members with
					 expertise in all areas of the transportation industry. It is perhaps worth
					 considering having separate tribunals to deal with individual appeals and
					 reviews in each sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be appropriate for someone without knowledge
					 of the rail industry to rule on issues concerning rail. However I am sure this
					 and other questions could be discussed at committee. The NDP is prepared to
					 support the bill in principle at second reading.</p>

					 Rock—Langley, PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to Bill C-34 on
					 behalf of the coalition. It is interesting that the government is introducing
					 the legislation. There are many important issues concerning transportation in
					 the country. This is not one of them. Airline security, the state of Canada's
					 airlines, and commercial transportation at the borders are all far more
					 important to the average Canadian than the housekeeping bill the government has
					 put before us today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is frequently heard from all parties in the House,
					 September 11 has changed everything. It has changed the way the world operates.
					 If there is any doubt, particularly from a transportation point of view, I need
					 only point to the events of yesterday when a passenger slit the throat of a
					 Greyhound bus driver in Tennessee. This caused an accident in which six people
					 were killed. It was a tragic event. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greyhound's response was to immediately shut down its
					 whole U.S. transportation network. That is the kind of response we are seeing
					 when something like this happens. Prior to September 11 it would have been
					 treated as an isolated incident and dealt with by local authorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of September 11 with these kinds of
					 situations happening it is interesting that the Liberal government feels we
					 need to debate a housekeeping bill to create the transportation appeal tribunal
					 of Canada. The purpose of Bill C-34 is to create the transportation appeal
					 tribunal of Canada, an independent quasi-judicial body which would act as a
					 mechanism for administrative and enforcement actions taken under various
					 transportation acts governing the marine, rail and aviation sectors.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new appeal tribunal would replace the Civil
					 Aviation Tribunal which was established in 1986. The Civil Aviation Tribunal is
					 a functioning body. It has been in existence since 1986. The changes being
					 introduced by the legislation would expand it into a transportation tribunal as
					 opposed to mere aviation tribunal. It would carry out the same basic functions
					 as the Civil Aviation Tribunal but its responsibilities would be expanded to
					 the marine and rail transportation networks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviews of decisions affecting the marine and rail
					 sectors are currently conducted by senior departmental officials and the
					 minister. I think Canadians feel it is wise to move these kinds of reviews to
					 an independent body as is done in the aviation industry. They feel it is better
					 to get these kinds of appeals out of bureaucratic hands. There is no question
					 that would be good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real issue with this housekeeping bill is that the
					 Liberal government has had plenty of time during its nine years in office to
					 have made the necessary changes. The aviation tribunal has been around since
					 1986. Why has the government chosen this time to bring the legislation on to
					 the floor of the House?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that this is not a main concern to
					 many Canadians. We did a computer search of Canada's major newspapers for the
					 last three months. We turned up exactly zero articles that mentioned the Civil
					 Aviation Tribunal or the proposed transportation appeal tribunal. It is not on
					 the agenda of the ordinary Canadian or for that matter any political party. It
					 has not been on anyone's agenda.</p>


	<A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a former member of the transportation committee I
					 can say that the committee never dealt with any issues regarding the tribunal
					 although the processes were mentioned in passing and whatnot. If people and
					 government committees have not been talking about the need for it, why does the
					 government see it as the most important transportation issue for the House to
					 be addressing?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This housekeeping bill concerns the makeup and
					 legislative authority of this new tribunal. The Civil Aviation Tribunal
					 currently consists of a chair, a vice-chair and six other full time members in
					 Ottawa. There are 26 part time members around the country who are supposed to
					 be chosen on their knowledge and experience in aeronautics. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-34 states that the new tribunal, which would
					 bring in marine and rail component industries, would consist of members who
					 collectively have expertise in transportation sectors in respect of which the
					 federal government has jurisdiction. One has to assume that the makeup would be
					 of individuals who have knowledge of the marine, rail and aviation industries.
					 We do not know how many additional members would be appointed or what the
					 expansion of the budget would be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the budget of the Civil Aviation Tribunal was
					 $1.2 million. To the ordinary Canadian that may sound like a lot of money, but
					 to a government agency it is a very small amount. Unlike many other government
					 agencies, the tribunal did not use its full budget. It only used $1.12 million.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an issue of a grand haven for patronage
					 appointments. It is not a tribunal that will expand to a size that Canadians
					 should be concerned about. It is a housekeeping issue of changing the
					 parameters of how the tribunal operates to include other modes of
					 transportation outside aviation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge individuals who have concerns about where the
					 tribunal is going, its makeup or its mandate, to contact a transportation
					 critic member or a member of the transportation committee to raise their
					 concerns because it has not been a topic of high interest to people in the
					 transportation industries or to members of the transport committee. To date we
					 have not heard from anybody with concerns. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition will be supporting this housekeeping
					 legislation. We are concerned that this has been considered a priority of the
					 government and has been put on the House agenda before other very important
					 transportation issues. We urge the government to move quickly on the
					 transportation concerns that have been identified as a result of the tragic
					 events of September 11. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. congress passed legislation for airlines just
					 10 days after the terrorist attacks. The American senate is holding hearings
					 about its concerns regarding the Canada-U.S. border. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the U.S. congress is talking about the important
					 issues confronting its country and the world, we are talking about housekeeping
					 changes that could have been done any time in the last nine years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition's concern is that the greatest failing of
					 the government is not what is in the bill but that the bill is what it feels is
					 its priority on transportation issues.</p>

					 been passed any time in the last nine years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is continuing with a legislative program
					 as though nothing has happened, at a time when we are facing a changed reality
					 not only in Canada but in the world due to the events of September
					 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is making some movement in some areas. However it
					 has been very slow. It has not been comprehensive. It has not included all
					 members. It has not activated our committee process in a meaningful way to
					 address legislation that would take a look at issues such as border security
					 and the perimeter of North America. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has not taken any bold initiatives in bringing
					 forward anti-terrorism legislation immediately. It has not brought a budget to
					 the House to discuss with the people of Canada what the priorities of the
					 government will be and how it will address issues such as border security,
					 immigration and increased resources to find individuals who are under
					 deportation order or are illegally in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not seen any concrete leadership in those
					 areas. We have seen it in the United States and my colleague referred to that.
					 We have seen the house of representatives and the senate committees getting to
					 work the very next day after this event and changing the entire legislative
					 agenda in the United States. It is changing the agenda of other legislatures
					 across the world, yet it seems to have merely a ripple impact in the House of
					 Commons. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stood on a number of occasions since September
					 11 and congratulated the government when it has done a good thing. I have also
					 indicated that it is not doing enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can tell when someone cares about an issue by the
					 time, the effort and the resources they put into something. We implore the
					 government to take this a little more seriously, to set the tone, to change the
					 direction in this place, to bring us together in a less partisan way and to put
					 us all to work. We are itching to make some concrete changes in these areas
					 which in many ways have accumulated due to the neglect of resourcing from the
					 government for the last eight years. I would like my colleague to comment on
					 those concerns.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threat to Canada right now is that there might be a
					 security wall built along the Canada-U.S. border that prohibits the flow of
					 goods and services as we experienced in the past and which we require for the
					 growth and the stability of our economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should be a major issue that the House addresses
					 in a very serious way from security, transportation and foreign affairs points
					 of view. When the United States decides it is creating this secure control we
					 must ensure that Canada is within that wall, that we are part of what the
					 United States considers the perimeter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very concerned that from a transportation issue
					 perspective we are not asking how to move goods and services more efficiently
					 and quickly across that border. How will we prevent 4, 6, 12 and 16 hour tie
					 ups for our trucks trying to get goods and services across the border into the
					 United States? Our economy depends on that ability. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It depends on our ability to move deliveries from
					 Canada to the United States just in time. If Canadian companies and
					 manufacturers cannot meet that requirement, the American companies that depend
					 on our manufactured goods will find an American company that can provide those
					 goods.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a critical point that transportation and other
					 agencies need to be addressing. How do we ensure that Canadians continue to
					 participate in the economic growth and development of the North American
					 continent? If we are not careful and if we do not start addressing those
					 issues, our economy will be left out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians will suffer even greater unemployment and
					 downturns in the economy. Those are the issues we should be discussing in the
					 House and in committee. Those are the issues that are important to every
					 Canadian, not the addition of marine and rail sectors to an aviation tribunal.
					 That is not important to Canadians and it should not be the most important
					 issue for the government and the House of Commons.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up with two other
					 comments. One of them deals with airport security. Some individuals have told
					 me they are still concerned about workers at the airports not going through
					 metal detectors but coming to work with uniforms and security or clearance
					 badges. I have not heard the minister address that concern. It is something
					 that has to be looked at. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen that the individuals who perpetrated the
					 crimes of September 11 will go to any means to conceal their actions and
					 participate in devious methods to gain access to secure areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about something that I had hoped the
					 immigration minister would have talked about: interdiction, sending individuals
					 abroad. We have had an interdiction program in Canada. Royal Canadian Mounted
					 Police officers worked with forces from other countries to expand our security
					 perimeter not just to North America but to other areas where individuals who
					 boarded planes to come to North America might gain access to our country.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a very good pilot project. I have not heard
					 the minister talk about extending it. This would be the time to effectuate the
					 program. It is an issue that I raised in committee a number of years ago. My
					 colleague was also on the immigration committee in previous years. I would like
					 to hear her comments about both airport security and the idea of interdiction
					 abroad.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his insight into

					 report to my hon. colleague and to the House that the transport committee has
					 started its work. We will be looking at the issues of airport and airline
					 security. The committee will continue to work on that to make sure everything
					 that can be considered will be put before the government for consideration.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immigration interdiction program was a great pilot
					 project. It had some very good results. This too is another area in which the
					 government should be making sure that these kinds of issues are dealt with.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians feel that these are important issues. They
					 want to know that their government and legislators are dealing with the issues
					 that have been brought to our attention as a result of September 11 and not
					 that we are just sitting in the House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to know that we are busy working on making
					 our country, immigration system, airlines, rail lines and buses more secure.
					 They want to know that this is the agenda of the government and the House of

	Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if there is someone who
					 wants to debate the bill. If not, perhaps I, as the sponsor of the bill, could
					 be given a couple of minutes to summarize it before we ask the question, as is
					 commonly done. There may be someone who would like to speak to it.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-54940"></A><a HREF="#Int-54942"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-54938"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands,
					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to private member's Bill
					 C-217 brought forward by the member for Fraser Valley. The bill would allow
					 collection of blood samples so that we could protect our emergency workers. If
					 there were to be a concern that in the line of duty there was a question of a
					 communicable disease from contact with someone, a sample could be obtained so
					 that the emergency workers would actually know what they would be dealing with.
					 At present there is no legislation in the country that protects our police
					 officers, firemen and emergency personnel in this situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to set priorities for who we are going to
					 protect. Following the incident on September 11, which is so often referred to
					 now in the House, we see just how heroic these frontline officers are who
					 protect us each and every day. There were hundreds of firemen who immediately
					 entered the World Trade Center towers to help people. Probably many of them
					 knew exactly what they were going into when they entered the towers, that is,
					 trying to fight a fire some 100 floors above ground.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is remarkable that the instinct of these workers is
					 to go in and protect people. We, as parliamentarians, should be giving the same
					 type of dedication to them. We should not hesitate at all when a bill like this
					 comes before the House. Emergency workers and police officers in the country
					 have been asking us to pass legislation so that they would be protected in such
					 circumstances. We should rise to the occasion as they did, as we witnessed on
					 September 11. They did not hesitate or flinch. Their instinct was to do their
					 job and protect people. We should not flinch either. We have an opportunity to
					 show emergency workers in our country that we want to protect them and give
					 them every advantage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the member for Fraser Valley who brought the
					 issue before the House. This goes to one of my earlier speeches where I talked
					 about a bill coming before the House and how if it is a good bill it should
					 pass, just like that. There should be no politics. We have just had a debate on
					 the modernization of parliament and now we will have an opportunity to see if
					 it actually means anything. All the members of the House will have an
					 opportunity. Are they serious about changing the culture of parliament? That is
					 what this is about: changing the culture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a perfect example. Members will have an
					 opportunity to do what is right, not to flinch or worry about politics, about
					 whether it is a bill from the government or cabinet, but to look at the bill
					 and say that emergency workers deserve our protection. When they are out there
					 on the front line, in the line of duty, they at least have a right to know if
					 people they are in contact with have a serious virus or serious diseases such
					 as hepatitis B or AIDS, which could have a huge impact on the frontline
					 officers and their families. They need this information. It is absolutely
					 critical.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can use the terminology, Mr. Speaker, this is a
					 no-brainer. This one is automatic. This is one where parliamentarians should
					 stand up unanimously to support this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude by saying that I hope every
					 parliamentarian will not flinch just as all the emergency workers who went into
					 the World Trade Center towers did not flinch. We have an opportunity to show
					 the emergency workers of the country how much we care for the work they do and
					 how much we support them.</p>

					 (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would very much attach myself to the
					 remarks of my learned colleague from Saanich--Gulf Islands. He has in a very
					 eloquent way put into perspective for Canadians and for the House the
					 importance of this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stated in a very poignant and emotional way that
					 while others were fleeing those World Trade Center buildings that were under
					 attack, while others were running for their lives to escape that atrocity,
					 emergency workers, police officers and firefighters were running in. They were
					 going into the buildings and many of them did so at a horrific cost, the cost
					 of their own lives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to put too fine a point on it, the bill brought
					 forward by the member for Fraser Valley, my colleague in the coalition, is
					 aimed specifically at allowing those firefighters, emergency care workers or
					 anyone else who acts in a magnanimous way to at least be afforded the right to
					 know what terrible consequences might flow from those actions. It helps those
					 persons who put their own health and safety secondary to their attempts to
					 assist people in dire straits, whether it be someone who has fallen ill on the
					 sidewalk or victims of catastrophe. It helps those persons who put their lives
					 at risk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be clear on what we are talking about. What I am
					 talking about is the contracting of a deadly illness or life altering virus
					 that the person who has acted so selflessly may have contracted in the process
					 of rendering assistance. That also applies to citizens. If we are to encourage
					 the values we all hold so dear in Canadian society, such as encouraging people
					 to help their neighbours, encouraging people to help those in dire straits or
					 those in need, I think it certainly bears enshrining in law the ability to
					 later assist those individuals in finding out if in fact they have contracted a
					 life altering illness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many practical and pragmatic elements to
					 the bill. To reiterate the comments of my colleague from Saanich--Gulf Islands,
					 the bill would allow those individuals some certainty and peace of mind as to
					 the ensuing consequences of their actions. It would allow them to find out, for
					 example, whether they have to undergo agonizing treatments in many instances,
					 whether they have to embark on a process of prevention by taking chemical
					 cocktails that are intended to fight off or in some ways stave off the effects
					 of the illnesses that may have been contracted, whether it be hepatitis C, AIDS
					 or any other illness that might be contracted through exchange of bodily
					 fluids. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be the act of a civilian coming upon an
					 accident scene where blood has been spilled. We have to speak in these graphic
					 terms. If that person, in his or her efforts to save an individual in need or
					 to somehow try to revive an individual, contracts an illness the bill would
					 simply provide a legal avenue that can be pursued to determine whether an
					 illness has been contracted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I very much commend my learned colleague for bringing
					 forward this issue. I think he has done so with the assistance of many
					 Canadians across the country, many who work in emergency services and those who
					 would be directly affected by this. If nothing else, what happened on September
					 11 put into a profound perspective for everyone the incredibly valuable and
					 important service that is provided by emergency service workers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously stated, I hope all members of the House
					 will neither flinch nor hesitate in supporting this legislation so that it
					 might be put forward immediately.</p>

					 Fuca, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I echo the compliments to the members from
					 the PC/DRC who put forward the bill in both the last parliament and this
					 parliament. It is a bill that is intended to protect those individuals who, in
					 the line of duty, in the line of protecting individuals, who seek to serve and
					 protect others, are inadvertently potentially infected by a disease that could
					 make them sick or at the very worst could be fatal. In particular we are
					 talking about HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, the three primary viruses
					 prevalent in our society and unfortunately on the increase. The bill is
					 designed to focus on those people who are doing good Samaritan acts or also
					 acts in the service of others, particularly those people who are firefighters
					 and police officers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill has been on the legislative table for quite
					 some time. As such, the member for Fraser Valley, like many others in the
					 House, has done a lot of work in trying to get co-operation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bill were bad, if the bill were somehow going to
					 trample on the rights of others, we would not see the support we see for it
					 from dozens of groups, and I will name just a few today, including the Canadian
					 Police Association, the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Police, the Toronto Police
					 Service, the RCMP veterans society, the Central Saanich Police Association and
					 so on. Additionally there are dozens of police organizations, firefighting
					 organizations and hospital organizations that support the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of bill is to enable an individual who has
					 been accidentally infected to have the blood of the person who accidentally
					 infected him or her, or occasionally deliberately, as police officers have
					 found in the line of duty, taken and examined. The information would be shared
					 by the physicians treating the person and the physician or the medical
					 personnel treating the individual who is accidentally infected. This
					 information, as medical information, would be treated with the utmost respect
					 and as such would not be shared with the general public. That was a concern of
					 those individuals who in fact composed the bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say that the bill tramples on the rights of the
					 individual who is sick and whose blood accidentally infects emergency
					 personnel. The fact of the matter is that we have a legal precedent which says
					 that it does not actually infringe upon the rights of individuals. That
					 overarching philosophy imbued within our legislative codes is the good
					 Samaritan bill, whereby if we found somebody sick on the side of the road we
					 would be obliged to some degree, to the extent of our abilities, to help that
					 person. If in the course of trying to help that person something happens where
					 that person is injured or we are injured, we are protected by the overarching
					 belief within our legal system that we were trying with the goodness of our
					 heart and to the best of our ability to help that particular individual who was
					 hurt. Therefore we are protected. The fact that we are protected also means
					 that we are protected from other eventualities that could happen when we are
					 trying to help that other person who is sick. That is what the bill is all
					 about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill, as the member for Fraser Valley has put it so
					 articulately in the past, is meant to protect the good Samaritan, just as that
					 good Samaritan is trying to protect the individual who is hurt. I define a good
					 Samaritan as not only the member of the public who is trying to help somebody
					 but also as the firefighters, the police officers and indeed the medical
					 personnel who try constantly to help individuals in the line of
					 duty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not often speak about how prevalent this is, but
					 we know at it is. There are people like Isobel Anderson, a constable here in
					 Ottawa who has done a tremendous job of putting this on the board, and dozens
					 of personnel who in the line of public service are accidentally infected by
					 blood products. They go through all kinds of trauma. They go through emotional
					 trauma and trauma with their families. They go through a great deal of
					 uncertainty that by and large is not necessary. </p>


	<A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would remove that uncertainty to a large
					 degree. It would give them much greater peace of mind, not absolute, but it
					 would greatly diminish the consternation and psychological trauma they would
					 endure if they were potentially infected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a physician I have worked in emergency medicine. I
					 have treated many colleagues who have been accidentally infected. In the course
					 of our duties in the emergency department we are continually confronted by
					 blood sprayed out in all manner of ways when treating patients who are very
					 sick. There are cases where unfortunately, people are infected. It does not
					 happen very often but it can happen in the line of duty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are individuals who seek to deliberately infect
					 police officers, firefighters and emergency room personnel. This is an assault
					 of the most vile nature. As such, the emergency response personnel need to be
					 protected. They must be protected in that particular environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to address a couple of issues because I am a
					 strong supporter of the bill. A number of people have said that this bill is an
					 effort to root out those people who have these diseases, that it is an effort
					 to stigmatize those individuals. Nothing could be further from the
					 truth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a man nor a woman in the House today who
					 does not want to see a cure and a prevention for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis
					 C. All of us recognize the scourge and the incredible heartbreak exerted on the
					 individuals who are infected with these diseases. Our hearts go out to
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reciprocally, we have to put ourselves in the shoes of
					 those people who are trying to help those individuals who have been infected
					 and unfortunately, encounter blood borne product. On balance, the legislative
					 framework within our country today, the good Samaritan laws clearly articulate
					 that it is within the realm of fairness and of our legal system to protect
					 those individuals who put their lives on the line in the service of
					 others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage the House to adopt the bill, put it into
					 legislation. The bill will give a great deal of comfort to the police officers,
					 firefighters and emergency personnel who day in and day out put their lives on
					 the line.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the number of groups in those three professions
					 across the country that have supported the bill from the outset, those
					 individuals and groups that have made eloquent interventions in support of the
					 bill, it is important that the government listen to them. They are on the front
					 lines. They are the ones who put their lives on the line and they deserve to be
					 supported.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. members:</b> Agreed.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for its indulgence. It
					 may be quicker than four minutes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the several people who brought
					 the bill to this stage. The member for Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca, who is a
					 medical doctor, has done so much to promote this cause. Both he and I had very
					 similar bills in the private members' hopper at the same time. It was the luck
					 of the draw that mine was picked. It could just as well have been his bill we
					 are voting on today. He certainly deserves at least half of the credit for what
					 has gone on here, both for his expertise in drafting his bill, which again was
					 very similar to mine, and for being a champion for this cause. I want to thank
					 him personally for that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank Isobel Anderson, who is a
					 member of an Ontario police force. She is someone who has done a lot of service
					 in highlighting the problem. She had a needle stick injury that put her and her
					 family at risk. She pointed out the emotional trauma she went through and how
					 unnecessary it was. The street person who could have infected her gave a blood
					 sample to the medical practitioner in exchange for a hamburger. Her life was
					 changed because a person accepted that exchange. It is just not fair and it is
					 not right that someone's life goes on hold because someone else wants something
					 to eat or is willing to trade that information for something as mundane as a
					 hamburger. She pointed that out. She has done a great service on behalf of all
					 of the people who work in emergency services by showing that laws needed to be
					 changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank a young man from my riding who,
					 as a good Samaritan helped to arrest and hold someone who had stolen something
					 from the Canadian Tire store where he worked. This 18 year old young man
					 exemplified the best of our community's ideals. He put himself at risk to
					 enforce the laws of the land and to do what is right. He went through six
					 months of treatment with chemical cocktails because the person who was
					 apprehended would not give a blood sample. That young man gave of himself for
					 all of us. I want to thank him and his family for what they have been
					 through.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to report that now, after three years,
					 that young man has no sign of any long term infection. He was fortunate, even
					 considering the trauma he went through. Now he is a married man and is getting
					 on with his life, but his life was on hold for a long time because our laws
					 were inadequate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time this bill was before the House it was
					 passed unanimously and was sent to committee. While I do not claim that the
					 bill is perfect, I think it should be sent to committee. At committee we will
					 have to wrestle with balancing the rights of different individuals to make sure
					 their charter rights are protected and so on. We can do that at committee. I
					 urge members of parliament to pass the bill again, preferably unanimously, so
					 that it will be sent to committee where we can wrestle with some of those
					 intricacies. The justice committee is a good place to do that and it is
					 infinitely qualified to do it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, all members of parliament will be getting an
					 information packet with frequently asked questions and the detailed support
					 from the dozens and dozens of national organizations that have supported the
					 bill. I ask them to look at that in the days to come. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dana Canada will be building a 140,000 square foot

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the fruit growing town of Oliver has
					 endured attacks by weather, insects and U.S. apple dumping policies with little
					 help from the federal government. Now it is under attack by the government
					 itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver provides farm irrigation through the operation
					 of a canal. It has been in use since the 1920s. Now the Department of Fisheries
					 and Oceans has decided to enhance the salmon fishery in the Okanagan River by
					 having an elaborate fish screen placed over the mouth of the canal and is
					 demanding that Oliver pay the $400,000 cost, this despite the fact that the
					 canal has operated and presumably the fishery has survived for over 80 years
					 without one. The cost may not be much for a government that squanders more than
					 that per day on subsidizing VIA Rail, but it is devastating to a small
					 community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I spoke to the minister about this, I mentioned
					 that it was not fair that DFO decided to enhance the salmon fishery and stick
					 the town of Oliver for the cost. His response was “DFO makes lots of decisions.
					 Obviously we cannot be expected to pay for all those decisions, we would be
					 broke”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If DFO wants it, it should be prepared to pay for it
					 instead of downloading it on a small British Columbia town.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am glad to join with my colleagues and
					 recognize Mental Illness Awareness Week sponsored by the Canadian Psychiatric
					 Association.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus for this year's campaign is “Making a
					 difference-Shed light, Give hope, Take action”. These are words that evoke a
					 great deal of meaning to those who live with or suffer some form of mental
					 illness. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through information workshops held throughout the week
					 the Canadian Psychiatric Association hopes to shed light on this largely
					 misunderstood disease, to give hope and to ask the public to take
					 action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental illness affects a dramatic number of Canadians.
					 One in five will likely experience a bout of mental illness some time in their
					 lives serious enough to impair daily function. A great deal of research is
					 continuing in this area through the Canadian Institute on Health Research and
					 other research institutes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge the work of the advisory board of the
					 Institute of Neurosciences, Mental Health and Addiction and recognize in
					 particular a member of that board, Mr. Phil Upshall, who volunteers his--

	Mr. Speaker, many of our fellow citizens and their
					 families face the challenges of mental illness. I am told that 50% of emergency
					 room admissions are related to mental illness. Fourteen billion health care
					 dollars each year go toward the treatment of mental illness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental illness is not just a health issue. Problems in
					 the workplace and family setting are also factors. We need to strongly affirm
					 the personal dignity and worth of every individual, including those with mental
					 illness. These fellow citizens need to be assured of their valued and active
					 roles in our communities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disability payments alone will not provide needed
					 integration into the larger society. We also need more mental illness research
					 to find new and better ways to relieve those affected by mental illness. We
					 need to be aware of ways to promote good mental health in ourselves and in
					 others around us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust that each of us will set aside a little time
					 during the upcoming Mental Illness Awareness Week to reflect on these important
					 considerations.</p>

					 Prevention Week. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before elaborating on activities of this year's events

					 members of the fire service and their families who were touched by the tragic
					 events in the United States on September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year we move closer to our fire prevention goal
					 through public awareness, promotion of fire safety measures and escape
					 planning. The tragic events of recent weeks have reminded us how important
					 safety procedures are to us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire Prevention Canada with the support of the labour
					 program is launching an exciting series of animated public service
					 announcements targeting fire prevention and safety in the home. These pubic
					 service announcements are scheduled for broadcast on national networks and
					 local affiliates across Canada in the next few weeks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope members will support and participate in

	Mr. Speaker, as a result of the tragic events of

					 been dramatically reduced because of necessary security measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slowdown has resulted in thousands of jobs being

					 throughout the whole service sector. It has been quite devastating on our

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Windsor are acutely aware of the need for
					 the increased security. However they do not want open borders. They do not want
					 to be at risk for the possible influx of crime from the American side of the
					 border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know from prior experience that if we work together

					 and the reality of cultural globalization, teachers must shape responsible and
					 competent citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis of this international event is on teacher
					 training, and this year's theme is “Qualified Teachers for Quality
					 Education”.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, many of our most treasured historical
					 documents continue to be exposed to irrevocable damage. The National Library of
					 Canada is tasked with preserving Canada's published heritage so that it is
					 available for present and future generations. Yet over $2 million of
					 irreplaceable information has already been lost since the Liberals took over in
					 1993.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Works like the original hand drawn maps of Champlain,
					 pages from the original Guttenberg Bible and the first newspaper ever published
					 in Canada are threatened daily by leaky roofs, exploding pipes and a climate so
					 humid that it routinely sets off the fire alarm.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked about her plans to protect the 20 million
					 items representing our shared history, the heritage minister said that the
					 government was still deciding on whether or not this was a priority. I find it
					 amazing that the minister can find half a billion dollars for new culture
					 spending but is still mulling over whether she will take action to find safe
					 storage for priceless documents. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current repair costs already exceed the budget.

	Mr. Speaker, media reports indicate that there was an
					 air marshal on Air Canada flight 792 which returned to Los Angeles under U.S.
					 military jet escort last week. After an altercation between a belligerent
					 passenger and a flight attendant, a witness stated that an air marshal wearing
					 casual clothes walked from the front of the plane and took control of the
					 situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is for the minister. Have any on duty
					 Canadian law enforcement officers travelled in plain clothes on Canadian
					 commercial flights since September 11 as air marshals?</p>

					 softwood lumber.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow we will consider Bill C-35, the foreign

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next week the House does not sit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday, October 15, we shall have an allotted day. I
					 have consulted with opposition House leaders about a bill we propose to
					 introduce that day and debate on the following day. The bill will introduce
					 measures to implement the United Nations conventions; amend the criminal code,
					 the Official Secrets Act and the Canada Evidence Act; and propose other
					 measures to improve security and protect Canadians. We hope to commence
					 consideration of the bill on Tuesday, October 16.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take this opportunity to inform the House that we are
					 making arrangements to give the relevant critics an advance briefing of the
					 contents of the bill on the morning of October 16 prior to its introduction. I
					 intend to discuss this with House leaders at the earliest opportunity. I will
					 arrange to do so early on the morning in question so critics can have an
					 advance copy of the bill. Obviously we intend to make quantities of the bill
					 available on introduction. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to seek the consent of the House to have
					 introduction of government bills at 11 o'clock that morning rather than 3 p.m.
					 We want to give hon. members additional time to familiarize themselves with the
					 bill because by exception we would be dealing with it on the floor of the House
					 the next day. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members have been very co-operative in this
					 regard. I take this opportunity to thank all House leaders for the co-operation
					 they have demonstrated in the face of these important events. I thank them for

	He said: Mr. Chairman, does the minister not speak
					 ahead of me? I ask because we have had three days of meetings in Washington
					 this week and I understand there may be late breaking developments. I do not
					 want to find that whatever I might say is pre-empted by more recent events.
					 That is the only reason I ask if the minister would like to precede me. I am
					 pleased that the minister and others in the House are interested in hearing
					 what I have to say. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had two other debates in the House since we
					 came back on September 17. One was about the airline situation, an obvious area
					 of priority. The other was about the situation on the prairies, another obvious
					 area of concern. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who suggests softwood lumber is not a major
					 concern in Canada would be incorrect. As of today in British Columbia alone
					 somewhere in the order of 15,000 workers have been laid off. Estimates are that
					 30,000 may be laid off by the end of the year. On a national basis 40,000 to
					 50,000 people could be laid off at either end. Obviously this is an unhealthy
					 situation for workers, their families, their communities and their
					 employers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If free trade in lumber between Canada and the U.S.
					 cannot triumph over protectionist U.S. legislation, Canada and the U.S. will
					 both be losers. The Government of Canada must take this situation with the
					 utmost seriousness. So far its track record is not good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will offer some solutions, but a bit of background is
					 in order first. Until March of this year, the same month the quota driven and
					 detrimental five year softwood arrangement expired, the government had no
					 publicly enunciated direction on softwood. When it finally adopted the free
					 trade position the Canadian Alliance had been promoting for months, we were
					 encouraged by its action. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when there is every reason for optimism about
					 achieving free trade in lumber there needs to be strong representation from the
					 Prime Minister. There is no sign that this is happening in a real sense.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had several optimistic signs from the U.S.
					 administration. On September 20, U.S. trade representative Robert Zoellick
					 wrote an important piece in the Washington <i>Post</i> called “Countering
					 Terror with Trade”. I will quote a couple of statements from the
					 article:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Our nation has drawn together in
						  shock, mourning and defiance. Now we must thrust forward the values that define
						  us against our adversary: openness, peaceful exchange, democracy, the rule of
						  law, compassion and tolerance. Economic strength--at home and abroad--is the
						  foundation of America's hard and soft power...To that end, U.S. leadership in
						  promoting the international economic and trading system is vital. Trade is
						  about more than economic efficiency. It promotes the values at the heart of
						  this protracted struggle.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoellick went on to say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Congress, working with the Bush
						  administration, has an opportunity to shape history by raising the flag of
						  American economic leadership.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the stroke of a pen the Bush administration
					 removed tariffs on some of the products of its trading partners to solidify the
					 coalition against terrorism. Indonesia had duties removed from plywood exports
					 to the tune of about $200 million per year. This demonstrates what is
					 possible.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday of this week the American Consumers For
					 Affordable Homes, who represent 95% of lumber consumption in the United States,
					 wrote to President Bush and asked him to reverse the commerce department's
					 preliminary countervail duty of 19.3%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American Consumers For Affordable Homes
					 organization has consistently promoted free trade in lumber. It represents many
					 more jobs in the U.S. and represents the consumer interests as opposed to the
					 U.S. lumber lobby. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these series of events and with senior Bush
					 administration officials and U.S. federal reserve chairman Alan Greenspan all
					 promoting free trade and suggesting that U.S. protectionist legislation is
					 counterproductive, the stage is set for a push by the Prime Minister to break
					 through and appeal directly to President Bush to set aside the CVD
					 determination imposing a 19.3% duty on Canadian lumber. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American consumer group pointed out to the
					 president this week the importance of a strong housing sector in a fragile
					 economy and that U.S. gross domestic product growth could be reduced by 15% to
					 30% because of the 19.3% tariff. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is concerning me today is that we are hearing, as
					 a consequence of talks going on in Washington, that there may be an arrangement
					 whereby these talks have actually turned into negotiations which have strayed
					 from the free trade path and have now taken us into an area where we may have
					 direct negotiation between the U.S. trade representative and our provincial
					 jurisdictions. If this is the case, and I am waiting to hear from the minister
					 on whether it is, then I want to put a warning shot out there that this is
					 betraying free trade and the strong coalition that has been built up over the
					 last two years on both sides of the border to pursue free trade in lumber. If
					 that is the case then I can only say that I am disappointed that this
					 government can lose its vision and its principles. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We entered into a very bad deal in 1996 when we got
					 into the five year softwood lumber agreement. If we agree today to these kinds
					 of balkanized negotiations I can only say that would be a total abandonment of
					 the consumer interest, local governments and the greater Canadian
					 interest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will only lead to a situation where the U.S.
					 lumber lobby will have divided and conquered. It will only lead to a lack of
					 accountability where the federal government can say that it has washed its
					 hands of responsibility for these bilateral trade negotiations. This is a
					 federal area of jurisdiction and it will place us further from free trade in
					 lumber than we have been in a long time and I do not know how we would ever get
					 back there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is clear is that if we appeal at the highest
					 levels, as other countries have done, if this is the number one priority of the
					 Prime Minister and he talks directly to President Bush, the Bush administration
					 is sympathetic if we can get the right priority placed on this file.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government and almost everyone else who is involved
					 in this circumstance agrees that if we stay the course, go to the World Trade
					 Organization and to NAFTA panels, we will win.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to make it clear that any deal with the
					 U.S. beyond free trade will cause us permanent long term damage. It is already
					 clear from the likes of Senator Baucus from Montana and others in government

					 dangerous road to go down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, the United States is looking for $30
					 billion to $50 billion in oil and gas. Does the member think there could be
					 some significance to our Prime Minister getting directly involved with that?

	Mr. Chairman, when it comes to linkage, I think what is
					 clear to everyone is that what is linked is our two economies. Any restrictions
					 on softwood lumber are detrimental to both economies. The consumer movement in
					 the U.S. recognizes it, the Bush administration recognizes it and obviously
					 Canadians recognize it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vastly greater number of jobs in the U.S. are related
					 to the lumber consuming business rather than to the lumber producing industry.
					 Both of our economies are somewhat fragile, particularly after the events of
					 September 11. As housing starts are a big part of that, it is crucial that
					 lumber flow freely in order to maintain those levels of housing
					 starts.</p>

					 for the government is absolutely wrong. On the advice given to us by the member

				  </b>

	Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to
					 this, but I want to be quite clear. The Government of Canada has been working
					 very hard on this file and for a very long time. If we let the softwood lumber
					 agreement die last March it was not that we had not foreseen its end. It was
					 that after narrow consultations with industry from all over the country, narrow
					 consultations with the provinces and the advice of opposition parties there was
					 a consensus of not renewing that agreement, of letting it die precisely to see
					 what American producers would then do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been bitterly disappointed with the attitude of
					 the American producers. We have been extremely disappointed that the Bush
					 administration has listened narrowly to the U.S. producers' protectionist
					 demands and has given them everything they have been asking for. We find the
					 19.3% tariff absolutely indecent. We have found, of course, that in regard to
					 the inclusion of re-manufacturers, these shops trying to enter value into the
					 softwood lumber, their inclusion in this litigation is wrong. We also find it
					 amazing that they found the critical conditions to put that countervailing duty
					 retroactive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been saying these things loud and clear. I was
					 in Washington on September 10 and met with both trade representative Zoellick
					 and secretary of commerce Evans. We made our position very clear: we do want
					 free trade and we do not believe that we have been subsidizing our softwood
					 lumber industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reminded them that in 1994 we had a similar dispute.
					 Panel after panel and court decision after court decision, the softwood lumber
					 producers lost their case. A billion dollars in taxes that had been collected
					 by the Americans was given back to the Canadian producers. We won in
					 1994.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to work very hard. Saying that we have not
					 done a thing is just so wrong. The member for Vancouver Island North himself
					 has quoted all the successful things we have done, precisely because of the
					 very hard work and leadership that our team Canada, non-partisan, above
					 parties, from all provinces, the east and west of the country, has been able to
					 do in the United States. A team of members of the House and Senators obtained
					 great success in Washington. We obtained a letter from a hundred congressmen,
					 both senators and representatives of the house, who wrote to President Bush
					 siding with Canada. That has never been seen before.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, and the member has quoted it, support from the
					 consumers, from the coalition for affordable homes in the United States and the
					 Home Depot people. We have it because we have been doing our work, providing
					 the leadership that is necessary, promoting our cause in Washington and across
					 the United States. We had gone through legal action to the WTO before the
					 actual cases that the Americans have put as pre-emptive strikes in order to
					 gain some enlightenment from the WTO and to gain some time. We had gone there
					 months before the end of the softwood lumber agreement, precisely in order to
					 gain some time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have been doing is with respect to an
					 extraordinary team Canada that has been really working hard on this front. I am
					 very pleased that the industry from British Columbia and Quebec and the
					 provincial governments are participating very well and very strongly in the
					 discussions in which we are involved. Yes, we are pursuing the WTO and we will
					 pursue every legal venue that we can to challenge the American allegations.
					 This is our duty, this is our right and we will win. We know it will take some
					 time and that is where I fail to understand where the Alliance is on
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alliance says the only thing they want me as
					 minister to negotiate is free trade. This is precisely what we want, this is
					 precisely what we are engaged in and this is precisely why we are having all
					 these legal challenges. At the same time Alliance members say it is urgent
					 because people are losing their employment, so they want us do something other
					 than the legal challenges. That is what I think the position of the Alliance is
					 although it was pretty vague and I am not sure I understood.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are having sets of parallel discussions, some that
					 just finished at 2.30 today. For three days we have been meeting in Washington.
					 Provincial governments are there. Our international trade experts are there. It
					 is the third such three day meeting we have had and we are finding common
					 ground, comparing forestry management practices on both sides, finding common
					 ground to make sure that we can have a better dialogue and hopefully find an
					 alternative to litigation. However, that has to be done on solid grounds. That
					 has to be done on grounds that will help our industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member suggested an export tax. He says Americans
					 want to slash the 19% tax and asks why do we not do so. It would be as bad for
					 our industry whether I do it or the Americans do it. We want to access the
					 American market at the level where we should be accessing it. We won in 1994.
					 They had to give back $1 billion in tax they had collected. Since then all the
					 provinces have increased their stumpage fees. Therefore, how could we win in
					 1994, then increase the stumpage fees and not win this time? It is so clear.
					 The Americans know very well that their case is a bad one and that they will
					 lose before the WTO. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to gain time, because we know that for many
					 enterprises and many businesses time is of the essence, and unfortunately legal
					 courses and challenges take time, we have set up these discussions with the
					 Americans. I want the thank the provincial governments for participating so
					 well in them. We are really making progress on that front.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has raised it with President Bush
					 and we are pursuing every venue possible to find more allies in the United
					 States. I do believe that our team Canada approach has provided the right and
					 the best possible eventual outcome for us. However, it is not the time to cave
					 in. It is not the time to move to any quick fix that some U.S. senators might
					 be trying to push us into because they realize that they have a bad case. I ask
					 members to please let us resist their request for a quick fix, thus harming
					 ourselves, rather than having them harm us for a while but losing
					 eventually.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to softwood lumber, enormous progress has
					 been made in the past five, six or eight years. We have built Team Canada, in
					 which Quebec's industry works closely B.C.'s industry and provincial
					 governments have had long discussions to compare forestry practices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that we do not subsidize our wood. We won in
					 1994, and since then we have increased our stumpage fees in Quebec and
					 elsewhere. If we won in 1994, and increased our stumpage fees since, how could
					 we lose our case this time? Except that, as we know, time is of the essence,
					 and the courts often take time to decide. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, we are making considerable progress in

	Mr. Chairman, I have two questions for the minister.
					 The first is with respect to the issue of enforcement of the Fisheries Act,
					 which is federal legislation. As the minister will know, under NAFTA there is a
					 joint independent environmental panel which has come to the conclusion that
					 there are serious problems in the enforcement by the Government of Canada of
					 the Fisheries Act, problems that have resulted from some of the forestry
					 practices and their impact on salmon bearing streams. That is a preliminary
					 finding by the environmental tribunal under NAFTA. I will ask the minister what
					 action the federal government is taking to respond to this very serious
					 concern. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I will ask the minister the same question that
					 I asked the member for Vancouver Island North. That is with respect to an
					 assurance from the government that whatever agreement is ultimately signed, it
					 will not involve any increased export of raw logs from crown lands or undermine
					 Canada's ability to manage its forests or wood industry in the interests of
					 Canadians.</p>

					 would not want to speculate on something which I have not been focusing on
					 seriously. The member deserves a better answer than I could volunteer this
					 afternoon so I will get back to him on that issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of log exports, I heard the question to
					 the member for Vancouver Island North. As we know, British Columbia has a
					 policy of log export controls. That policy is actually implemented by my
					 department. We have gone to the WTO to find out its answer on whether U.S.
					 legislation which sees that log export control as a subsidy in a sense is
					 right. The member will know that the WTO panel has given Canada the answer that
					 we already knew was right, which is that our log export controls are not a
					 subsidy. This has undermined a key element of the United States case against
					 Canada. This was a pre-emptive strike that we took some time ago.</p>

	Mr. Chairman, my question is for the minister. We are

					 30,000 jobs in B.C. and more jobs in Alberta, Quebec and Ontario.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue for me is that we were willing to pay the

				  </b>

	Mr. Chairman, I am absolutely in agreement with the
					 hon. member for 
					 Abitibi--Baie-James--Nunavik and I greatly appreciate
					 the question from France Gagnon. She is absolutely right.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the opportunity to tell that directly to
					 U.S. secretary of commerce Donald Evans in Washington on September 10. I found
					 it unacceptable to include, along with all the rest of the softwood lumber
					 industry, the lumber remanufacturers, who are adding value to this commodity.
					 They are not part of the case and ought to have been exempted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been stated very clearly and I trust that
					 Statistics Canada will be able to provide them with figures that demonstrate
					 very clearly just how much they ought never to have been included in the
					 American petition. </p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, I do not believe we have been able to
					 discuss the softwood industry much in recent weeks. It is understandable that
					 all hon. members were reeling from the shock of the events of September
					 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is worthwhile holding an emergency debate,
					 as suggested by the Canadian Alliance, on the softwood lumber industry, since
					 this week there have been three days of meetings held in Washington between
					 American officials and Canadian federal and provincial officials. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is also interesting to note is that the consensus
					 that gradually developed this past winter and spring to demand for compliance
					 to the free trade agreement immediately seems to have held up over the
					 intervening weeks and months.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That consensus was not built up overnight. Discussions
					 are still being held within the industry in Quebec and at the Canadian
					 Manufacturers Association. The choice offered to us was either to follow the
					 legal approach to the end, something that had never been attempted, or to enter
					 into negotiations with the Americans, and in that context to repeat what
					 happened in 1986 and 1996.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wise choice that the Quebec industry made, as did
					 the other industries and the governments across Canada apparently, was to use
					 the legal approach all the way. There are very good reasons for this. First, in
					 the United States—this has already been mentioned, but we do not insist enough
					 on this in Canada and in Quebec—we have allies among American consumers and
					 builders. We have a broad range of allies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the opportunity, along with the hon. member for
					 Kamouraska--Rivière-du-Loup--Témiscouata--Les Basques and the hon. member for
					 Rimouski--Neigette-et-la Mitis to travel to Washington as part of a
					 non-partisan delegation of parliamentarians. I was surprised to see that the
					 U.S. black people's chamber of commerce supports the Canadian position, as do a
					 number of other consumers associations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do have allies, even among U.S. parliamentarians.
					 The Minister for International Trade mentioned it. This summer, about 100
					 parliamentarians from both the Senate and the Congress wrote President Bush to
					 ask him to maintain free trade in the lumber sector, because it was in the best
					 interests of consumers in the various states that they represent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important to recall that we are now engaged
					 in a negotiation process on a free trade area of the Americas. There is
					 something contradictory in the Americans asking for protectionist measures in
					 the lumber industry when all the nations of the Americas are talking about
					 greater trade liberalization. In this regard, I think that President Bush does
					 have—as the Canadian Alliance member pointed out—a responsibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We certainly realize that, following the September 11
					 events, this may not be at the top of his priorities. However, at some point in
					 time, if he is the free trader he claims to be, he will have to take steps to
					 put a stop to the procedures and harassment by the American lumber industry,
					 particularly since we are now trying to further develop harmonious relations
					 between all the countries. In my opinion, a prerequisite to such relations is
					 to settle trade wars that have no real basis. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another element, which strikes me as important and
					 enters into the arguments relating to pursuing the legal battle, is the
					 existence of the World Trade Organization. The rules it is in the process of
					 developing—a process not yet complete—did not exist at the time of the last
					 problems, which occurred around 1995-96. Now, with the WTO in place, and
					 involved in this matter, U.S. legislation is now being challenged by the
					 Canadian government, and rightly so, moreover. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the political point of view, the situation is
					 completely different from what it was in 1996. On the economic level—as the
					 minister has said—the stumpage fees in Quebec have increased substantially in
					 recent years. I also want to point out that a study commissioned by the
					 government of Quebec on stumpage fees in private woodlots reached a very
					 interesting conclusion.</p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, Quebec has a price setting mechanism. I
					 believe it is along the same lines as the one applied in the other
					 provinces--Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia in particular--which take into
					 consideration the stumpage fees for private woodlots to set the ones for crown
					 lands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are often told that since 90% of forests are under
					 public administration in Quebec, the private sector could not be taken into
					 account because it was too heavily influenced by the strong presence of public
					 forest management. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is interesting is that the study in question
					 reaches the same conclusion, from which I shall read an excerpt, because it
					 seems to me to offer additional proof that there is no subsidy involved in
					 setting softwood lumber prices in Quebec:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Empirical data indicate that there is
						  a single price for wood originating in Quebec, New Brunswick or northeastern
						  U.S., once adjustments are made for the quality and for shipping costs.
						  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we see is that the price of wood in Quebec is the
					 same as throughout eastern North America. The paradox is that the Atlantic
					 provinces, including New Brunswick, were excluded from the American process,
					 more so because their forests are managed privately rather than publicly. But
					 we can see that price setting comes down to the same thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study clearly shows that prices based on stumpage
					 fees accurately reflect market prices. This is further proof that there are no
					 subsidies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are right in economic terms. Our environment, in
					 political terms, is favourable. And yet we face a whole series of legal
					 proceedings and harassment from part of the industry in the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for International Trade and the federal
					 government will have to take steps to help the industry and those working in
					 it. They will have to ensure the consensus remains, because, obviously, with
					 the latest layoffs in British Columbia, among others, the pressure is
					 tremendous, as we can understand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for International Trade and the federal
					 government will have to use their imagination in coming to the aid of the
					 industry to help it get through these turbulent times and through the legal
					 process and come out a winner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the minister mentioned the possibility of the
					 EDC's providing guarantee for the exporters, which corresponds to the interim
					 countervailing duties of 19.3%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the minister spoke of it around the end of
					 August, I think it was August 24, we have heard nothing more. I think this
					 avenue should be explored, and it seems to me it could help the industry get
					 through the period better.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the whole issue of employment insurance.
					 I know that my colleague, the member for
					 Kamouraska--Rivière-du-Loup--Témiscouata--Les Basques, will elaborate on that.
					 We also have a situation, with the economic downturn, that would allow the
					 federal government to implement measures, particularly with regard to
					 employment insurance, that would help industry as a whole, including the lumber
					 industry, which is suffering the consequences of countervailing duties, and it
					 will only get worse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, and this is very important, the federal
					 government and the Minister for International Trade must play a leadership
					 role. They have done that. I humbly submit that the Bloc Quebecois has
					 supported the government in its initiatives and has even guided it in some
					 instances to ensure that it was headed in the right direction. This must
					 continue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, it seems important that, following the
					 meetings between the provinces, there be a summit where the provinces, the
					 industry and the federal government get together to assess the situation before
					 the end of October.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope we will get through this dispute and that our
					 interests, which are totally legitimate, will be defended in a context where we
					 cannot let the might makes right principle prevail, because that would be
					 contrary to all the work that has been accomplished by Canadians and Quebecers
					 over the last 60 years. </p>

					 PC): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, I listened intently to the hon. member's
					 comments and I have a couple of comments and a question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is an extremely important issue for Quebec
					 because it supplies 25% of all of Canada's lumber exports. Certainly my
					 province of Nova Scotia supplies 7%. Timber is an extremely important industry
					 in Atlantic Canada but at the same time, on a national scale, our part of the
					 pie is not quite as large as Quebec's.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has always amazed me is our local Maritime Lumber
					 Bureau has always done its homework. We have sent delegations to Washington on
					 an annual basis for many years. We were largely responsible for having Atlantic
					 Canada excluded from the original softwood lumber deal based on our traditions
					 with U.S. trade practices and on our stumpage practices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue I am most afraid of at this time is the
					 anti-dumping legislation that has been imposed. We know we are having a hearing
					 on that on October 15, but how does the member feel the government has reacted
					 to that? I think the government has simply allowed this to proceed almost like
					 a runaway railroad car that is just on the track and moving forward. We have
					 done nothing to counteract the anti-dumping charges, which are much more
					 significant than the countervailing ones.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Chairman, I definitely do not want to criticize the
					 Atlantic provinces for having done their homework, so as to be excluded from
					 procedures undertaken by the U.S. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, what the Americans should be criticized
					 for is the main reason that made them go after Quebec and British Columbia in
					 particular, namely the fact that our forests are managed differently than U.S.
					 forests and that, in their eyes, public management, which incidentally gives
					 excellent results, is tantamount to subsidies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to see this for myself when we met U.S.
					 officials in Washington. In their mind, it was a simple equation: private
					 forests means subsidies. To which Canada and Quebec reply that managing our
					 forests differently does not mean that we do so in an unfair way. I think we
					 must be clear on this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the anti-dumping issue, we know that it is
					 businesses themselves that are directly involved. But I think that the federal
					 and provincial governments have a responsibility to support businesses at a
					 political and technical level.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that a lot has been done. I met with Tembec
					 officials, among others, who are targeted by this anti-dumping procedure and
					 they told me that they received very substantial technical support from both
					 the Quebec and federal governments. I think that we should continue in that
					 direction. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the whole anti-dumping process is a
					 measure to increase pressure on the Canadian industry. A settlement based on a
					 return to free trade would put an end to all these procedures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not psychic, but I hope this is what will happen,
					 because it is an extremely dangerous and arbitrary process. The investigation
					 is focused on a few companies but the rights will be imposed on the whole
					 industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to keep a very close eye on this
					 situation.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure to rise today in the
					 House of Commons to speak on behalf of the New Democratic Party in today's
					 debate on the softwood lumber industry. It is about time we had this debate
					 because this issue has been dragging for far too long and I am sure my
					 colleagues here in the opposition feel the same way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize that since our return on September 17 the
					 House has been charged with a number of issues related to the terrorist
					 attacks. I would like to acknowledge the co-operation of all parties to ensure
					 that this debate took place before we take our Thanksgiving week
					 break.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My NDP colleagues and I began raising this issue in the
					 House of Commons last March when it became clear that we were heading into yet
					 another softwood lumber dispute with the United States. At that time I was
					 thinking, here we go again. Why do we always end up in these situations
					 vis-à-vis the United States? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having recently been appointed the NDP industry critic,
					 I started looking into the matter back in March. Since then I have had the
					 opportunity to meet with many people involved in the industry, from the unions
					 that represent the workers in the industry to the representatives of the lumber
					 companies that operate in the different regions of our country. That is an
					 important thing to note. The softwood lumber industry is a national industry,
					 but the way it is managed and runs differs from region to region. That is why
					 it is important to listen to people from all the regions to get the proper
					 national perspective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to my one on one meetings, I also had the
					 opportunity to take part in some very good committee meetings on the subject. I
					 have learned a lot about the softwood lumber industry over the past months. I
					 have come a long way toward answering that question I was asking myself back in
					 March, why do we keep ending up in these lumber wars with the U.S.?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is that the U.S. is prepared to do
					 almost anything to keep Canadian lumber from capturing more than 30% of the
					 U.S. market. Anytime we do that, and it happens because we have a stronger,
					 more competitive industry than it does, the powerful American lumber companies
					 and U.S. lumber unions take their clout to Washington and the U.S. government
					 starts these trade wars. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time the Americans start one of these wars, it
					 ends up getting resolved by a temporary agreement or treaty. The last time was
					 in 1996 when Canada and the U.S. signed a five year softwood lumber agreement,
					 a five year ceasefire. The treaty expired in March 2001 and the U.S. went into
					 its protectionist mode by imposing the 19% tariff on most Canadian lumber.
					 Because of these tariffs, 15,000 lumber workers have lost their jobs since
					 April. We have to stop this situation now. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people wonder how the U.S. can get away with
					 putting these tariffs on Canadian lumber when we are supposed to have free
					 trade. The North American Free Trade Agreement is supposed to guarantee the
					 free movement of goods and trade between our two countries. This shows how weak
					 and ineffective the NAFTA regime is. Whenever we in the NDP criticize NAFTA for
					 these kinds of shortcomings our political opponents put on their smokescreens
					 and say “You New Democrats just oppose open trade”. Well it is not true. We
					 want open trade with our friends and neighbours in the United States.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that NAFTA is not good enough. It is
					 supposed to protect us from unilateral protectionist actions by the U.S. and it
					 does not. To prove it, look no further than the softwood lumber industry and
					 the 19% tariff that the U.S. is now putting on Canadian softwood
					 lumber.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not the only one who thinks this way. Allow me to
					 quote the president and chief executive officer of the Maritime Lumber Bureau,
					 Ms. Diana Blenkhorn, who told the House of Commons Sub-committee on
					 International Trade, Trade Disputes and Investment that, “The history of NAFTA
					 to date, relative to softwood lumber, shows it has not done the job, quite
					 frankly”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a quote from the same meeting with Mr. David
					 Emerson, co-chair of the Canadian Lumber Trade Alliance. Mr. Emerson told the
					 committee: “We do not have any faith in the trade litigation framework that
					 exists today because it has been designed by the Americans, for American
					 producers, to be as punitive as it possibly can be”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NAFTA has not done the job. That is why we have never
					 reached a final, permanent resolution to this issue. Instead we have gone from
					 short term agreement to short term agreement with periods of trade wars and
					 tariffs in between. The last thing we need now is another short term band-aid
					 solution. What we need is a long term solution to provide stability for the
					 industry and the people who rely on forestry for their employment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I am not the only one who thinks we need a long
					 term solution to break out of this cycle of trade wars. All the business
					 leaders and unions representing forest workers that I have heard from are
					 saying the same thing. I would like to quote Mr. Haggard, president of the
					 Industrial Wood and Allied Workers of Canada Union. This is Canada's largest
					 forest union. </p>


	<A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Haggard told the committee that his union and the
					 forest workers he represents were prepared to live with the short term pain of
					 the current tariffs for up to two years if the federal government used the time
					 to craft a real long term solution so that this would be the last time we have
					 to go through this process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unions and business agreed that the solution was
					 open trade with the U.S. The forest industry and unions told us they were
					 prepared to ride out the storm a little longer if we could secure a permanent
					 end to the bullying U.S. protectionist measures rather than another short term
					 band-aid solution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the problem is that the Liberal government is
					 not doing that. It should be standing up for Canadian jobs and industry, and
					 instead it knuckles under to the U.S. There is so much it could be doing to
					 help Canadian forest workers and to protect jobs but it is not doing any of
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the income assistance plan for the 15,000
					 people who have been laid off? We in the NDP called for that two months ago and
					 we have not heard a peep from the Liberal government. Where are the measures to
					 stop the export of raw logs to the U.S.? Exporting raw logs rather than
					 processing them in Canada is like the export of jobs. We have been calling on
					 the Liberal government for years to help keep these jobs in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be working with industry to develop our
					 processing capacity so that we could export more finished wood products instead
					 of raw logs and keep the processing jobs in Canada where they
					 belong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need the federal government to stand up for Canada's
					 right to manage our forests in an environmentally sustainable way. In our
					 federal system conserving and managing forests is a provincial responsibility.
					 In Manitoba most forestry takes place on provincial crown land and each year
					 the province sets quotas for the lumber companies. In that way the provincial
					 government is able to balance the needs of industry with the imperative that we
					 sustain our forests and our environment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the maritime provinces manage their forests
					 differently than Manitoba. In New Brunswick, for example, most of the forests
					 are privately owned and not on crown land.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prefer Manitoba's way of doing it because it is more
					 environmentally friendly, but I recognize this is a decentralized federation.
					 Each province is different and has the right to chart its own course in areas
					 of provincial jurisdiction. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. has been saying that it likes the way some
					 provinces manage their forests but not others. It wants to force us to change
					 the way we manage our forests to the least environmentally sustainable model.
					 It calls the crown land model used by Manitoba and other provinces to protect
					 the environment an unfair subsidy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is unacceptable and the federal government needs
					 to stand up to the U.S. and say that it is not a subsidy. It is environmental
					 management and the U.S. has no business interfering in our federal-provincial
					 division of powers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP wants to see open trade with the U.S. without
					 compromising our right to manage and preserve our forests for future
					 generations. We need sustainable forest management to maintain jobs now and in
					 the future so that there will always be enough trees for future generations to
					 harvest. We need fair and open access to the U.S. market through effective and
					 balanced trade deals, not unbalanced trade deals like the one we have
					 now.</p>

	Mr. Chairman, I listened carefully to my colleague from

					 not the first time that we have a situation where we are forced to go to court

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, however, the system we are dealing with now.

					 time when there is high unemployment and when we know that the immediate future
					 is quite gloomy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have liked to ask the question either to the
					 minister or to my colleague, but I will ask the member for Churchill. Until we
					 solve the problem for good, in my riding of Champlain--as in the Abitibi, which
					 my colleague mentioned, and I know the situation is the same everywhere in
					 Quebec--we are especially penalized since the forest industry is a base
					 industry in our area. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the problem is solved, people will be unemployed.
					 Would tit not be possible, for instance, to use the unemployment insurance
					 program or some other program to compensate the industry, to help it survive
					 and to reduce the pressure on the unemployed? It is actually the workers who
					 are paying for a problem that has cropped up between two governments. Does the

					 workers now?</p>

	Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Churchill for
					 her very thoughtful comments. As members know I am from the province of British
					 Columbia. British Columbia was particularly hard hit by the punitive tariffs of
					 19.3%. It has been estimated that as many as 15,000 jobs may have been lost
					 since the tariffs were imposed. We want to voice our very strong solidarity
					 with the workers and communities that were affected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that IWA-Canada has launched a national
					 campaign, which we strongly support, to protect Canadian jobs and communities
					 in the face of these bullying U.S. protectionist tactics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday this week the Interfor mill in Squamish
					 announced that it was shutting down. That is another 170 workers out of a job.
					 There are no transitional measures whatsoever for these folks. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Human Resources Development indicated
					 today that the employment insurance system was working just fine. It is not
					 working for the airline industry and it is not working for these workers
					 either.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does my colleague agree it is critically important we
					 make it clear to the U.S. government that access for Canadian manufactured wood
					 products entering the U.S. market has to be a prerequisite to any future trade

	I certainly agree with my colleague, Mr. Chairman. I
					 will touch on the unemployment issue just to reinforce again the need for the
					 EI fund to be used for what it was intended. Only one in five unemployed
					 workers in Canada is able to access employment insurance in spite of this
					 year's $17 billion surplus in the EI fund. It is irresponsible of the
					 government for not using that money for what it was intended.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to future trade agreements, it is without
					 question that those are the types of issues that the New Democratic Party feels
					 are missing from these trade agreements. Those types of rules must be put in

	Mr. Chairman, I commend the member for Vancouver Island
					 North for bringing forward this emergency debate. The issue has taken a human
					 toll. It truly is an emergency that needs to be dealt with and that is why it
					 was appropriate for him to bring this debate forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian softwood lumber industry exports about $11
					 billion a year to the United States. Almost half of that comes from British
					 Columbia. The current countervail duty of 20% imposed by the United States
					 amounts to $1 billion a year out of the British Columbia economy and $2 billion
					 a year out of the Canadian economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are pretty big numbers for people to comprehend,
					 but let us talk about the human toll. We have lost well over 15,000 jobs in
					 British Columbia. The potential job loss across Canada is 25,000 and that
					 number is expected to double by the end of the year. That will be 50,000 jobs
					 in Canada alone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is critical that we have this discussion and move
					 the ball forward to find a solution. Throughout the interior of British
					 Columbia and on Vancouver Island we have many single industry communities that
					 rely solely on the forest industry. These communities cannot survive and will
					 become ghost towns if the issue is not resolved quickly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human toll will be enormous. It goes much deeper
					 than just people losing their jobs. The 50,000 lost jobs can be exponentially
					 increased to hundreds of thousands of Canadians that would be affected:
					 workers, families and their children. Economic hardship is incredibly difficult
					 for families.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is in crisis proportion and it is an
					 emergency that needs to be dealt with. We have been to the WTO and various
					 international tribunals on three separate occasions. We have won every time but
					 we need to do more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has a strong case. We are fighting this through
					 every process. I applaud the minister for the pre-emptive strikes in regard to
					 the raw log exports. That argument has been successfully taken away from the
					 Americans. However the issue is so serious that our Prime Minister has to
					 become directly involved with the president of the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current United States administration claims that it
					 is a free trader: Robert Zoellick, the U.S. trade representative, Secretary of
					 Commerce Donald Evans and President Bush.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is the time when our Prime Minister should be
					 holding their feet to the fire. We have every right to be going at them quite
					 aggressively on this issue. Our Minister for International Trade and our Prime
					 Minister had conversations with U.S. representatives. Our Prime Minister spoke
					 with President Bush. He has even raised other issues such as energy, which was
					 probably the appropriate place. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is bad economic policy to start linking various
					 commodities. We would go down a slippery slope if we were to look at the kind
					 of overall trade we have with the United States. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely we need to do more. The human toll is
					 enormous, absolutely phenomenal. We have to be more aggressive on this issue
					 and look for solutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events that happened on September 11 have shaken
					 all of us. They have affected our lives, how we feel and what we do. They have
					 affected this dispute as well. It was not appropriate to discuss this issue in
					 the weeks following the attacks. We needed to deal with the aftermath. We
					 needed to support our friends to the south, to be there shoulder to shoulder.
					 However I think this issue should be brought back to the table. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Minister for International Trade for being
					 present for this debate. I also commend the member for Vancouver Island North
					 who brought the debate forward. It was questioned earlier whether it should
					 have been an emergency debate. It is an emergency. This is a crisis. Look at
					 the job losses and the communities that are affected. Throughout British
					 Columbia it is enormous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few hurdles in front of us as well. The
					 protectionist forces in the United States will go to great lengths to lobby
					 their government. We need to take them on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-dumping issue is coming up on October 15. We
					 are expecting some kind of decision on the anti-dumping issue and if they come
					 forward with that, it will be catastrophic against our industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some $2 billion has been sucked out of our economy, but
					 more important than the money, it has affected thousands of jobs, some 50,000
					 jobs. That is what hits home. It is creating a turmoil for hundreds of
					 thousands of Canadians and their families.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage the minister to do more at the head of
					 state level and the ministerial level. The Prime Minister and the president,
					 and the minister and his counterpart must be creative in finding solutions. We
					 cannot back down. We know we are right, as he has stated before. We have been
					 to the international tribunals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it takes a year or 18 months for the issue to wind
					 its way through the international tribunals, I am afraid there will be nothing
					 left to recover in some of our industries and the remote communities in Quebec,
					 Atlantic Canada and British Columbia. That simply will not be good enough. Our
					 government will be faced with a much greater crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are things we can do in getting involved at that
					 level. The Americans are looking for help in oil and gas. I emphasize that it
					 is not good public economic policy to make these direct links, but they are
					 desperately looking for help in those areas. We should give it to them, but at
					 the same time we should expect them to honour free trade and be the free
					 traders they claim to be.</p>

					 Asian flu hit and knocked the socks out of our western forestry exports to the
					 Asian market, suddenly the American market became much more important.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding mills have gone down. A lot of the mills

	Mr. Chairman, as has already been alluded to, much of
					 our attention over the last few weeks quite rightly has been absorbed by the
					 tragic events of September 11. That goes without saying. The aftershocks that
					 have followed those events have impacted our economy in a very serious way.
					 They have contributed to large scale layoffs in the airline industry, just as
					 one example.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These last weeks, there has been more and more bad
					 news. Thousands of job cuts have been announced, particularly in the Montreal
					 area, with the closing of the GM plant, massive layoffs at Air Canada, many job
					 losses in British Columbia, bad news for the aviation industry, and so on.
					 </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to recall that before September 11 the
					 Canadian economy was already facing a huge and looming crisis due to the
					 government's inaction in settling the Canada-U.S. softwood lumber
					 dispute.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a great deal of concern expressed in the
					 House, and quite rightly, about the loss of some 5,000 jobs at Air Canada. We
					 should be concerned about that. However, we have seen far less concern from the
					 government on the loss of jobs for some 30,000 people who have been laid off
					 due to the United States' imposition of the 19.3% softwood lumber tariff. The
					 effect of this has been huge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 15 we expect another ruling on the alleged
					 dumping of Canadian softwood. That could impose even more devastating tariffs
					 and devastating results on the industry. Some people have said that in the
					 minds of many Canadians, the lumber industry seems to be treated as an
					 afterthought by the government. They wonder if it is because it is not located
					 in the industrial heartland of central Canada. Many people are asking what the
					 problem is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a great opportunity for the government to show
					 with action and not just words that it really does care about this industry.
					 These kinds of questions are being asked by Canadians. It is a great
					 opportunity for the government to show its concern with action. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lumber is Canada's largest industrial sector. It is
					 bigger than automobiles. Canadians especially in rural communities rely heavily
					 on the lumber industry. They expect the federal government to give this number
					 one industry a number one priority when it comes to trading relationships.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly one of the reasons we are in this crisis is
					 that the government was asleep at the switch on this file. Members of the
					 Canadian Alliance and before that the Reform Party stood right here in the
					 House literally for years warning that something had to be done before the
					 agreement expired last April 1. Nothing was done. We can check <i>Hansard</i>.
					 Time and time again the warnings went out. We knew that the softwood lumber
					 agreement was temporary. The federal government knew it was a temporary
					 agreement. The government had five years to lay the groundwork for when the
					 agreement would come to an end and it did not happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groundwork needed to be laid so that based on the
					 principles of free and fair trade, this issue could be settled as the agreement
					 ended. The government delayed taking any position on the agreement until it was
					 too late. While we were calling for the government to openly push for free
					 trade in lumber, it was not focused on the issue at all. That is a matter of
					 history and it is a matter of fact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than spending four or five years building a
					 coalition for free trade with the United States by getting down there and
					 talking to consumer groups and home builders and senators, the government in
					 the time before April 1 did nothing to explain the Canadian case in great
					 detail especially to elected representatives on the U.S. side. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last spring I was in the United States and met with
					 Vice-President Cheney on this issue. Later the same day I met with U.S. Senator
					 Larry Craig of Idaho. He was one of the leaders in petitioning the president of
					 the United States to go along with this countervail, this tariff against
					 Canadian lumber. Vice-President Cheney has a reputation for being up on all the
					 issues and I believe he is. To my amazement, he and Senator Craig seemed to
					 lack an understanding of many of the pertinent details relating to Canadian
					 lumber.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I explained to them the details of our having won
					 this case three times before, by the types of questions they were asking they
					 seemed to be interested. Obviously Senator Craig, being a senator, listens to
					 his constituents who are appealing to him to impose some kind of tariff.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of preparation by the federal government was
					 evident. It simply was not done. I would have expected the government and our
					 embassy to have been down there not just days and weeks but months and years
					 before the agreement came to an end preparing and putting in place rules based
					 on free and fair trade for the future. It appears they have been sitting on
					 their hands. Some industry groups have come together to try to deal with this
					 issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should we be doing as MPs? Certainly constantly
					 raising the issue here is important, but we could do more. Members of
					 parliament in a non-partisan way should put together a group and go to the
					 United States. They should talk to those key senators, talk to the
					 representatives and make sure they understand the issue. They should talk to
					 the consumer groups down there.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is never too late for us to pursue the work that
					 should have been done beforehand and push this issue on a parallel side, in a
					 non-partisan way, with members of parliament from all sides of the House. We
					 have to.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, this issue could go all the way to the World
					 Trade Organization. However, it would be far better if we could convince the
					 United States administration and the U.S. congress to drop this case, not by
					 cutting some kind of a side deal that will lead to ongoing export tax but in
					 fact by dealing with it. It can be done. It is possible. I would suggest that
					 this post-September 11 environment in which we now live may actually give us a
					 new opportunity to pursue this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a meeting I had with the U.S. ambassador a few days
					 after the awful events of September 11, we talked about this particular issue.
					 I said that we would in very appropriately and dignified way handle the issue,
					 that we would not let it go. Obviously while our American friends were going
					 through this terrible time, we would not politically pound away at something. I
					 shared with him the issue of jobs and livelihood for 30,000 people, and it will
					 be in the tens of thousands more, being absolutely critical. We talked about
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister is saying that we will plod on, work our
					 way toward WTO and hope to win that one, and believes we will. However, the
					 devastation in the industry and among families will be huge. We recently saw
					 the Bush administration, virtually with the stroke of a pen, remove a tariff on
					 some products from other trading partners to build coalitions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context of debate, Indonesia had duties removed
					 from plywood exports to the tune of something like $200 million a year. I am
					 sincerely glad for the people of Indonesia and their industry. What about
					 Canada? Where are we on this particular file? We need to be there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is not prepared to go to the United
					 States, and I do not mean through the meetings that are being set up now with
					 the industry groups, and take the initiative in a way that is visible and
					 dignified but forceful, even at this particular time. It is not prepared to put
					 together a non-partisan team so that the United States will know that this is
					 not political, that we are concerned about our constituents and that believe we
					 are standing on the principles of free and fair trade. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A non-partisan delegation recently went to New York
					 City to send a message of sharing grief and condolences, not just for the
					 Americans but also for Canadians. We need to and we can put together a
					 non-partisan delegation the same way.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This non-partisan delegation of representatives of the
					 people in Washington will allow us to clearly establish our country's
					 commitment to free trade, particularly in the softwood lumber industry. Quebec
					 and British Columbia are the two provinces most affected by losses in the
					 softwood lumber industry. Thousands of families are waiting for us to act
					 quickly to defend their interests with our American friends and
					 allies.</p>

					 to the Minister for International Trade, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, I badly wish there were questions and
					 comments because I have two or three very serious questions for the leader of
					 the official opposition. I hope I will have an opportunity to take them up with
					 him. Perhaps he will attend the trade subcommittee which will deal with these
					 issues and we will have a chance for a fuller exchange there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed to hear the Leader of the Opposition
					 reach into his bag of tricks and pull out the old regional fears of playing
					 B.C. against Ontario and against the other provinces. The country deserves
					 better at this time. The federal government cares about all regions of this
					 country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to invite the Leader of the Opposition to
					 come to Northern Ontario, to those communities which are very dependent on
					 softwood lumber. I would like him to come with us to Quebec where he will
					 realize that 25% of the softwood lumber exports come from the province of
					 Quebec. B.C. is critical in this issue, but this is not just important to B.C.
					 This is a national issue. It is important to all regions of Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear hon. members opposite say of course, but they
					 would not have drawn that conclusion from the partisan regionally divisive
					 comments that we just sadly heard from the Leader of the Opposition. It really
					 was regrettable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Leader of the Opposition is somehow very badly
					 misinformed. He talks about non-partisan groups going to the United States. I
					 participated in a non-partisan effort to go to the United States, Washington
					 specifically, in June with colleagues from all parties of the House of Commons.
					 I believe his party participated. It was certainly invited to participate. I
					 understand the critic could not attend.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second group went in July. I heard the critic say
					 that he participated in that. I am glad he was there. Would he then inform his
					 leader that the government has encouraged several non-partisan visits to the
					 United States, efforts to build consensus and to look at the root causes.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader spoke about consumer groups that have
					 appeared somehow magically in the U.S. and the business groups that support our
					 position. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask, Mr. Chairman, for a little indulgence from
					 the other side. I did not once interrupt the leader of the
					 opposition.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Chairman, the Leader of the Opposition says I
					 incite them. They are easily incited.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened very carefully to the hon. member's
					 comments. With all due respect, I just do not think he is correct in the
					 statements that he made. Those statements need to be challenged by the
					 government and they will be challenged.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most serious trade dispute that exists
					 bilaterally between our two nations. Hundreds of thousands of jobs are directly
					 at stake. Some 300 Canadian communities from coast to coast to coast, including
					 B.C., but not just in B.C., have 50% at least of their livelihood depending on
					 the softwood lumber industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some 100 million jobs in all regions of Canada,
					 including central Canada and B.C. and the Atlantic, one is six jobs of them
					 indirectly or directly related to the softwood lumber industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the government done? It has repeatedly and
					 consistently challenged the false accusations of the American industry and the
					 American government that have been made about our softwood lumber industry.
					 This is the fourth time that we face this challenge now from the United States.
					 In the three previous cases these allegations were not
					 substantiated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is this. This is an issue of U.S.
					 protectionism and the fact that the Americans are very unhappy with the
					 Canadian industry having gained a 34% market share in the United States. That
					 is really what this is all about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the efforts of the Canadian government, led by
					 the Minister for International Trade, with the close co-operation of the
					 Canadian embassy in Washington, we have for many months now been building
					 alliances in the United States, exactly as the Leader of the Opposition
					 suggests, belatedly. Action has been going on for a long time to recruit some
					 150 members of the U.S. congress who support our position to inform and work
					 with major companies like Home Depot . They support our position to recruit
					 consumer groups that understand that they could be paying up to $4,000 more on
					 a new home. Why? To simply protect less competitive U.S. lumber
					 operations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those efforts did not just come out of thin air. The
					 Government of Canada has taken the lead in helping make sure that groundwork
					 was done. The Leader of the Opposition put forward some good suggestions. It is
					 just that they are late and they have already been going on for some
					 time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a good consensus of the industry in Canada, the
					 provinces and territories, that what we want is free trade in softwood
					 lumber.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the minister pointed out, there was no sort of a
					 willy-nilly decision that we just woke up and the softwood lumber agreement is
					 over. There was a conscious decision after very wide consultations that this
					 agreement would be allowed to run out. Why? Because what we desire is free
					 trade in softwood lumber.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the United States had not taken the action that it
					 has taken, we would be in a situation where softwood lumber prevails.
					 Unfortunately, the Americans again for the fourth time in 20 years have taken
					 this protectionist action. Of course we have been and will continue to
					 challenge that at every opportunity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has repeatedly raised this issue
					 with President Bush, as I said. The Minister for International Trade has
					 repeatedly raised the issue with Secretary Evans and with trade representative
					 Zoellick. We are challenging these allegations of the United States at the WTO.
					 We have requested a panel where five specific challenges will be launched about
					 the American allegations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the United States congress is split on the
					 issue. There are a few protectionist senators who are leading the charge
					 against this and are now being mischievous, some sending letters to Canadian
					 parliamentarians suggesting that we now self-impose a tax that will help them
					 out of a situation that they know they will lose. They will lose this trade
					 action again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the unfortunate reality in this? My colleague,
					 the Minister for International Trade, I and our government knows this very
					 well. Unfortunately, this kind of a decision does not come really quickly.
					 Unfortunately, there is pain to be borne unfairly by Canadian companies,
					 producers and workers because the United States is not living up to what it
					 claims to be, which is free traders.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions went on in Toronto last week and are going
					 on in Washington this week. Progress is being made to find the root causes of
					 this so we can come to a solution outside of litigation. As long as those
					 efforts are bearing fruit then they ought to proceed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time we are moving on several other fronts,
					 whether it be ministers and government leaders talking to American leaders or
					 whether it be Canadian officials taking the necessary steps for the WTO
					 challenges.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that Canada is right in this issue. Our
					 case has stood up every time it has been challenged and it will stand up
					 again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the Minister for International Trade for the
					 wide consultation. A number of members on the other side of the House have
					 indicated that there has been very wide consultation. That has continued and
					 will continue. As long as there is a consensus in the industry for us to
					 continue down this path then the government will continue to vigorously defend
					 our interests in softwood lumber.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution really is free trade. It is not
					 regionalism. It is not the unfortunate comments that I heard from the Leader of
					 the Opposition to play B.C. against Ontario or Quebec. Those are not the
					 sentiments that we need at this time. We need a united effort. The Canadian
					 people will accept nothing else.</p>

					 (Abitibi--Baie-James--Nunavik, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, I rise today because it is not just that.
					 All the political parties and provincial governments are getting
					 involved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am first and foremost a former forestry worker in the
					 Abitibi and the economy of the Abitibi—Témiscamingue region is largely based on
					 lumber and mining. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, we too make the rounds of our vast
					 regions. In Quebec's great Abitibi--Témiscamingue region, resolutions are being
					 passed all over the place. People are getting involved. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 12, for instance, the Témiscamingue RCM
					 proposed a resolution at a meeting where county councillors and mayors were
					 present. The meeting was chaired by Philippe Barette, the mayor of
					 Témiscamingue and reeve of the RCM.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people say in their resolution, which they sent
					 directly to the minister and to the federal government, that they are opposed
					 to the imposition by the United States of countervailing duties on Canadian
					 lumber. They ask that the government:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--energetically oppose the imposition of countervailing duties
						  by the United States on Canadian lumber and ensure that resource regions are
						  treated justly and fairly.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same thing with the town of Senneterre. We
					 see what is happening in resource and northern regions. It is important to say
					 it and not just make fine speeches about what we do in the House of Commons.
					 There are small municipalities that take the time to pass resolutions. I have
					 one here from the town of Senneterre, a municipality administered by mayor
					 Gérard Lafontaine and the councillors. They say: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Whereas the United States is unfairly
						  invoking a sudden and massive increase in Canadian exports, and also subsidies
						  to the industry to justify their action—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This an excerpt from a resolution passed on September
					 14. These are all resolutions that were adopted recently.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go back to the case of Précibois in Barraute,
					 a company that employs forestry workers. France Gagnon clearly indicated to the
					 Quebec and Canadian governments that the value added sector must immediately be
					 excluded from this trade war because it affects our forestry workers, either at
					 the plant or in the bush.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Processing industries operate under unique conditions
					 that were not taken into account by the United States. The decision made on
					 September 4 by the United States trade department to impose countervailing
					 duties of 19.3% on softwood lumber, based on our declared value rather than on
					 first processing value, is contrary to American practice in previous disputes
					 and will have serious consequences for our secondary producers and wholesalers
					 in Canada. The Canadian government believes this decision is not based on any
					 law nor any fact, and is urging the United States to cancel it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must read the papers. At present, people are afraid
					 of retroactive measures. If, in the coming weeks or the coming months, a long
					 term fixed rule is adopted, with one time countervailing duties applied
					 retroactively for several months, during the summer, that will hurt, in the
					 Abitibi and Quebec especially. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody cuts wood on Wellington Street in Ottawa, or on
					 Sainte-Catherine Street, in Montreal, or on Grande-Allée in Quebec City. That
					 activity goes on in resource regions, especially if it is permanent. The
					 Abitibi--Témiscamingue will be out of breath. I believe in Liberal minister's
					 competence, I know he is working hard to get a victory for us and we will have
					 that victory with the governments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government of Quebec decided to do everything it
					 could to demonstrate, as it successfully did in 1991, that the forestry regime
					 in Quebec does not in any way subsidize the softwood lumber industry. That is
					 why Quebec is doing so well in its battle, with the help of every political
					 party at the provincial and federal levels. However let me be clear on one
					 thing. According to a study, referred to earlier, which was carried out in
					 Quebec:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>In Quebec, the price of timber stands
						  on private lands is used as a benchmark to estimate the stumpage fees paid to
						  the crown for trees taken out of a timber berth. The purpose of the study was
						  to confirm the suitability and the legitimacy of this estimate in the context
						  of free trade. </small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultants were asked to answer three basic questions:
					 Are timber stands on Quebec private forests competitive? Are they
					 representative of the world market for timber stands? And finally, are they
					 properly assessed? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the study, the answer to all three
					 questions was an unqualified yes. Therefore, the study confirms our claims and
					 supports the answers we provided to the United States department of commerce
					 last June.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important to stress that this recent
					 study, which was very well done, confirms, clarifies and reinforces Quebec's
					 position on this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current as well as the previous governments,
					 Quebec has always been in favour of free trade, and we believe that we can
					 benefit from easier access to the America market and still fully comply with
					 the NAFTA and international trade rules.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position, which is now supported by this study, is
					 very clear: our timber market from private lands is competitive and
					 representative. It is that market that determines fairly the level of stumpage
					 fees for timber from public lands. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means that free market rules are fully respected.
					 We disagree with any measure that would limit trade, such as the introduction
					 of quotas and countervailing duties, which would hurt Quebec's forest
					 industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the most important thing. We must think about
					 the industry, about workers, about families. Our forests are located mostly in
					 our resource regions. I understand that there are certain disputes. I have to
					 mention the James Bay situation. The James Bay Cree have vested rights in that
					 area under the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, and they defend those
					 rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that, one day, the Cree from James Bay will be
					 able to sit with people from the forest industry to try to find a solution to
					 the logging issue in the northern part of the James Bay area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I must say that I trust the minister, to
					 whom I referred earlier as the Liberal minister responsible for 2 x 4s. We will
					 win this battle together, with the opposition parties and the government, and
					 one day we will be able to refer to this Liberal minister as the minister
					 responsible for 4 x 4s.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. member of the Canadian
					 Alliance for calling for this debate, and the Chair for allowing it this
					 evening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softwood lumber is something we have been following
					 closely for some months, because it requires constant attention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those in our audience who might not necessarily be
					 very familiar with the issue, the American market for Canadian and Quebec
					 softwood lumber is a very vital one for us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans have imposed a countervailing duty of
					 19.3% as the result of a preliminary decision by the American department of
					 industry; this would be somewhat retroactive if maintained. The Bloc Quebecois
					 has intervened on several occasions in order to seek massive support in the
					 House for the return to free trade in softwood lumber. Why? Because softwood
					 lumber producers in Quebec and in Canada have developed a highly competitive
					 product capable of going for a better price in the U.S. market than many U.S.
					 products. This is, moreover, acknowledged by U.S. consumers, who want to see
					 quality lumber from Canada available in their country, because it would bring
					 their house prices down. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fighting a major battle. It is vital we convince
					 the Americans, at all levels, of the relevance of our position. I think that,
					 in this regard, we must as members of the opposition serve as watchdog to
					 ensure the government is not transforming the information and discussion
					 sessions into negotiation sessions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for International Trade has confirmed this
					 was not the case. We accept his word and hope things continue this way. A lot
					 of effort was put into winning the battle in the preceding months.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself went to Washington with a non-partisan
					 delegation of members, including the member for Joliette and the member for 
					 Rimouski--Neigette-et-la
						Mitis. We went to meet American representatives. I met someone
					 from Louisiana who thought Canadian softwood lumber competed with his softwood
					 lumber production in Louisiana. We had a discussion and in the end he
					 understood that the softwood lumber produced in Louisiana did not compete with
					 that produced in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sort of intervention, on a small scale, between
					 individuals, means that today the Americans have a better understanding of the
					 facts. There is still a way to go and we must make sure we carry on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that sense, the visit of the Bloc Quebecois leader
					 in my riding in late August has shown that both producers and workers want to
					 keep fighting until we reach our ultimate goal, to restore free
					 trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously there is a short term negative impact. For
					 example, the price of lumber tends to drop in Canada. With a 19% tariff, we
					 have oversupply on the Canadian market and that tends to put pressure on the
					 price. Our producers will have to live with that. Also their benefits have
					 dropped and ultimately jobs are lost. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of which, we will need to show solidarity if
					 we are to stand fast to the end, until we get a final decision. One of the
					 things we should do, and I urge the government to do it, is make sure that
					 during that difficult period there is a special effort to diversify regional
					 economies and to adjust the employment insurance plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who will be laid off a little sooner because
					 there are fewer jobs in Quebec cutting, processing and shipping wood to the
					 United States because of countervailing duties deserve a chance at EI benefits
					 for a reasonable number of weeks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in all regions where forestry is a major
					 industry, people could be allowed to qualify with 420 hours of work, rather
					 than something higher if the rate of unemployment is not very high. There is
					 therefore work to be done with respect to the EI plan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts could also be made to diversify forestry
					 products. A particular effort is required in the next few years because, every
					 time we export softwood lumber which has been processed, it is not affected by
					 countervailing duties. This takes the pressure off and would give us an
					 argument in our discussions with the Americans.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that there be this kind of debate. It
					 is important that we make it clear that we are behind the position Canada is
					 now defending, provided that it defends it all the way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst thing would be to return to an agreement like
					 the one we had before, which expired on March 31.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have come too far to go back to a position like
					 that. Let us hope that there will be an outcome which sees the end of
					 countervailing duties and that the Americans will also recognize that free
					 trade is the way of the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free trade agreement signed with the Americans
					 concerned a number of areas. Why not respect it? It would be to everyone's
					 benefit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talks are now underway. They are not negotiations but
					 if they lead to a long term free trade solution, so much the better. That is
					 what we must hope for. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people showed maturity in this area. The Quebec
					 government mandated Pierre-Marc Johnson, a former Quebec premier, to ensure
					 that the Quebec position was well championed. We also contributed to the study
					 that my colleague from Abitibi--Baie-James--Nunavik referred to earlier, a very
					 serious study, which showed that in fact Quebec was not giving any hidden
					 subsidy to the softwood lumber industry, that we can compete on the North
					 American market and that we are looking forward to an open market. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that all of these positions, those adopted by
					 Quebec, the other provinces and the federal government, bring us closer to a
					 sustainable solution, a solution that will ensure that we will not have to deal
					 with the present situation again in five or ten years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that the five year agreement that
					 came to an end on March 31 had a somewhat negative impact on productivity.
					 American businesses took advantage of this period to catch up somewhat in terms
					 of productivity, while the best would have won had the market remained fully
					 open. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what we are prepared to live with on the
					 competition level. We are ready to live with the Americans and the producers of
					 North America. We believe we are able to take on the challenge and take our
					 share of the market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is evidenced by the fact that, during the five
					 years of the agreement allowing countervailing duties, those Canadian provinces
					 that were not included had an advantage that I would describe as unfair in some
					 respects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we could come back to full free trade, then there
					 would be a level playing field. My riding is adjacent to the maritimes. In the
					 last five or six years, exports have increased considerably throughout Canada,
					 but particularly in the maritimes. Indeed, we had to predict the part of the
					 duty that we had to make up for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must follow the situation very closely. Now that the
					 international situation is stabilizing somewhat, that the terrible events of
					 September 11, which we will never be able to put right, are behind us, we are
					 trying to see if we can make up for the negative effects they have had on the
					 economy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a region like mine, entire villages are economically
					 dependent on the lumber industry. I am talking about villages that members do
					 not necessarily know, small communities of 500, 1,000 or 1,500 in the
					 Témiscouata region. I am also talking about small towns. All these communities
					 depend on the lumber industry and we must find a satisfactory solution for
					 their sake. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers who live in these communities that have
					 achieved a good productivity level in co-operation with local industries
					 deserve that we go to the end of the negotiation process. That is what I want.
					 I want us to continue to apply pressure and to make compromises. Some
					 interesting and promising meetings are going on right now and we want them to
					 continue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that there was going to be other meetings in
					 Vancouver and in Montreal. Let us give those meetings a chance to produce some
					 interesting results. But let us not change our fundamental position. We want
					 free trade again, not a compromise that would repeat the agreement that expired
					 on March 31 of this year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, any tendency to soften our position would
					 amount to recognizing our weakness and that would be unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us continue to pursue this issue with the Americans
					 and to argue our point, and we will find a solution. That solution will benefit
					 both the lumber producers and the consumers who need that lumber to build
					 houses and buildings throughout North America. </p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Madam Chairman, I am delighted to participate in the
					 debate this afternoon. I am sure some of my colleagues will be wondering why a
					 member of parliament from Parkdale--High Park, a Toronto urban riding, is
					 interested in these issues because obviously I do not have any softwood lumber
					 industries in my riding. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I would like to advise my colleagues that as a
					 lawyer who practised law for 18 years I have a very special interest in
					 international trade law issues. I also had the opportunity to be a chair of the
					 House Subcommittee on International Trade, Trade Disputes and Investments. I
					 was a member of the committee that travelled across Canada a few years ago
					 consulting Canadians from coast to coast on our position with respect to the
					 WTO and where we should go from there. I must say that at that time, certainly
					 in British Columbia but all across Canada, the issue of the softwood lumber
					 agreement was prominent well before its expiry came up. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to use my time to actually talk about the
					 concrete steps that the Government of Canada is taking before the World Trade
					 Organization to defend the rights of our softwood lumber industry and to
					 guarantee the protection under law that it deserves. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this is the fourth round of trade action taken by
					 the U.S. industry in 20 years, the U.S. industry allegations do not merit a
					 worthy response since they have not been sustained time and time
					 again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to outline Canada's challenge to the five
					 U.S. measures before the WTO in defence of our softwood industry and of one
					 related measure that directly impacts on our lumber producers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 9, 2001, the United States department of
					 commerce made a preliminary determination that Canada's softwood lumber
					 industry was subsidized by federal and provincial programs and furthermore,
					 that our exports to the U.S. exceeded a 15% increase in exports to warrant a
					 “massive importations” or critical circumstances determination.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these findings by the U.S. were only
					 preliminary, they were made in a politically charged environment due to
					 intensive lobbying by protectionist U.S. lumber interests. As a result, the
					 U.S. department of commerce will impose a 19.3% duty on Canadian lumber exports
					 to the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add insult to injury, as the Minister for
					 International Trade stated earlier, the U.S. department of commerce will impose
					 duties on our lumber, not only on what is first milled but also on its
					 increased value when it enters the United States. In essence, the United States
					 will reap duties on the higher remanufactured lumber rather than the so-called
					 mill rate value. This is contrary to any previous decision we have ever seen
					 before.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decision follows an earlier preliminary
					 determination by another United States body. The United States international
					 trade commission found that although our industry is not injuring United States
					 producers,our industry “may” injure U.S. producers in the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the U.S. allegations of subsidy have never
					 been sustained in previous cases and our export monitoring data from Statistics
					 Canada found that our exports from this year compared to a similar period last
					 year increased by only 11.3% and not the 15% increase as the U.S. alleges,
					 regrettably, the U.S. department of commerce is intent on finding against our
					 industry, whatever the circumstances may be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these rulings have no basis in fact or law, we
					 nonetheless must respond accordingly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the U.S. trade action, the Government of
					 Canada has taken the following steps before the World Trade Organization.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the first measure, Canada requested that a WTO
					 panel be established to hear our complaint that the U.S. treatment of our log
					 exports restraints or controls is contrary to U.S. obligations under the
					 subsidies and countervailing measures agreement, which is also known as the
					 SCM. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister for International Trade noted at the
					 beginning of this debate, the WTO panel in its final report on June 29 found
					 that our export restraints do not provide a financial contribution and thus do
					 not confer countervailable subsidies. This ruling is very positive for Canada
					 and actually undermines the U.S. claims that log export controls confer
					 subsidies in the current countervailing duty investigation.</p>


	<A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1715)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the second measure before the WTO, Canada also
					 requested a WTO panel to hear Canada's complaint that when the dispute
					 settlement body has ruled that the U.S. anti-dumping or countervailing duty
					 order is inconsistent with United States international obligations the U.S.
					 must refund all duties collected. Those members who were in the House earlier
					 will have heard that the Minister for International Trade said that in 1996 in
					 fact the Americans had to pay back over $1 billion to our producers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third action follows the U.S. department of
					 commerce preliminary determination of subsidy in its countervailing duty
					 investigation and the imposition of a 19.31% duty for Canadian softwood lumber
					 imports entering the United States. Canada finds this ruling inconsistent with
					 United States WTO obligations on a number of grounds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the United States treated stumpage as a
					 financial contribution on the basis that it is a provision of a so-called good.
					 Rather, stumpage is a licence or right of access to cut timber, which is not
					 covered by the financial contribution definition found within the subsidies and
					 countervailing measures agreement. Second, the United States also wrongly
					 determined that stumpage is a benefit and it based its findings on U.S. prices
					 rather than on the prevailing market conditions in Canada. All of these actions
					 are inconsistent with the subsidies and countervailing measures agreement and
					 accordingly we will challenge these findings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fourth action before the WTO concerns the U.S.
					 department of commerce critical circumstances decision that resulted in the
					 19.31% duty now being applied retroactively to Canadian shipments made on or
					 after May 19, 2001. This determination was based upon an alleged subsidy that
					 was found to be de minimis, or less than 1% subsidy rate. This application of
					 an alleged subsidy of less than 1% to justify the retroactive application of a
					 preliminary duty rate of 19.31% is also inconsistent with the subsidies and
					 countervailing measures agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth action we are taking before the WTO concerns
					 the entitlement of Canadian exporters to seek a review of their circumstances
					 when trade action is taken before them. Exporters subject to countervailing
					 duty action are entitled to individual expedited reviews following an
					 investigation in order to calculate company specific duty rates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, once again the U.S. regulations do not provide
					 for individual expedited company reviews where subsidy rates are determined on
					 a countrywide basis. Once again, this practice is inconsistent with the
					 subsidies and countervailing measures agreement in that it denies exporters to
					 such a review and the determination of an individual duty rate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is challenging these measures as WTO
					 inconsistent and has requested accelerated consultations to discuss this
					 matter. Those of my colleagues who were here earlier would have heard the
					 Minister for International Trade talk about those consultations that are going
					 on, up to today until 2.30, I believe, and they will continue to go
					 on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is also challenging the United States on another
					 measure. The sixth measure relates to softwood lumber and it includes a review
					 of a certain piece of U.S. legislation known as the Byrd amendment. This
					 amendment requires U.S. customs to distribute Canadian duties assessed to
					 affected U.S. producers directly. This amendment creates a clear incentive for
					 U.S. industry to file and support cases against Canadian firms exporting to the
					 United States. In challenging this measure, Canada is joined by over a dozen
					 other countries that also find the U.S. actions WTO inconsistent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, I think it is important to remember that
					 this is the fourth time that the United States industry has taken action
					 against our softwood lumber industry in the last 20 years. Our actions and
					 indeed, we are saying, U.S. actions must be based on a rules based system
					 whereby everyone is treated fairly, impartially and without the ability to pick
					 and choose which rules they want to abide by.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure members of the House that we will
					 continue to take action that best defends our industry and that best supports
					 the international agreements that we are all party to.</p>

	Madam Chairman, I am somewhat pleased to rise on debate
					 today. I wish I did not have to. I come from a riding that has been hit very
					 hard by this. Contrary to what the parliamentary secretary and the minister
					 have inferred, we know that this is a far bigger issue than just British
					 Columbia. We know it affects many people across the country.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-55332"></A><a HREF="#Int-55335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-55331"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b>

	However, after all, I am a member of parliament from
					 British Columbia and I have been elected to represent my constituents. I think
					 my hon. colleagues in the House need to know that people are phoning me to tell
					 me about the hardships they are now enduring because they have been laid
					 off.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had nine major mills in my riding. We now have
					 eight. One has closed completely, four are in a stage of lay off and are not
					 producing at the moment. The other four are not by any means at capacity in
					 terms of production. The people calling me are feeling, and I have to say this,
					 that their government has failed them on this issue. That is about as blunt as
					 I can be about it. They are the people who are directly affected by this. They
					 are the people having to go on social assistance or EI and who may not have a
					 job when this thing is settled. Their mills may not re-open. They are the
					 people who are having to turn to help from family, churches, food banks and
					 every other kind of support system that we have in the country when a major
					 industry like the softwood lumber industry goes into such a serious
					 position.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unusual, then, for us to be standing and
					 fighting on behalf of our constituents who find themselves in such a terrible
					 state. I make no apologies for it at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is on this basis that we believe the government has
					 failed Canadians on this issue. This is a huge part of our economy, as has
					 already been stated in the House during this debate. In 1995 it employed
					 100,000 people. It contributed $14.5 billion to our economy. Those are big
					 statistics and mean that this industry has a significant contribution to make
					 to the total economic well-being of the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live in a riding that is a major producer of softwood
					 lumber. It covers approximately 3,837 square kilometres. Any people going to my
					 riding would agree, I am sure, that there they would be able to see some of the
					 most beautiful tree covered mountain scenery to be found in the world. Anyone
					 standing at the top of the mountains to look out over the riding would get an
					 understanding of how dependent we are upon this industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are approximately 115,000 people in my riding. Of
					 those people, over 20%, or almost 23,000 of them, depend upon forestry as their
					 primary income. That is 23,000 individuals plus their families. By the time the
					 economists extrapolate the family members, the circulation of the dollars
					 through the local community and so on, it is certainly crystal clear that
					 forestry is a major industry in my riding. Until recently it has been the
					 number one economic stimulator in the riding of Nanaimo--Cowichan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I cannot just stand idly by and watch in
					 silence as the government allows our forestry sector to be stalled due to the
					 whims of a few American lumber barons, primarily in the American
					 southeast.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister accused us of not having said anything
					 about this in the House during the last three weeks. It is quite clear that
					 international events have overtaken us in the House. It is still appalling for
					 us to even think of the terrorist acts that took place and the loss of life.
					 What we have done today is simply make sure that this issue does not go off the
					 radar screen. It is at this point that we felt it was timely to bring it up. It
					 ought not to slide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. trade representative, Mr. Zoellick, stated
					 that U.S. needs to join in with more free trade agreements around the world,
					 that the U.S. needs to "advance the causes of openness, development and
					 growth". He acknowledges that NAFTA has led to gains for the average American
					 family of approximately $1,300 to $2,000 annually in income.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that it is time, then, for our government to
					 stand up to the American tactics and clearly say to them that it is time for
					 them to act on their own words, if that is what they believe. Simply put,
					 softwood lumber should be a freely traded commodity.</p>


	<A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devastating effect of the recently imposed 19.3%
					 tariff on our softwood lumber exports has really negative consequences. In B.C.
					 alone there are already an estimated 15,000 forest workers laid off. Without
					 any changes it is estimated that this number will double to 30,000 by the end
					 of the year. This, then, is a very serious issue and I hope the minister can
					 see beyond the rhetoric, beyond all of the meetings and everything else that he
					 has done and see that these are real people who are in a really desperate
					 situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we do? I have several thoughts. Some of them
					 have already been shared in the House. The first thing that must be done is to
					 send a clear and consistent message. So many times Canadians have watched the
					 evening news and have heard different government representatives make wildly
					 diverse statements around this issue. That simply cannot continue. We need to
					 hear clearly and unequivocally from our government what it is doing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the problem and the reason why we are having
					 this debate today is that the government has failed to communicate to us as
					 legislators and certainly to the ordinary British Columbians who are losing
					 their jobs exactly what it is doing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I would ask the minister and his department
					 to make sure that he clearly shares with Canadians what he is doing. Somehow he
					 has to get those communication tools working better so that Canadians
					 understand that the government, the party in power, is doing something about
					 this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is to negotiate from a position of
					 strength. A weak bargaining position is tantamount to a losing position. Simply
					 put, the Americans not only want our natural gas and other energy sectors, they
					 need them. If we have something that the Americans want, let us make sure that
					 we get something that we want, namely free trade in the softwood lumber sector.
					 There should be no shame or any kind of hesitation for us to bargain hard with
					 the Americans in terms of energy. In spite of three senior cabinet ministers at
					 some point offering their support to the linking of free trade and softwood
					 lumber to the energy sector, the Prime Minister has flip-flopped on this issue
					 several times. He did it not too long ago on a trip to Alberta. Simply put, if
					 the Americans want our energy they must allow free trade for our softwood
					 lumber.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the government must make a strong representation
					 to the U.S. trade representative on behalf of all Canadian companies, stating
					 our concerns and our position unequivocally. To date we have not seen the
					 government helping this to take place in Canada. I urge the government to stand
					 up and act in the interests of all Canadians whether they be in British
					 Columbia, Quebec or any other place in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the government must work quickly to remove
					 those parts of the forestry industry that should not be included in the U.S.
					 19.3% tariff, specifically in the case of a number of producers in British
					 Columbia, from where I come, in the cedar industry. The stakes are high and
					 more jobs are at risk if those things do not happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very serious issue for us. We want to have
					 the government continue to act boldly and decisively on our behalf. We want it
					 to communicate with Canadians clearly what its position is. We want the
					 government to get tough with our American friends. They can be nice, but they
					 can be tough. We need to be able to say that at the end of day we truly have
					 free trade in this commodity as well as any other.</p>

					 trade with the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restrictions in the United States creates an
					 immense impact on the industry and on all Canadians. They are of particular
					 interest and concern to British Columbia. Softwood lumber is more than a $10
					 billion export industry and almost half of that lumber comes from British
					 Columbia. As we have heard, 15,000 jobs have already been compromised in
					 British Columbia and many more across the country. One million jobs across
					 Canada are related to the forest products industry in some way. These
					 countervailing duties are also having an impact on federal and provincial
					 revenues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to look at the motivation for the countervail
					 action in the United States. The motivation by the American industry is simply
					 protectionism. It wants protection for its industries. What is our motivation?
					 Our motivation is free trade which has been our motivation all along. It is why
					 we did not seek to renegotiate the softwood lumber agreement when it expired at
					 the end of April. We have been working toward free trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the many important aspects that have
					 been raised in this special debate this afternoon, let me briefly mention what
					 I would see as the four key approaches of the government together with other
					 governments and industry in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first approach would be strength in unity. Since I
					 have been in the House, the Minister for International Trade has been speaking
					 publicly on a weekly basis and working across the country to ensure that we do
					 not separate interests across Canada by province or by industry against
					 industry. Unity and the strength that comes from unity has been the byword and
					 the underlying fundamental strength of this approach, and it is holding and it
					 is working. In fact if it does not work and we do not hold together then we
					 will fail against this challenge. This unity is provincial governments to
					 provincial governments, all provinces to the federal government and governments
					 with industry. That is immensely important. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry has not had a difficult time. It is facing
					 different circumstances across the country but also within any one province it
					 has differences but it is holding together and it is supporting this strength
					 in unity toward free trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second approach is to pursue every legal avenue and
					 every available forum to challenge these countervail duties and these false
					 allegations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue is around subsidy. As we have heard
					 over and over again, Canada has won this challenge many times over the last 20
					 years in independent international tribunals. There is no subsidy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, after winning this issue again, $1 billion in
					 improperly collected countervail duties was returned to Canada and Canadian
					 industries. Here we go again. There is no subsidy. Our differences in forest
					 practices and the way we manage our forests in the two countries has led to
					 some confusion perhaps but the rulings are absolutely clear. Our stumpage
					 system and crown management system on public lands and public forests is based
					 on sound forest management practices that protect the environment and create a
					 sustainable flow in managed forests so that this is a sustainable industry into
					 the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsidies, no way. It has been proven over and over
					 again. What is the 19.3% interim countervailing duty based on? In this same
					 time the price of lumber in the U.S. market has gone up 15%. How could there be
					 a 19.3% entry. Moreover, it is calculated on a quarter to quarter basis rather
					 than on an annual basis against the same quarter for the previous year which
					 would have been the accurate calculation. The calculation is done by using the
					 first milled price, which the calculation should be based on, yet the 19.3%
					 countervailing duty is being imposed against the entry price which includes the
					 added value from Canadian manufacturers crossing the border. </p>


	<A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1735)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is patently unreasonable, unfair and contrary to
					 international trade rules. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have looked at U.S. laws but U.S. laws keep
					 changing. However time and again we have been told that this is clearly against
					 international trade rules. The Byrd amendment that people have talked about
					 has, thank goodness, been suspended by the president in response to the
					 concerns expressed by Canadians, by our minister, by our Prime Minister, by our
					 interparliamentary engagements, including members of the opposition to the
					 president. We are being listened to.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the claim that Canada's log export
					 restrictions are subsidies? The WTO has already ruled that those restrictions
					 are not subsidies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. law changed since the last ruling to prohibit
					 the reimbursement of Canadian companies for improperly claimed subsidies. As we
					 have heard, this is being challenged by Canada at the WTO and we will fight
					 that to the end.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also fight in the U.S. courts. When the
					 department of commerce makes its final conclusions on this matter, if it
					 continues to support this false claim of subsidy and harm, then we will
					 challenge it in the U.S. courts. We have judicial review there. The prime
					 allegations in a judicial review are patently unreasonable decisions by public
					 authorities, and that is clear from all of the evidence that has come together.
					 We have submitted hundreds of thousands of pages of documents showing this
					 patently unreasonable action. We will win the day in the end but what does it
					 do in the interim?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third approach is to have discussion with the U.S.
					 involving federal and provincial governments. The third series of these
					 promising discussions wound up in New York this afternoon. They were held in
					 Toronto two weeks ago and they have been held in Washington over the last three
					 days. They have been promising enough that all parties are being advised by
					 Canadian industry to continue in Vancouver in the next short while and later in
					 Montreal. These discussions are going somewhere. They are working on common
					 ground and leading to a better understanding of the differences in forest
					 practices and market conditions in both countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads to our final approach, which is building
					 relationships with our natural allies in the United States. It involves
					 parliamentarians. We have heard from over 115 congressmen, member
					 representatives as well as senators, who have come behind the Canadian position
					 to support our just claims for free trade. We are making progress with home
					 suppliers and homebuilders who are seeing their costs rise simply because a few
					 lumber companies in the U.S. are looking for protectionism in the trade of
					 lumber products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also speaking to the American consumer more and
					 more effectively. We are strengthening unity and litigating on every point to
					 win our just claims of free trade at the end of the day. In the interim we are
					 working on discussions between all levels of government, with parliamentarians
					 and government officials in the U.S., and with the solid support of Canadian
					 industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in our communications and dialogue, we are
					 speaking directly to a whole range of allies, the most important of which is
					 the American consumer and voter in the United States, to ensure their
					 government lives up to its obligations to all Canadians to ensure free trade in
					 softwood lumber.</p>

					 (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Canadian Alliance):
				  </b>

	Madam Chairman, I thank the member for Vancouver Island
					 North for the leadership he has provided on the issue of softwood lumber. It is
					 clear that on this side of the House we have consistently urged the government
					 to be proactive as we have been urging this government to take action.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to represent the softwood lumber
					 producers of not only my riding of Renfrew--Nipissing--Pembroke and eastern
					 Ontario but of all Ontario in this debate. Rural Ontario has been without a
					 voice in Ottawa since 1993. In fact, rural Canada has been under assault by
					 this government since it was elected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jobs have been disappearing at an alarming rate in
					 rural Ontario. The need to keep jobs in the lumber industry to maintain our way
					 of life is paramount. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to re-orient its priorities and
					 jump at the first sign of trouble in the same way that it jumps when the
					 presidents of large corporations, like Canada Steamship Lines and Bombardier,
					 call when looking for government assistance. The big difference is that, unlike
					 the friends of the government who are big multinational corporations looking
					 for handouts, the softwood lumber industry in my riding is characterized by
					 small operations, many family owned, and by people who are not looking for
					 handouts, just fair treatment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government's softwood lumber policy is
					 causing significant unemployment in my riding. Worried softwood lumber
					 producers call my office on a regular basis with the hope that a resolution
					 regarding this crisis can be found. Families with their principal breadwinner
					 unemployed wonder how they are going to survive the winter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rural areas jobs are hard to come by. Ben Hokum and
					 Son Ltd. in Killaloe, Murray Brothers in Madawaska, Gulick Forest Products Ltd.
					 and Thomas J. Newman Ltd. in Palmer Rapids, and Bell Lumber in Renfrew are just
					 a few of the businesses in my riding affected by this softwood lumber dispute.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear this softwood lumber crisis could have been
					 avoided. We all knew the softwood lumber agreement would expire when it did
					 last March. If the minister had been paying the slightest attention he would
					 have known that the American lumber industry was pushing for countervailing
					 duties. The government talks now of building alliances with American consumers
					 and other interested groups to fight the countervailing duty imposed on the
					 industry. This should have been done long before we hit this crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has a lousy record when dealing with a
					 crisis. Whether it be Canada's response to the terrorist attack of September 11
					 or the current crisis with softwood lumber, the government lunges leaderless in
					 every direction and the people pay the price with unemployment
					 lines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softwood lumber is big business in Ontario, exporting
					 $2 billion worth of goods annually and employing 20,000 people directly, many
					 of whom work in eastern Ontario. The gross regional income of the central and
					 eastern Ontario economy is $5 billion annually in the forestry industry alone.
					 The region employs 133,000 people. In the Ottawa valley the forest industry
					 supports nearly 4,500 jobs. That translates into 2,055 direct jobs, which is
					 19.3% of regional goods producing sector employment, over 1,000 indirect
					 regional jobs and another 1,295 indirect provincial jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary wood manufacturing is over 10 times the
					 provincial average. In actual dollars and cents our forest industry output is
					 $294 million annually. I can identify over 100 forest product companies that
					 make their home in Renfrew county.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more important in this debate over
					 softwood lumber is how it is affecting our trading relationship with the United
					 States. For value added products, the United States market is number one in
					 Ontario.</p>


	<A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1745)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half of all forest products in Ontario is
					 exported. Members will understand why we on this side of the House use the term
					 crisis when we refer to the state of the Canadian softwood lumber industry.
					 Those products have the largest export market in the United States. Exports
					 from Ontario have increased by more than 100% since 1991.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States construction industry is worth nearly
					 $700 billion U.S. every year. It will continue to be the focus of Canadian wood
					 product shipments. It is imperative that the government respect the special
					 trading relationship we have had in the past and priorize the need to resolve
					 this trade dispute.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-55341"></A><a HREF="#Int-55343"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-55337"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Andy Burton (Skeena, Canadian
					 Alliance): </b>

	Madam Chairman, I am pleased to speak to this emergency
					 debate on softwood lumber and the trade dispute between Canada and the United
					 States. This is an issue that is very near and dear to my heart and to my
					 riding of Skeena in northwestern British Columbia. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding is heavily dependent on the forest industry.
					 This is not a partisan or regional issue. British Columbia accounts for 50% of
					 Canada's annual export of softwood lumber to the U.S. at an approximate value
					 of $5 billion. One would imagine an industry that generates this much income
					 would be the top priority of any government to look after and to fight
					 for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government has shunted the issue year after
					 year. We are standing in the House of Commons once again pleading for some
					 action on the part of the government to help the logging and sawmilling
					 industries. Tens of thousands of employees across Canada go to work every day
					 uncertain if it will be their last day of employment at a particular
					 manufacturing plant or sawmill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 10 the U.S. commerce department announced a
					 19.3% penalty on Canadian lumber to counter what was ruled as subsidies given
					 to the Canadian lumber producers by the government. This is a ridiculous and
					 unconscionable level. This has been challenged three times in the past and
					 Canada has won every time. It is unfortunate that it was allowed to get to this
					 level before the government reacted in an attempt to try to resolve
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's minister of fisheries quite rightly
					 urged the government to step in and help B.C. He suggested that the federal
					 government should assist the industry by posting a customs bond to cover the
					 new tariff. He was shot down by his own government. I find that very
					 unfortunate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not just an opposition issue; it goes right
					 across Canada. How many government members are from ridings that depend on
					 lumber export? Tens of thousands and possibly hundreds of thousands of jobs are
					 involved. It is a huge issue for people across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 5 Liberal members from the Atlantic provinces
					 stood in the House and asked their minister for continued free trade of
					 softwood lumber to the U.S. They were given the same no answer that was given
					 to opposition members. The parliamentary secretary to the minister as reported
					 in <i>Hansard</i> said: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We will continue to fight for free
						  access for Atlantic softwood lumber, but in the context of free access for all
						  Canadian softwood lumber because that is supposed to be the agreement. Alan
						  Greenspan, chair of the federal reserve, yesterday cautioned against
						  protectionism on softwood lumber and everything else.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We totally agree with that but that was six months ago.
					 We are now into October and we still have no resolution of the issue. Free
					 access is required, demanded and needed. We urge the government to achieve that
					 immediately. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government had no problem stepping into the trade
					 dispute with Brazil over aircraft. If the lumber industry had closer ties to
					 the Prime Minister's Office it may have been afforded the same consideration as
					 Bombardier. I do not know but possibly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Byrd amendment has been suspended. It was a
					 ridiculous amendment that put our lumber producers in the position of
					 subsidizing their competition. It was absolutely ludicrous. It should never
					 have been in place, but that is out of our control.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is not the only country that is challenging the
					 legislation. We have challenged it in the past and we will win. However time
					 goes on. In the meantime the industry and families are suffering. People are
					 losing their homes. It is a very difficult situation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A growing number of Canadian lumber producers are being
					 bought or have been bought out by companies owned and operated in the U.S. The
					 countervail issue has depressed Canadian forest company stocks while U.S.
					 companies grow and possibly are in a better position to take over these
					 Canadian companies with 50 cent dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows what the ultimate result of that will be in
					 the future? That trend is out there. U.S. consumer groups such as Home Depot
					 and the coalition for affordable housing are on side with Canadian producers as
					 they see the cost of lumber rising. There is a great deal of support out there
					 for our industry. We need to continue to build on that support. The government
					 needs to continue working on it and push as hard as it possibly can.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator Baucus has asked for an anti-dumping case that
					 would put an export tax on top of the CVD. It would mean a double tax when
					 markets are soft. This is not acceptable or sustainable by the industry. We
					 need to work toward more open borders to be able to trade our goods back and
					 forth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also raises the issue of the perimeter safety
					 network that has been talked about and pushes the issue a bit harder. We need
					 to consider that in terms of free trade to make sure our borders remain open to
					 our goods without undue delays.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the option for stumpage changes. This
					 would mean that Canadian provinces would have to change the way they sell their
					 standing timber. This could be impractical or even impossible. It is hard to
					 say. However these things are being worked on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British Columbia is looking at putting in a market
					 based stumpage system down the road that may possibly help the
					 situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a company in my riding called Skeena Cellulose
					 that was in serious trouble prior to the softwood lumber tariff. The wood
					 profile in that part of British Columbia is 70% to 80% pulpwood. The small
					 volume of saw logs and lumber that is produced has to be produced economically
					 to subsidize the cost of logging the pulp logs which have to be removed as
					 well. This countervail duty makes it that much more difficult.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sent a letter to the Prime Minister and the minister
					 in August requesting some responses as to where the situation might be. I have
					 yet to receive a reply. I would appreciate a reply, as would people in my
					 riding in northern British Columbia, as to the status of the ongoing talks as
					 soon as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go back to a statement I made in the House on April
					 3. The government was about to host the summit of the Americas where the topic
					 of discussion was the free trade area of the Americas. Today there is talk
					 about a free trade agreement between Costa Rica and Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worry as to what will come of it when we have not
					 even sorted out a dispute that is hanging over our heads with our closest
					 trading partner and friends in the United States. I look forward to a quick
					 resolution of this terrible situation on behalf of not only the people of
					 Skeena but the people of Canada.</p>

					 Environment, Lib.): </b>

	Madam Chairman, I take my place in the debate as senior
					 federal minister responsible for the province of British Columbia because of
					 the importance of the forestry industry to the economy of my home province. The
					 forestry sector's contribution to provincial tax revenues is nearly equivalent
					 to the provincial government's entire expenditure on all education costs from
					 kindergarten to grade 12. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forestry activity affects 14% of the workforce in
					 British Columbia. Fourteen per cent of British Columbians are employed directly
					 or indirectly in the forest industry. The industry is worth some $17 billion to
					 British Columbia's gross domestic product.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding the GVRD, the forestry industry dominates the
					 economies of more than half the communities of British Columbia, possibly even
					 two-thirds. In many such communities forestry accounts for 50% of the economy.
					 In the greater Vancouver area alone forestry makes a substantial contribution
					 in terms of 120,000 direct and indirect jobs. It is a critical issue throughout
					 the province.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In British Columbia we have 850 mills, many of which
					 are closed. We have 47% of the total Canadian exports of softwood lumber. Some
					 16,000 people have been directly laid off since the United States imposed a
					 19.31% duty on softwood lumber on August 9. The importance of softwood lumber
					 to British Columbia cannot be exaggerated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal briefly with the previous speeches and move
					 on to what has been done. I was deeply disappointed by the speech of the Leader
					 of the Opposition. He represents a British Columbia constituency. If he wishes
					 to come from Alberta to British Columbia and represent the people of the
					 province he should take his responsibilities as a British Columbia elected
					 official seriously. I was deeply offended by statements which set one region
					 against another by suggesting if this had happened in the heartland of Canada
					 the government would have acted instead of doing nothing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comments of the hon. member who preceded the last
					 member were similar. Indeed the previous speaker made the comment that if there
					 were closer ties with the Prime Minister's Office something would have been
					 done. The effort to smear hon. members of the House and suggest the issue is
					 being ignored because of its regional importance in British Columbia is
					 despicable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Leader of the Opposition has not asked a
					 question in the House on softwood lumber since April 23 of this year. Yet he
					 spent the entire time since we returned to the House in September on a wild spy
					 chase. He has gone into every part of the country desperately trying to find a
					 connection between security in the United States and possible errors of
					 Canadian officials. He spends his time doing that while the softwood lumber
					 problem has become worse because of the actions of the United States.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should be ashamed of that type of approach. As a
					 British Columbia member he should be ashamed. It is clear why so many of his
					 members have decided his leadership is something they can no longer
					 tolerate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada should take a united front on the softwood
					 lumber issue. I congratulate the premier of British Columbia, Gordon Campbell.
					 I congratulate the minister of forestry for British Columbia, Mike de Jong. I
					 congratulate the industry in British Columbia. I congratulate the Minister for
					 International Trade who has done a splendid job representing Canada on this
					 file.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The type of performance we have had from the official
					 opposition is simply not good enough. It has been pounced on with glee by our
					 opponents in the American softwood lumber industry as an example of how we in
					 Canada do not have a united front and how we can continue to be horsed around
					 by the types of actions that have taken place over the last few months.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the hon. member for Vancouver Island North
					 who proposed the motion is sincere in his concern for the industry, unlike the
					 hon. Leader of the Opposition. Let us look at the opposition leader's
					 performance on the issue. He has not asked a question about it in the House
					 since April. Yet he comes in here and criticizes my colleague the hon. Minister
					 for International Trade. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has been working on this file day after
					 day, week after week and weekend after weekend in contrast to the absolute
					 absence of activity by the Leader of the Opposition. The opposition leader's
					 critical remarks suggesting this is somehow a regional issue are thoroughly
					 improper. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is my view of the approach taken by the hon.
					 Leader of the Opposition. I do not know how long he will remain here or how
					 long the members who have spoken will continue supporting him. However if he
					 keeps this up the people of British Columbia will reject him firmly and
					 clearly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the approach taken by the Canadian government, we
					 will continue to fight this U.S. trade action wherever we can. We are willing
					 to discuss with the United States, not negotiate but discuss, any aspect of the
					 issue it wishes to discuss with us. We want a long term and durable solution
					 that avoids litigation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to mobilize U.S. consumer groups to
					 increase advocacy efforts in the United States. We will continue to defend our
					 industry wherever we can. We will fight in every legal venue available although
					 our preference is not to get involved in litigation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has kept on this file time after
					 time not just with President Bush but with his predecessor President Clinton.
					 The Minister for International Trade has done exactly the same thing with his
					 counterparts in both the Bush and Clinton administrations. Thanks to their
					 efforts the U.S. is fully aware of our concerns. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have every reason to believe the imposition of the
					 19.3% duty on Canadian softwood lumber is unfair, punitive and wrong.
					 Furthermore, it fails to meet the standards of the World Trade Organization the
					 United States alleges it adheres to. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to impose duties on the entered value and
					 not the first mill value is contrary to longstanding U.S. practices and adds
					 yet another unfair burden on our Canadian producers. We will continue to press
					 on behalf of our remanufacturers at every forum and in every way to get back to
					 the first mill value. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We categorically reject as having no basis in fact or
					 law the decisions of the U.S. department of commerce that Canadian softwood
					 lumber exports to the United States are subsidized by provincial and federal
					 programs. We have gone into the issue time after time. We have won every time,
					 but the United States in a protectionist move has changed or varied the rules
					 so it could come back at us yet again. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be challenging the United States contention
					 regarding stumpage and every other practice of our provincial governments. We
					 will be doing so in the United States and before the WTO. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have suggested there should be short term bridging
					 solutions such as an export charge. There is no consensus for such a measure
					 among provinces and industry because it would not get to the root of the
					 problem.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Chairman, the umbrage and bombast from the
					 minister on the other side is certainly inappropriate and highly offensive. For
					 him to use this occasion on a very serious debate to attack the Leader of the
					 Opposition is rather outrageous. In fact the patronage of his party has been
					 well known.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might stay for just a minute to hear that in my
					 riding in British Columbia, we had arts and culture week in March. People
					 wanted to know why, when $76 per head is the national per capita given for arts
					 and culture, Quebec got 147%, Ontario got 107% and British Columbia received
					 34% of those dollars. The comments made earlier do in fact have a basis. It is
					 a pity that the minister tried to cover for this with umbrage and
					 accusation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of my constituents, mill workers and industry
					 workers who are suffering in British Columbia, I am pleased to enter this
					 softwood lumber debate. I will say right off the bat that this is hurting
					 people in my riding. Since we have been here the past few weeks, hundreds of
					 workers have been idle in my riding of Nanaimo--Alberni. We have saw eight
					 mills close in Port Alberni over the last number of years. Of 1,025 mill
					 workers employed just a few months ago, there are now only 200
					 working.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Port Alberni there were 950 loggers gainfully
					 employed and now there are 185. Right now communities in my riding are hurting.
					 They are sitting idle wondering when or if they will get back to work because
					 of the situation that has arisen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem has roots stretching back many years and
					 the government has been inactive on this file. It should not have been
					 surprised by it. We have had five years to prepare for this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed earlier the minister said that the government
					 was waiting to see what the U.S. would do. Of course we know that the old
					 softwood lumber agreement expired in March and we saw what the U.S. did. It
					 immediately responded with a 19.2% tariff.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having seen that, mill workers in my riding want to
					 know why Canada did not do anything. Why did it not have a plan ready to take
					 action? Many people in my riding would like to know why the government does not
					 step up to the plate and take action to get our mill workers back to work. It
					 is time to offer some leadership and it is time to get behind the
					 industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the suggestions put forward was the issue of
					 bonding. If our mills are going to be allowed to export into the United States,
					 the regulation by the department of commerce and customs requires that they
					 have to put up a bond immediately. People in my riding want to know why the
					 government has not stepped up to at least help the companies put those bonds in
					 place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonding issue for the big companies is perhaps
					 something that can be negotiated with banks regarding loans, but many of the
					 smaller companies are simply not in the position to deal with that. They do not
					 have the capital base and many of the marginally profitable smaller producers
					 may be pushed over the edge. Jobs will be lost and families will
					 suffer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote Rick Doman, the CEO of Doman Forest
					 Products, one of the largest employers in my riding. He said the bonding
					 guarantee is an important issue. This was stated in the Victoria <i>Times
					 Colonist</i> August 25. Mr. Doman stated:</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to know why the government has not
					 stepped up to the plate to help our industry in this manner is an
					 issue?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have suffered because of the inaction of the
					 government on other issues: the farm crisis; leaky condos in British Columbia;
					 continued high debt and high taxes; the immigration crisis; the low dollar; and
					 the decaying military response and ability. It is time to demonstrate some
					 leadership in this area.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bonding issue, the Minister of Fisheries and
					 Oceans was quick to come to the plate in Vancouver shortly after the tariff was
					 announced. I will quote him from the Vancouver <i>Sun</i>. He said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>A loan guarantee financed by the
						  federal and provincial governments could help firms avoid insolvency while
						  Canada fights the duty before international tribunals.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our mill workers and mills cannot afford to wait one
					 and a half years or two years for the WTO process to work its way
					 through.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard the umbrage expressed by the minister over
					 allegations that the government is much quicker to step up to the plate on
					 behalf of industries in other parts of the country. People in my riding watched
					 the Bombardier-Embraer events unfold. The government stepped up to the plate to
					 support an industry in another province. It even offered low interest loans to
					 American firms to secure purchase of regional aircraft. Those people want to
					 know why the government cannot step up to the plate to offer some temporary
					 support to keep our mills open and our workers working while we work through
					 the dispute resolution process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we have not seen action that has been
					 helpful to our members at the present time. Believe me, people are hurting,
					 families are suffering and many people are wondering whether they will have a
					 job to go back to.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House recently received a letter from
						a U.S. senator suggesting that we sit down and negotiate a settlement. Reaching
						compromises is appropriate at times but in this case we do not need to
						compromise. We have a binding agreement but we need some support to get through
						this dispute mechanism which is already in place with the World Trade
						Organization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will win the argument with the WTO but what will
						  our mill workers do?</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I questioned the Minister of National
					 Defence on May 8 with respect to the position that the Government of Canada
					 speaking on behalf of the people of Canada would take on the proposed national
					 missile defence scheme being advocated by President George Bush. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urged the Canadian government to get off the fence,
						to take a clear stand and to join with the majority of Canadians who strongly
						opposed this missile defence scheme. This is a dangerous new escalation of the
						arms race.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the most recent poll 58% of Canadians opposed the
						proposed anti-ballistic missile system that is presently before the United
						States congress. That was in May and we are now in October and still waiting
						for the Canadian government to take a stand on the issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all look at the impact of the terrorist attack
						  of September 11 and ask ourselves whether this has had an impact on the
						  American proposals for missile defence. Tragically it would appear that it
						  has.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the casualties of September 11 was the
						  democratic senators' resistance to missile defence. Prior to September 11
						  democrats on Capitol Hill indicated that they were prepared to trim back the
						  $8.3 billion first year missile shield program and place tight restrictions on
						  testing and development. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately that opposition appears to have
							 collapsed and the scheme is now proceeding. Those who would benefit are the
							 global arms merchants like Boeing, Lougheed Martin, Raytheon and TRW. They are
							 eagerly anticipating the possibility that they might get their hands on some of
							 the $60 billion that the U.S. government intends to spend on this dangerous
							 escalation of the arms race.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Foreign Affairs indicated that he
							 was opposed to the creation of weapons in space. Canadians also share that
							 opposition. Yet it is very clear that the U.S. missile defence scheme would
							 lead to the creation of weapons in space. United States senior air force
							 officials have made very clear that is their intent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on the Canadian government to speak out
								on behalf of Canadians against this escalation of the arms race that would lead
								to the creation of weapons in space and lead to the possible abrogation of
								Start I and Start II treaties. Russian President Putin has made that very
								clear. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sanctions on Pakistan have been lifted in
								the aftermath of September 11. That is a matter of deep concern. Prior to
								September 11 the United States government indicated that it was prepared to
								accept an escalation of China's nuclear missile program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not acceptable that Canadians, along with
								people from around the world, should be charged with peaceful and non-violent
								protests. Guy Levacher from Montreal was charged in July when he protested this
								action peacefully and non-violently.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appeal to the government to speak out on
								  behalf of Canadians and tell our friends in the United States to stop this
								  madness and instead work toward the abolition of all nuclear weapons on the
								  planet.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, the Canadian government has not been
					 asked by the United States to participate in a BMD system. What is more, we
					 cannot very well make a decision for or against BMD without first knowing what
					 the system will look like, how much it will cost, where it will fit into and
					 how it will affect the global security framework. The Government of Canada is
					 keeping an open mind about the proposed U.S. ballistic missile defence system
					 and has not taken a position for or against it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ballistic missile defence has the potential to play a
						positive role in global security without jeopardizing arms control and
						disarmament. However, the outcome will depend largely on how missile defence is
						pursued. We are continuing to assess the U.S. plans for a missile defence
						system as they emerge and to consult closely with our allies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Canadian decision will be taken only after an
						analysis of the new global security framework into which the U.S. would fit a
						BMD system and a comprehensive review of the implications for Canada. In line
						with Canada's defence policy, and without prejudicing any future decisions on
						BMD, the government continues to examine the issue of ballistic missile defence
						and the details of the U.S. system as they develop. The American proposal does
						not yet include a timetable for deployment or specific details about the
						architecture of the system. U.S. officials have made it very clear that Canada
						will be consulted on the issues affecting our longstanding defence partnership,
						including NORAD.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pleased with the U.S. intent to reduce its
						  nuclear arsenal and welcome the American commitment to consult with China and
						  Russia on ballistic missile defence. The government has a longstanding
						  tradition of consulting parliamentarians on major foreign and defence policy
						  issues. At the moment, and in line with the 1994 defence white paper, Canadian
						  participation in ballistic missile defence is limited to research and
						  consultation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I am out of time, but let me say that there
						  has been no Canadian decision made with regard to BMD and our efforts remain
						  within the perimeters of current Canadian policy.</p>
