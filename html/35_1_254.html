	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (for the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services)</B> moved that Bill C-108, an act to amend the 
National Housing Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to move that Bill C-108, an act to amend the National Housing 
Act, be read a second time and referred to committee.
<P>
	This is an administrative bill whose purpose is to increase the 
ceiling of mortgage loan insurance under the National Housing 
Act. This will enable CMHC to continue underwriting home 
mortgage loan insurance within the legislative limit. Bill C-108 
will increase the existing limit on outstanding loan insurance from 
the current $100 billion to $150 billion. The bill also includes a 
provision to increase the ceiling further through appropriation in 
the future.
<P>
	Members of the House should know that CMHC loan insurance 
is self-financing and self-sustaining and does not cost the 
government anything. The mortgage insurance fund is regularly 
evaluated according to rigorous insurance principles and is fully 
adequate to cover all insured losses as well as overhead.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	While the amendments contained in this bill represent 
administrative matters, passage of this bill is essential to the 
continued operation of CMHC's Mortgage Loan Insurance. Allow 
me to take a minute to explain why this bill is important to 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The desire to own a home remains very strong among Canadians. 
Yet many people who can afford the monthly mortgage payments 
are still unable to access home  ownership because they find it 
difficult to save for a down payment for a conventional loan.
<P>
	With mortgage loan insurance, home buyers can secure up to 95 
per cent financing with a lender because CMHC insures the 
mortgage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Because CMHC assumes the risk of borrowers defaulting, 
mortgage lenders are able to supply more mortgages to Canadians. 
By reducing the down payment required to purchase a home, the 
Mortgage Loan Insurance Program makes home ownership more 
accessible to moderate income households.
<P>
	It is a vital component of ensuring that all Canadians, regardless 
of where they live, have equal access to mortgage funds needed to 
acquire decent, affordable housing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me give you an idea of the extent to which Canadians depend 
on mortgage loan insurance in order to fulfil their dream of owning 
a home. Mortgage loan insurance has allowed many people to 
become homeowners, some who would not otherwise have been 
able to buy, others who would have been able to make their 
purchase sooner because of the lower down payment.
<P>
	In 1994 alone, CMHC mortgage loan insurance helped to house 
over 300,000 Canadian families at no cost to the government.
<P>
	My colleagues will also be interested to learn that this means 
that approximately 40 per cent of the residential mortgage stock in 
Canada has involved financing by CMHC mortgage insurance last 
year. Without mortgage loan insurance, Canadians who do not have 
a 25 per cent down payment would generally never have access to 
home ownership.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	CMHC Mortgage Loan Insurance has demonstrated the 
flexibility to facilitate innovation in housing finance. This is a 
critical feature, given that the needs of mortgage borrowers, and 
the market within which these needs are met, are constantly 
evolving. In 1987, the program was improved to allow for the 
insuring of second mortgages, an innovation that has been 
particularly helpful to people who need additional money for 
renovation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16178"> 16178 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the following year, the chattel loan insurance program was 
introduced as a five-year experiment to cover loans made on 
mobile homes and to help people who choose this kind of 
affordable home ownership. This coverage for mobile homes has 
now been made a regular part of the mortgage insurance program 
as per the announcement made by the the minister responsible for 
CMHC at the beginning of this year.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	In 1992 the mortgage insurance program was expanded to 
accommodate the reduced down payment for first time home 
buyers making home ownership even more accessible to moderate 
income households.
<P>
	This program, called First Home Loan Insurance, has provided 
Canadians with their entry point to home ownership. May I 
reiterate to my hon. colleagues that the success of this initiative has 
been achieved without any cost to the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We want to ensure that CHMC can continue to provide that kind 
of market support in the future. That is why this legislation is 
before the House today. CHMC is continually reviewing the 
Mortgage Loan Insurance Program and regularly introduces 
changes to make it more effective and more convenient for both 
approved lenders and home buyers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	By exploring new housing finance options for Canadians we are 
looking to promote greater choices, lower the costs, increase the

	CHMC will continue to encourage innovation and creativity in 
housing finance through the Mortgage Insurance Fund to promote 
greater access to housing markets for the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Besides helping Canadians to become homeowners, CMHC 
mortgage insurance has been key to the health of the housing 
industry in Canada. By fully protecting approved lenders against 
default on the part of the borrower, mortgage insurance encourages 
investment in residential construction.
<P>
	The federal government, through CMHC, has been providing 
national mortgage insurance for four decades. CMHC has remained 
a significant player throughout this time with a mandate from the 
federal government to provide mortgage insurance to support loans 
to all Canadian home buyers regardless of where they live in 
Canada at the smallest feasible down payment and the lowest 
feasible cost.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today, the private housing market is able to meet the housing 
needs of the vast majority of Canadian households. There is no 
doubt that CHMC's Mortgage Loan Insurance has played a critical 
role in that achievement. CHMC's Mortgage Insurance Program 
experienced a record year in 1994 in terms of volume. A number of 
unexpected factors led to the significant increases in activity last 
year. Mortgage rates dropped to their lowest levels in 30 years, 
much lower than anticipated. Low inflation has kept house prices 
stable and more affordable.
<P>
	As well, the rapid and continued success of housing stimulation 
policies, including the First Home Loan Insurance Program and the 
RRSP Home Buyers' Plan, contributed to record volumes of 
insurance activity last year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When the Mortgage Insurance Company of Canada stopped 
underwriting new mortgage insurance business in April 1993, 
CMHC had to assume 100 per cent of residential mortgage 
insurance activity. Furthermore, a greater proportion of all 
mortgages have been insured by CMHC in recent years.
<P>
	In 1994, CMHC insured 40 per cent of all residential mortgages 
initiated, up from 22 per cent in 1991. Because there is some lag 
time between insurance loans and receiving the reports from the 
approved lenders, it was only in 1995 that all the figures for 1994 
were compiled. At that time it was realized that the $100 billion 
maximum aggregate loan insurance currently stipulated in the 
National Housing Act had been exceeded. For this reason the 
provisions of this bill are effective starting 1994. I hope members 
of the House will see fit to give swift passage to Bill C-108 so that 
CMHC can continue to promote access to home ownership through 
mortgage loan insurance.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	As I have stated and as my colleagues are aware, the purpose of 
the bill is to increase the maximum aggregate mortgage loan 
insurance. This will enable CMHC to continue underwriting home 
mortgage loan insurance within the legislative limit. Considering 
the housing sector's importance to the well-being of the nation, 
CMHC is committed to a stable supply of housing that increases 
economic and social opportunities for all Canadians.
<P>
	With CMHC's mortgage loan insurance program qualifying 
home buyers anywhere in Canada can secure up to 95 per cent of 
home financing with an approved lender. Mortgage insurance 
through CMHC also provides a means of introducing guarantees 
for innovative mortgage products to benefit consumers, for 
example mortgage backed securities which increase the pool of 
funds available for mortgages and competitive rates.

	The corporation continues to develop new initiatives and adapt 
existing ones to meet the challenges of housing Canadians 
adequately into the new millennium. Among the new initiatives 
being examined are alternative financing mechanisms for homes 
such as reverse annuity mortgages and shared equity financing.
<P>
	CMHC has a role to play in helping Canadians to access decent 
affordable housing. CMHC continues to provide social housing 
assistance to support more than 661,000 existing units that house 
over one million low income Canadians whose housing needs 
cannot be met through the housing market. This housing assists 
some of the most disadvantaged members of our society including 
seniors on fixed incomes, aboriginal people, persons with 
disabilities, single parent led families, social assistance recipients 
and the working poor.
<P>
	To solve today's housing problems and define tomorrow's 
housing needs CMHC is involved in research and development 
both independently and with industry and government partners. 
CMHC's research into sustainable development, quality of life, 
housing technology and building science promotes good living 
environments that are safe, healthy and sustainable. As well 
CMHC is helping the Canadian housing industry to promote the 
Canadian housing system abroad by helping to develop housing 
export strategies to assist the Canadian housing industry to market 
Canadian housing technology, products and services in world 
markets.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Through its Mortgage Loan Insurance Program, CHMC 
continues to make housing more accessible for Canadians. The 
Corporation is also working to improve housing affordability.
<P>
	The federal government through CHMC is committed to a stable 
supply of affordable and accessible housing that increases 
economic opportunities for all Canadians. CHMC's market 
housing programs promote affordable housing and equal access to 
financing through financial instruments such as mortgage loan 
insurance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Moreover, CMHC provides mortgage insurance to all Canadians 
regardless of where they live in Canada at the smallest feasible 
down payment and at lower cost. To improve access to an 
affordable form of housing CMHC also provides mortgage 
insurance for manufactured housing, for example mobile homes. In 
January 1995 the minister of public works recently announced an 
expanded chattel loan interest program that includes resale of 
manufactured housing units.
<P>
	CMHC also helps to ensure Canadians are well housed by 
pursuing and encouraging housing innovation and by developing 
national housing policies in concert with provincial and territorial 
partners, the housing industry and non-profit groups.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One important way CMHC levers the efforts of its partners in 
Canada's housing sector is CMHC's Canadian Centre for 
Public-Private Partnership in Housing. The Centre acts as a catalyst 
and a source of expert advice.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	It brings together the public and private sectors, non-profit 
organizations and private citizens to develop low to moderate 
income housing projects without the need for government 
subsidies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	CMHC is also contributing to making housing more affordable 
through better housing regulations. The affordability and choice 
today program funded by CMHC encourages regulatory innovation 
in municipalities across Canada. The ACT program encourages the 
housing industry and municipalities to work in partnership to 
improve housing affordability and choice. More than 80 ACT 
projects are developing a wide range of practical approaches to 
streamlining approval processes, developing new forms of 
affordable housing, facilitating infill and conversion, and adopting 
alternative development and building standards.
<P>
	As I have said Bill C-108 is an administrative bill. As my 
colleagues know, the bill is crucial to ensuring that CMHC can 
continue to offer mortgage loan insurance to Canadians. Through 
its mortgage insurance activities CMHC has been responsible for 
helping many Canadians become homeowners and we want to 
ensure that it can continue to do that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to take a few minutes to talk about a complementary 
initiative, First Home Loan Insurance, introduced by CMHC in 
February 1992, to make home ownership even more accessible for 
first time home buyers. Earlier this year, the Hon. David Dingwall 
announced that the maximum eligible house prices for First Home 
Loan Insurance were increased in 30 communities across the 
country.
<P>
	This initiative allows more first time homebuyers to purchase a 
home with a down payment of as little as five per cent. Anyone 
who buys or builds a home in Canada as their principal residence is 
eligible for the lower down payment, as long as they have not 
owned a home at any time during the last five years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First home loan insurance was initially in effect for a two-year 
period but was extended for an additional five years until 1999.
<P>
	The 5 per cent down initiative has been a major success in 
helping to increase home ownership in Canada. Thanks to the 
reduced down payment home ownership has moved from a dream 
to a reality for the many  Canadians who can afford monthly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16180"> 16180 </A></B>
<P>
mortgage payments but are having trouble saving for the down 
payment.
<P>
	The statistics speak for themselves. Since November 1993 over 
210,000 Canadian households have taken advantage of the lower 
down payment to become the proud owners of either a new or 
existing home. In April 1994 a survey of Canadians who bought 
homes with less than 10 per cent down showed that 72 per cent of 
them would not have been able to purchase their homes when they 
did without the reduced down payment.
<P>
	The first home loan insurance initiative is constantly being 
monitored to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of 
Canadians. CMHC is committed to helping Canadians who desire 
to own a home and have the proven financial management 
capability to do so.
<P>
	First home loan insurance is an excellent example of CMHC's 
ability to adapt its mortgage loan insurance activity to ensure that 
Canadians can enjoy the benefits of home ownership.
<P>
	Allow me to speak on the importance of Bill C-108 by 
describing an initiative of CMHC which has as its foundation the 
flexible use of the mortgage insurance fund. I am referring to the 
Canadian Centre for Public-Private Partnerships in Housing which 
I mentioned earlier. Allow me to take a moment to provide the 
House with some details about the important work being 
undertaken here.
<P>
	The partnership centre was established by CMHC in 1991.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Its objective is to bridge the public and private sectors to 
facilitate the production of cost-effective and accessible housing 
for low to moderate income households, including those with 
special needs. The centre ventures into new areas through such 
means as innovative financing and tenure arrangements.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Much of the centre's activities are accomplished at the grassroot 
level with a view to encouraging a wide variety of people active in 
their community to become involved in newly created housing 
partnerships.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The partnership centre identifies opportunities and brings 
together potential partners to develop and implement 
public-private partnerships. It acts as a source of best advice by 
offering an advisory service to potential partners to identify the key 
legal, financial and regulatory issues that need to be considered in 
structuring a deal.
<P>
	Since its inception the centre has ventured into innovative tenure 
arrangements such as occupancy rights, life leases, equity co-ops, 
as well as a home ownership equity partnership program. As at the 
end of June of this  year the centre had facilitated the realization of 
79 projects totalling in excess of 4,200 housing units.
<P>
	Allow me to take a minute to outline a few innovative projects 
that have been made possible by CMHC's Canadian Centre for 
Public-Private Partnerships in Housing.
<P>
	Vancouver's Khatsahlano Equity Housing Co-operative offers 
affordable housing for families. Equity co-operatives are ongoing 
housing co-ops that are financed entirely or partly from the 
investment of their members.
<P>
	Traditionally aimed at seniors, they are now becoming an 
affordable housing alternative for a growing number of Canadians. 
This project demonstrates that it is possible to provide families 
with affordable housing options in a market where starter homes 
are very expensive.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Two non-profit groups in the province of Quebec, both dedicated 
to helping people with psychiatric and developmental handicaps, 
are buying and renovating houses and will run them as group 
homes. In Montreal, Centre de crise ``Le Transit'' is purchasing a 
house in a mixed residential downtown neighbourhood to 
accommodate eight adult residents referred to them by city-run and 
charitable social services agencies.
<P>
	A similar project in Granby will house 12 residents in a triplex 
being purchased by L'Autre Versant Inc., a local non-profit group 
organized five years ago to provide homes for people with 
psychiatric and development handicaps. Both these projects are 
being made possible thanks to CMHC-insured mortgage loans 
supported by the Partnership Centre.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Clearly CMHC's partnership centre and its innovative uses of 
mortgage insurance are making great strides in increasing the 
supply of affordable housing for low to moderate income 
Canadians including those with special needs.
<P>
	As I have stated before, Bill C-108 is an administrative bill to 
facilitate the continuation of mortgage loan insurance under the 
National Housing Act. As my colleagues well know, CMHC has an 
important role to play in helping Canadians gain access to home 
ownership.
<P>
	CMHC's mortgage loan insurance with its mandate to provide 
equal access to Canadians throughout the country is important to 
achieving that goal.
<P>
	CMHC has a unique role of ensuring equal access to Canadians 
throughout the country. This is one of the major factors that 
distinguishes CMHC's operation from mortgage loan insurance 
operations. Without CMHC's commitment to provide mortgage 
loan insurance in the small communities of the country, places that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16181"> 16181 </A></B>
<P>
private insurers have not traditionally wanted to serve, many 
Canadians might not be able to buy homes.
<P>
	Let me illustrate how important CMHC loan insurance is to 
Canadians in small communities. Take for example CMHC loan 
insurance activity in the municipality of Brooks, Alberta, with a 
population of 10,000. In 1994, 137 households were able to access 
home ownership thanks to CMHC's mortgage loan insurance.
<P>
	This year, as of September 30, 153 households became proud 
homeowners, again thanks to CMHC. Make no mistake about it, if 
CMHC were not in the mortgage loan insurance business these 290 
families in Brooks, Alberta, might not have been able to buy their 
homes. I would further like to point out that these 290 households 
represent 83 per cent of the total number of 349 households who 
bought homes in Brooks, Alberta, during that period.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government knows just how much Canadians value home 
ownership. It represents a major portion of wealth accumulated by 
households. For some it is a source of retirement income. It is also 
an important component of quality of life.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We believe that every Canadian should have access to home 
ownership. CMHC mortgage loan insurance can turn the dream of 
owning a home into a reality. It is therefore critical that CMHC be 
able to continue to provide mortgage loan insurance to Canadians 
now and in the future. This is why I support Bill C-108.
<P>
	I hope my colleagues will see fit to give swift passage to this 
administrative bill so that CMHC can continue to help Canadians 
realize their dream of owning a home.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Good 
morning, Mr. Speaker. We will, of course, support the bill 
introduced by the parliamentary secretary since we agree with what 
it proposes to do, which is to increase the aggregate amount of 
loans that may be approved by the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation to $150 billion, but the fact remains that it all seems 
very unsatisfactory.
<P>
	We must admit that, at the very least, there is something 
embarrassing, disturbing and unsatisfactory about the fact that we 
have before us a bill that reminds us that the federal government's 
involvement in the housing sector, through this flimsy vehicle, the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, consists exclusively 
of loan guarantees.
<P>
	We must not forget it has been some years-in fact, since 1989 
but even more so since 1992-since the federal government 
withdrew altogether from the construction  of social housing. 
Remember this: It completely withdrew from this sector, and I 
intend to give chapter and verse later on. There is something here 
that arouses a sense of outrage and indignation-and I hope the 
parliamentary secretary, who I know is sensitive to these issues, 
will share my sense of outrage and indignation-when we see that 
the federal government, with all the resources at its disposal, has 
nothing to offer except loan guarantees through the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Meanwhile, it has withdrawn 
from the construction of social housing, it completely abolished its 
co-operative housing policy in 1992, which the Liberals had 
promised to reinstate, and plays no role at all in housing 
renovation.
<P>
	We have a definite problem with this. And anyone in this House 
who has a social conscience must feel the same. As for amending 
the National Housing Act and having a debate on housing, what are 
we entitled to expect from the government? We have a Liberal 
government that does not believe that poverty is acceptable, that 
believes that being a Liberal means embracing the philosophy of 
liberalism. Embracing this philosophy means believing that the 
state has a role to play in putting an end to the disparities in our 
society.
<P>
	I know the parliamentary secretary agrees with me. As the 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, I am disappointed. And if 
the hon. member does not agree with the substance of what I am 
saying, I am sure that by the end of my speech he will have changed 
his mind.
<P>
	The issue is one that concerns me, as the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and as a former member of the board of 
a technical resources group that examined these issues. I have been 
involved in housing issues since I was 20, and I am now 33, 
although I may not look it. The fact remains that I have been 
involved in the housing sector for nearly 13 years. And I am 
shocked that this government has nothing to offer in the way of 
social housing.
<P>
	It is particularly shocking this morning, when we are asked to 
discuss the role of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
at a time when poverty, both in Canada and Quebec, is more 
widespread than ever before. This is serious.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	As members of Parliament, we all represent ridings, and when it 
comes down to it, we all want to work for the people who elected 
us. We all know that housing, the right to have a decent roof over 
your head at a decent price, is something that is central to people's 
lives.
<P>
	The debate this morning comes at a time when there is more 
poverty than ever before. Mr. Speaker, let me quote a few figures. 
When we talk about poverty, we should remember that in Quebec, 
to give you a very specific example-or perhaps we should look at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16182"> 16182 </A></B>
<P>
the situation in Canada as a whole, where the poverty rate is  now 
17.4 per cent. So what does poverty mean? Poverty is when a 
household has to spend more than 55 per cent of its income on three 
basic items: rent, food and clothing.
<P>
	We live in a society where poverty is more widespread than ever 
before. And since we live in this society, we have every right to 
expect the Liberal government to be a little more enterprising, to 
come up with a proposal this morning that is more intelligent and 
more pro-active than approving loan guarantees, since even the 
parliamentary secretary admitted this did not represent any 
additional cost to the public purse. The parliamentary secretary was 
very frank at the beginning of his speech when he said this was a 
program, a loan guarantee that was self-financing and did not cost 
the treasury a cent.
<P>
	Is the parliamentary secretary satisfied? Does he approve of the 
fact that his government, considering its responsibilities at a time 
when more people are poor than ever before, when, according to 
Statistics Canada, we have never been so short of housing? When 
the parliamentary secretary goes to bed tonight with his beloved, 
will he be pleased that his government has nothing to offer but a 
loan guarantee which puts no strain on the public purse?
<P>
	That does not satisfy me. I do not think that it is politically 
defensible. So 17.4 per cent of Canadian households are classified 
as poor. This means that 17.4 per cent of the population belongs to 
a household which spends 55 per cent or more of its income on the 
three basic items.
<P>
	I know we are just coming out of a referendum campaign, and 
that events in the months to come will mean that the issue is not 
totally closed, but speaking as a levelheaded, rational man-two 
qualities which I think the parliamentary secretary will agree 
describe my character-I feel that, when evaluating federalism, it 
is our duty to recall that Quebec, as we speak, is the province with 
the highest rate of poverty.
<P>
	As we speak, Quebec has the highest number of poor households 
of anywhere in Canada. If the parliamentary secretary is sceptical, I 
can provide figures. The most recent figures available are for 1993: 
Newfoundland, 17.7 per cent of households; P.E.I., 9.9 per cent; 
Nova Scotia, 5.5 per cent; New Brunswick, 14.5 per cent; Quebec, 
20.7 per cent.
<P>
	This means that 20 out of every 100 households belong to people 
who are among the poorest in Canada. This is the reality the federal 
regime has inflicted upon us. And this is not a mindset, a political 
pipedream, but something confirmed by Statistics Canada.
<P>
	So the figure in Quebec is 20.7 per cent; in Ontario: 15.6 per 
cent; in Manitoba, 18.1 per cent; in Saskatchewan, 17 per cent; in 
Alberta, 17.6 per cent. In a context where Quebec has the highest 
number of poor households, in a context where we are aware of the  
importance of housing in balancing individuals' and families' 
budgets, we find ourselves faced with a government that has 
nothing to propose except the addition of a measure like any other 
government action relating to shelter, a loan guarantee. One that 
they have the gall to describe as not requiring anything from the 
government, from the public purse, because it is self-sustaining.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	As the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, as an individual 
who believes in democracy, I wish to state that it is my belief that 
the government is not assuming its responsibilities, that this is 
shameful, that this is unacceptable, that it is just one more reason to 
separate, because we have no need of a government that cannot 
offer us anything in the area of housing.
<P>
	If the parliamentary secretary finds that I am overdoing it, he has 
only to get up off his chair and add some substance to his proposals 
on housing-at this time, as we speak, all of my friendly feelings 
for the parliamentary secretary notwithstanding, we have every 
reason for dissatisfaction. But I want to get back to the subject of 
poverty in Quebec.
<P>
	Quebec has 24 per cent of the total Canadian population. The 
federal government gains 23 per cent of its income from Quebec's 
individual or corporate taxpayers. Thirty per cent of all of those 
living in poverty live in Quebec. There is one other reality which 
characterizes Quebec and militates in favour of more government 
involvement in social housing: more Quebecers rent their homes 
than the Canadian average.
<P>
	This means that more individuals in Quebec have insufficient 
income to own property. This is why we feel a government must be 
involved in social housing. What is social housing in its 
co-operative or non-profit OSBL form? I shall come back to that 
later.
<P>
	When a government sets aside public funds for social housing in 
co-operative or OSBL form, this is because of a belief that there are 
people whose income alone, without a little hand up from the 
government, will never enable them to own property.
<P>
	This is a trend which a self-respecting government, a 
government with some social democratic leanings will take action 
to correct-and I am sure that the Government whip either lives in 
a co-op or has plans to do so, since he shares our slight socialist 
bent.
<P>
	All of this to say that, in Quebec, 44.4 per cent of households are 
tenants; 44.4 per cent rent their homes, while the Canadian average 
is 37.1 per cent. We would therefore have been right to expect this 
morning that the government would have a somewhat more 
substantial policy to provide support to the provinces in the whole 
area of public housing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16183"> 16183 </A></B>
<P>
	I say ``a somewhat more substantial policy'' with respect to the 
provinces, because it is clear in my mind that federal government 
involvement in housing must take the form of a transfer of funds 
or budget allocations, where the funds are managed by the 
government of the individual provinces. I say this, because it is 
clear, constitutionally, that the federal government has no 
authority to intervene in the matter of housing.
<P>
	When it does, it is obviously contravening the Canadian 
constitution, because neither section 92 nor section 93 accords the 
federal government jurisdiction over housing. We must remember, 
however, that, if the federal government is to be involved in public 
housing, as I think it ought, it is by transferring money to the 
provinces, which want to be involved.
<P>
	No one is saying the government should not set funds aside. We 
acknowledge that it has a fiscal capacity, access to areas of taxation 
that justify its setting money aside for the provinces.
<P>
	I have an example for hon. members. Quebec has a program, I do 
not know if the parliamentary secretary is familiar with it, called 
Logirente. It targets people 55 years of age or older, who have 
difficulty paying their monthly rent on the basis of their income 
alone.
<P>
	The government of Quebec assists those who meet the eligibility 
criteria with their rent payment monthly.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Some 60,000 people benefit from this program at the moment. 
Quebec officials asked the federal government if it could also get 
involved and make some money available.
<P>
	Had the federal government agreed, through an administrative 
agreement, to become involved in the operation of the Logirente 
program, we estimate that 145,000 households and families could 
have been helped, instead of the present 60,000.
<P>
	This is the role of government. What is the point in having a 
federal government that could care less about getting involved in 
people's lives when the most fundamental of needs are at issue? 
You will not be surprised to learn that the federal government 
refused to get involved in the Logirente program, thus ensuring that 
60,000 households rather than 145,000 could benefit from it. This 
is one case where federalism is not working, and where a sovereign 
Quebec could have, on its own and totally, a housing policy it alone 
established, one that functioned independently under its control.
<P>
	I would like to come back to something I consider absolutely 
essential, something that could have helped us through the difficult 
years of the last recession and could help Canadians through the 
next recession. The program we must talk about and one I 
encourage the federal government to re-establish with the 
provinces is, obviously, the co-operative housing program.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will remember that, in 1992, the federal 
government of the day abolished it without so much as a warning 
cry, a hint of its intention or consultation of any sort. Of course the 
parliamentary secretary will say it was not his government. That is 
true. Nevertheless, his government has not taken any positive 
action to date to re-establish it. Despite the fact that the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation is relatively well off, we have 
not found a way to use public money to establish a co-operative 
housing program.
<P>
	What does a national co-op program entail? First of all, a 
national co-op program requires that people be responsible since 
co-op members must choose a board of directors and acknowledge 
their responsibility to manage and maintain the building in which 
they live. This implies that they feel concerned about their 
environment.
<P>
	There are now 40,000 people-I hope the parliamentary 
secretary will admit that these are real figures, and I invite him to 
check their accuracy-on the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation's waiting list for co-op housing. As a member of 
Parliament who believes in co-op housing, I am proud to remind 
you that, between 1973 and 1992, 85,000 units were funded by the 
provincial and federal programs then in effect, particularly by the 
federal government because it is mostly at that level that programs 
were available.
<P>
	Co-op housing was found for 255,000 low income people. What 
is the reality? The reality is that, as we speak in November 1995, 66 
per cent of households in co-op housing have an income that is less 
than $30,000, or a third of what MPs earn. We should keep this in 
mind. We can still agree that, in 1995, $30,000 a year is certainly a 
modest or average income.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	In the past, and especially during the last federal election 
campaign, I heard members say that some co-op members were 
making $60,000, $70,000 or $80,000, and that co-op housing was 
reserved for the better-off in our society. When we look at the 
figures a little more closely, we see that co-op housing is a tool 
available to the poor or to honest, middle class people, since 66 per 
cent of co-op members, 66 per cent of households, make less than 
$30,000 a year.
<P>
	Thirty per cent of households in co-op housing across Canada 
are headed by single mothers. These women are their families' 
breadwinners. This shows that there is a need, that there are poor 
people who, for all kinds of reasons, were not able to buy their own 
homes.
<P>
	It is reasonable to think that a decent government, one that lives 
up to its responsibilities and cares about the people, cannot tolerate 
a situation in which the federal government has nothing to offer 
people with housing programs.
<P>
	The main paradox of the federal government's withdrawal from 
the housing sector, especially from  co-op housing, is that, in the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16184"> 16184 </A></B>
<P>
past three years, unemployment in the residential construction 
sector has hovered around 20 per cent. I think that the hon. 
members in this House would agree with that figure.
<P>
	As our grandparents used to say, and I am sure that your 
grandmother also said it, ``as the construction industry goes so goes 
the world''.
<P>
	Why is it that, with an unemployment rate of 20 per cent in the 
residential construction sector, the government does not realize that 
one way to revitalize the Canadian economy would be to promote 
the construction of co-op units?
<P>
	Let us not forget that, for every 1,000 co-op units built-I have 
the figures here-2,000 direct jobs are created. The parliamentary 
secretary should never forget that, every time public assistance 
makes it possible to build 1,000 co-op units, 2,000 new jobs are 
created.
<P>
	There are not many sectors in which government initiatives give 
a 200 per cent return. But in the housing sector, for every 1,000 
co-op units built, 2,000 direct jobs are created.
<P>
	Why does the government not understand that reality? Why is 
the government so dull witted and narrow minded? Whay can the 
government not see the obvious? Can we rely on those government 
members who represent ridings, in Montreal and in the regions, 
where there is a need for co-op housing? I ask these members to get 
a little more involved and show a little more respect for the people 
who need the government's assistance to take action.
<P>
	The influence of the Quebec Liberal caucus on cabinet is aptly 
described by the movie title <I>The Silence of the Lambs</I>. We truly feel 
that the Quebec Liberal caucus has no desire to make 
representations to cabinet to correct the major fundamental 
injustices suffered by Quebecers because of policies put forward by 
this government, particularly in the housing sector.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Since 1989, the federal government has drastically reduced its 
support in the renovation and the co-op housing sectors, including 
its support to owner occupants. That withdrawal has had the effect 
of destabilizing public finances, as well as the economic situation 
of the poor in our society.
<P>
	Let me give you an example. There used to be a rehabilitation 
assistance program for rental housing, which allowed people living 
in non-profit housing to get financing for up to 50 per cent of the 
costs of renovations to a housing unit. That was a joint program, 
with the federal and the provinces, Quebec in this instance, each 
assuming 50 per cent of the costs.
<P>
	Then, all of sudden, without any warning, without any 
consultation, and in a period of widespread poverty, the federal 
government withdrew its financial support to the  program. This 
resulted in a $20 million shortfall for Quebec.
<P>
	Let us take the important issue of social housing. There are, in 
every riding, people who live in low rental housing. We are proud 
of these people, because they are a very dynamic group within our 
community. People who live in low rental housing create a feeling 
of solidarity. They have community halls which often alleviate the 
problem of loneliness.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, believe it or not, the federal government bluntly 
withdrew its support to that sector. Since 1992, not a single low 
rental housing unit has been built in Canada or in Quebec. I am 
shocked and I find this irresponsible. I was hoping that, this 
morning, the federal government would have shown a desire to do 
more in the important co-op and social housing sector.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, it being 11 a.m., we will now 
proceed to statements by members. Our colleague for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve will, however, have the floor again after 
question period.

	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Moncton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like today to speak to regulations in the mining industry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Regulatory reform has been an issue of great concern to the 
government. A climate of change will serve as impetus to continue 
pushing these efforts.
<P>
	Canadians in Quebec and across the country have made their 
voices heard and have called on us to continue to make the changes 
necessary to do business differently.
<P>
	The mining industry is a prime example of where regulatory 
reform must take place. It is also one of the six economic sectors 
targeted by the government.
<P>
	The Minister of Natural Resources has responded to the 
challenge with the Whitehorse mining initiative and most recently 
a new policy paper on sustainable development in mineral and 
metals that was unveiled in Vancouver in September.
<P>
	All parties must be prepared to address this issue with greater 
vigour and with the conviction that mining is essential to our 
economic balance sheet. Mining is a $20 billion industry in this 
country and we need to ensure its viability for future generations.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
has stated that one element of fulfilling the government's red book 
commitment is to ``not require blanket extinguishment of 
aboriginal rights in the settlement of land claims''.
<P>
	A few of the Yukon bands that signed the umbrella final 
agreement after 20 years of negotiations are now refusing to abide 
by its terms. They want to know if they might get more with the 
new inherent rights policy. They want to know if they can sign a 
final agreement for hundreds or thousands of square miles of 
territories now, and not surrender their right to ask for more 10 
years down the road.
<P>
	Instead of certainty, the government has created uncertainty. The 
minister must clearly state that a land claim is final, that 
self-government does not mean entrenching special rights based on 
race in our Constitution.
<P>
	We all agree we must reach fair and affordable settlements of 
outstanding native claims but we cannot and must not achieve 
finality by sacrificing the fundamental Canadian principle of 
equality.

	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am most 
pleased to offer congratulations to Mr. Eric Robinson, named to the 
Atlantic Agricultural Hall of Fame.
<P>
	Eric's love for agriculture can be seen in his family, his farm, his 
community, and the company that bears his name. The company 
maintains two farming operations and also buys and sells potatoes 
for the domestic and export markets.
<P>
	Eric's extensive travels throughout North America and Europe 
resulted in the introduction of new equipment that led to complete 
mechanization of the potato industry in Prince Edward Island. He 
was one of the first to use a bulk harvester and to import and grow 
the Russet Burbank variety, now the common variety grown in 
P.E.I.
<P>
	A volunteer to many organizations, Eric was a member of the 
original P.E.I. potato marketing board in 1950.
<P>
	Although he claims he is retired, Eric looks in daily on the 
operation. Eric Robinson is indeed most deserving of this honour. 
Congratulations to Eric and his family on his induction into the 
Atlantic Agricultural Hall of Fame.

Lambton-Middlesex, based not on government handouts but on 
true community spirit.
<P>
	I am referring to the recent facelift of Wilkesport Community 
Centre in Sombra township. The hall was built 17 years ago by 
holding various fundraising events in the community. The 
community centre consists of of a 500-seat hall and three ball 
diamonds, which incidentally have brought Sombra township two 
Ontario championship teams and seven runners up.
<P>
	Volunteers have given their time and effort to keep this hall 
successful by providing the township with a focal point for a wide 
variety of community events. Seventeen years later, this 
community is still strong and vibrant. The hall needed a facelift, 
and the community provided it.
<P>

whose hard work and dedication exemplify a united community 
spirit.

	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to acknowledge one of my constituents who has 
returned from the Caribbean as a volunteer with the Canadian 
Executive Service Organization.
<P>
	Mr. Ed Peppler of Hanover, Ontario recently completed a CESO 
project in Dominica. He was asked to start a furniture 
manufacturing workshop within a woodworking factory that was 
only producing small gift type items. Mr. Peppler oversaw the 
purchasing of machinery and taught the staff how to make 
furniture. The staff members were soon busy filling orders for the 
new products and were looking to hire three or four new people. 
The machinery, furniture, hardware, and tires for their vehicles 
were all purchased from Canadian manufacturers to help the plant.
<P>
	Ed Peppler's efforts stand in the tradition of Canadian aid to the 
developing world. I and the town of Hanover, with its rich heritage 
in furniture manufacturing, and indeed the people of Bruce-Grey 
applaud the spirit of volunteerism and international co-operation of 
Mr. Peppler.

<P>
when a government member stood to speak out against the way the 
employment equity bill was handled in committee. His words from 
<I>Hansard</I> were: ``I am a first time MP. I never dreamed ever that 
laws were created in this fashion''.
<P>
	At least 52 other members in the House agree that changes must 
be made to the system so that Parliament will function in a much 
more democratic manner. The present system is perfect for 
enacting a political agenda, but Canadian voters who pay our 
salaries are fed up with having Parliament force its will upon them 
and they are voting for change in greater and greater numbers.
<P>
	We need more system changers in the House. If this does not 
happen before the next election it will surely happen during the 
next election. In the meantime, I ask the House to join me in 
congratulating all members of the House who have already shown 
that voting to represent their constituents takes precedence over the

<P>
	On Friday, October 27 a large number of Prince Albertans

people of Quebec. This is 1980  revisited. The member for 
Saint-Maurice wants to use the defeat of the referendum to silence 
sovereignists and prevent them from holding another one.
<P>
	In learning that he would not recognize a slim yes vote, we 
realized his contempt for democracy, but we would never have 
imagined his considering restricting the democratic rights of his 
own people. If this is how the Prime Minister of Canada responds 
to the 49.4 per cent of the population of Quebec that voted yes last 
Monday, Quebecers will do everything they can to retain their right 
to speak freely on their future. Let the Prime Minister just try to

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on Monday 
some 49.5 per cent of Quebeckers who voted yes to separation did 
so because they believe that status quo federalism is bankrupt and 
the government is incapable of carrying out necessary reforms. 
Others voted yes because they believed the claims of the separatist 
leadership that when countries split apart the process is quick, 
painless, and amicable.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	The best way of combating these twin errors is for Canadian 
federalists to adopt a two-track approach. First we must advocate 
and implement a new confederation consisting of reforms that will 
decentralize the Canadian federal system. The Reform Party's 
20-point new confederation proposal released several weeks ago 
outlines one method of doing this.
<P>
	The Reform Party will also pursue a second stream intended to 
outline a formal Canadian position on the terms and conditions of 
separation if ever necessary. Such a position will make crystal clear

members have any respect for democracy, they should not 
challenge them either.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
serious. The federal Minister of Justice says the federal 
government wants or may wish to use the power of disallowance to 
go over the head of the Quebec National Assembly. The minister is 
off topic and using all kinds of excuses to try to evade the issue.
<P>
	How could the federal government even consider ignoring the 
powers of the Quebec National Assembly by using a power that, 
according to the Supreme Court, has become obsolete? Are we to 
understand that with this government, democracy comes second to 
federalism?

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois respect democracy. Because 
if they have the slightest respect for democracy, they will accept 
the outcome of the vote last Monday, and they will abide by the 
wishes of 73 per cent of Quebecers who want the Quebec 
government to work towards renewing federalism. That is 
democracy. Democracy spoke Monday night, and the Parti 
Quebecois should listen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this from 
the Deputy Prime Minister of a government that, I may remind you, 
was formed by the party that introduced the War Measures Act in 
Quebec in 1970. We know your democratic propensities. A party 
that, through its Minister of Justice, tells us it will use a power now 
obsolete, the power of disallowance, to flout the authority of the 
Quebec National Assembly and ignore its decisions. And this party, 
which according to the Prime Minister would not have respected 
the results of the referendum, now wants to give us a lesson in 
democracy.

reconsider, because the government has no plan and because they 
know that next time, the Yes side will win, the government is 
desperate, and its only option is to deny the democratic system, 
either through the power of disallowance or by going before the 
courts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

Martinez thinks of democracy according to the Parti Quebecois. 
Anita Martinez is a 23 year old worker in Quebec who was accused 
by the Deputy Premier of Quebec of not being a real Quebecer.
<P>
	Those people over there want to teach us a lesson in democracy, 
but we respect the results and we respect the fact that whether it is 
cast by a Nunez, a Martinez or a Lucien Bouchard, a vote is a vote,

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the last stretch of the referendum campaign the Prime 
Minister of Canada, along with several premiers of English 
speaking provinces, clearly implied that changes were coming in 
Canada, particularly the formal recognition of Quebec as a distinct 
society. It would appear that the Prime Minister is planning in the 
very near future to make a ``motherhood'' announcement of his 
intentions toward the distinct society.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that bringing in any federal 
legislative measure whatsoever on the recognition of distinct 
society status will not offer any response at all to the legitimate 
aspirations of the Quebec people, for Quebecers want more than 
cosmetic changes with no true meaning?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, when will the party of the official opposition give up on 
continuing to fight a lost referendum, and when will it start 
addressing the true problems of Quebecers, which are problems of 
unemployment and problems of investment?
<P>
	We face the official opposition here as a government which is 
attempting to develop Quebec and Canada, which is attempting to 
reduce unemployment. We know that Quebecers want us to renew 
federalism and want to see the economic situation improved. And 
the official opposition is continuing to debate arguments that were 
settled on the evening of the referendum. Quebecers decided 
democratically that they did not want out of Canada, and I implore 
the official opposition to return to the path of duty and to defend 
Quebecers, to help us create jobs and investments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how can the minister talk about the real problems of 
Canadians, when the government is tabling no legislative measure 
whatsoever in response to those very problems?
<P>
	Now, to my question. How can we have any faith in the Prime 
Minister when it comes to the distinct society, when his allies in 
English Canada wasted no time immediately after the referendum 
in diluting the content of the resolutions they had adopted in their 
legislative assemblies, particularly when we are familiar with the 
views of the Prime Minister, the man who killed Meech Lake, on 
the distinct society?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the person who changed 
sides, who jumped ship one month after the Meech Lake 
agreement, was the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	It would be advisable, if the hon. member does not want to listen 
to the voice of the people as expressed in this morning's poll, for 
him to listen to the former leader of his party, Pierre-Marc Johnson, 
who today stated according to the Parti Quebecois that ``the 
government ought to get busy instead with governing, given the 
unemployment situation and the pressures on the public purse''.
<P>

might at least listen to Pierre-Marc Johnson.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadian federalists must never get into any future 
contest with Quebec separatists-and regrettably there will be one 
more contest-as ill prepared and ill equipped as they entered the 
last referendum campaign.
<P>
	If we are to keep this great country together, we have to fight the 
separatist dream with a federalist vision, not the status quo. We 
have to fight separatist deceptions not with panic or propaganda, 
but with the naked truth about what separation really means. The 
time to prepare the ground is before, not during some future 
campaign.
<P>
	I ask the intergovernmental affairs minister, in this period prior 
to the next real confrontation with the separatists, what is the 
government going to do to make the real consequences of secession 
crystal clear to every Quebecer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during the campaign the economic arguments against 
separation were done well. They convinced a large number of 
Quebecers that separation was not in their economic interests and 
would be very costly especially to the vulnerable elements in 
society the separatists say they want to defend.
<P>
	What is more important is that federalism is not the status quo. 
Federalism has been flexible. We indicated in fact, not in words 
like the opposition, that we were ready to reduce the size of the 
federal government and we were ready to review the powers of the 
various levels of government.
<P>
	We are presently doing that. The federalism test we have applied 
is presently resulting in all kinds of powers being reassessed 
between the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it may be that some of the economic arguments on the 
dangers of secession were presented.
<P>
	The sad fact is that on October 30 over 30 per cent of the people 
who voted yes thought they were voting for a new and better 
economic union with Canada rather than for a separate Quebec. 
The federal government and the no campaign failed utterly to get 
through to those voters on the negative implications of a yes vote. 
That simply cannot be allowed to ever happen again.
<P>
	To prevent that from happening again, will the government begin 
to clearly and openly answer from a Canadian perspective all the 
what if questions which are raised by a Quebec secession and 
which I presented to  the Prime Minister on June 8, 1994 prior to 
the last campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt that the question asked was confusing. 
We said that during the campaign. A number of Quebecers who 
voted yes voted yes under the misapprehension that a partnership 
was possible and that it was a mandate to negotiate.
<P>
	What is important now is not to relive the referendum. It is 
important now to see that we have to reform Canada. The 
government has not only agreed to that, but we indicated that 
especially in last February's budget where we re-established fiscal 
responsibility and where we indicated the future elements of 
decentralization that should take place.
<P>
	We are not in favour of decentralization for the sake of 
decentralization. We are for decentralization to the extent that it 
serves the people of Canada by making the various levels of 
government more efficient. We will not move in the direction of 
decentralization without justification.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government can try to ignore 30 per cent of the yes 
people who thought they were voting for something else. I suggest 
that is keeping the government's head in the sand. That is not going 
to win the battle with the separatists the next time around.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	Quebecers must know the Canadian position on terms and 
conditions of separation. Quebecers have to know the Canadian 
position on debt division, the Canadian position on boundaries, the 
Canadian position on protecting Atlantic Canada and the Canadian 
position on terms and conditions of trade.
<P>
	Since over 30 per cent of yes voters thought they could keep all 
the benefits of Canadianism and vote for separation, will the 
government begin to spell out the Canadian position on terms and 
conditions of separation in order to make the negative 
consequences of separation clear to every Quebecer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Canadian position 
includes Quebec. It is still part of Canada, thank God, after Monday 
night.
<P>

the federal House who ask for his help in the rebuilding process,

<P>
	The day before yesterday, the Prime Minister stated in this 
House, and I quote: ``I said it would be a veto for the people of 
Quebec''. When questioned about the meaning of this statement, 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs suggested that we ask the 
Prime Minister himself for clarifications, because he was unable to 
tell us what the Prime Minister meant.
<P>
	Could the Deputy Prime Minister clarify for us what the Prime 
Minister was referring to when he spoke of a veto for the people of 
Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois is 
asking all kinds of questions about the promises made by the Prime 
Minister, but I can assure the Bloc that we will keep our word. We 
will stand by the Prime Minister's promise for change.
<P>
	Let us just hope that the Bloc Quebecois will respect the result of 
Monday's vote, in which a majority of voters in Quebec said no to 
separation. They now want the PQ and the Bloc Quebecois to focus 
on the issues. Unemployment figures were released today. We 
should work together to find effective ways of dealing with the 
unemployment problem, instead of continually quarrelling about 
the constitution.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the people of Quebec regard as important the questions 
that we, as the official opposition, ask in this House.
<P>
	Could the Deputy Prime Minister explain how the Prime 
Minister can refuse to clarify what he really meant with respect to 
the right of veto, when the minister responsible, one of the 
brightest members of cabinet, admits to not knowing what the 
Prime Minister was talking about?
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

ask any question they want. The question the people of Quebec are 
asking themselves right now is: When will the Government of 
Quebec and the Bloc Quebecois start focusing on the economy?
<P>
	We know for instance that the Parti Quebecois was prepared to 
put on the line billions of dollars from the  Quebec old age pension 
fund, as Mr. Parizeau himself indicated when he said: ``The 
defensive tools we are referring to certainly include the deposit 
fund. This, of course, represents a lot of money. Hundreds of 
millions of dollars''. In fact, it is more like a few billion dollars. 
The Premier of Quebec was prepared to put on the line billions of 
dollars that Quebecers have contributed to the Quebec old age 
pension fund to further his own separatist ambitions, and the 
people have said no. Let us hope that he will respect their wishes.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government collects money from taxpayers in 
Quebec and other provinces. It then spends that money, after 
keeping some of it, on programs for manpower training, for 
immigration settlement and a whole range of programs, all with 
lots of strings attached that the provinces do not like.
<P>
	My question is for any minister responsible for such spending 
programs. For the sake of unity, why do not the ministers 
responsible for this spending simply call up their counterparts in 
the provinces and say: ``As of the first of next month we will send 
you the money, totally without strings attached, for you to spend 
any way in which you wish for the sake of unity''?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have to remind members of the third party that we were 
elected by Canadians like they were and Canadians did not ask us 
to implement every desire of the premiers of the provinces.
<P>
	They asked us to act in their interests by spending the taxes we 
collect from all Canadians for the benefit of all Canadians, not for 
the benefit of province <I>a</I>, <I>b</I> or <I>c</I>, in particular, but within province 
<I>a</I>, <I>b</I> or <I>c</I>, for the benefit of all Canadians. This is how we differ 
from provincial governments.
<P>
	In this case the question to be asked is are the interests of 
Canadians being served well? The record is clear. The country we 
have created is the proof. As the federal government we have been 
serving Canadians right. There are some fields where the powers of 
the various levels of government must be reassigned. But it must be 
done for reasons of efficiency and service to citizens, not for 
reasons of ideology.
<P>

<P>
	The ball game has changed. I would like to get to the question of 
spending another $750 million on yet another program that not 
only we cannot afford but also impinges on provincial sovereignty, 
namely spending on day care facilities.

only destroys national unity, but ruins spending programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have heard a great deal of

clear responsibility of a democratic system is to respond to the 
desires of people as they express them at the ballot box.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	In the last election in 1993 this party put forward a proposal for 
assistance to the provinces to enhance child care. In that way we 
could ensure a basic standard of development for children right 
across Canada regardless of the respective wealth of different 
regions. We want to ensure that in this new workplace where many 
families have both parents working, where there are many single 
parents who want to go back to work that need good care for their 
children, the federal government would provide assistance. The 
government does not want to impinge, does not want to take over. It 
wants to share, as we have always tried to do in this party.
<P>
	In 1993 we received the mandate of 178 seats elected. That is 
why we are the government. That is why we intend to carry out a 
major investment in child care. It may not be the priority of the 
Reform Party but we happen to think that good care for children is 
a real priority for all Canadians.

The truth is, the minister is so incompetent that she is desperately 
looking for a scape goat to hide her own inability to find a safe 
solution to the problem of the <I>Irving Whale</I>.
<P>
	Would the minister agree it is high time she showed some

	Will the minister admit that the reason she is faced today with a

incompetence in this matter, the reason is she is incapable of

	Unfortunately, when the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean was

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all 
Canadians are aware of the horrific torture of three Ottawa teens 
and the death of 17-year old Sylvain Leduc at the hands of a vicious 
youth gang.
<P>
	The minister is aware the studies his department has received by 
noted criminologists state that young offenders believe there will 
be no serious consequences for criminal action and they will 
commit unlawful acts that include torture and violence.
<P>
	Would someone on that side of the House explain why the 
minister will not put severe consequences in the Young Offenders 
Act for brutal, violent, sadistic crimes committed by young 
offenders?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government has brought forward legislation to tighten up the 
Young Offenders Act and provide more severe penalties. The law 
has been adopted. It will go a long way to responding to the kinds 
of concerns raised by my hon. friend.
<P>
	At the same time, the justice committee of the House has been 
mandated to carry out an overall review of the work with respect to 
young offenders. I hope it will be able to take into account the 
understandable concerns of my hon. friend. I appreciate his raising 
this important point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
remind the minister that these types of crimes are showing up more 
and more often and that they need to be stopped. If he is referring to 
Bill C-37, forget it; it will not do the trick.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question. When will the minister change 
the Young Offenders Act so the names and pictures of violent and 
sadistic gang members such as the Ace Crew, regardless of their 
age, become available to the general public for its own protection?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this information is available to and used by law enforcement 
agencies. The hon. member's  suggestion is one that can be given 
active consideration in the course of the wide ranging and urgent 
review of young offenders provisions currently under way in the 
justice committee.
<P>
	I urge my hon. friend and his colleagues to take that review 
seriously and participate in the hearings so we will have a good 
result in the interests of all Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	Recently, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> revealed that some people have 
managed to find a way to follow the advice of the Minister of the 
Environment, who wished to see Canada transform its 
environmental challenges into economic opportunities. Despite its 
regulations, Canada is in fact exporting hazardous waste to the 
third world.
<P>
	Does the minister confirm her departmental employees' 
complaints of being so short of resources that they cannot assume 
their responsibilities and apply the regulations on hazardous waste 
exports properly?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>In fact, Mr. Speaker, during the review of 
the budgets for environment, the budget for protection was 
increased.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today the minister is avoiding direct answers with 
surprising regularity. I shall, however, try a supplementary.
<P>
	Does the minister understand that she ought to ensure that her 
departmental employees apply existing regulations properly, rather 
than seek to set national standards and to continually meddle in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, I am trying 
to follow the lead of the former Minister of the Environment, the 
hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean, who stated that the federal 
government had not only a duty to be concerned about the 
environment, but a responsibility. And I endorse that statement by

John Richardson was on mandatory release from Millhaven 
penitentiary after serving just two-thirds of his sentence.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Reform has been asking for the elimination of mandatory release 
but our pleas and the pleas of many Canadians and victims of 
violent crimes have fallen on deaf ears.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Justice or the Solicitor 
General of Canada. In view of the murders of Sylvain Leduc and 
Melanie Carpenter, also murdered by an offender on statutory 
release, why will he not move immediately to eliminate mandatory 
release?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my hon. friend in beginning his question said that the individual in 
question was on parole. The person in question was not on parole. 
He had not been released pursuant to any decision of the parole 
board.
<P>
	Instead, as the hon. member said later in his question, the 
individual was on mandatory release. The conditions in the law for 
the automatic sending of the person's case to the parole board for a 
detention hearing had not been met because the person's original 
offence did not involve crimes of violence or drugs.
<P>
	With respect to the basic point he is making, most of the people 
on mandatory release are not involved in further offences. 
Experience has shown that a controlled period of supervision at the 
end of a sentence is the best way of ensuring that there are not 
further offences, something I hope the hon. member will support. I 
hope he will support measures designed to avoid further offences 
rather than steps that might create more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, John 
Richardson was denied parole not once but twice because the 
parole board said: ``There is indication of behaviour that 
demonstrates a potential to commit an offence involving 
violence''.
<P>
	When Richardson was released by statutory requirement 
conditions were attached because: ``You remain a high risk to 
reoffend''. This evidence clearly indicates that the death of Sylvain 
Leduc could have been prevented.
<P>
	When will the minister move to eliminate mandatory release to 
keep dangerous offenders locked up? When?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
at this point the individual in question is wanted for questioning. 
Charges have not yet been laid against him.
<P>
	The hon. member is jumping to conclusions which may or may 
not turn out to be correct. At the same time he is raising an 
understandable concern which I share. However the point he is 
making with respect to the  absolute abolition of mandatory 
supervision does not fit in with reality. The best way to help ensure 
further offences do not take place is to have people under a form of 
supervision and controlled release into the community so that they 
will not do things that are likely to lead to further offences. Most 
cases of mandatory supervision turn out well and tragic incidents 
are the exception rather than the rule.
<P>
	There is a provision in the law whereby if a person is considered 
to be likely to carry out further offences and certain conditions are 
met the case can be referred to the parole board for a hearing which 
can lead to the person's detention to the end of sentence. 
Unfortunately the conditions were not met because the person's 
original conviction was not for one of the offences in schedule one 
or two.
<P>
	The hon. member calls for changes in the law. This can certainly 
be considered. If we present changes to the law I hope he will 
co-operate in ways that protect public safety rather than simply 
making a lot of noise about it.

	Like the rest of us, the Minister of Finance noted the profound

	I wonder whether the Minister of Finance might not use this 
opportunity to put forward a national plan to the country to

to do so for the benefit of the country as a whole.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party is entirely right to talk of a desire 
for change that is reflected right across the country, from Atlantic 
to Pacific. He should know that this very thing was discussed at the 
last two meetings of the country's finance ministers. I agree with 
him totally about what must be done, namely, drawing up a 
federal-provincial master plan with very clear objectives of 
consolidating public finances at both levels of government.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALHOUSINGACT">NATIONAL HOUSING ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-108, 
an act to amend the National Housing Act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-108, an act to 
amend the National Housing Act. I am speaking on behalf of the 
member for Comox-Alberni, the Reform critic for Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
<P>
	This is actually a very brief bill and its intent is quite simply 
explained. Bill C-108 proposes to increase the aggregate amount of 
outstanding CMHC loan insurance from $100 billion to $150 
billion, plus any additional amounts that may be authorized by 
Parliament. That means that CMHC's liability limit will be 
increased by $50 billion. That is billions, not millions-fifty 
thousand million dollars, a huge increase over the present 
liabilities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16198"> 16198 </A></B>
<P>
	I am not surprised that the Bloc would support such an increase 
in liabilities. It really thinks it is getting something for nothing. 
It thinks money grows on trees. The fact is it is a much more 
complex situation than that.
<P>
	There are many areas of concern that are raised by this bill, 
concerns that are being voiced by Canadians right now. It surprises 
me that given the nature of this bill the government is not listening 
to those concerns. On second thought, maybe it is not such a 
surprise, given the history of the government so far.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Canadians are already very concerned about the current debt 
load. They are carrying that debt load and it is creating an inability 
for them to move forward financially or personally because of high 
taxes. Every way they turn they are being taxed over and over. 
There is no room to move. Pretty soon there will not be much left to 
tax.
<P>
	The bill does nothing to halt the trend to ever bigger government 
and increasing public liabilities. It appears that the government is 
willing to gamble taxpayers' dollars at a time when the present debt 
is already more than $564 billion and climbing by $100 million 
every day.
<P>
	Increasing the liability limit for insuring mortgages is nothing 
more than government speculation without any money. It is a trend 
that has been going on in other departments and it really must come 
to an end. The Liberal government has borrowed more than $80 
billion in the first two years of its mandate, and it is continuing to 
spend beyond its means. This year alone the government had to 
borrow another $32 billion.
<P>
	CMHC finances are actuarially accounted for every 20 years, so 
the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation does not know 
what its ultimate liability will be or what it really has outstanding 
right now. Bill C-108 should be of great concern to all Canadians, 
who can clearly see that the government is continuing to spend well 
beyond its means and incurring liabilities that on a standard 
accounting balance sheet would show that we are actually in very 
deep trouble.
<P>
	By increasing Canada's liabilities we are increasing our risks. 
Although Bill C-108 does not ask for actual cash per se, it is 
increasing the liability, which will in the end cost taxpayers a 
tremendous amount of money if there is a major default. Loans and 
mortgages are not guaranteed; they can fall back on the 
government and lead to a further lowering of Canada's 
international standing and raise the overall debt.
<P>
	Canadians are already staggering under an oppressive tax 
burden. They do not need government to dig them a deeper hole. 
They want to get out of the hole, as proven by the types of 
provincial governments they have been electing of late.
<P>
	The government will not disclose its ongoing liability. I would 
like to see it publish a standard accounting style balance sheet once 
a year, as was done in New Zealand. Members know that I am 
originally from New Zealand. There is a law there that requires the 
government to actually print once a year all of its liabilities in 
standard accounting form. The first year the country did that, it 
discovered there was a negative worth in the country and it had to 
cancel a lot of the liabilities.
<P>
	If standard accounting practices were used here in Canada to 
show the liabilities, we would probably find a network of debt and 
liabilities all strung together in a way that would be completely 
unacceptable and illegal probably in the private sector.
<P>
	It certainly appears the government does not know how large the 
liabilities will be 10 or 15 years from now. Yet it is continuing to 
increase that liability load on us. This trend of increasing 
government liabilities across the board will only lead to the 
government overextending itself, to the detriment of taxpayers who 
bear the burden of the national debt.
<P>
	Last week on television the Prime Minister spoke from Montreal 
with desperate pleas to Canada and promises to Quebec that the 
Liberal government would make changes if Quebec would stay in 
Canada. Yet it is ironic that on the eve of the Quebec referendum 
the government had the gall to table this bill. While the Prime 
Minister was in Montreal making overtures of a new and 
decentralized federal government, at the very same time his 
representatives in Ottawa were tabling a bill that takes us in exactly 
the opposite direction. So it should not be a surprise if Canadians 
find that the Prime Minister is trying to back down on his promise. 
Looking at this bill, it is obvious the government has no intention 
of decentralizing and that it really wants to cling to every piece of 
power it has.
<P>
	When asked about promises of decentralization, all the Prime 
Minister could say is: ``That is going to require a lot more thought 
and discussion, but I am sure there is going to be some of that''. 
Some of that-what does that mean? Has the government not 
learned anything from the Quebec result? Did it not do any forward 
planning? Demands for decentralization are being heard across the 
country. They did not start with the Quebec referendum; they were 
there long before that. It takes a major crisis of unity in the country 
before the government will even begin to address the problems.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	When asked about what degree of decentralization the 
government was considering, the Prime Minister responded that he 
did not know at this point in time. He did not know. More waffling 
as usual. Canadians are getting pretty tired of all the waffling from 
the Liberal Party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16199"> 16199 </A></B>
<P>
	The answer is right here in this bill. The government does not 
want to decentralize. It is looking to strengthen its federal control. 
Canadians are not going to tolerate the double talk for too long. 
Misrepresentation of intent from the government can be seen in 
the changes that are now sweeping the country at the political 
level.
<P>
	The Liberal government's response to Canadians' desire for 
change has been totally inadequate to say the least. The status quo 
has got to go if we are going to move forward as a nation.
<P>
	There was an example today in question period when we asked 
yet again about the Young Offenders Act. We have been asking 
week after week after week for two years and the government has 
done nothing to address the concerns of people. We still have these 
young punks out there who do not have their names or their 
pictures published. We have to get this government doing 
something for Canadians for a change.
<P>
	Lingering uncertainty in Quebec continues to plague Canada's 
economic security. Only a few days ago it was reported in the 
newspapers that the bond raters are still uncertain about Canada's 
economic future because the Quebec situation remains unresolved. 
If the government cannot take steps to address the problems at 
hand, we are simply headed for more chaos.
<P>
	The future financial stability of this country depends on how 
well this government addresses its fiscal problems. So far, the 
picture does not look very rosy. Canadians want a smaller federal 
government.
<P>
	The minister responsible for the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation claims that his departments and responsibilities, 
including CMHC, are headed in that direction. However, this bill 
shows the federal government is actually moving in the opposite 
direction.
<P>
	Instead of downsizing and moving away from the housing 
market, the government wants to put another $50 billion of 
mortgage liabilities on the backs of Canadian taxpayers. This will 
increase the federal role, not downsize it as the government claims. 
If the government is as committed to decentralization as it would 
want us to believe, then why is the minister responsible for the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation grabbing for more 
money?
<P>
	The federal government must realign its responsibilities with 
other governments in this country and the time to start doing it is 
now. It is absolutely necessary that the government take steps in the 
right direction, not backward as it is doing with bills like this one. 
In the light of the disastrous campaign the government led during 
the referendum debate, it is a pity it has not learned any lessons.
<P>
	Canadians are taxed to the hilt with all the levels of government 
they are financing. Not only are they paying for services whose 
needs are often questionable, but they are paying for the same 
services again and again through  user fees, not just at the federal 
level but at the provincial and municipal levels as well.
<P>
	The Reform Party proposed in its recent 20-point plan for 
decentralization to totally transfer over to the provinces a number 
of areas of operation at the federal level that are duplicated at the 
provincial level. Those areas illustrate mostly a federal level of 
meddling in affairs that are actually set under the Constitution to be 
provincial. The federal government is long overdue in getting out 
of those areas of provincial responsibility.
<P>
	This is not the time for the government to put up its feet and 
relax because it thinks it won the Quebec debate. It is time for the 
government to start coming up with a plan that truly decentralizes. 
One of the things it could be doing is moving total responsibility 
for housing to the provincial level. If the government would come 
up with such a plan, it would begin to save the taxpayers some 
money.
<P>
	Perhaps it would not be such a bad idea if the government tried 
adopting the suggestions the Reform Party has made. We have 
offered the government the entire plan. We have dropped the plain 
brown envelope on the floor outside the office door of the Deputy 
Prime Minister. All she has to do is look inside the envelope to see 
what good ideas are shown there.
<P>
	Yesterday in his speech at the Canadian Club in Toronto, the 
leader of the Reform Party received a standing ovation for the 
suggestions in that 20-point plan. It was very well received as could 
be seen by the live telecast of that speech on the ``National'' 
yesterday.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party has been listening to Canadians. If 
government members need some help heading in the right 
direction, we are more than happy to assist. They just have to pick 
up the plain brown envelope off the floor outside the Deputy Prime 
Minister's office.
<P>
	As I said, one of our proposals is for the federal government to 
get out of the housing business. If crown corporations like CMHC 
are truly self-supporting let us turn them over to the private sector. 
Areas which are perhaps socially oriented should be turned over to 
the provincial level.
<P>
	Not only do Canadians want an end to federal interference in 
areas of provincial responsibility, they also want clearer 
distinctions of responsibility between the provinces. They do not 
want this muddled thing we have right now where municipal, 
federal and provincial governments get all mixed up together 
giving one another grants. It is like government incest in a way.
<P>
	Canadians also want an end to federal interference in the private 
sector. They are sick and tired of the federal government interfering 
unnecessarily in their affairs.
<P>
	Bill C-108 allows the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation to significantly increase its presence in the  mortgage 
market. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16200"> 16200 </A></B>
<P>
It represents a further intrusion into a private market and will lead 
to further distortions of that market.
<P>
	The federal government is artificially inflating mortgages in 
urban areas in order to subsidize rural areas. The government's 
policy of cross-subsidization of mortgages means that houses in 
urban areas cost more to Canadians than they would if the federal 
government stepped out of the housing business in the first place. It 
is all very well to offer a lower price to rural residents, but why 
should urban areas bear the brunt of that cost? Federal meddling in 
the housing industry also means that private companies like GE are 
offering mortgages at a higher rate as well.
<P>
	It is time for the government to stop artificially jacking up 
mortgage rates and to stop subsidizing one kind of mortgage by 
gouging rates on another. Let private industry do what it does best, 
provide consumers with competitive mortgage rates.
<P>
	In terms of the 5 per cent down program, there is a very real 
danger that any economic downturn which continues the trend we 
have seen lately where property prices have been falling could 
create a situation where homeowners are left holding mortgages 
worth more than the property. It is a simplification for the 
government to say that the liabilities we are incurring have no cost. 
If the property market turns down and homeowners walk away 
from some of those commitments, the taxpayers are left holding 
the can.
<P>
	I was in the U.K. in August over the summer break. Incidentally, 
my trip was paid for with my own funds and not those of taxpayers. 
I met with some bankers while I was in London. To my 
astonishment, I was told that because of the property downturn in 
the U.K. some banks are now holding a lot of mortgages in their 
portfolios which are currently valued at 120 per cent of the 
properties on which the mortgages were originally taken out.
<P>
	The banks are also holding in their portfolios huge numbers of 
vacant properties because people have walked away from those 
commitments. That is a sign of the sort of disaster which can 
happen if the government does not take into account where these 
liabilities could lead.
<P>
	It is pretty frightening that we are building up a liability account 
in this area of something of the order of $150 billion. It is 
wonderful to offer this opportunity for new homeowners to get into 
home ownership, but to do it on the backs of the taxpayers is not a 
good idea.
<P>
	For that reason among others, the Reform Party does not support 
an increased federal role in the mortgage market. We do not 
support increasing federal liabilities. We do not support federal 
meddling in the private sector and therefore, we do not support this 
bill.
<P>
	In conclusion, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' 
and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-108, an act to amend the 
National Housing Act, because the principle of the bill does not address the 
issue of transferring the responsibility of housing from the federal 
government to the provinces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The motion 
the hon. member just moved was a substantive motion and not an 
amendment to the motion now before the House. I do not believe it 
is in order.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We certainly take every 
consideration necessary before making the proper ruling. Having 
reviewed the full contents of the motion and its form as it is written 
here, the motion is in order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to speak about housing.
<P>
	Since giving my first speech in this House during the throne 
speech debate, I have pledged to be one of those members who tries 
to make a difference and tries to make things work.
<P>
	A wise man was once asked which was the most important level 
of government: provincial, federal or municipal. The wise man 
thought for a little while and responded by asking which was the 
most important leg of a three-legged stool.
<P>
	We have had the referendum. I must say that I work in this House 
with all members from all sectors, the independents, the BQ, the 
Reform Party, the NDP, the Liberal Party and the Conservative 
Party. There is a lot of talent. Many of us are spending a lot of time 
on other things when the taxpayers have indicated there are so 
many restructuring things happening and the Canadian economy 
needs to be addressed. Yet we get into partisan discussions which 
are sometimes pretty nonsensical. We talk about devolution, 
restructuring and downsizing. Some people do not even know what 
the heck they are talking about with regard to those.
<P>
	As a member of this House I am going to start talking directly to 
the Canadian people. They have sent us to this place to do a job. We 
have talents and we have to use those talents. We must use 
Canada's resources, both human and natural, to the best advantage 
for Canadians. Canadians expect to have jobs. They expect to have 
good health care and they expect to have good housing.
<P>
	To address one of the points raised by the hon. member of the 
Reform Party, I remind him that the mortgage insurance premiums 
charged by the CMHC are sufficient to meet the risks being 
assumed at no cost to the government. The viability of CMHC's 
mortgage insurance fund is assessed annually by an independent 
actuary. An actuarial evaluation of the fund as of September 30, 
1994 has confirmed its long term solvency.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16201"> 16201 </A></B>
<P>
	Since 1946 CMHC has returned $1 billion in the form of taxes 
and profits. The mortgage insurance fund contributed an additional 
$35 million in 1992 to the consolidated revenue fund. The member 
also needs to be reminded that the activities of the fund contribute 
to the stable supply of affordable housing for all Canadians, 
including the handicapped and poor people.
<P>
	No province has expressed an interest in moving into this sector 
of the economy. There is no duplication. A change in the market is 
essential for the viability of the fund. This balances the economic 
and budgetary risks. Clearly the third party is ignoring 320,000 
Canadians who have purchased homes throughout the land with the 
fund.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Before returning to the substance of the bill I would like to 
address some comments by a member of the Bloc Quebecois. On 
one hand we have the Reform Party balance sheet argument. On the 
other hand I had a lot of sympathy for my friend from the BQ 
because he was looking at disadvantaged people. He talked about 
the fact that some of them made only $30,000 and had problems.
<P>
	I will return to the facts. I say as a mayor of a community that we 
needed intervention by governments. There were slum landlords. 
There were cockroaches. There was inadequate housing. The heat 
would be turned off at certain periods of time. That intervention has 
brought real standards so that we could have good homes for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	The member opposite did not give the correct statistics with 
regard to the amount of funds spent in Quebec. I will address some 
of his comments. Between 1986 and 1993 Quebec received 29 per 
cent of all federal social housing units committed nationwide. In 
1994-95 in Quebec $357 million was spent on social housing. The 
member simply chooses to ignore the importance of that 
contribution.
<P>
	That contribution means that 140,000 units of social housing 
received federal assistance in Quebec. It also means that Canadians 
in Quebec have benefited from federal programs like the 
residential rehabilitation assistance program.
<P>
	One factor the member should be aware of is that the funding for 
new social housing commitments in Canada has been distributed 
according to a model established on need. That is why Quebec 
received 29 per cent of all federal units between 1986 and 1993. 
Additionally between 1992 and 1994 there were more than 53,000 
instances of first home loan insurance for Canadians in Quebec. 
This is one example of what the federal government can do to assist 
all Canadians.
<P>
	This program costs the government nothing. CMHC has returned 
more than $1 billion in profits and taxes to the federal government. 
Over and above this amount, the  federal government has received 
$55 million from the mortgage insurance fund. This amount was 
returned to the consolidated revenue fund in 1992. It is being 
applied to reduce the federal deficit.
<P>
	We have a great country in Canada. We have our problems but 
we have solutions to the problems. When we work collaboratively 
on the solutions the country will do well. That is why we are the 
best in the world, between number one and number three. That is 
why we have good standards.
<P>
	Notwithstanding that globally we have a lot of structural change, 
Canadians will come out better because we will apply the programs 
for which the government was elected. We have the talent to do it 
and we have the will to do it.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of Bill 
C-108, an act to amend the National Housing Act. This is an 
administrative bill, the purpose of which is to increase the ceiling 
of the CMHC mortgage loan insurance from the current $100 
billion to $150 billion.
<P>
	My colleague also described for us the importance of the role of 
the CMHC's mortgage loan insurance, the importance that it 
played and continues to play in helping Canadians to have access to 
home ownership.
<P>
	Home ownership is a cherished dream held by many Canadians 
and there are good reasons for it. Home equity is a major portion of 
wealth accumulated by households and has been a great source of 
retirement savings for Canadians. The concept of home speaks to 
one of our basic human needs. Home is a place where people feel 
secure. Owning a home gives people a stake in their community 
and a sense of belonging.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Home ownership is a concept that the people of Canada support. 
That is not likely to change at any time soon. It is therefore critical 
that CMHC is able to continue to provide mortgage loan insurance 
to Canadians today and in the future.
<P>
	One of the most important aspects of CMHC mortgage loan 
insurance is the public policy mandate to provide equal access to 
mortgage financing at the lowest possible cost for all Canadians 
regardless of where they live in Canada. Equal access is achieved 
through cross-subsidization. Surpluses generated from lower risk 
businesses are used to fund shortfalls in higher risk businesses.
<P>
	The public policy mandate of equal access distinguishes the 
CMHC in a major way from the private insurer. Without access to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16202"> 16202 </A></B>
<P>
CMHC mortgage loan insurance Canadians in some parts of the 
country would have to come up with a conventional 25 per cent of 
the value of the house as a down payment. Needless to say,  many 
Canadians would hardly ever be able to purchase a home if this 
were the case.
<P>
	CMHC's mortgage insurance is therefore critical in helping 
Canadians to access home ownership. CMHC has long recognized 
that the housing financial needs of Canadians are diverse. The 
corporation's mortgage loan insurance has traditionally 
demonstrated the flexibility to respond to varying needs.
<P>
	I refer to an example that has helped hundreds of Canadians 
realize the affordable home ownership dream. The manufactured 
housing or mobile home industry has contributed greatly to giving 
Canadians access to good quality, affordable housing. CMHC has 
been working in partnership with the manufactured housing 
industry for many years because of the importance of the housing 
sector in the economy of Canada as a whole.
<P>
	Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation introduced its 
chattel loan insurance program, known as CLIP, as a five-year 
experiment in 1988. The objectives of CLIP were twofold: first, to 
improve access to alternative forms of affordable housing without 
involving government expenditures and, second, to help place 
manufactured homes in a more competitive position with 
conventionally built homes.
<P>
	CMHC completed an evaluation of CLIP last year which 
confirmed that the program is an important instrument in 
increasing access to good quality affordable housing without 
involving government expenditures. The evaluation also confirmed 
that CLIP has had a positive impact on the manufactured housing 
industry and mobile home park developments.
<P>
	Following the results of the evaluation the minister responsible 
for CMHC was pleased to announce an expansion of the chattel 
loans insurance program. As a result it now includes new homes, 
resale homes and manufactured homes in Canada.
<P>
	CLIP is an affordable alternative for many of the approximately 
335,000 moderate income rental households that could not 
previously afford to purchase a mobile home. The CMHC and the 
manufactured housing industry have enjoyed a productive 
partnership for many years. They have been working together to 
help Canadians gain access to good quality, affordable housing and 
to enhance the viability of the industry. The enhancement of CLIP 
will lead to greater access to mobile homes as affordable options 
for many Canadians and will encourage growth in the housing 
industry.
<P>
	CMHC and the mobile home industry have done their part. The 
consumers have shown they are interested in mobile homes as a 
housing option. Certainly there can be no doubt of the importance 
of NHA insurance in making the program possible.
<P>
	This is only one example of how NHA mortgage insurance has 
met the specific need and why NHA mortgage insurance must be 
maintained as a public  policy instrument capable of evolving to 
meet the future housing needs of Canadians.
<P>
	With any eye on future needs CMHC is currently working to 
develop a variety of new housing finance instruments made 
possible by innovative uses of mortgage loan insurance. In 
developing new products CMHC is looking to the challenge the 
creativity of the financial community to ensure that the largest 
possible number of borrowers can find a product in the marketplace 
to meet their precise needs. A variety of choices will encourage 
lenders to compete on a basis of service and product 
differentiation.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	The financial environment in which CMHC's mortgage loan 
insurance business operates has undergone significant changes in 
recent years. The introduction of one-stop financial services, the 
increased use of technological systems to support businesses and 
operations, and the need to manage expenditures and facilitate 
better risk management are factors that have had an impact on the 
way in which CMHC runs its mortgage insurance operations.
<P>
	CMHC has responded to a changing environment by continually 
reviewing its processes for delivering mortgage insurance and 
introducing improvements and efficiencies where needed. 
Ensuring that CMHC's mortgage loan insurance remains relevant 
and capable of responding to the changing housing and financial 
needs of Canadians adds a major focus to the activity of the 
corporation.
<P>
	CMHC is now focusing on the introduction of new processing 
mechanisms which will utilize the capabilities or electronic 
communications between CMHC and its approved lender clients. 
The enhancements will allow the corporation to serve better the 
needs of the Canadian housing consumer.
<P>
	Mortgage loan insurance has played a significant public policy 
role in the past. CMHC's stewardship will continue to evolve to 
meet the changing needs of Canadians and the financial 
community.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have one question for the hon. member in relation to the overall 
concept of CMHC.
<P>
	My understanding is that it was felt necessary in the past that we 
had to develop this corporation to address the needs of Canadians 
who were incapable of meeting the 25 per cent, et cetera, to realize 
their own homes.
<P>
	If we are to put another $50 billion into it, it implies that more 
Canadians are in need of it. Since the economic situation in the first 
place did not allow them to buy their homes we created the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16203"> 16203 </A></B>
<P>
program and now we are expanding it. Would it not be better to put 
the $50 million into the economy so the people can get work,  meet 
the 25 per cent requirement and reduce CMHC instead of 
increasing it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jackson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
question. The corporation and the Government of Canada are 
responding to the housing need.
<P>
	In the construction industry housing is a major motor of the 
Canadian economy. When the housing sector falters the whole 
system falters. Many people are looking for jobs right now. In my 
earlier dissertation I alluded to the fact that nobody in the private 
markets is not responding.
<P>
	The initiative does not cost the government a cent. Using my old 
hat as mayor of Owen Sound, we have had private sector and 
CMHC interventions. The main role of CMHC is to make sure that 
handicapped people are looked after, that the heating requirements 
and other construction requirements are met before they are 
allowed insurance. There has to be a balance in the system. If the 
government intervenes too much it probably affects the private 
sector people. In the communities there is a groundswell to keep 
that from happening.
<P>
	I assure the member there is a need for the initiative. Infusion in 
this category is probably better than putting it in other places 
because of the spinoff effects of building homes in communities. 
There will be a multiplier effect on the dollar and job creation. The 
activity it will create in the hardware store, the corner store and for 
construction workers, et cetera, will be enormous.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	It is simply that there is a real need and it is a great thing to 
happen. As I have said before, health, work and housing are the 
three most important things for Canadians. This initiative helps 
those exactly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise again to tell the Canadian audience that the speech made by the 
hon. member for North Vancouver was somewhat wrong. First, I 
wonder if he has read the bill and second, I do not know why he 
disagreed so strongly with the fact that this is a cost revenue neutral 
program.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, the Government of Canada made money in 
1994. The mortgage insurance fund gave $55 million back to the 
treasury. It is beyond my wildest imagination why members of the 
Reform Party would so strongly object to this bill.
<P>
	My colleague from Bruce-Grey made an eloquent speech. It 
was obvious that he had read and understood the thrust of the bill 
which says essentially that $50 billion in liability will be added to 
the $100 billion that the Government of Canada already has to 
provide those Canadians with low incomes the backing to be able 
to own their own homes. This is extremely important  because in 
many cases a 25 per cent requirement for a down payment is not 
there. They simply do not have the revenue. However, if they have 
5 per cent or 10 per cent, the Government of Canada comes in and 
guarantees their loan with any bank in Canada.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague from Bruce-Grey how 
important is this initiative for those Canadians who would not 
otherwise have the opportunity to buy their dream home?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jackson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the CMHC gives Canadians a choice 
of mortgage loan insurance. Without the CMHC Canadians would 
be served by a private sector monopoly. The risks with a monopoly 
are higher prices and fewer choices, making housing less 
affordable, particularly for first time home buyers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise 
and speak on Bill C-108, an act to amend the National Housing Act.
<P>
	In 1987, CMHC introduced National Housing Act mortgage 
backed securities, a new way of attracting investors into the 
mortgage market and increasing the supply of funds available for 
home buyers. Since then the program has become a key part of the 
financial system in two respects: first, as an attractive real estate 
based investment offering very good yields and maximum safety; 
second, as a source of financing for the Canadian housing industry. 
The mortgages are all insured under the National Housing Act.
<P>
	The fact that these blue chip securities are the only ones of their 
kind backed by the federal government makes them as solid as 
Canada Savings Bonds but with the added advantage of higher 
yields. Yields are greater because their liquidity is market based 
and their value fluctuates with market interest rates.
<P>
	MBSs help to increase the amount of private capital available to 
finance the construction and purchase of homes and rental 
accommodation and encourages competition in the mortgage 
market. MBSs help to support the availability of lower mortgage 
interest rates by assisting smaller approved lenders to compete with 
the larger ones.
<P>
	MBSs have also improved the security of tenure for Canadians 
through longer term mortgages. Before they were introduced, 
mortgage terms usually ranged from six months to three years and 
now consumers can benefit with terms of up to 25 years. Over $25 
billion worth of mortgage backed securities have been issued since 
the initiative began in 1987.
<P>
	Turning to the bill itself, it is quite straightforward. It is intended 
to increase the maximum aggregate mortgage loan insurance from 
$100 billion to $150 billion. It sounds like a large sum of money, 
but at the same time we have heard members on this side of the 
House explain that this is really a profit making venture on the part 
of  the government, which contributes to the reduction of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16204"> 16204 </A></B>
<P>
national debt and at the same time encourages housing 
construction.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Many really do not understand what we are talking about when 
we say mortgage insurance. Some people have the view that it is 
like life insurance and it is something that is put on a mortgage to 
insure someone's life. Most lending institutions will only lend up 
to 75 per cent of the value of a house or a property available for 
construction, so there is the leftover portion of roughly 25 per cent. 
That can only be accommodated in one of two ways, either the 
person who is building the home or buying the home comes up with 
that 25 per cent, or the financial institution receives a guarantee 
that it will be paid back that 25 per cent. That is where mortgage 
insurance comes in and that is why it is essential.
<P>
	It is clear from everything I have read that if mortgage insurance 
was not available for that 25 per cent, housing construction would 
literally grind to a halt and we would see no activity at all.
<P>
	I have gone through the joys of constructing a house of my own. 
I use the term joy very loosely. It is a challenge more than a joy. I 
contracted out the work myself, which means I used to be seven 
feet tall and have no grey hair, but after having being beat up by all 
of the contractors and chasing around, I realized exactly what goes 
into constructing a home.
<P>
	What I was struck by in the process was the amount of 
employment created in the construction of just one home. People 
have no real appreciation of the facts because a lot of people have 
contractors build their homes and do not really see the full effect of 
what one house has in the construction industry.
<P>
	I had five framers working on my house for six weeks. Those are 
the people who build the house and do all the rough construction. I 
had two plumbers working on my house for at least two weeks and 
three electricians working for another two to three weeks. Eight 
roofers put on the roof in two days, which I was very impressed 
with, but there were eight people scampering all over the roof. Four 
people put up the gyprock and another two put on the plaster. As 
well, there were painters and finish carpenters.
<P>
	I was lucky to have fixed contracts so that I did not get beat up by 
the time that it took on this particular contract, or else I really 
would have been looking stupid, but fixed contracts are very 
important in these circumstances. What struck me was the sheer 
number of jobs created. That does not even account for the other 
people who were involved, the building supply people, the 
manufacturers of the pipes, the sinks, the toilets, the sewer pipes 
and those types of things, the cabinet makers, the people who do 
the hardwood floors and the carpets.
<P>
	I am sure I have forgotten some of the people who were actually 
involved in the process. My wife is sitting at home telling me I 
have forgotten about this and I have forgotten about that because 
she did it all and that is why I do not know. She did most of the 
contracting rather than me.
<P>
	The fact is that literally hundreds of jobs are created because one 
person chooses to build a house. If we can make that happen 
throughout the country, then we are really going to be creating a 
large amount of employment. It is clear that housing is a major 
contributor to the creation and the maintenance of employment. 
That is why mortgage insurance and CMHC have a very critical 
role to play.
<P>
	In this major indication of commitment, the government is 
saying it wants to spur on the housing industry. For those on the 
opposite side that say it is crazy, that we should not do it, that we 
should let the marketplace do it on its own, I would like to read 
some of the stats that are put out by the housing industry.
<P>
	In a press release in September of this year CMHC forecast 
housing starts of 112,500 for 1995, an astonishing 30,000 drop 
from the initial forecast of 141,000 starts at the beginning of the 
year and far below national housing requirements of 165,000 starts. 
While the news is a little better in 1996 with CMHC forecasting 
another 127,000 starts, the housing industry is at recession levels. 
Ways have to be found to encourage the housing industry because it 
creates the employment Canada needs.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	The press release went on to state that lower interest rates are not 
the cure all for the current situation. Lower rates will not address 
the principal problem, the loss of confidence among many 
Canadians in their employment prospects.
<P>
	That is why we have a double barrelled task here. First, to create 
that confidence, which is what the Liberal government is doing 
now by getting our financial house in order, while at the same time 
providing those mechanisms like mortgage insurance so that the 
housing industry can easily facilitate the increase in construction 
which is necessary. I want to emphasize that the key is confidence. 
We have to establish confidence. We have now turned the corner on 
the referendum. It is time to start talking about confidence, about 
creating employment and carrying this country into the 21st 
century.
<P>
	New approaches and new directions for financing the housing 
industry have to be found. I know the industry has brought forward 
a number of imaginative approaches. It talked about RRSP loans 
for mortgages and all of those things. I found it interesting to look 
at some of the things that Central Mortgage and Housing is actually 
doing now. I thought I should read those into the  record because 
they are important as we try to grapple with housing. If this country 
is going to succeed, one of the areas which will help cure crime 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16205"> 16205 </A></B>
<P>
problems, create jobs and, in effect, fuel a positive, caring society 
is through the provision of adequate and proper housing.
<P>
	Here are some of the objectives of the National Housing Act and 
what CMHC supports. Through social housing, CMHC works with 
provincial, territorial and municipal housing agencies and with 
local non-profit organizations, co-operatives, urban native groups 
and First Nations, for those whose needs cannot be met by the 
private market. Assistance is provided to more than 661,000 social 
housing units.
<P>
	CMHC's direct lending program enables CMHC to act as a break 
even lender to public and private, non-profit and co-operative 
projects that are subsidized by CMHC.
<P>
	CMHC is helping the Canadian housing industry to promote the 
Canadian housing system abroad by helping to develop housing 
export strategies to assist the Canadian housing industry market 
Canadian housing technology, products and services in world 
markets.
<P>
	CMHC's Canada Centre for Public-Private Partnerships in 
Housing facilitates housing partnership projects involving the 
production of affordable and accessible housing for low to 
moderate income households without ongoing federal subsidies.
<P>
	CMHC continues to provide leadership in improving not only 
Canadian but international housing standards. Those are just a few 
of the things that are ongoing.
<P>
	In conclusion, this bill will be pooh-poohed by the members 
opposite, some saying it is too little and some saying it is too much. 
Mortgage insurance has been one of those key catalysts to keeping 
the housing industry functioning and a positive contributor to the 
economy and to the creation of jobs. At the same time, as has been 
mentioned before, it makes a contribution to the reduction of our 
debt as CMHC returns a profit to the Government of Canada.
<P>
	I am sure that members opposite will see their way clear to 
quickly support and pass this piece of legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am really pleased to hear the hon. member's comments 
regarding this bill and the positive forces it will have on the 
economy of our country.
<P>
	Only a few weeks ago I had the ambassador from Poland in my 
riding of Cumberland-Colchester, Nova Scotia. The purpose of 
his visit was to look at housing for Poland and eastern Europe. The 
interest is there because they know that Canada and particularly 
Atlantic Canada have numerous sawmills making new houses 
constructed of wood, high insulation products and meeting the 
R-2000 code for insulation standards.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	When we had the G-7 conference in Halifax in June, we 
produced a G-7 model home. This was the interest the east 
European countries had in looking at Canada and the great potential 
in development. Could the hon. member elaborate a bit on the 
value of this construction, on the high prestige of construction of 
homes, on the value to the world structure, on the peace and 
economic development it will bring, as well as bringing jobs here 
at home and adding to that great potential of export for our 
country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rideout:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her question. 
It is an interesting one, because in a country the size of Canada, 
with a population of roughly 30 million, the key to a lot of our 
economic success is the role we are to play on the international 
market and what we will accomplish there.
<P>
	What is very gratifying for me in my role as parliamentary 
secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources is dealing with 
companies that are actually building model homes or sending 
building materials into the international marketplace.
<P>
	I recently had a meeting with a model home builder who is 
building homes for the Japanese market. A lot of people said that 
would not happen, that we could not crack that market. The 
manufacturer was telling me that he cannot supply the demand, that 
if he could generate more he would. The market is flooded with the 
types of housing that do not fit the strict criteria necessary in the 
Japanese market. Canadians have developed the techniques, the 
building standards, and those types of things that make it easier for 
us to introduce our products into the international marketplace.
<P>
	I hear the Reform Party from time to time talk about doing away 
with the Department of Natural Resources, saying that the federal 
government has no role to play. As we set the standards so that we 
can meet the international criteria and the International Standards 
Association requirements, as we do the research and the 
development that is necessary and develop the new technologies 
that allow our industries to compete in the international 
marketplace, we are making that contribution to creating jobs in 
Canada. That is where the housing market has an integral role to 
play.
<P>
	In my home province, Kent Homes, part of a larger company, is 
building model homes and is trying to sell those all around the 
world. Just as I described the number of people who were working 
on my house when I was building it, the same sorts of things are 
going on in the construction of model homes. These are job 
creators. They are a transfer of money, jobs, and growth to the 
international marketplace so that we can then reap the returns from 
those activities.
<P>
	The Department of Natural Resources has an excellent role to 
play, CMHC has a role to play, and we at the  federal government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16206"> 16206 </A></B>
<P>
level have a very important role to play in creating employment 
through housing. This bill will make one small step for that 
approach.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In closing the intervention to 
the hon. parliamentary secretary, the word from Moncton from 
many subcontractors is they wish he had stayed in Ottawa and let 
Mrs. Rideout look after the contracting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a lot has been said about 
CMHC's involvement in providing insurance so that more people 
can afford homes. I would like to touch on the area of social 
housing and the way the National Housing Act and CMHC have 
helped in the social housing. I would like to use experiences in my 
riding.
<P>
	Canadians of Lithuanian descent in my constituency saw the 
need for housing for seniors. In no way could these seniors afford 
individual homes, et cetera, so they built Vilnius Manor. How did 
they build it? They got a long term mortgage from CMHC at a very 
low percentage over a long period of time. Today these seniors are 
enjoying one of the most beautiful homes in Toronto, probably. In 
this home the seniors not only mix with Canadians of other 
heritages but they can also hear their own language. They can also 
see part of their own culture that they brought with them to Canada. 
It is a real success story, situated right on Bloor Street in Toronto.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	An example of a similar project, again funded or assisted by 
CMHC, is Copernicus Lodge. A group of Polish descent built 
Copernicus Lodge as a home for seniors. It was filled up before it 
was even completed. In these models some people have to pay the 
full rent and others get a subsidized rent. Again, there is a women's 
auxiliary with this Copernicus Lodge who provide activities for the 
seniors. You will not see happier Canadian citizens than the ones 
living at Copernicus Lodge.
<P>
	Another example in my constituency is Wawel Villa. Again 
thanks to CMHC funding a group of seniors can live in Wawel Villa 
just opposite High Park. They can walk through the park and enjoy 
life in their older years.
<P>
	I had the experience also of helping Canadians of Latvian 
descent to build Kristus Darzs in the Woodbridge area. Again, this 
home would never have been built if it were not for the assistance 
of long term loans from CMHC.
<P>
	I hope this program will never be cut. We have thousands of such 
homes across Canada providing comfortable living for those in 
these kinds of homes.
<P>
	A problem is beginning to develop that I would like to share with 
the minister, the mover of this bill. As these people age in these 
homes they now need more intensive  care. Many need ongoing 
nursing care. Many require chronic care assistance and they do not 
want to move out. These homes were not built for these kinds of 
clients.
<P>
	Do they move out? Where do they move to? Most of them want 
to stay. All the homes I have mentioned are looking. Copernicus 
Lodge has already built a second phase. They have floors that 
provide more intensive care for the people who need it. This is a 
problem that is facing our country. We build affordable homes for 
senior citizens as they get into their eighties and nineties. And I am 
so pleased that many are living into their eighties and nineties, and 
some are reaching a hundred and over. But they need special care.
<P>
	Rather than move the people out, we have to provide in these 
homes more intensive assistance, which requires a different kind of 
personnel. It requires highly trained nurses, psychologists, social 
workers, and so on. Yet these are the areas where unfortunately the 
Conservative provincial government is cutting back. I do not know 
why the Premier of Ontario wants to cut back on the backs of 
seniors. I believe we have to reduce our deficit. We have to run a 
much leaner government, but not a meaner government, such as the 
province of Ontario appears to be doing. This is an important issue, 
which will be facing the country even more intensively.
<P>
	This brings me to the issue of jurisdictions. We have been talking 
over the last month about perhaps moving some of the powers the 
federal government has to provincial jurisdictions and co-operating 
with the provinces to decide who can deliver these programs the 
best.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	We are talking about federal programs in housing. The province 
of Ontario also is involved in housing. If someone in the greater 
Toronto area wants a subsidized unit, they go to the metropolitan 
Toronto level. The city of Toronto has a program called City 
Homes to help people with affordable housing. There are four 
levels of government-federal, provincial, metro Toronto, and 
Toronto-all involved in housing.
<P>
	If we want to keep the country together, these are the areas we 
must look at to see who can deliver the housing programs best, 
most efficiently, et cetera. And let us talk with the other levels of 
government. If there is one level that can do it better, fine, it can 
take over a certain area. If the federal government can do it better, 
it would take over, with the caution that the federal government 
will still need a strong central government to maintain standards 
coast to coast to coast, be it in housing, day care, or health care.
<P>
	I wanted to put on the record the kind of assistance my 
constituency received thanks to the type of bill we are amending 
here today, the National Housing Act.
<P>
	The House has heard the problems that are facing the Parkdale 
area of my riding, with prostitution, drug trade,  high school 
dropouts, et cetera. We are trying to analyse why in one part of my 
riding there is such a heavy concentration of all these social 
problems yet in another part of the riding there are not the same 
problems. One thing, in my analysis, that contributed to this is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16207"> 16207 </A></B>
<P>
lack of home ownership in the troubled area. In that area only six 
per cent of the population own their homes.
<P>
	Again, if all levels of government got together to make it 
possible for people to afford their own homes and build a family 
unit, et cetera, I think we would reduce the numbers and the kinds 
of problems facing the Parkdale area. We are working on it, but we 
do need help from legislation such as we have here today.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's comments about the value 
of housing to seniors. I am sure every member in the House can 
appreciate that in his or her own community.
<P>
	So often we hear criticism about CMHC, about government 
involvement in mortgages. I would like to ask the hon. member 
why the government is involved or should be involved in the 
issuing of mortgages for housing here in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, wherever government involvement 
creates unfair competition, I feel government has no right to be 
there. However, the mortgage insurance that is provided with this 
legislation is fair and equal competition. It provides insurance for 
people who would normally not get it through private insurance 
companies. By providing this alternative, it keeps the rates down 
also. If we believe in the free market forces, which I do, it is good 
for consumers, because it does keep the rates down and it makes 
mortgage insurance available to those who otherwise would not get 
the insurance and consequently would not be able to purchase a 
home.
<P>
	We made some amendments not long ago about allowing first 
time homebuyers to make a down payment of just 5 per cent. This 
was another good move to make home ownership more accessible 
and affordable to more Canadians. It is the same with the 
insurance.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has been 
interesting to listen to the comments of my colleague and others 
who have spoken on the bill and to understand the intricacy of this 
legislation. It touches the aspect of social housing, to which my 
colleague has just referred. Previously we heard how it will impact 
the building trades and local economies across the country.
<P>
	We also understand that this legislation will have an impact on 
our ability to trade in foreign markets. As the hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs knows, this is an 
important aspect of this legislation as well. Here we have a bill 
presented in the House of Commons that is prepared for the 
national  good and yet we have the third party challenging it, 
wanting this responsibility for housing to be devolved to the 
provincial level.
<P>
	I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary if he can see any 
real value in that kind of solution, given the kinds of things that we 
are hearing and the facilitative role that this particular and single 
piece of legislation has for all Canadians in so many different ways.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her concerns 
and for raising these issues. She ran and I ran and I think most 
people in this House ran on one theme in our platform, which was 
prosperity and job creation.
<P>
	The more homes made available to Canadians the more jobs are 
created. When you consider what is bought when someone 
purchases a home, people mention immediately fridges, stoves, et 
cetera, but those you need in an apartment when you do not buy a 
home. Think of all the other infrastructure, the landscaping, the 
garden, the paving of the driveway and how many jobs this creates.
<P>
	I am glad we are having this debate because the member 
mentioned her experience with the Polish ambassador and his 
interest in our housing system. When I was taking cour des français 
in Saint-Jean, I met with a representative of a company from 
Quebec who wants to export 240 homes to Krakow, Poland. The 
technology is totally Canadian, totally Quebec. It would be shipped 
out to Poland all prefab and later put together.
<P>
	Imagine the kind of job creation that project alone would have. 
However, the problem in Poland was that people cannot get 
mortgages to buy those homes. Poland is looking very closely at 
the legislation we are discussing today because through such a 
program the people in Krakow, Poland could buy those 240 homes.
<P>
	If it is successful, we can repeat this model not only in Poland, 
but in Ukraine, in Russia, all over the world. This would be a niche 
for Canadian manufacturers of housing. This would be a niche for 
getting into the export field.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade is now looking at how we can help the SMEs, the small and 
medium sized companies, to get into the export market. We have 
such great entrepreneurs who are sharing their expertise with our 
foreign affairs committee. Again, I keep stressing jobs because if 
you increase exports by $1 million, you have created about 35 new 
jobs. When you are exporting in the billions, imagine the kind of 
jobs that will create.
<P>
	We have a beautiful country. We have a country like no other in 
the world. Let us stick together. Let us co-operate with every 
province and the nation. Let us co-operate with every province and 
the world. We have expertise such as I have mentioned here and we 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16208"> 16208 </A></B>
<P>
will keep  our number one position. Not only that, but we will 
improve the lifestyle of people in other countries.
<P>
	I thank the member for that question.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The question is on the 
amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour of the 
amendment will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the nays have 
it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 
45, the recorded division stands deferred until Monday, November 
6, at the ordinary hour of daily adjournment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you would find a disposition 
on the part of the House to call it 1.30 p.m.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Shall I call it 1.30 p.m.?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> So ordered.
<P>
	It being 1.30 p.m. the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-343, an act to amend the Criminal Code (arrest without warrant), 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, Bill C-343 which I am happy to address 
today is not a lengthy bill. I do not believe it will require a lot of 
debate. I would like to read the actual amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Subsection 495(1) of the Criminal Code is amended by adding the following 
immediately after paragraph (c):</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) a person who has committed the offence described in subsection 740(1) or 
who on reasonable grounds, the peace officer believes has committed or is 
about to commit the offence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The purpose of this bill is to give the police or a peace officer the 
power to arrest without a warrant a person who is in breach of a 
probation order binding the person.
<P>
	This is not an idea that was dreamed up out of the blue. It came 
to me from talking with a number of police officers during many of 
the ride-alongs I had with various police units throughout the 
country including Calgary and particularly Toronto. The officers 
had mentioned to me on a number of occasions that if they had the 
power and authority to arrest individuals who were in breach of a 
probation order, it would be a good preventive measure to stop a lot 
of crimes.
<P>
	Let me give a couple of examples. When I was riding in a 
Toronto police car a couple of officers identified a young offender 
who walked by on the street at two o'clock in the morning. They 
named him and said he was a young offender who was on probation 
for dealing drugs. He was not even supposed to be on the streets 
past six o'clock in the evening.
<P>
	I asked what they would be able to do. They said that they would 
take the name and report to the probation unit that this individual 
was in breach of probation. However, they had no authority to do 
anything. A young fellow who had been convicted of drug dealing 
being out at two o'clock in the morning probably meant that 
something was not right. It is the belief of those officers, and they 
have a number of cases they can name, that had they had the 
authority and the ability to take the person into custody for breach 
of probation that the crime, which was committed later in the 
evening by the individual, would have been prevented.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Another example. An individual, because of an alcohol problem, 
was on probation for either a domestic dispute or for committing 
crimes while under the influence. Whether there has been a court 
order or this individual is under probation, the individual is not 
allowed to enter a bar or a drinking establishment. This is part of 
the probation order. Police have told me that a number of times 
they see such individuals breaking their probation orders by either 
being seen consuming alcohol or going into places where they were 
directed not to go.
<P>
	All the police can do is report to a probation officer which may 
take as much as one or two weeks because of the lack of manpower. 
Had they been able to just arrest the individual on breach of 
probation, summary conviction, that it would have prevented 
problems later in the evening.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16209"> 16209 </A></B>
<P>
	A number of other times in one particular area there had been 
young offenders arrested on 52 counts of break and enter. These 
are young offenders who are required to attend school, are required 
to be at home by six o'clock in the evening and are required to 
do a number of different things. They were obviously in breach 
of probation on a number of occasions by being out very late at 
night. There were 52 charges of break and enter but only one 
conviction. They were found guilty on all charges. There was the 
one conviction but they were not incarcerated. They were put on 
probation and were expected to follow the rules.
<P>
	More break and enters followed because these individuals were 
out late, clumped together and kept stealing. The police said: ``If 
only we had the authority and the power we could have prevented 
some of these problems''. They do not even have to arrest and lock 
them up. The fact that they would have the authority to stop them 
and ask them what they are doing breaking their probation orders, 
maybe giving them an opportunity to get the heck out of there and 
go home, would help. However they need the authority to do it.
<P>
	This small little bill is just one measure that would help a great 
deal in the prevention of crime throughout the country. It is 
something the police have asked for. It is something that I have 
agreed to submit on their behalf. It was awhile before my name was 
drawn. I was lucky enough to get it drawn so I am putting this 
forward.
<P>
	In the near future I will also be putting forward legislation that 
would give police the authority to arrest people who are in 
violation of parole and statutory release. Whenever there are 
conditions to a release somebody should have the authority to do 
something when they are in obvious breach of those conditions.
<P>
	I do not believe any member in the House can say for a moment 
that it would not be a good idea to stop crime before it happens. 
There is no doubt in the minds of all the enforcement officers I 
have talked to that if they had the authority, which they do not have 
now, if they had the ability, which they do not have, they would be 
more than pleased to do these things because they feel that would 
be a major part of their job. Let us face it. Enforcement of the law is 
a major part of their job, but so is prevention. If those in the 
enforcement agencies can prevent it from happening, they do so.
<P>
	That is why they stop drunk people from getting behind the 
wheel of a car and driving off. They do not wait until a drunk 
person drives off, they prevent it by trying to stop that person from 
getting behind the wheel.
<P>
	This is a perfect example of something this House should do by 
adopting this kind of measure. I do not have much more to say on 
it. It is a common sense measure and does not encroach on 
anyone's rights or privileges. We always seem to be worried about 
the charter and the interference we may run into on a charter 
challenge.
<P>
	The supreme court judges surely would get the message from 
legislators that this kind of legislation is serving a purpose. This 
purpose appears in the red book. It is in the Reform Party policies. 
It is in the Bloc policies. One of the policies of every party in this 
House is to make Canada a safer and better place in which to live. 
This kind of legislation would do that.
<P>
	I encourage support from everyone in the House to put into the 
hands of the police departments throughout the country, the power 
and the ability to do this. They do not have it now. I repeat, they 
cannot do it now. Let us make it possible for them to do so. Let us 
take the burden off the understaffed and undermanned probation 
departments. They are running at an unbelievable pace trying to 
keep up with all the difficulties they now have.
<P>
	It is a way of accomplishing what we all said we would do in our 
policies. It is a small way, but a good place to start. I suggest that 
we adopt this bill immediately.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate. I see the 
member for New Westminster-Burnaby rising. It is not for me to 
manage the operation of the House but of course in private 
members' hour the mover of the motion has 20 minutes and the 
other speakers have 10. I do not believe the member for Wild Rose 
gave any indication as to whether he might be splitting his time. He 
did use only 10 of his 20 minutes. Perhaps the member for Wild 
Rose could help the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not make any arrangements 
to split my time. It does not take 20 minutes to talk on this topic. I 
am willing to share my time with either one of my colleagues, with 
agreement.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Upon that clarification, 
certainly if another member of the hon. member's party wishes to 
split that time, there is 10 minutes remaining. I will recognize the 
member for New Westminster-Burnaby.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, after further consultation with my 
colleagues, let us go in the rotation order.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> As you wish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-343. Let me begin by acknowledging 
what I understand to be the objectives of the member in putting this 
bill forward.
<P>
	The objective is to make it easier for a peace officer to arrest 
someone who is breaking the terms of a probation order. The target 
group for this measure is anyone who is under a probation order. 
Such an order could include many types of conditions, for example, 
that the probationer refrain from alcohol, stay within the 
jurisdiction, avoid use of firearms, or attend counselling.
<P>
	We may be talking about family situations where someone is 
convicted of an offence and is ordered to keep away from other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16210"> 16210 </A></B>
<P>
family members. It might be a  situation where an offender is 
ordered to keep away from public parks or school yards.
<P>
	Failure to comply with a probation order is an offence under the 
Criminal Code. I suggest that this is good criminal justice policy. 
Under the current provisions, an offender's probation can be 
revoked because of a serious breach of a probation condition. He 
can be arrested and charged for the distinct offence of breaching a 
condition.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Let us examine some situations and where it leaves a police 
officer who encounters someone who appears to be breaching one 
of the conditions of his probation. The police officer's authority is 
defined in section 495 of the Criminal Code which authorizes the 
peace officer to arrest without warrant a person found in the course 
of committing a summary conviction offence.
<P>
	Say for example the peace officer finds someone loitering 
around a public park where children are playing. If the peace 
officer is suspicious of the person he sees loitering at the park, he 
can investigate in the usual way. If he finds that the person is bound 
by a probation order which forbids the person going near public 
parks, he may actually be in a position to arrest him on the spot. 
Just being present in the park may constitute an active criminal 
offence.
<P>
	At the moment, breach of probation is a summary conviction 
offence and the peace officer's authority to arrest without warrant 
is limited. To arrest without a warrant the peace officer currently 
must satisfy the conditions set out in section 495 of the Criminal 
Code which states that a peace officer shall not arrest a person 
without a warrant where on reasonable grounds the public interest 
may be satisfied without so arresting the person at the time.
<P>
	In making this judgment the peace officer must have regard to all 
the circumstances, including the need to establish the identity of 
the person to secure or preserve evidence concerning the offence, 
or to prevent a continuation or repetition of that offence or another 
offence. In effect the peace officer has some discretion to arrest on 
the spot but he must exercise that discretion according to several 
criteria laid out in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Bill C-343 would make the policeman's job easier by freeing 
him from having to satisfy these conditions. If breach of a 
probation order were an indictable offence, fewer conditions would 
need to be satisfied. In that case the police officer could arrest the 
person if he believed on reasonable grounds that the person had 
committed the offence or was about to commit it.
<P>
	This is precisely what Bill C-41 does. Bill C-41 deals with 
Criminal Code amendments to improve and modernize our system 
of sentencing. It makes failure to comply with a probation order 
under section 740 a hybrid offence, that is, one that can be 
proceeded with by  way of indictment or by summary conviction 
procedure. Hybrid offences are considered the same as indictable 
offences for purposes of arrest without warrant.
<P>
	The bottom line is that the police officer will now have the 
flexibility the member for Wild Rose would like. The police officer 
can arrest without warrant where he believes the person has 
breached or is about to breach a condition of his probation and not 
just during the course of the offence.
<P>
	Bill C-41 received royal assent on July 13, 1995 but is not yet in 
force. Therefore the first part of Bill C-343 will be unnecessary as 
soon as Bill C-41 comes into force.
<P>
	I would also like to bring to the attention of this House another 
relevant modification included in Bill C-41. It is a modification to 
section 740 that may make it easier for the police officer to do his 
job. Section 740 refers to someone who ``wilfully'' refuses to 
comply with a probation order. Bill C-41 changes the wording to 
``without reasonable excuse''. This may make it easier for a police 
officer to legitimately challenge a person, in the situation I have 
described, to provide a reasonable excuse for being in the park or 
near the school yard in apparent violation of the probation order.
<P>
	Bill C-343 would give more freedom to arrest than Bill C-41 
would give. Bill C-343 would create an exception to the general 
rule for this offence of failure to comply with a probation order. 
The arresting officer would not have to bother considering the 
overall circumstances, or whether it was necessary to take the 
person into custody in order to establish his identity for example.
<P>
	It is evident there is a preference in our criminal law for using 
appearance notices or summons as opposed to arresting persons on 
the spot. Taking someone into custody without warrant should only 
be done where it is necessary. Alternatively the peace officer is 
expected to seek a warrant or issue the appearance notice.
<P>
	Why should we make the breach of a probation order an offence 
different from most other offences in the Criminal Code? Why 
should the peace officer not be bound to respect the safeguards 
placed into the code to guarantee basic rights and liberties?
<P>
	It is unacceptable to exempt this particular offence from the 
rules governing arrest powers for other criminal offences. I am not 
sure whether an argument could not be made that such an 
exemption is arbitrary or otherwise excessive and therefore 
contrary to the charter of rights and freedoms. The real issue here is 
controlling the risk to the community or to particular individuals 
presented in various situations.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Probationers are subject to the active supervision of probation 
services and this supervision provides an additional measure of 
control. Probation officers are experienced in judging when a 
breach of probation order  is merely a technical violation or 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16211"> 16211 </A></B>
<P>
something more serious that deserves revocation of the probation 
or an arrest and separate charges under section 740 of the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	Police and probation officers work together to monitor these 
conditions. I believe peace officers have what they need to handle 
almost every situation. If a suspect is actually committing the 
offence of breach of probation, they have authority to arrest that 
person without a mandate. Similarly, they have that authority when 
they believe the suspect has committed the offence or is about to 
commit an indictable offence. Alternatively, they may choose to 
issue an appearance notice or even seek a warrant.
<P>
	They are not overly restricted in their ability to arrest someone 
who is hanging around a park or drinking alcohol or attempting to 
approach the residence of a former spouse without a reasonable 
excuse. If they believe a loiterer is about to repeat that offence or 
commit another one, they can exercise their good judgment and 
arrest that person.
<P>
	I do not believe the criminal law modifications proposed in Bill 
C-343 are necessary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just a few extemporaneous, spur of the moment 
observations to make.
<P>
	Perhaps I can provide some perspective on the bill, seeing that 
my previous profession was that of probation officer and I was in a 
situation where administratively I dealt with the relationship with 
the 24-hour contact agency, which is the police, and saw the 
behaviour of probationers. Often on a Friday or Saturday night 
things were happening in the community, but the probation officer 
generally worked in an office in a day situation.
<P>
	Certainly the well meaning intention of this private member's 
bill comes from legitimate police concern. It also can be seen that it 
comes from public concern. I am adding that it also comes from 
criminal justice probation officer concern.
<P>
	The bill gives some reasonable discretion for giving additional 
tools to the police. That is not to say, as the member for 
Lanark-Carleton would say, that this is unjustifiable in the 
panoply of what is available to police officers. However, we must 
look at what are the administrative instructions to police 
specifically concerning their justice time and the allocation of 
dollars. They are under administrative control to be very careful 
not to arrest on a summary conviction unless they are absolutely 
pushed over the limit and it can be justified.
<P>
	The operational difference between what happens on the street 
and the permutations that may be technically possible under the 
Criminal Code are quite different.
<P>
	I am saying that the bill is going in the right direction because it 
conforms to the principle of minimal  intervention and intrusion to 
achieve a public good. Rather than trying to change the offence 
from summary to an indictable offence, it looks at a specific 
exception to the law, which is a minimal change. It is the minimum 
possible to achieve the objective. It provides an exception to the 
summary procedure in a special case where the police officer 
decides for the general social good that it needs to be done. 
Currently, because of administrative procedures those are simply 
avoided and discounted by saying we really cannot intervene. Why 
should we do this?
<P>
	The administration of justice has been brought into disrepute by 
the current operation in the streets. Probation orders are often seen 
to be not worth the paper they were written on. Orders are given 
and they must be obeyed. They will be obeyed increasingly if there 
are regular consequences that flow. We are talking about general 
deterrence and the community reputation that develops around the 
operation of these court orders, especially conditions of probation 
such as not to enter premises where alcohol is sold or not to be out 
after a certain hour, not to frequent a particular bus exchange where 
it seems that criminals have a tendency to meet, geographic 
prohibitions or prohibitions to stay at least one block away from a 
girlfriend's residence because of a history of assault or threats. The 
community expectation is that these orders will be obeyed and can 
reasonably be administered without unnecessary administrative 
barriers. We see in the newspaper that the offender received a 
sentence and was placed on certain conditions, and the public can 
feel good about it. However, when we investigate it, we find the 
administration of the order actually breaks down.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	The probation order must have some real meaning. The public 
delegates to the authority and then has an expectation that the order 
will be administered properly. The orderly operation and 
administration of court orders are very important. I think the public 
reputation is that court orders are not that well administered.
<P>
	We have to overcome the community notion that the order is not 
worth the paper it is written on. There are administrative barriers 
that could be put aside by this measure. The bill is minor in size but 
I am saying it is very meaningful in its practical form.
<P>
	The member for Lanark-Carleton outlined in some technical 
sense how this bill went beyond the current bill before Parliament. 
I am recommending it is an additional permutation that would be 
very helpful for the administration of criminal justice in the 
community.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will take a 
few minutes to express some of my feelings and concerns about the 
area addressed by the bill.
<P>
	For what purpose do courts issue prohibition orders? They feel 
under the circumstances it is the adequate  action that should be 
taken to protect society. Probation is a comforting term, an order of 
probation. It is not unlike mandatory supervision term we hear.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16212"> 16212 </A></B>
<P>
	Is it comforting that someone will be released before his or her 
time on mandatory supervision? The state is to conduct supervision 
over the person to ensure the safety of the public. We have seen 
how absolutely useless that type of condition is in protecting the 
Melanie Carpenters and the Sylvain Leducs from the kind of action 
the court has surmised will never take place.
<P>
	I support the bill. If the court issues a probation what is it 
asking? It is asking the accused person to obey certain 
requirements: to stay away from bars, perhaps to stay away from 
the classroom or perhaps to stay away from a spouse who has been 
subjected to abuse, physical or otherwise. Does the court expect the 
person will simply obey those orders? What happens if he or she 
fails to obey? Probation officers do not have the manpower to deal 
with circumstances late at night. We also know police officers are 
usually there. At least they are on duty 24 hours a day. The public 
has access to them in case a probation order is violated.
<P>
	If a wife realizes her husband is to stay away from liquor under 
probation and he is at a bar at two o'clock in the morning and she is 
sitting at home in fear of his attendance, what protection does she 
have? Should she phone the probation officer? Nonsense. That is 
impossible. She could phone the police under the circumstances. 
The police do not have any authority whatsoever to intervene to 
protect her from her husband even though he is in violation of a 
probation order set as a result of his violation of her.
<P>
	I listened to the hon. member across the way speak about the 
laws being in place now to prevent that. If that were the case we 
would not be receiving feedback from police officers about the 
violations of individuals they have brought before the courts and 
the courts have placed on probation. They have seen the violation 
of those probation orders and can do nothing about it except to 
report the situation to the probation officer on Monday morning 
and if the probation officer has time he will follow it up perhaps 
two or three weeks later.
<P>
	This is a common sense response to the cries of the police to give 
them reasonable tools to prevent crime and criminal acts from 
occurring. I suggest violation of probation is a criminal act. I do not 
think anyone will deny that. Why not place within the hands of our 
peace officers the power to do something about it? Therefore I 
support the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. At the 
time of preparation of the bill I discussed it with a number of 
people, particularly those of legal mind, who felt it was an 
important bill to pursue. They also felt that it completely qualified 
under the 12 or 15 points that clarify whether a piece of legislation 
is votable or non-votable. It certainly met the criteria in all their 
eyes.  I have also talked to a number of police authorities about it 
and they said it was the kind of thing they could use to help prevent 
crime.
<P>
	I do not believe it is in contradiction to or identical to Bill C-41. I 
have been advised that is not necessarily the case. Therefore, with 
the idea that all of us are here to do whatever we can to prevent 
crime, it would be a small step in the right direction if we all 
supported it as a votable item. If there is unanimous consent I 
would move that Bill C-343, for the sake of the safety of 
Canadians, become a votable item.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion by the hon. member for Wild Rose. Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There being no unanimous 
consent, there being no further members rising for debate and the 
motion not being designated a votable item, the time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired 
and the order is dropped from the Order Paper pursuant to Standing 
Order 96.
<P>
	It being 1.52 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 1.52 p.m.)
