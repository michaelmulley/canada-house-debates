</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our parents 
always equated work with health.  Our Prime Minister often tells 
us work is dignity.  Meeting our own needs and those of the 
people who depend on us is also a source of pride, self-esteem 
and hope in the future.  That is why this government has worked 
so hard, and continues to work so hard, to sustain the economic 
health of this country.  We are very much aware that prosperity 
creates jobs, many jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since our government was first elected in 1993, more than 
400,000 jobs have been created in Quebec.  As a result, there 
has been a five point drop in the unemployment rate, to a 25-year 
low. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proud of Canada's economic performance.  There are 2.1 
million more jobs today than when we took office in 1993.  We 
know that all Canadians benefit from this economic growth in one 
way or another.  However we also know that they do not all 
benefit from it equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it is our collective responsibility to help those who, 
through no fault of their own, have difficulty providing for 
their needs.  For this reason we have dynamic and effective 
social programs such as employment insurance. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old employment insurance system was in need of updating.  We 
therefore organized a broad consultation in all regions of the 
country.  Then in 1996 we carried out an indepth reform of this 
program, which is one of the cornerstones of our social security 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware that the labour market is constantly evolving. 
As technologies develop, markets become globalized and new forms 
of work are developed, change is taking place more rapidly than 
ever.  We therefore wanted to ensure that our employment 
insurance program can effectively meet any shortages in the 
labour market. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the extent of the reforms, we promise to monitor the short 
and long term effects very closely.  For this reason we included 
an annual evaluation mechanism that enables us to identify and 
correct certain provisions that are not having the desired 
effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mechanism is very useful.  In 1997 we used it to correct 
certain deficiencies by introducing the pilot project for small 
weeks. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the objectives of our employment insurance reform was to 
encourage people to work. In order to better achieve that 
objective, we introduced the short week pilot project and we 
have made various adjustments along the way. Today, we are 
continuing in the same direction with this bill, which seeks to 
ensure that the program is fair and effective. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will recall, Bill C-44, an act to amend the 
Employment Insurance Act, was introduced last September.  This 
legislation was at second reading at the time of the election. 
Canadians supported the legislation and gave the government a 
clear mandate to advance the proposed changes.  Bill C-2 is the 
same bill with an additional minor amendment concerning EI 
fishing regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that enhanced EI parental benefits came into 
effect on December 31, 2000.  Payment of similar benefits to 
self-employed fishers requires an amendment to the EI fishing 
regulations.  However, because of the election, amended 
regulations could not be approved by the House in time for 
December 31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amended regulations were tabled by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and are being considered by the House. Bill 
C-2 would make these amendments retroactive to December 31, 2000, 
so that fishers can have access to the same types of benefits as 
other Canadians.  This is the fair thing to do. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to provide additional help to those who are looking for 
work. We also want to correct certain provisions that are less 
effective than anticipated.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are going to eliminate the intensity rule.  The 
purpose of this rule, introduced in 1996, was to reduce the 
reliance of frequent claimants on employment insurance and to 
encourage work efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over time we have noted that this intensity rule did not produce 
the anticipated results and is instead seen as a penalty on 
workers living in communities where job opportunities are 
limited.  Therefore we are correcting the situation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, in those regions where seasonal industries are major 
economic catalysts, we will closely co-operate with the 
communities and with all our partners to help them diversify 
their economy and create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also amends the criteria governing the clawback 
provision. That measure was introduced in the late seventies to 
deter high income earners from frequently relying on employment 
insurance. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clawback will not apply to first time claimants and 
claimants collecting special benefits, namely sickness, maternity 
or parental benefits. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, this clawback provision should reflect today's 
economic reality. Therefore, we want to ensure that it targets 
only taxpayers with higher than average incomes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the net income above which benefits must be paid back 
by repeat claimants would increase from $39,000 to $48,750.  The 
maximum repayment would be limited to 30% of net income above 
this clawback threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government places a high priority on the welfare of 
families.  Therefore, we have taken into consideration the case 
of parents returning to the labour market after having taken an 
extended time off to care for their children. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulations governing re-entrants' eligibility for 
regular benefits will be amended to ensure that parents of young 
children who return to the labour market are not unduly 
penalized because of their absence. 
This measure is in addition to the higher parental benefits that 
have been in effect since December 31, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, since that date, all Canadian families that 
have a new child can enjoy much longer and much more flexible 
maternity and parental benefits. Thanks to these new measures, a 
large number of parents will be able to spend more time with 
their young children. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill improves our employment insurance system even further. 
It benefits parents and Canadians in all regions of the country 
who are looking for work.  It also demonstrates our commitment to 
carefully scrutinize the effects of this very important social 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also extending until 2006 the mandate of the Canada 
Employment Insurance Commission to continue closely monitoring 
the effects of the program. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased that the economic situation in Quebec and in 
Canada has greatly improved. The amendments proposed to the 
House today will better help those who live in regions where 
seasonal work and unemployment are higher than average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our ministers travelled throughout Quebec and Canada. They met 
with workers and they found out for themselves that some 
provisions of the employment insurance program were not 
producing the anticipated results. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are proposing these amendments today.  These 
amendments are improvements to the former law. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government promised to act. It is fulfilling that 
commitment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, are there not any 
questions and comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The first three speakers on this bill 
will have a maximum of 40 minutes without questions and comments. 
That could only be addressed through unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
humbly request unanimous consent to ask the parliamentary 
secretary a few questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate you on your 
appointment to the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 was known in the last parliament as Bill C-44 and is 
known more by its unofficial title of the Liberal Atlantic Canada 
re-election strategy.  The parliamentary secretary has explained 
some of the details of the bill so I will not go into them. 
However, I will say that the official opposition does not support 
the approach the government is taking on these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not alone.  There are people and organizations across the 
nation who feel that this is not the right direction to take: 
the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association, the 
Atlantic Institute for Market Studies, the St. John's Board of 
Trade on the east coast, the Vancouver Board of Trade on the west 
coast and probably all the boards of trade in between.  Even the 
Canadian Federation of Labour has problems with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was first introduced last fall, this is what 
Catherine Swift, president of the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business, had to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After several years of making some steps in the right direction 
on EI policy, this is a U-turn that hearkens back to the 1970s—a 
big spending government promoting dependency on programs, instead 
of solid economic growth.  We thought they had learned something 
from the mistakes of the past. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the International Monetary Fund report.  Last week 
the finance minister was bragging about how the IMF supports 
Canada's economic incentives and economic and fiscal policies and 
said that he had received high praise from the IMF.  However, he 
chose to ignore paragraph 8 in the report, which I should like to 
read into the record.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comprehensive reforms enacted during the 1990s to the Employment 
Insurance (EI) system and to social assistance programs and the 
introduction of the National Child Benefit have enhanced the 
flexibility and efficiency of the labour market, boosting 
employment growth and helping to reduce structural unemployment. 
Pressures to ease the impact of some of these 
reforms—particularly the 1996 EI reforms—have intensified as 
they have become more binding.  The Government has mitigated the 
intended effects of some of the reforms and has proposed to 
rollback others.  In particular, the IMF staff sees the proposed 
elimination of the intensity rule, which was designed to 
discourage frequent use of the system, as sending the wrong 
signal.  Frequent use of the system, along with the provision of 
extended EI benefits for high unemployment regions for a 
prolonged period of time, has had adverse effects on the 
behaviour of both workers and employers, has significantly raised 
reservation wages in high unemployment regions, and has reduced 
labour mobility.  In addition, the recent experience in the 
United States suggests that labour market flexibility is an 
important factor in fostering the rapid adoption of 
productivity-enhancing new technologies.  Therefore, the IMF 
staff continues to endorse the implementation of new measures to 
reduce the frequency of EI use (such as experience rating of the 
EI premium rate, which would tie the rate for individual firms 
directly to the use of the system by their workers) and the 
elimination of regional extended benefits. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This quote is from the International Monetary Fund, which the 
finance minister seems to think is highly supportive of 
government policies.  This is one area in which it has 
recommended and suggested to the government that the change in 
direction is not in the best interests of the economic future of 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If IMF support is so important in all other areas and if its 
recommendations are so valid in all other areas, why does the 
government turn its back on the recommendations that the IMF put 
forward on the EI insurance program?

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is, with this coming from the IMF, why would the 
government go in this direction which retreats from the very 
policy that the IMF claims is having a beneficial economic impact 
on Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the official opposition feel that it is extremely 
important to get the bill before the standing committee on human 
resources so that the committee can hear witnesses and have an 
indepth study to look at the EI program and the benefits and lack 
of incentives that are being proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to put Bill C-2 before the House of Commons and 
have the government, which said it was in favour of parliamentary 
reform, let the bill pass through to committee in a very real and 
meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see whether the government will seriously listen to all 
aspects of the discussion from witnesses who have a lot to say 
about the legislation.  Let us see whether the Liberal government 
will actually allow committees to do their job, to listen to 
witnesses and to come up with recommendations to change the 
legislation and make it more meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance would like to see whether or not the 
government is willing to look at some of the concerns that have 
been expressed.  One concern that has been expressed is that the 
legislation is taking the control or responsibility from the EI 
commission and placing the rate changes in the hands of cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real concern out there, not only in the Canadian 
public, among workers and employers alike, but in labour 
commissions and labour organizations, that the government is 
trying to control this fund to a degree that we have never seen 
before.  Instead of having the employment insurance program at 
arm's length from government, the government is reaching in and 
bringing in total control over the EI program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to ask oneself why this would happen.  Why would the 
government want to have this kind of control?  A surplus of $40 
billion may be all that is needed to see why a government would 
want to do this.  The EI fund is reaching the point of having a 
$40 billion surplus.  I think the government would like to see 
this as its personal slush fund to use at will rather than for 
the purpose it was intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief actuary for the fund has indicated that a $15 billion 
surplus is all that is required in the program.  I would like to 
look at last year alone.  EI premiums last year were $18.511 
billion.  That is money coming in.  EI benefits paid out were 
$9.3 billion.  That leaves a $9.211 billion surplus in this fund 
which the cabinet wants to control.  I suggest that is the wrong 
direction for the country to take.  It is wrong from the employer 
point of view and from the employee point of view.  It is wrong 
from every way we look at it for the cabinet of a government to 
have control over that kind of money, which was put in place for 
a specific reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the poor working person who is paying employment 
insurance premiums does not want to continue paying an inflated 
amount of money so that the government has access to a huge 
surplus fund to use whenever it wants.  When these surpluses were 
brought to the attention of the government, what did it do?  It 
reduced premiums by 25 cents, a small, piddly amount.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that every worker could stop paying EI premiums 
for two years and we would still have the surplus in the account 
that is required, according to the chief actuary, to have a 
stable fund.  We could go two years without any premium payments 
and the fund would be where it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ask ourselves why the government is so intent on keeping 
employment insurance premiums to a level that gives it surpluses 
every year, to the point of building a surplus fund of $40 
billion.  The reason is so that the government can balance its 
books.  It is balancing its books on every working person and on 
every business person who provides jobs for working people.  That 
is not fair.  It is not right and it has to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its August 1999 unemployment insurance bulletin, the Canadian 
Labour Congress states “The UI fund must be separated from the 
government accounts, and the authority and autonomy of the UI 
commission must be strengthened”.  That needs to be brought 
before the committee of parliament.  It needs to be reasoned out. 
We need to find a way of strengthening the EI commission, of 
putting it at arm's length from government and taking control of 
it away from the Canadian government and cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only a drop in the bucket for the government, which 
takes things out of the public eye, away from commissions that do 
business up front, and puts them behind the doors of a cabinet 
meeting.  It puts things beyond the reach of ordinary Canadians 
to understand or to know what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is distressing to me to see that we will be continuing this 
direction with a government that has told Canadians it will be 
more transparent and more open.  We see that the very first 
legislation to be introduced in the House of Commons is doing 
precisely the opposite.  The government is taking something that 
is open and transparent and putting it behind closed cabinet 
doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than anything else, the thing that distresses a lot of 
Canadians and me personally is the importance that the government 
places on making small amendments to the employment insurance 
legislation rather than looking at creating an environment of 
long term permanent jobs for Canadians across the country from 
coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years ago the Liberals announced changes to EI.  The Prime 
Minister stated “we wish to provide an incentive for people to 
work instead of receiving social benefits”.  We have to wonder 
why the government is turning away from that challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the Prime Minister have said that the best way to 
help unemployed people is to put them to work, to give them jobs, 
to have jobs created so that they can find employment.  I suggest 
that the government has done little to create any employment. The 
parliamentary secretary claimed that there were 400,000 jobs 
created in Quebec and 2.1 million jobs created across the 
country.  I challenge her, in that it was not the federal Liberal 
government that created those jobs.  The small business community 
and the business community created those jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade pointed out last year that 
85% of these new jobs were created due to trade.  Most of the 
increased trade is due to the free trade agreement and NAFTA, and 
let me remind Canadians of elections past when the Liberals

opposed free trade and NAFTA until they formed the government.

is to substantially reduce personal income tax.

</I></B></P><P align=left>By leaving money in the hands of consumers, the government could 
have increased the purchasing power of Canadians.  It does not 
take a rocket scientist to know that by increasing the purchasing 
power of Canadians one increases jobs.  There are provinces that 
have shown that this works.  There are provinces that had the 
courage to do what had to be done and they saw the benefits.  The 
federal government did not have the courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government really wanted to do something concrete, 
something that would benefit the economy, it could have developed 
a vision for a national transportation infrastructure strategy 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed that the government has such little insight and 
foresight and such little incentive to place the country in a 
position where we can compete in the North American marketplace 
and compete internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is not even paying lip service to the 
development of a national transportation strategy.  While our 
economy has grown, we are still relying on a transportation 
system that was built almost a half a century ago.  We think the 
system should be adequate enough to service our people and our 
goods.  In many places, the movement of people and goods is in 
total gridlock while the government sits back and does nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The port of Halifax is a very good example of what could have 
been.  Two years ago Halifax was bypassed as this continent's 
Atlantic super port.  Halifax has an excellent port.  It is much 
more convenient to Europe.  Why was it bypassed?  It was bypassed 
because there was no adequate infrastructure to move the goods 
from the port to the North American trade market, to the cities 
and towns that would be using the materials brought in.  There 
was no adequate railroad access to the market.  Why did New York 
get it instead of Halifax?  It was because there was no adequate 
infrastructure program in place to support the Halifax bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think of the jobs that the transportation infrastructure 
strategy would have created, not only in Atlantic Canada but in 
the north, long term jobs that would have benefited the future 
economy.  Where is the strategy, the planning and the insight? 
The strategy is not there.  The vision is not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wastes money on grants and all kinds of things, 
but it does not put money where it would have a meaningful impact 
on the growing economy of our nation.  It is not just Atlantic 
Canada and Quebec, it is also the north.  The north has the 
capacity and the potential of some major developments and 
megaprojects.  The north is an area of traditionally high 
unemployment and it is waiting for something to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal community in the Northwest Territories is 
prepared to negotiate for the Mackenzie River pipeline.  There is 
also talk of a gas pipeline from Alaska coming down through the 
Yukon to join the existing pipeline network that currently 
extends as far as northern Alberta.  Alaska is also seeking a 
rail link from that state to join our northern rail lines that 
only go as far as Fort Nelson and Dease Lake in northern B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the Northwest Territories are also talking about 
extending the Mackenzie Highway from its current northern 
terminus at Wrigley all the way to Inuvik.  The extension of this 
highway would assist in opening up the vast untapped mineral 
reserves of the Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget our new territory, Nunavut, which would like a 
road link with the rest of Canada.  While these projects would 
undoubtedly cost billions of dollars, they will also return 
billions of dollars to the federal government coffers through 
taxes and royalties.  Equally important is that they would 
provide hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of man years of 
employment, good paying long term employment.

for the country, they would be in extensive negotiations with the 
territories, the western provinces, the American and Alaskan 
governments, northern aboriginal communities, environmentalists 
and the business community on how they could develop our north. 
However there was not a passing reference to this kind of 
development in the Speech from the Throne, not even a mention of 
developing the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of co-ordinating projects that would employ thousands of 
individuals, they tinker with the EI bill by making minor 
amendments.  They are more concerned about keeping people on 
employment insurance than they are in providing them with good, 
long term, full time employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, because of the Liberal's lack of vision we are 
limited to debating a handful of amendments to the EI act.  There 
is no vision of moving forward in a strong dynamic way by making 
great changes and great projects.  We are talking about minor 
changes to an existing bill that does not address the serious 
problems of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not spend a lot of time on the details of the bill at 
second reading.  We want to move the legislation before a 
committee.  We want to see whether the Liberal government is 
intent on opening up the process of reforming parliament to allow 
real discussion and real debate on employment insurance and what 
it should be doing and what it is doing.  We want to see whether 
things can work differently and better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the first bill being debated in the House of Commons to 
go to committee.  We in the opposition will make a commitment to 
go there with an open mind.  We hope the government will go there 
with an open mind as well, so that we can hear witnesses and 
people who specialize in this area and, if necessary, make 
changes to make the legislation better.  I would like to see the 
bill serve as an indication of the willingness of the House to do 
things differently for the good of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak today on the 
occasion of the start of debate on Bill C-2 on employment 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the start it is important to establish clearly the point 
we have reached in this debate.  In January 1997, the reform of 
the employment insurance plan took effect.  It was supposed to 
attune the plan closely with the realities of the labour market 
and enable people to return to work quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is a major flaw in the system.  Under cover of 
the reform, which was to improve employment insurance, the plan 
started pumping money to the Minister of Finance of Canada. 
It became one of the best tools in the fight against the deficit 
on the backs of the unemployed, workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government wondered how to go about collecting as 
much money as fast as possible and as quickly as possible, and on 
the backs of whomever would be the easiest.  It turned toward 
society's most disadvantaged, the unemployed, people who were 
not necessarily solidly organized in social terms, and imposed 
the employment insurance plan on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will provide an example for members.  The employment insurance 
plan is based on contributions by employers and employees, and 
benefits are paid.  In 1994 the surplus was $2.3 billion; in 
1995 it was $4.3 billion; in 1996, $5 billion; in 1997, $6.7 
billion; in 1998, $7.3 billion; in 1999, $6.5 billion; and in 
2000, $5.6 billion. 
The surplus is approaching a total of $30 billion to $31 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, the federal government, since imposing the new 
employment insurance plan, has taken $31 billion more from the 
pockets of employers and employees than it has paid out to the 
unemployed as benefits.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not use the word that we would use back home because it 
would be considered unparliamentary, but the government has 
plumped up its coffers by making employers and employees pay 
excessively high premiums and by tightening the screws across 
the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it looked for a way to reduce benefits to a bare minimum. 
One thing it came up with was the intensity rule.  For the past 
three or four years we have been telling the government that 
this rule has to go. Finally it listened to us and 
introduced a provision to that effect in Bill C-44. 
The intensity rule is federal bureaucracy at its best.  The 
federal government is saying that our seasonal workers are 
unemployed because they want to be, because they simply do not 
want to work.  The idea is that it will give people 55% of their 
average earnings the first time they draw EI benefits and bump 
them down to 54% the next time around. It figures this will 
encourage people to get out and work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take someone earning $600 a week.  This is not 
astronomical—it amounts to $30,000 a year.  If such a person 
worked 18 to 20 weeks, at $600 a week, his employment insurance 
cheque would normally be $330 a week. The intensity rule would 
lower this to $300.  This means that the government has pocketed 
the $30 difference, a loss that is keenly felt at this income 
level.  The federal government has siphoned off quite a bit this 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The demands for changes to this rule of intensity, which the 
government has finally decided to change, are nothing new.  They 
have been around for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government imposed a program that would collect as much 
money as possible to battle the deficit.  I have already given 
some examples of the amount of money it has generated.  As a 
result, the program no longer has any credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, about 40% of the unemployed qualify for benefits.  If 
this were a private insurance plan, no one would subscribe to 
it.  When we pay premiums for a car, a house or other kinds of 
insurance, we expect to get some benefits in the end.  This one 
is a mandatory program to which everyone contributes.  The 
Liberals changed the rules in 1997 and now everyone pays into 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young workers start contributing as soon as they start to work, 
even if they do not work the 910 hours required to qualify. 
Women returning to the workforce contribute as soon as they 
start to work.  If the young worker has not accumulated 910 
hours, “so long”.  No question of paying him or her any 
benefits.  Although the worker has contributed, there is no 
entitlement to benefits.  Today's bill does nothing to correct 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A system has been created, a way of doing things that works to 
the detriment of the people in our society who are the worst 
off.  It has, however, been realized that the surplus 
accumulated over the years has to be put back into the system 
one day in the context of the present legislation.  There was a 
provision that the government could decide to use this money for 
other purposes within one economic cycle.  That it has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the economic cycle, it should put these 
surpluses back into the system but it does not want to do that. 
Making lower income earners contribute has worked just too well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, people pay premiums on their income up to $39,000. 
Someone earning $100,000 pays premiums on the first $39,000 but 
not on the difference between $39,000 and $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, someone earning $45,000 pays premiums on the first 
$39,000 but not on the additional $6,000. This is assuming that 
person contributes to the employment insurance program, because 
many people do not. During his last mandate, we even informed 
the Prime Minister that he was not contributing to the 
employment insurance program. After 30 years as a member of 
parliament, he did not know that. We informed him of that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are others who do not contribute, including all the 
professionals who work but do not pay EI premiums. 
This means that these people did not do their share in the fight 
against the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there are surpluses, as has been the case in recent years, 
people expect lower taxes. For some, it is the way to get 
something back for helping to fight the deficit. However, those 
who do not pay much tax, those earning $15,000, $18,000, $20,000 
or $25,000 per year—and there are many who earn such salaries and 
even less than that—do not really need a significant tax 
reduction but rather an acceptable and adequate employment 
insurance program that will provide them with a decent income 
when they find themselves between jobs. The bill still does 
not provide such a program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue was the subject of a major debate during the previous 
parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate was so important that during the election campaign 
the Prime Minister was obliged to recognize that a lot of errors 
had been made in the reform.  He said, for example, on November 
4, 2000 “We realized that it was not a good decision in that we 
should not have done it”. He was talking about the cuts to the 
employment insurance plan his government had imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister himself has recognized that the 
government made a mistake. 
Bill C-44 had been introduced before the election campaign and 
people were rightly saying that it was not enough.  It was in 
reaction to this position that he said “It is true, we did make 
major mistakes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem today is that the bill before us is 
the same one we had before us prior to the election.  During the 
election campaign, the Liberal Party noted very clear messages 
on this.  It told the public that significant changes would be 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I quote the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport, 
who said during the election: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a Liberal majority is elected, we will reinstate the 
process and make sure that the changes are effective and meet 
the needs, for the most part, of the people of the 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and Canadians as a whole. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Public Works and Government Services, who is 
also responsible for Quebec, also supported the arguments in 
favour of changes to the employment insurance plan.  The 
Secretary of State for Amateur Sport continued, speaking as well 
for the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, “The 
government is open to discussion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem in this government, because we did not know 
who speaks on its behalf, except that now we know, the bill has 
been introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of this bill, the remarks of the Secretary of 
State for Amateur Sport and the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, who is also responsible for all of Quebec, 
were rebuffed by the government. 
Once again with the administration of the employment insurance 
account, it would appear that it is not those who want 
improvements who have won but the Minister of Finance. Money 
must continue to flow from the pump for him because he needs it and 
he is still getting it the way he always did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This attitude is unacceptable. Politicians cannot expect to be 
taken seriously by public opinion if the government keeps acting 
this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one makes a promise during an election campaign and, 
immediately after winning the election, one forgets one's 
promise, this fuels frustration and cynicism toward politicians. 
The Liberal Party is truly responsible for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is even worse. 
Cynicism does not stop people from eating. It is something very 
difficult to bear and very damaging to democracy but today we 
have a situation where Canadians expect significant corrective 
measures, a situation where people going through hard times 
expected much more than what they are seeing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been proposed that the intensity rule be abolished. It 
would be interesting to increase the average benefits from 50% 
to 55% for everyone. However we have seen that 55% is not 
enough. The thing to do would be to increase this percentage to 
a higher level, something like 60% of the average salary. Thus 
the unemployed could count on a decent income between two jobs, 
which was the intent of the employment insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if economic growth is optimal, some seasonal jobs will not 
reap the benefits.  Economic growth is important because it is 
essential to job creation and is part of the fight against 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In forestry, agriculture and tourism, the fact that the economy 
is in good shape does not necessarily translate into a 
significant increase in benefit weeks or hours of work.  As we 
have pointed out, the jobs in these seasonal industries are also 
seasonal.  These workers are therefore entitled to a minimum 
acceptable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the whole issue of maternity and parental leave. 
After much lobbying, the government reduced the number of 
qualifying hours from 700 to 600.  It may interest members to 
know that before the reform, however, a woman needed 300 hours 
to qualify for maternity leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government had just stuck with the requirement in the 
1997 regime—20 weeks of work at 15 hours a week, or 300 hours of 
work—nothing would have changed and more women would have been 
able to qualify. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time the federal government took advantage of the 
situation and raised the requirement to 700 hours, or 20 weeks 
at 35 hours.  That is many weeks.  The result was that far fewer 
women were able to qualify.  For five years, we were stuck with 
a regime that was divorced from the conditions workers actually 
face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  In 1989, before all the reforms, 82% of 
unemployed women qualified for benefits.  We saw this percentage 
drop dramatically as soon as the Liberals introduced their 
change.  In 1994, benefits had dropped to 59% of earnings.  The 
downward trend continued, and in 1999, 38% of unemployed women 
qualified for EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This behaviour is totally unacceptable especially because, with 
the increase in precarious jobs and part time jobs, the number 
of people contributing to employment insurance but not eligible 
for benefits has increased. This is the ideal clientele for the 
Minister of Finance. On the one hand, he collects the money and, 
on the other hand, he does not give it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing has happened with young workers. In 1989, 98% of 
young people between the ages of 20 and 24 were eligible. In 
1999, only 24.9% were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that only one young adult out of four is eligible. In 
Bill C-2, there is no provision in this respect. They have 
decided not to change their tune. I have already asked questions 
on this and I received the same answer as when I asked about the 
intensity rule “This rule has been put in place because people 
are unwilling to work hard. 
If we cut their income, these people are going to go back to 
work”. This is the point of view expressed by the Prime Minister 
himself when he referred to the unemployed as beer drinkers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the bureaucracy went by for four years. People were 
systematically penalized. They were told they would 
lose benefits because they did not want to work. We realized 
that after three years of studies on this matter. During that 
time, a lot of people lost money and could not afford to meet 
their mortgage or car payments or to raise their families. This 
is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the government is proposing that the measures be 
retroactive to last October. These people should benefit from 
retroactivity back to the date the plan came into effect 
because it is inhumane. 
Canadian workers are being treated like economic guinea pigs. 
It is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conception that people are a little lazy and do not want to 
work is being applied to young people. The minister herself told 
me “If we take away the discrimination toward young people, they 
will all drop out”. That is the exact same conception as for 
seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When young people drop out, it is not because they do not want 
a job but rather because they have a problem. We see nothing to 
that effect in the new bill. It is as if the new bill would not 
change anything. This is not acceptable to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have in front of us a system that does not function well. 
Everybody contributes from the first hour worked. 
There is a dramatic drop in the number of contributors who 
qualify. We have seen it with women and young people. There are 
those who earn more than $39,000, as I was saying previously, and 
women who just do not qualify any more. More and more women could 
not qualify for the employment insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Average benefits also dropped considerably. The tables have been 
changed. Instead of being eligible for 40 weeks of benefits 
after a certain number of hours of work, people now qualify for 
only 32, 33 or 34 weeks, which means less income, and the 
creation of what has been known as the spring gap. People will 
live through that again this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer there was an attempt to change the regional map. In 
my area, people applied for unemployment benefits between July 9 
and September 17. 
Because the minister had changed the regional map without 
reasonable consultation having taken place prior, 565 hours were 
required to qualify instead of 420 hours previously. Instead of 
being eligible to 32 weeks of benefits, they were given 21.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should remember what happened as a result of public protests. 
It was a few months before the election. The federal government 
was paying a lot of attention to these things. It decided to 
correct the situation. On September 17, it said it would return 
to the old rules: 420 hours to qualify and 32 weeks of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it cannot correct the situation that it created with the 
summer gap between July 9 and September 17. These past few 
weeks there are people in my region whose benefits are running 
out. It did not correct that situation, while it would have the 
opportunity, in legislation such as the one we have before us, 
to say it made no sense to create for two months sub-citizens, 
sub-unemployed, people who do not have what is required to 
qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people came to my office. They were two friends who worked 
in the same business. One said “I submitted my request on 
September 15 and got 21 weeks of benefits”. The other said “I 
went on September 18 and for the same length of employment I 
got 32 weeks of benefits”. Where is the justice in this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, when this correction was made, the minister told us 
that it would take a legislative change. The legislation would 
have to be changed. Legislation cannot be changed like that. 
Changes cannot be retroactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the legislation is being changed. 
This would be an excellent opportunity to amend the act and to 
restore the dignity of an EI system that would provide the 
benefits that these people deserve. There is no such amendment, 
even if the Prime Minister himself was made aware of the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote him last December asking if there was really no way to 
address the situation so as to provide these people with more 
acceptable conditions. I am still waiting for an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is now making some corrections that were 
suggested as important a very long time ago, dealing with the 
intensity rule, eligibility for special benefits and clawback. 
According to the present system, seasonal workers who make a lot 
of money, particularly in the building industry, have to give it 
back when they file their income tax, when they earn more than a 
certain amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A solution had to be found, because no one enjoys giving back 
part of the money earned during the year, money used to keep the 
family, and having to give it back suddenly in March and April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we would like to live with this kind of 
situation given the kind of work we are doing. If we were told 
in February or March that for the purpose of our personal 
income tax return the vacation allowance should be considered 
as a supplement and returned to the government, we would not 
find it very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still faced with a situation or a government approach 
that is unacceptable. We have a fundamental problem that is 
reflected in the spirit of the Speech from the Throne. I quote 
the only sentence referring to employment insurance in the 
Speech from the Throne “There was a time when losing a job also 
meant immediate loss of income for workers and their families. 
And so Canadians created Employment Insurance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a complacent statement. 
It is as if, when employment insurance was created, we had 
solved all the problems of the unemployed people who needed income 
between two jobs. Rather, it is the opposite. It is unemployment 
insurance that was created soon after the war in order to 
provide people with sufficient income. It is only when the plan 
was changed under the Liberals that it became the employment 
insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an unemployment insurance plan under which people, 
through collective solidarity, could get a decent income between 
two jobs. The name of the plan was changed and not only the 
packaging but also the content were changed. It has become a 
money pump for the finance minister. It has become a way to make 
sure the government gets as much money as possible. 
This certainly does not meet the objective outlined in the 
Speech from the Throne, which was to ensure an income for 
workers and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think employment insurance has been one of the main factors in 
the increase in poverty in Canada over the last five or six 
years.  We keep hearing about concerns for children with respect 
to the child tax benefit.  It is not a bad program per se but 
we must remember that if there are poor children, it is because 
there are poor parents to begin with.  If the situation were 
different, if employment insurance had not been cut as it has, 
many children would be much better fed every day in their 
families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people would not have to resort to food banks at the 
end of each month.  We are talking here about money and an 
insurance program, a program based on contributions.  Society as 
a whole, workers and employers contribute collectively to offer 
those who lose their jobs some form of income.  But cuts were 
made to this program, which changed it into a program promoting 
financial dependency.  I think an important social pact that 
existed in Canada was also broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many decades now the resource rich regions of Canada supplied 
the raw material, the basic resources our society needed to 
function. 
Now that we have also developed the new economy, this employment 
insurance plan has put an end to an existing agreement. Under 
this agreement, the resource regions that had industries, such as 
forestry, agriculture, tourism and fisheries, were to develop 
their resources but because these industries do not operate 
all year long, the plan would provide adequate income to workers 
so they could have a decent life in their own region. However 
the government put an end this agreement unilaterally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One the one hand, it has decided to apply to seasonal workers 
the principle that they do not work because they are lazy and 
that putting more stringent conditions into the plan will make 
them work harder. Benefits will be cut and workers will have to 
manage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the government was supposed to invest in the 
diversification of regional economies and thus counterbalance 
the effects of the tightening of the employment insurance plan. 
But that money never came, and when it did, it was invested 
inefficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We witnessed the HRDC boondoggle. A program called the 
transitional jobs fund was used for electioneering purposes, 
especially in 1997, to help the Liberals win more ridings. We 
have never seen so much investment in Bloc ridings as we did 
then. The Liberals had carefully targeted the ridings where they 
wanted to get results. But this did not resolve the social pact 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, resource regions have to adapt, and they have had to 
bear a disproportionate share of the fight against the deficit. 
Now that we have surpluses, they cannot get their fair share. 
I think there is a basic problem with the implementation of the 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also another important aspect. The employment insurance 
program has been in place for five years now. It is reviewed 
every year. It is in its fourth year and we are waiting for the 
report. We hope the report will be published soon and it would 
be important to have it before the end of this debate. Maybe we 
could adjust things based on the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from the financial problems the unemployed may have, there 
is a need to bring the plan in line with the labour market. 
Among other things, the Bloc Quebecois has proposed that 
self-employed workers be eligible on a voluntary basis. 
Why not put this possibility on the table? Today, with the new 
reality of the workplace, why can we not be more flexible and 
find a way to make the program more acceptable, since many 
people work part time and 18% of the people are self-employed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is always the same: the basic principle is not to 
provide people between jobs with a decent income but to 
accumulate as much money for the finance minister, so that he 
can invest in all kinds of activities with the money of those 
who are the worst off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is much easier to force a worker whose status is precarious, 
a young man or a young woman starting to work at 15 hours a week 
and getting a pay cheque for the first time, to contribute to 
the plan. How can he or she protest and say “ It does not make 
sense for me to contribute when I do not even qualify”. Before 
these young persons get organized and make representations, 
things will not change much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have learned their lesson. I am now very satisfied 
with the public's reaction to Bill C-2. I just received a call 
from a representative of the Mouvement autonome et solidaire des 
sans-emploi du Québec. 
I asked him if he had a problem with the fact that we considered it 
unacceptable for the government to legalize the misappropriation 
of these surpluses and, as a result, that we oppose the bill 
even though it proposes some improvements we have been asking 
for a long time. He answered that he did not because the 
association thinks that the bill is a disgrace. The government 
ought to be ashamed of trying to use blackmail by saying “I stole 
$100 from you and I am giving you $8 back, so you should be 
delighted”. When someone takes $100 from me he owes me this 
sum and he must give me back $100, not $8. Otherwise it is 
unacceptable to ask us to be delighted because we are getting 
$8 instead of the $100 owed us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that in this regard we are on solid ground. Unions and 
other representatives of the workers and the unemployed know 
very well that we stand for social equity. This is what the 
population wants and it needs no explanation. We are going to 
defend social equity and I am ready to debate our position at 
any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People know very well that if we just agreed with the bill, the 
$30 billion surplus would just disappear into the system. 
The unemployed would never benefit from the surplus. All the 
sacrifices they had to make in the fight against the deficit 
would not earn them anything while other groups would benefit 
from those sacrifices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Management of the system must appear to be fair for people who 
contribute to the plan, for the employers and the employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers are at the mercy of economic cycles. 
Unemployment rates are down in every region of Canada. In many 
places, the 10%, 12% or 13% unemployment rates we saw a few years 
ago are now 7 or 8%. However in those areas seasonal workers 
do not necessarily work a higher number of weeks. For them the 
situation did not change. 
They need to qualify for employment insurance to get an income 
for the winter months and the months when the industry they work 
for slows down. When the unemployment rate suddenly decreases in 
an area, instead of needing 420 hours in order to qualify, they 
will need 500, 560 or 600, and in the end they will get benefits 
for fewer weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has given rise to a situation where there are problems not 
only in rural areas but also in cities where there has been a 
big drop in the unemployment rate. There are situations where 
people have to work 700 hours in order to qualify and they end 
up being 7, 8 or 10 weeks without any income. It is not a very 
interesting situation in which to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is closely connected with the issue of 
globalization. We must not forget that the 1994-95 employment 
insurance reforms were carried out because the International 
Monetary Fund and other organizations urged Canada to put its 
fiscal house in order. To be productive, Canada had to create 
programs that were quite similar to those of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government tried to bring our employment insurance 
system in line with the American system. Sometimes it forgets to 
look at both sides of the fence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the United States, for example, for the waiting period, 
there is, just like in our system, an old principle stating that 
during the two first weeks, the claimant is considered to be 
unemployed and, therefore, he gets no benefits. That principle 
dates back to the time when workers did not start paying 
premiums the moment they started on the job. 
A person had to work 20 hours a week for 15 weeks in order to 
qualify. Now that everyone contributes right from the first hour 
worked, this archaic waiting period ought to be done away with, 
but it is still in the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another element the government should change.  There is 
a $30 billion surplus and the bill involves about 8% of the 
annual surplus in the employment insurance fund in recent years. 
If there is an annual surplus of $6 billion, that will mean 
$500 or $600 million will be put back into the fund, which is 
about 8% of the surplus. The government keeps the rest, which 
should go to employment insurance.  This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must be brought around to changing this, and I 
hope that will happen during the committee hearings. 
It will be very important for all groups wishing to make 
representations to come and do so.  People have met with the 
Secretary of State for Amateur Sport, the Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services and probably with ministers in the 
maritime provinces as well, and just about everywhere else, and 
have been told changes would be forthcoming.  Those people are 
not very happy this morning to learn that this bill contains 
nothing of what was promised to them.  The only way they can get 
their point across properly is in a parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can be certain that those of us in the Bloc Quebecois will 
be open to people having an opportunity to be heard, so that 
amendments that reflect the points they have brought up can be 
introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am anxious to see the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport and 
the Minister of Human Resources Development contradicting each 
other on issues on which they have theoretically reached 
agreement secretly during the election campaign.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Somebody, somewhere, must have said “Yes, there will be changes 
and here is the list”. I am eager to see, when these requests 
are made public, who will win the battle going on among the 
departments under the responsibility of the current Prime 
Minister? Who will win in the end? Will it be those who are 
seeking improvements or those who want the system to remain the 
same and to continue to grab as much money as possible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, from the Bloc Quebecois, have the advantage of being able to 
speak publicly on this subject. We do not have to hide behind 
cabinet secrecy or government solidarity. 
I can assure the House that we will fully assume this responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were expecting much more since the Prime Minister had 
admitted that it was a bad reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is there an extension of the evaluation period of the 
system? We learned in the bill that the annual evaluation, which 
was to apply for a five year period, would go on for many years. 
The message is aimed at those who are waging a trench war to 
obtain improvements to the system. We will have to fight for the 
issues that we raised on a day to day and year to year basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are encouraging signs. We have long said that we are 
against the intensity rule and finally the government has 
decided to do something about it. 
Our arguments are just as strong on many other issues, including 
discrimination against young people and women. In the end I am 
convinced that the government will have to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have an election every year and this 
government's sensitivity is lower following an election. It 
seems to diminish until the next election gets close. That is a 
reality with which we have to live but we still believe that 
the soundness of the arguments and strength of the people who 
come to tell us what they are experiencing will allow our views 
to prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent weeks I also spoke to Françoise David from the 
Fédération des femmes du Québec. Mrs. David wishes to make 
representations to the parliamentary committee reviewing these 
issues, as do the union representatives and officials from the 
Associations de défense des chômeurs. I am convinced that in 
the end we can arrive at a positive solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to a release issued by the CLC, the 
Canadian Labour Congress. The title of the release is to the 
effect that two thirds of the unemployed will still not qualify. 
This morning Hans Marotte, who is the spokesperson for the 
Associations de défense des chômeurs, said the same thing: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current bill does not in any way solve the issue of 
eligibility to the plan. 
The current program will simply improve a number of minor 
conditions for people already in the system, for example, by 
abolishing the intensity rule. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the issues of insurability and the return of the right 
of access to the plan for those unemployed have not been 
resolved. In view of all this, clearly we cannot vote for 
the bill unless it is thoroughly changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois proposed two things.  First, we recommended 
that the 
bill be split into two bills.  One would be debated later and 
would cover the whole issue of management of the fund surplus to 
enable it to be come an independent fund or a payroll tax.  This 
indepth debate would be held in the coming weeks or months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other bill would concern the list of improvements to be made 
to the plan which we should vote on soon.  We are ready every 
day to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument that the Bloc Quebecois is holding up the vote 
on improvements is totally false.  We are ready to vote on 
improvements at any time but we will not be duped into 
approving a clause that would enable the government to retain 
control and legalize the misappropriation of surplus funds.  The 
bill currently permits that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is shifting responsibility for setting the 
contribution rate from the employment insurance commission to 
itself.  If the bill is passed, next year, when the rate is set, 
the government would not have to take the needs of current 
workers into account.  It would have to take the needs of labour 
into account along with its own financial requirements 
and this would justify anything the government wants to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this clause is included in the bill is that we are 
at the end of an economic cycle.  If there is such a change, the 
government would have to put money back into the system and it is 
not ready to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What people living with the employment insurance plan 
want, whether they be 
employers or employees, is a system that gives value for 
money. In an insurance plan, when there are surpluses, either 
premiums are reduced or the terms and conditions are improved 
but no third party grabs the surpluses and uses them for some 
other purpose.  Those who pay premiums are the ones who should 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us a bill that is totally unsatisfying and 
inadequate. This is a bill that would not satisfy the 
unemployed, workers, employers or unions representing workers. 
This is a bill in which the government is trying to make a 
fool's deal with us, a deal where it would give us some little 
improvement, while what is needed is a comprehensive employment 
insurance reform. Such reform would ensure that the plan would be 
administered by the people who pay into it and give dignity back 
to it, so that it can really serve the unemployed and not pay 
for the federal government's debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have efforts to make regarding the debt. We have done 
some in the past but there are people who did not get the 
return on their investment that they deserved. On their behalf, 
the Bloc Quebecois will oppose this bill as long as the changes 
deemed necessary have not been made.

interesting promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I wish to thank the electors of Acadie—Bathurst who have 
put their trust in me for a second mandate as their

it was an honour and a privilege to represent the people of 
Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a pleasure to rise today in the House to speak to 
Bill C-2. This bill was long in coming. Yet, as I will explain 
later, it does not go far enough. It was long awaited by those 
who have to rely on employment insurance benefits because of 
the EI economic region they live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, legislation was passed in 1996, which may even be 
responsible for my getting elected in 1997, because of changes 
that the Liberals had brought to employment insurance. Members 
will remember that my predecessor, Doug Young, introduced 
changes to employment insurance and described people back home 
as lazy and do-nothings, people who did not want to work. He did 
not defend the interests of our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ended up with a bill on employment insurance similar to the 
one before us today, which needs to be amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 now before us is an unfortunate one. In May 2000, 
through a motion that I had introduced in the House of Commons, 
I made a request to change employment insurance. My colleague 
and neighbour, the hon. member for Miramichi—there did not seem 
to be any problems in Miramichi—asked that changes be made to the 
EI plan rather than to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House passed my motion unanimously. All members present in 
the House of Commons supported my motion requesting that changes 
be made to the employment insurance plan. In October, with Bill 
C-34, we proposed changes to the EI plan. Why was it not passed? 
Because the Liberals preferred to wait till the last minute, 
because they knew that the Canadian Alliance was against all 
changes to the plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance had its leader come to Bathurst, New 
Brunswick at the Keddy's Hotel to meet the Alliance candidate, 
Jean Gauvin. The day before, the Alliance leader had said 
in western Canada “No changes to EI. There should even be more 
cuts”. Once in New Brunswick, he told Jean Gauvin, his 
candidate, that if the Canadian Alliance were elected it would 
save EI and help Atlantic Canadians. He was speaking from both 
side of his mouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next day, in Hamilton, Ontario, he said “EI will be cut in 
Atlantic Canada. These people have to be put back to work. They 
do not want to work and are dependent on employment insurance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again this morning, we heard what the Canadian Alliance member 
had to say. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance does not understand our country.  It does 
not understand working men and women.  It does not understand the 
jobs in the country.  It is time it got out of Alberta and B.C. 
and came down to the Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that we go to committee.  I hope the parliamentary 
committee travels across the country.  I will invite it to come 
to my home area.  I hope Jean Gauvin will have the guts to sit in 
the hall and listen to the Canadian Alliance's feelings on 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That party's leader said it would not change EI and that if 
elected it would protect the working people.  The Alliance is 
two-faced.  It was two-faced when it said that if elected it 
would refuse the pension plan.  Now its members must look at it 
again for the good of their families.  That is what they are 
saying now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That party's leader said he would never take up residence in 
Stornoway because it was a grassroots party, and he moved into 
Stornoway.  He said he would never use a limousine and he used 
one.  I am sick and tired of listening to how the Alliance feels 
about our country and especially how it treats working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now switch topics because I do not want to spend more 
time on the Canadian Alliance.  The Liberals are the ones who 
made the changes.  They listened to the Reform too much when it 
was in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the example of Hamilton, Ontario, right now.  Workers 
went on strike.  When the strike was over the company decided the 
workers had nothing to do with the strike and wanted them to 
return to the 85% level of production needed.  They punished them 
by not allowing them to collect employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government supports Stelco which is against 
steelworkers local 5328.  That type of program is against working 
people.  It is not acceptable. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The surplus in the employment insurance fund is $32 billion and 
all of it was taken right out of the pockets of workers without 
their permission. I have put it this way because I am not 
permitted to use the word that comes to mind, although according 
to the definition in the dictionary, it is stealing.  That is 
what it is; $32 billion was taken from men and women who have 
lost their jobs, the least well off in our society, who have no 
means of defending themselves, who cannot afford big name lawyers 
to take their case to court.  These people cannot defend 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a disgrace what the government says in the throne speech:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now Canadians must undertake another national project—to ensure 
that no Canadian child suffers the debilitating effects of 
poverty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a disgrace because 1.4 million children do not have enough 
to eat. These children are hungry today.  What does the 
government say in the paragraph just before this one?  It says:

income for workers and their families.  And so Canadians created 
Employment Insurance.

to be in the governing party because we want to be part of the 
government so that we can change things”.

Belledune, he did more in five minutes than I had done in three 
and a half years.

Christmas trees in July. This is the way the industry works in

Atlantic Canada.

centres are always happy to receive our 2x4s to build their 
houses 
but people in my area have no choice. When the fishing season is 
over, it is over. There are no other jobs. Putting the cart 
before the horse is not the way to go. Let us put the horse in 
front of the cart and be sensible about the way we work at 
improving the economy so that people can find work. Do not take

received unemployment insurance benefits to finish school or

Employment insurance was not meant to hurt working people.  The 
$32 billion does not belong to the Minister of Finance to balance 
his budget on the backs of people who lost their jobs.  The 
billions of dollars in the fund was to help individuals who did 
not have jobs.  The throne speech said that Canadians chose to 
have employment insurance, but the Liberals chose to take it away

the visitors are gone. Work starts on June 15 and ends on

February to May. They have nothing left.

We need a better system. The only way we can have a better 
system is by sitting down and talking like civilized people and 
by listening to the problems of Canadians, of workers across the 
country. Workers are workers, whether they are in the Gaspé

Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, the 
Yukon or the Northwest Territories, and we must understand them.

would say they have been holding demonstrations since 1988 when 
the first changes were made. That is when the Conservatives

when the government took employment insurance funds to add to 
the consolidated revenue fund, the people kept right on 
demonstrating.

were 2,500 to 5,000 of them taking to the streets. The same

Will the men and women in the crab fishery be allowed to have a 
solidarity fund? Fishers do not have any money to invest in the

money into the fund. Afterward, these workers will slip into a 
so-called gap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what happened. The people back home took to the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member expand on some of the specific problems 
with Bill C-2?  The government changed the clawback provisions. 
However, even though it tried to change the intensity rule, it 
failed to touch on the way the benefits are calculated or what we 
call the divisor rule.  Under these new rules workers who make 
applications now are getting $130 or $200 a week on their first 
paycheques, instead of $430 which was common in the old days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not difficult to see why there is a huge surplus in the 
fund.  First the government makes it more difficult to qualify 
and if people are lucky enough to qualify, which is like winning 
the lottery, it will gouge the actual benefit they receive by 
using the divisor rule and calculating the dead weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member itemize those shortcomings in the way the 
benefits are calculated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is another place where 
the workers are being hit very hard, both men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an example of a working woman in my riding who should 
have been allowed to collect employment insurance based on 52 
weeks.  She was not making much money; she made $2,736.  She had 
the hours needed to qualify for employment insurance.  However, 
according to the employment insurance rules, it only went back 26 
weeks to calculate the money.  In that 26 weeks the woman made 
$629 and received $34 per week in employment insurance. It is a 
real shame.  If the benefits were calculated the right way then 
she would have received $150 instead of $34. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another case of Mr. Réginald Raîche called me yesterday. 
He had worked and earned wages of over $350.  Because the 
calculations were based on 26 weeks, instead of all his hours of 
work being calculated, he is receiving only $74 instead of 
receiving over $200. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the type of case where we have to have an open mind and 
make changes.  That will not encourage Réginald Raîche to work 
more. He had a hard time getting 10 weeks.  He was trying hard, 
even calling my office to ask for help to get some hours.  He 
said he did not want to be on welfare.  He wanted to work but 
there are no jobs in his riding during the winter.  There are 
probably no jobs in some parts of the riding of my dear colleague 
from Winnipeg or in the ridings of some of my colleagues from the 
Gaspé coast.  There is no work and that is the reason some 
changes have to be made.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member 
on the three specific examples he gave us of all that needs to 
be changed in employment insurance and the need for an indepth 
reform of the system, which serves more to accumulate surpluses 
for the government than as a true employment insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him a question about the fate of older 
workers.  The program for older worker adjustment has not been 
in effect since 1995, when it was set aside.  The government has 
programs for active measures. 
Today, workers aged 50, 51, 52, 53 or 55 do not necessarily 
have the skills for retraining in another field.  Jobs in 
different sectors do not necessarily correspond either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was expecting the federal government would do something in 
this regard.  Employment insurance money could be used or a way 
found to establish a bridge with old age pension benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he agree with me that it would be relevant with respect to 
the surplus in the employment insurance fund, in the case of 
people who have contributed for 15, 20 or 25 years, to have 
something added to the bill so that older workers could have a 
proper program and so there could be something to help carry 
them over to their old age pension? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank the Bloc 
Quebecois member for his question. Yes, something could be done.

the divider. One can work 420 hours over a 12 week period and 
divide by 14. Again, we are stuck with the divider. Bill C-2 
should eliminate the divider rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for those aged 50 and over, it is 
not easy—and I am sure you would agree with me, Mr. Speaker—with the 
new technology, to go back to a community college and try to 
learn how to operate a computer and become an expert in the new 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a program to help these people. 
Back home, there are plant workers who tell us “We have worked 
for 35 or 40 years in a fish plant; give us our pension, do 
something”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the case of those over 50 and out of work, we 
had a system whereby they would work for six months and then let 
someone else take over for six months. That program worked well 
but only lasted five years. It had a positive effect in my 
region. People felt useful to the community. They felt useful in 
today's world and they did not find themselves with nothing at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the bill should include such initiatives to help those 
who lose their job at a certain age because of the new 
technology or cuts. We must help them upgrade their skills or 
find something else. An employment insurance program should be 
in place to help these people. 
We now find ourselves with something that makes no sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment.  I am not sure 
whether to chastise you, criticize you, or promote you.  During 
the last parliament you were the government whip. I guess I am 
giving you some credit because it was a very tight majority.  You 
never lost a vote in that three and a half years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it is difficult for us on this side of the House to say 
it, I think you did an extremely good job.  Despite our political 
differences, I think your colleagues recognized that.  I wish you 
the best in the chair.  Being a former NHL referee, as has been 
mentioned many times, it comes naturally to you.  This is 
probably a tougher forum than some of the ones you have refereed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 is a replacement for Bill C-44 which died on the order 
paper when the election was called.  It was to address some of 
the difficulties the government incurred following its draconian 
moves on the EI file in 1996.  At that time The government 
inflicted a lot of punishment on seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really revolved around the intensity clause, which meant that 
if one collected employment insurance over a period of years, one 
would lose 1% of the benefits, up to 5% if one collected over 
what is called a 20 week cycle over a five year period.  In other 
words if one was a claimant for five years, one would lose 5% of 
the benefits.  That would bring it down from 55% to 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not seem like a lot of money to any one of us in the 
House, but my colleagues and I have done a quick calculation 
based on a minimum wage worker.  Many workers in New Brunswick 
and other parts of Canada are earning minimum wage.  In some 
cases it is as little as $6 an hour, or $240 a week before taxes, 
before EI premiums, CPP and all other deductions are taken off. 
With a $240 paycheque, how much does one have at the end of the 
day?  It is not very much.  I suggest in the order of $200 with 
any luck.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When our jobs ran out what did we do?  Was there a safety net? 
There was, and it was called unemployment insurance.  The name 
has now been changed to employment insurance.  I guess it is a 
more positive name.  No one wants to use the word unemployment. 
Employment insurance is the instrument we would look at for some 
protection and support when we are unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intensity rule meant that a minimum wage worker would be 
entitled to $120 a week in employment insurance.  That is what 
their benefit would be if they were unemployed.  It would be 5% 
higher, somewhere in the order of $126, maybe $130 tops, if one 
had not claimed employment insurance at all.  Basically, that is 
the straw that broke the camel's back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was not being very responsible or responsive to 
its citizens at the time.  I know some of the ministers in 
Atlantic Canada simply played hardball with the seasonal workers. 
They basically told the workers to get off their rear ends and go 
to work not realizing that work does not come that easily in some 
parts of Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada.  I am still 
surprised at my colleagues from the united alternative, formerly 
the Reform Party, when they talk about lazy Atlantic Canadians. 
They have made that statement more than once.  In fact it hung 
them in Atlantic Canada in the last election.  They were out 
campaigning hoping to get elected while calling the people lazy, 
the very people they would have been representing in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal work is not the type of work that most of those people 
would prefer.  They would prefer full time jobs, 52 weeks of the 
year, but unfortunately that is not possible in some parts of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government brought this in, it received a lot of 
criticism.  In fact, that criticism was borne out in the election 
of 1997 when the Liberal Party lost 19 seats in Atlantic Canada 
because the feeling was that the government was not being 
responsive to the people it represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Atlantic Canada is the poorest part of Canada.  We do not have 
oil in the ground at $40 a barrel.  If we did there would be a 
big difference.  We do not have a car manufacturing capacity and 
the benefits of an industrialized society.  We will give all 
levels of government credit for making advancements but there is 
still a long way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have fish plant workers and fishermen.  We have 
woodworkers and people employed in the tourism sector.  All of 
those are seasonal workers, workers who can only make a living 
part of the year and at the end of the year they are left to draw 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government realized that it had lost those 19 seats in 
1997, it decided it would do something about it.  On the eve of 
the election last fall, it brought in a bill that would address 
this issue.  In other words, it would eliminate the intensity 
clause.  It decided that it had made a mistake, that the 5% 
punishment on seasonal workers was too much and that it was going 
to change it.  I give the government credit for doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the legislation was held up in the House by the 
united alternative party because it does not believe in that. 
There was just too much generosity in the package for minimum 
wage workers for members of that party to swallow, despite the 
fact that they have swallowed themselves whole on the pension 
issue.  They made a career of attacking big government and the 
generosity of government, and destroyed many political careers in 
the process, only to find out that every single one of them will 
eventually jump on the pension bandwagon which they chastized, 
criticized and condemned for the last 10 years of their lives. 
What else would we expect them to do on this bill?  What do they 
do?  They attack little people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can be attacked on this as well because it is 
addressing the intensity clause.  In so doing, it has eliminated 
the commission.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission is the body set up by the government to determine 
what the rate will be.  Currently employees are paying $2.25 into 
EI.  That is their premium.  The employer is paying 1.4% above 
that.  Effectively the employer is paying over $3 and the 
employee is paying in $2.25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government now done?  By stealth, it has limited 
the capacity of the commission to establish the rate because the 
rate is too high. The rate could be set at $1.75 for the 
employee.  That is borne out by the auditor, the chief actuary of 
employment insurance premiums.  He states in his report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is likely that a rate as low as 1.75% could also be set for 
the year 2001 and kept for the indefinite future.  Although this 
rate would contain a smaller margin of safety, the current 
surplus would still make it a reasonable option. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has simply eliminated the ability of the 
commission to set the rate because it is sitting on a $35 billion 
surplus in the fund.  This is expected to grow to $50 billion in 
the next two years while the commission is suspended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rate could go down to $1.75 because the interest on that $35 
billion today has to go back into the fund.  That helps keep the 
rate lower.  The reason the government will act in stealth is 
that the EI surplus is just a bookkeeping entry.  The government 
even wants to eliminate that, because once it eliminates that 
entry it will be free to cash in the $50 billion and use it as it 
so desires.  In fact it already has; this is just a paper 
transaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will effectively allow the government to keep the rates 
higher.  If it does not have the $35 billion, the interest on 
which helps to keep premiums lower, it will then have the ability 
to sneak premiums up when necessary.  This is why the entire bill 
has to be revisited.  The ability of the government to suspend 
the commission has to be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a history of acting in this way, especially 
on this file.  Who else but this lonely group of us at this end 
of the House of Commons will stand to defend the lowly, seasonal, 
minimum wage workers?  I give the NDPers credit.  They 
consistently support the little guy, and that is what we are 
doing.  We cannot leave it up to the government to do it because 
it has a horrible history of ignoring the little people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens when those safety nets disappear which we see 
happening at the municipal, provincial and federal levels?  What 
do the little people have to fall back on?  We are not talking 
about the generosity of government.  We are talking about a fund 
that they have paid into, expecting it to be there when they need 
it.  It is called insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many times have we heard about people being duped by 
insurance companies where they pay in but cannot collect?  It is 
pretty well the same.  The government wants them to pay in.  It 
wants them to pay premiums higher than they should be, but it 
does not want them to go to the fund when they need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we have government departments acting in collusion 
to hit little people who cannot defend themselves.

“Justice:  Revenue Canada unfairly targeted businessman, judge 
rules”.  The article about a businessman says that “Saint John 
auctioneer Tim Isaac's tax evasion case has been thrown out after 
a judge ruled that he had been unfairly targeted by Revenue 
Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Isaac survived this witch hunt only because he had the financial 
wherewithal to hire a lawyer to defend him.  The judge came down 
hard on the Department of Revenue, which is now called the CCRA, 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency.  The better words for that 
would be “Revenue Canada”.  That is what we used to call it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we find the same thing happening to the lowly clam digger. 
What do clam diggers do?  They go out right now in sub-zero 
weather—they go out in summer as well—to harvest clams in the 
mud flats by digging them up by hand. It is back breaking labour. 
These people are the working poor, there is no question about it. 
They average $6 an hour, maybe $8 an hour if they are lucky 
enough and strong enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just found out that there is another witch hunt underway, 
but this time it is Revenue Canada, now called the Canada Customs 
and Revenue Agency, working with DFO, the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans, and HRDC, Human Resources Development Canada, to take 
a look at some of these clam diggers' claims.  They will also 
take a look at some of the buyers of these clams, because somehow 
they feel that the tax man is being cheated.  This morning HRDC 
officials confirmed that they have had numerous third party 
reports concerning claimants drawing EI who have not worked, who 
did not dig enough clams to actually claim the benefits they are 
claiming.  That is the long and short of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are third party reports?  Are they hearsay evidence?  We do 
not know.  No one knows.  These are rumours, the same kind of 
rumour that allowed the tax people to go after Mr. Isaac.  He 
hired a lawyer and the government was chastised severely by the 
judge in that case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case we have 33 to 36 interviews by 
government officials—interview is basically another word for 
interrogation—of the lowly little clam diggers to determine 
whether or not they dug clams.  They had no counsel in the room 
with them.  They had no one representing them.  Not one of them, 
and probably not all 36 of them pooling their resources together, 
could afford a lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the type of government we have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people get desperate they do desperate things.  One of the 
things that people want to do when they get desperate is to feed 
and clothe their children, particularly when it is the kind of 
winter that we are having now in eastern Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never know what goes on in that room when two government 
officials interrogate the lowly clam digger.  That is digging to 
the bottom of the barrel when one goes in and violates people's 
rights or, as our justice critic says, the charter of rights.  Do 
the government officials read the clam diggers their rights when 
they go into the room and interrogate them?  My feeling is no, 
the officials probably do not, because they know that they can 
kick the bejesus out of these little people, get away with it and 
have a minister sitting right over there defending their actions. 
In fact, it was government orders from right here in Ottawa that 
caused them to do this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not criticizing the local HRDC officials, because if they 
do not carry out their actions, they are gone too.  The 
government does not have any compassion for its own workers and 
has even less compassion for the disenfranchised, which is what 
these people are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why when we stand up in the House we defend the little 
guy, because no one else is going to do it.  The little guys 
cannot afford a lawyer or a consultant and there will be no one 
on that side of the aisle to come to their defence, and very few 
of us on this side.  That is one of the few things I can give the 
Bloc credit for as well.  It is not very often I defend the Bloc. 
They will defend their lowly woods workers and fishermen.  The 
NDP will defend the little guy as well.  So will we.  The 
majority in the House will not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of harassment of little people has to cease and 
desist.  If the ministers involved had any respect at all for 
human life and human dignity they would get together, share the 
information, consult with the members on this side of the House 
and find a better way of doing this.  In the middle of winter 
when it is damned hard to be make a living as a clam digger, what 
is now being done is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be proposing amendments to the EI bill.  We are prepared 
to support it with some amendments.  We do not want to go back to 
the old days of what they called the lottery, of working 10 weeks 
and loafing for 40.  There must always be a balance between a 
system that is too generous and one that is too miserly and too 
hard on the workers.  That is the type of balance we want to 
strike.  That is the reason we will support anything that comes 
in to help the little guy, but we do not want to flip-flop too 
much the other way and make the system too generous.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I extend my personal 
congratulations and thanks to you in recognition of your 
appointment to the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to thank the great people of Sackville—Musquodoboit 
Valley—Eastern Shore in Nova Scotia for giving me the honour of 
being their representative twice in a row. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my hon. colleague from New Brunswick, who 
lives in a very beautiful part of the world.  An awful lot of 
people were hurt by the EI changes, not only working people but 
small business people.  We all know that if a business were to go 
into a certain community and say that it would drop $20 million 
there, both federal and provincial governments would bend over 
backwards to do anything they could to get that business in 
there.  Yet communities like Saint John, New Brunswick, or St. 
John's, Newfoundland, had almost $100 million ripped out of the 
local economies because of the changes to EI.  It meant 
devastation for small business, families and workers in those 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member please elaborate on why the Liberal 
government would take away that money from those hard working 
people and then give it away in tax breaks for major 
corporations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know the 
complete answer, but it is the history of this particular party 
to do that.  I do not want to make it sound as if big business is 
the enemy, because it is not.  We have an economy that is 
chugging along pretty well and hopefully we will be able to 
survive the downturn in the American economy, which has hit the 
United States much worse than it has Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not simply them versus us and governments always 
supporting big business.  We must have big business and I have 
big business owners in my riding who are very good corporate 
citizens.  However, if I am right about the direction the member 
is taking in his question about grants going to big business, 
which is that maybe some of the money should go to Canadians who 
really need the help, I do not think most of us would disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the balance governments have to strike:  governments 
must not only do good but appear to be doing good.  That is 
always difficult.  I know that when we talk about loan guarantees 
to companies such as Bombardier and so on, it is easy to 
criticize them, but even though Bombardier is a large corporation 
and a very successful one, in the marketplace those types of 
guarantees are sometimes important for corporations. 
Sometimes governments have to make them.  Oftentimes, if they had 
their druthers, they would rather not, but there is 
globalization.  I know that the NDP's view of globalization is 
not quite the same as our party's, and I think some of their 
concerns are justified, but on balance we need to have 
corporations, big and small.

healthy, we could do without some of the things we are actually 
talking about here today.  Unfortunately that is a perfect world 
and we do not live in a perfect world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are talking about today is about support for little 
people when they need it, and I think that is one area we can 
agree on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to  my 
colleague's speech and I noticed that he was aware that on 
this issue his arguments were often those of the Bloc 
Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a matter of equity that goes beyond the various 
positions members may have on the national issue. Obviously we 
have created a monster with our employment insurance program. 
That monster has killed social equity, particularly the pact 
made with Canada's and Quebec's resource regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about amendments he would like to make to the 
legislation. I would like to know if these could be brought 
in quickly so we could vote on two bills as suggested by the 
Bloc Quebecois and so people could benefit from 
improvements to the program as soon as possible. There would be 
a first bill aimed at improving the program, and a second bill, 
which we could debate later on, on the issue of the employment 
insurance fund surplus. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as has been mentioned in 
the House, perhaps the whole EI file should go to committee, not 
just the specifics in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the points I did not make, which is not part of the bill, 
is about the EI boundary situation.  Every four or five years 
these boundaries are changed, based on census data and so on.  It 
is almost like redistribution in a political district.  Some of 
those changes have imposed a lot of hardship in rural New 
Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding it has, because we have fishing communities now 
lumped in with bigger areas like Saint John and Fredericton that 
have higher levels of economic opportunity or, in other words, 
lower unemployment.  Seasonal workers in those larger areas are 
brought into these higher areas of economic development, which 
means they have to work longer hours for fewer benefits.  The 
numbers are very much distorted by some of these bigger centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the committee to take a look at how we could fine 
tune some of those districts to take into account some of the 
difficulties that are brought in when the larger centres put 
these rural areas at a disadvantage simply because the 
unemployment rates in those areas are lower.  It becomes very 
complex.  Once one part of the equation is changed, it all has to 
be changed, but it is one thing I would like to see discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer I personally organized public meetings in my 
constituency on that very matter, and the government did change 
those boundaries.  Even though it is a five year process, the 
government said I was right, that these people were being treated 
unfairly.  The government said it would be changed and did put it 
back to where it was over about a four year period.  It is just a 
temporary fix. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole question of EI should be viewed by the committee in 
the hope of improving it from top to bottom, including the 
boundary situation, which is very unfair to rural seasonal 
workers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, several 
times during the debate today I have heard members of the 
opposition make reference to the bill going to committee. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to clarify a point.  As members of the opposition know, 
we are now at the second reading stage of Bill C-2, after which 
the bill will go immediately to the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development and the Status of Persons with 
Disabilities.  I am clarifying this because members of the 
opposition all day have been suggesting that it might not go to 
committee.  The bill will, in fact, follow due process like any 
other bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are well aware of 
that, but what we are referring to is the bigger picture. 
Obviously the bill deals with only some parts of the EI file. The 
boundary situation is not even mentioned in the bill.  We 
understand that it will go to committee where we will have a 
chance to put forward amendments, which I think most of us will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party regards the bill's failure to mention boundaries as one 
of its errors.  We have a solution or at least some ideas that 
might be workable if some attention is given to the bill.  I 
think this can be done best via committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will keep my comments short and ask one very specific question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the PCs support an amendment ensuring that workers in the 
trade school component of their apprenticeship have no two week 
waiting period for EI?  These people are not unemployed.  They 
are still attached to the workforce.  They are simply in school 
doing their annual six week school component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Tories support such an amendment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, all my advisors tell me 
that we would support that.  In all fairness, I have not looked 
at that but it is an idea that sounds intriguing.  My colleagues, 
whom I always depend on, tell us that we could.  Given that, I 
think we probably could do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was interested in the remarks by some of our colleagues in 
trying to portray themselves as the only ones who fight for the 
little guy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Substance this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  There will be a lot of substance if 
the hon. member would care to listen.  What they actually fight 
for is a little caucus, just to set the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a reason I have made that point. It is curious 
that members from eastern Canada come here and fight the changes 
to the Employment Insurance Act, when in fact the message came 
through loud and clear, through 19 Liberal seats in the 
maritimes, that they wanted change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must also remember that our government monitored the changes 
made in 1996 and realized that they needed an additional review. 
That is what this is about.  Contrary to the negativity that 
tends to come from across the floor, they should be saying that 
they are pleased the government is listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members may be surprised to hear that there are members on 
this side of the House, myself included, who would support 
additional changes that may come out of committee, such as the 
apprenticeship issue mentioned by my good friend from Winnipeg. 
It makes a lot of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is employment insurance?  It reminds me somewhat of the 
definition of life insurance.  One pays a premium to a company 
betting that one will die.  The company accepts the premium 
betting the client will live, and the client hopes they are 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance is very similar.  The employees pay a 
premium along with the employer.  In doing so, the employees are 
betting that they might need the use of the fund.  They are 
betting that they could lose their job. 
The employment insurance commission bets the employees will not, 
and the employees hope it is right.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI is an insurance program and not a social program which, with 
all due respect to my colleagues in the NDP, is how they view it. 
It is an insurance plan based on studies and actuarially sound 
financial data.  The premiums are adjusted up and down as the 
economy functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Conservative Party say that the premiums are too 
high.  It was not too many years ago, under former Prime Minister 
Mulroney, when the premiums exceeded $3.  Under this Liberal 
government the premiums are down to $2.25.  Let us not speak of 
premiums being too high, or of the surplus that my friends on the 
opposite side so eloquently discuss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the members back in a time machine about 10 
years and have them tell me what the surplus was.  Was there a 
surplus at all?  In reality there was not.  There was a deficit. 
Let us look at the history of the unemployment/employment 
insurance program.  At the end of the day it is the government of 
the day that is responsible for ensuring that EI money is 
available to workers at 55% of their earned income.  It is the 
government's responsibility to provide the money in good times 
and in bad.  Ultimately the government of the day, whatever 
party, is on the hook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How was the surplus created?  It is not rocket science.  More 
revenue is being generated in total premiums, both from workers 
and from corporations, than is being paid out in benefits because 
the unemployment rate is low.  Therefore not all the money is 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if the economy turns?  Are we naive enough to think 
that we will keep rolling along, that there will never be a 
change, a bump in the road or a downturn?   We already see it 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance is not, with all due respect, just for 
Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Members can get excited if they want 
but they should talk to some of the auto workers and steel 
workers.  Employment insurance is there to give all Canadians 
some security.  It is there so workers will know that when there 
are problems on the car assembly line in Windsor or in Brampton, 
an insurance program is available for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite chirp about seasonal work as if there were not 
four seasons anywhere but in their ridings.  What about the 
construction industry?  Do we not have construction workers 
working through all four seasons?  We all know the difficulty of 
pouring concrete in freezing weather and doing other jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  How would you know? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite asks 
how I would know.  I know quite well that it is extremely 
important to recognize that employment insurance is not a 
regional insurance program but a national program for all 
Canadians.  It is there to help the fishers in Newfoundland and 
on the west coast, the construction workers in Ontario and all 
those across this great land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes being made in this bill are based on the fact that 
the changes that were put in place in 1996 were in some instances 
punitive, although they were not meant to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes courage for a government to admit its mistakes.  The 
intensity rule reduced EI premiums for repeat claimants from 55% 
down to 50%.  The Liberal government found that eliminating the 
rule did not significantly change the number of claimants, and so 
it questioned the benefit of ever having introduced it. 
The government said that it was punitive to workers who needed 
the employment insurance fund perhaps more than those in other 
parts of the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite talk about the economic status of parts of the 
country.  It is true that the economy in some parts of Canada is 
not as strong as it is in other parts.  We have certainly 
experienced a boom since 1993 when the government came into 
office.  Certainly that has been the case in Ontario.  I do not 
deny that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know there have been problems in the maritimes where 
employment insurance needs to be adjusted to ensure people in 
that part of this great country are treated more fairly.  We are 
eliminating the intensity rule.  Let us be clear about that.  We 
have said it was punitive and that we put it in for a specific 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members that one of the reasons we put it in place was 
to stop large corporations such as General Motors, Ford or 
others, from quite legally using the employment insurance fund as 
an economic tool.  They could shut down the assembly line for 
weeks while they retooled to switch to another vehicle, simply 
lay off the workers and allow them to go on UI or EI.  Once the 
retooling was done they could bring the workers back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw that as corporate manipulation of an employment insurance 
program which was put in place to provide insurance to replace 
income loss due to job loss.  It was not for large corporations 
to use as an economic tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put it there for a good reason, but recognized that it became 
punitive to those people who consistently had to rely on 
employment insurance.  Let us also recognize that they continue 
to pay the premiums.  The intensity rule is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about the clawback.  This is one of the areas where 
workers in Ontario will benefit most in terms of their income. 
When workers attain a combined annual family income of a certain 
level, at income tax time the government starts clawing back the 
employment insurance benefits they may have received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Mr. Mulroney was Prime Minister I believe the level was 
somewhere in the neighbourhood of $64,000 or $65,000.   Workers 
at that time could be on employment insurance for a couple of 
months, work for the balance of the year, exceed $65,000, and 
Revenue Canada at income tax time would claw back their benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seemed to us that was too high.  The changes we made in 1996 
reduced it to $48,750, and then again reduced it to $39,000.  In 
some ridings one may be able to live with a family on $39,000 and 
have EI clawed back although it is not a lot of money.  However, 
if a worker lives in the GTA, works in the construction industry 
and has an income of $39,000, at which point the government 
starts clawing back benefits because he or she was unemployed for 
four weeks or eight weeks or something in that nature, it is 
definitely too low a threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was members of this caucus who fought and spoke passionately 
about returning the clawback level to a more reasonable $48,750, 
so that if second or third repeat EI claimants are off for a 
period of time they would see when their incomes exceed 
$48,750—by the way, first time claimants are exempt from any of 
this—a clawback of benefits to a maximum of 30% of the income 
over and above. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me members opposite, supposed champions of the 
little guy, should stand and applaud that kind of recognition of 
economic reality. 
It is an extremely important position.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak briefly about apprenticeship training.  The member 
for Winnipeg Centre asked the Tories if they would support 
eliminating the two week waiting period for apprenticeship 
trainees.  I think that makes a lot of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to work at seeing that happen in committee.  If it does 
not happen, we should not throw out the baby with the bath water. 
We should continue.  I believe it is a sound argument and a fair 
argument because we do not give enough recognition in my view to 
apprentices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a private member's bill, and the member for Winnipeg 
Centre had one that mirrored mine, that would have provided 
national standards for apprenticeship training from sea to sea to 
sea.  We recognize high school diplomas and university degrees 
anywhere in the country regardless of where they are obtained. We 
recognize them without a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then do we not recognize the qualifications of an apprentice 
in every corner of Canada?  I know we do in some instances.  With 
the red seal program some 44 apprenticeship programs are 
recognized nationally, but not all of them are covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seemed like a very logical bill that should have been 
supported by all sides of the House.  I really thought there was 
a chance for unanimity.  The problem that arose was that there 
were two particular parties in the House more dedicated to 
provincial authority, provincial responsibility and the delivery 
of programs at the provincial level than they were to supporting 
national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill would not have changed the delivery mechanism for 
apprenticeship training.  In Ontario we have a wonderful system 
through our community colleges supported by the provincial 
government.  In Ontario we would continue to deliver the 
apprenticeship funding and the programs at the provincial level, 
but it would allow for national standards to be put in place that 
would have no impact on provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the way things work around this place, my bill 
was not allowed to be votable.  It was not allowed on the floor 
of the House for a vote of all members because the Canadian 
Alliance and the Bloc had provincialism as their top agenda. They 
are more concerned about that than they are about nation 
building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge every member of the House to strive to help young 
people, apprentices, to develop.  It is fine for us to say that 
we would like all our kids to be doctors and lawyers, but the 
reality is that we need plumbers, bricklayers, pipefitters and 
carpenters.  As a matter of fact my youngest son starts a week 
today as a carpenter's apprentice.  We need all those trades to 
help build the nation.  We should be supporting them and we 
should be proud of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interest of moving the debate along, I conclude by saying 
that the government has shown a lot of courage.  We have adopted 
fair wage.  I have not heard anyone from the New Democratic Party 
applaud the government for doing it.  A worker's wages can no 
longer be used as the determining factor in awarding a contract 
if it is led by the government.  We have adopted fair wage as a 
policy.  We have adopted changes to the Income Tax Act that will 
allow for the tracing of contracts given out so that all the 
proper taxes are paid, that the unions have a chance to know who 
is doing the work and where it is being done, and that the 
workers are being paid properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also put in place a program of changes to employment 
insurance.  Here is the construction trades list:  repeal the 
intensity rule, which has been done; fix the small weeks problem, 
which has been done for claimants in some areas; fund 
apprentices, which has not been done yet; adjust the clawback, 
which has done and change the re-entrant rules, which has been 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not only listening to the people in the maritimes who 
rewarded us with a substantial amount of confidence in returning 
a large number of Liberal Party members to the House of Commons. 
That should have sent a message to both the New Democrats and the 
Tories, but apparently they did not get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are progressive.  We want these changes to go through.  I 
hope to see additional changes made at committee which will 
benefit the men and women in the hardworking families that help 
build this great nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened to much of the discussion today.  As numerous 
opposition members were speaking I saw a lot of baffled looks on 
the government's side, as if they were being enlightened by all 
the employment insurance problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the Liberals paid any attention to all the people in 
Canada who were complaining for over a couple of years that they 
were suffering and could not afford to feed their families.  They 
just did not listen.  Then, shortly before an election they tried 
to move the bill along, making promises all over the country.  My 
colleague mentioned that they received a great victory down east. 
We all know of the employment insurance promises that were made 
down east by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Economic blackmail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Absolutely.  Blackmail is a term 
that often gets used for that kind of thing.  When employment 
insurance first came into being there was a vision.  We had to do 
something to help unemployed workers to be able to put money into 
their pockets.  The vision was there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When money goes into a successful program and the program 
develops a surplus, most insurance plans would enhance the 
program.  What does the Government of Canada do?  It wondered how 
it could cut back on the program to see how much money it could 
save or maybe it wondered how much money it needed to cut down 
the debt or deficit and decided to get the money out of the 
employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of having a vision for improving the lives of Canadians 
and unemployed workers, improving training not just in the 
Atlantic or the north but throughout the country, building unity 
in the country and providing national programs that benefit 
everyone, the government did nothing.  It piecemealed every bit 
and figured out how much money it would keep, how many dollars it 
could shaft from workers and not give back to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague mentioned all the wonderful things in the 
bill.  Is he willing to look at having the employment insurance 
program operate separately?  Is he willing to have the money not 
become part of the government coffers but go strictly for the 
improvement of training and employment of unemployed workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a fair question. 
I knew she would get there eventually.  The reality is that the 
auditor general recommended that the so-called surplus from more 
cashflow in than we are paying out in good economic times should 
go to general revenue.  We simply adopted the auditor general's 
recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear.  The member overlooked one point I made in my 
speech.  Let us take ourselves either 10 years back or maybe 10 
years ahead to a point where there is less money coming in from 
employment insurance premiums than we are paying out in benefits 
and when the plan is in a deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that plan is left to stand alone, does that then mean the 
plan is unable to live up to the commitment or the benefits that 
will be needed at a time when the economy takes a downturn? Or, 
does that mean the government will write a cheque, which I know 
is the NDP way having served under Bob Rae for five years, 
whenever it goes down below the break even line? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have it both ways.  Employment insurance benefits 
workers, but it is also paid for by companies and employers as 
well as the workers.  It is a bilateral payment agreement that 
ensures the money will be there when it is needed.  We cannot 
have it both ways, like the NDP would, by simply spending it into 
oblivion and putting it in a place where it is no longer 
financially sustainable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague from Mississauga West talked about life insurance and 
employment insurance.  I think he does not understand that 
workers did not adopt a life insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal throne speech says that there was a time when losing 
one's job also meant immediate loss of income for workers and 
their families.  Therefore Canadians created employment 
insurance. It was not life insurance.  I think the member  is 
smart enough to know that it is an employment insurance program, 
not life insurance.  He should get the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also talked about feeling bad about people making $39,000 a 
year and how it was difficult to live on that amount.  I would 
like to see him in my area where people work for $8,000 or 
$12,000 a year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have his opinion on that.  Is he ready to 
recommend changes when people lose their employment insurance by 
the month of February because the fishery only starts in May and 
the woodcutters only start cutting in June? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is his solution?  Is it welfare?  Is that how he wants to 
treat the workers in Timmins, Hearst, White River and Wawa, 
Ontario?  Is that how he wants to treat the people in Ontario who 
have the same problem and whom I have visited personally?  Would 
he suggest that those people are not the real workers of the 
country who participate in good economic development?  Is he 
saying that those people abuse the system all the time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also mentioned the Atlantic provinces.  Is that how 
disconnected they are?  Do members know why sometimes people vote 
for the Liberals?  It is because 35 days before the election they 
look like a bunch of NDP but the day after the election they 
become Liberals again.  In Acadie—Bathurst, the people woke up 
and said to the Liberals that there was no place in the House of 
Commons for the Liberals.  They put back another NDP and members 
know his name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess by extrapolation 
what the hon. member is saying is that everybody else in the 
country except the wise people of his riding are stupid.  I would 
think that is a pretty unfair analysis from that perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will clarify something.  When I used the example of life 
insurance I made the point that people were paying a premium on 
the presumption that it was there to protect them.  With their 
employment insurance premium, they are betting they will lose 
their jobs and the insurance company is betting they will not. 
Obviously the workers hope the insurance company is right and 
they will not lose their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is a hard concept for the hon. member to understand 
but maybe if he has a chance to read it in <I>Hansard</I> with a 
highlighter he will figure it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill the government has recognized that the intensity 
rule needs to be changed, which is part of the problem the member 
talked about when he talked about seasonal workers.  It does not 
matter whether they are from Timmins, Ontario or from 
Acadie—Bathurst.  It is a national program for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have recognized that some of the changes that occurred in 
1996 were punitive against the workers.  I would have expected 
that member in particular to stand and applaud the government for 
having the courage to recognize that and making those changes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, can the member please tell us where 
the $30 billion to $35 billion EI surplus go?  The surplus 
belonged to businesses and workers in the country.  Where is the 
surplus? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is exactly where the 
auditor general suggested it should go.  It went into general 
revenue.  When it goes into general revenue it is used like all 
sources, whether it is GST, income tax or corporate tax, it is 
used for all sources of the government's priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question for the member opposite would be, what does 
the government do when the insurance plan takes a dip, when the 
economy goes down and unemployment goes up?  They live in never 
never land.  They think it will never happen, that things will 
just carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some news for them.  The United States economy is 
experiencing some severe trouble and there will be some impact. 
We are already seeing it in some areas of this country.  What 
this government has done is made sure that the employment 
insurance program, which will benefit workers and the little guy 
they pretend to represent, is sustainable and will be there to 
support those people who need it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I sat here listening to this debate 
and I am dismayed that the government would actually cater and 
pander to a vision of the future for this country that is less 
than what it can be. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know, and every member in the House knows very well, that 
seasonal workers do not want to work only part of a season. They 
do not want to make minimum wage.  They do not want to make less 
than what others make.  They want to maximize their potential. 
They want to work full time and all year long.  They want to give 
their children a better future than they have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that in the context of the employment 
insurance bill the government is catering to an old way of 
looking at things.  Our party and our party critic have for a 
long time been putting forth ideas to ensure that the employment 
insurance plan in the country is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day this is a question of balance.  It is a 
question of ensuring that seasonal workers and people who are 
unemployed through no fault of their own can be taken care of in 
their time of need.  It is also a question of balance for the 
people who pay into the program, the employer and employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always striven for, and indeed the government would be 
wise to look at this, an employment insurance plan that strikes 
that balance.  That is a true insurance program to make sure that 
in time of need a person will have enough money to live on.  They 
will not be hard done by as members of the NDP and the 
Conservative Party have mentioned throughout the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a question of ensuring that money is there in the 
future.  The member from the Liberal Party mentioned that.  We 
want that too.  However, it is unethical and unfair both to the 
employer and the employee that the government takes $10 billion 
out every single year, which is more than what they use.  That is 
nothing more than another tax on the employer and the employee. 
Rather than that money going into general revenues to be spent as 
the government sees fit, we feel it would be better to use that 
money specifically to ensure that those seasonal workers and our 
workforce as a whole have a better chance to compete in the 
changing economy in which we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear very little from the other side about the complex nature 
of our changing economy, both nationally and internationally.  We 
live in a globalized structure.  Information is passing back and 
forth much quicker.  Political and economic shocks are felt very 
rapidly and quickly by nations around the world because of 
greater linkages.  We also feel them.  As a nation, we depend 
very much upon our ability to export and our ability to export 
determines our standard of living at home.  These shocks affect 
the pocketbooks of Canadian employers and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear very little about the ability for us to maximize our 
niche as a nation.  We hear very little about our ability to deal 
with the demographic changes of our aging population and 
immigration.  All these things are going to have a profound 
impact upon our ability to be competitive in a more globalized, 
more linked international community.  As a nation, we are not 
only competing with the people next door to us, the people down 
the street, the people in the next province, we are also 
competing with countries from around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent for us as a country, and indeed everybody in the 
House, to ensure that the employees and employers of the country 
maximize their potential.  Maximizing potential is what I am 
going to refer to today.  My colleague, the critic, has done an 
excellent job of articulating our position on this view and my 
other colleagues will do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address a few specific issues that my party and many 
other members of the House have addressed before.  How do we 
maximize our economy?  First, we need to put the EI program on 
firm fiscal ground.  We need to ensure that the moneys paid by 
the employers and employees are less.  This will lessen the tax 
load.  For example, if we lessen the tax burden on the employers 
and employees, employers would have more money to train their 
employees.  Employers would have more money to hire people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member who just spoke mentioned some ideas on how we 
could maximize our educational abilities.  This is an issue I 
will get to in the future and which is very important. 
Unfortunately, there are huge issues that have not been dealt 
with by the government to this day.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to talk about the issue of taxes.  A lot of people 
are not investing in Canada because we have a far less desirable 
environment because of high personal and the high corporate 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would criticize us and say that we just want to lower taxes 
for the rich.  That is nonsense.  An intelligent tax reduction 
strategy, which is what we have been trying to get, ensures that 
all people, particularly those in the lower socioeconomic levels, 
have more money in their pocket.  In fact, we have been 
articulating plans to ensure that those in the lowest 
socioeconomic groups pay no tax.  Why?  Having a job is the 
greatest social program we can have in this country today.  I 
know those seasonal workers out there who are listening would be 
rather be working full time than have some income supplement 
program, some gift from the government or some cheque in the 
mail.  They would rather earn it themselves.  They could then 
provide for themselves and their family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been trying to articulate plans for lower personal and 
corporate income taxes to enable our citizens to be competitive 
in the global economy.  We know the Prime Minister is visiting 
the president of the U.S., Mr. Bush.  We know they are going to 
talk about some economic issues.  Mr. Bush has decided to lower 
taxes even more.  That is going to increase the gap between us and 
the U.S. which will cause a huge imbalance.  Some people would 
say so what it is just one country.  The fact of the matter 
remains that our nation does 86% of our trade with one country, 
the U.S.  So it matters a whole lot what Mr. Bush does.  In many 
ways it will determine how we adapt to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation, we should be getting together to streamline the 
complex morass of rules and regulations that choke off the 
ability of the private sector to maximize its ability.  In my 
province of British Columbia repeated business summits have said 
that rules and regulations are one of the top three reasons why 
companies cannot maximize their potential.  To put it into 
concrete terms, it means that those companies cannot hire people. 
They cannot make money.  If they made money, they could hire, 
train and employ people.  They could give people a better future 
than they would have on government assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk briefly about the notion of how we can deal 
with education.  I know there has been some mention of it.  It 
goes to the heart of enabling people in underdeveloped areas of 
our country to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, let us look at Ireland.  A few years ago Ireland 
was in a bit of an economic backwater.  It eventually said that 
it was not going to put up with it anymore.  It said it was going 
to maximize its potential as a small nation.  What did it do? 
It lowered taxes, eliminated useless rules and regulations and 
made an effective investment in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been pulling money away from the provinces 
for education for a long time.  We know we are getting into a 
crisis situation.  Not only is there a gap between people who are 
graduating from high school, and not enough graduating from high 
school who are literate, there is also a number of students who 
are graduating from university without necessarily getting 
some of the skills to be competitive in our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous hon. member alluded to a program which I think is 
very effective.  I will cite an example of where it works very 
well.  Germany has taken a very profound long range look at 
linking businesses with the educational community.  Students will 
have real time opportunities to learn skills in school, be it 
trades or others, and get real time experience in those areas. 
By linking up the private sector and the educational sectors, 
students will have an opportunity to not only develop real time 
work experience but also have real skills that they can take into 
the employment sector when they graduate.  This works very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a lack of infrastructure in schools and trained 
people to teach our students.  With the aging population in our 
universities, we know there will be an enormous gap in professors 
who can train the youth of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made proposals about EI.  One is to give enough money to 
businesses so they can to train their employees.  Businesses have 
repeatedly said that it will be up to business in the future to 
train and retrain their workforce.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not always up to the government.  If we do that, people in 
the workforce today and tomorrow will be able to continually keep 
their skills upgraded and be competitive in the ever changing 
global economy I mentioned at the beginning of my speech.  They 
can only do that if employers have the money in their pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should also be a review of barriers to trade.  It is 
extraordinary that in this day and age, in the 21st century, we 
have more barriers to trade east-west than north-south.  How 
could that possibly be so?  It speaks to a complete lack of 
action of the government since it was elected to deal with one of 
the major problems for trade and commerce, interprovincial trade 
barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should immediately strike a task force with 
business to see how it can eliminate those barriers to trade. The 
provinces must be brought into that and the government must work 
together with them.  If it does that, it will eliminate one of 
the most profound and useless impediments by ensuring our 
employers have the tools to be the best they can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area we can talk about is ensuring that the government 
of the day works with the provinces to deal with not only land 
use issues but labour and employment policy.  We have to take a 
long hard look at the employment and labour rules under 
provincial jurisdiction to ensure that they are not barriers to 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member spoke about the unfair situation where 
individuals trained in certain skills could not take their skills 
across the country.  That is a major impediment to individuals 
and is a barrier to the movement of manpower across our nation. 
It is another impediment to the nation maximizing its abilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, for years our party proposed solutions to ensure 
that we were able to strike a balance in the employment insurance 
plan.  That balance not only protects workers against 
unemployment through no fault of their own, but it ensures that 
employers can have the tools and the money to train workers and 
be competitive internationally and nationally.  If we do not do 
this, employers will only be catering to the lowest common 
denominator and to a level of mediocrity.  That would be a shame. 
There is much more that we can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would like to advise the hon. member for

admit that the program is flawed and to fix it.

Mr. Speaker, I have great concerns when I hear the Deputy Prime 
Minister say there is no threat.  I do not know what he has been 
listening to, but if it has been the U.S. Senate, this was one of 
the number one issues at the confirmation hearings of Robert 
Zoellick.  I do not know where he has been.  He says that Canada 
is speaking with one voice.  If he had read the papers last 
week, I do not know how many different voices there were but 
they were coming from his cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important issue to every single Canadian. 
Thousands and thousands of jobs are at stake.  The industry wants 
to know the Government of Canada's position.  Canadians want to 
have some confidence but they are getting mixed messages from the 
industry minister and the international trade minister.  What is 
their position?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

that the Government of Canada believes that Canadian lumber exporters 
produce a quality product, that we pay fair stumpage and that we 
should have free and clear access to the U.S. markets.  That is 
in fact what I said all week, what the Minister of International 
Trade has said and, I am sure, what the Prime Minister will be 
saying in his discussions with the U.S. president. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We happen to believe in this industry.  We will work hard for

Shawinigan, after it was named “the most eligible community in

things to all people and wound up a hopelessly complicated 
failure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, our youth justice legislation 
is based on three fundamental values of paramount importance to 
Canadians.  Those values are:  first, that one prevents crime 
before it happens; we do not need more victims; second, that when 
crime happens there are meaningful consequences for those who 
hurt others; and, third, a strong commitment to rehabilitation 
and reintegration of young offenders back into the society and 
communities from which they came.

issue of GM foods and a study released today by the Royal Society 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister will reread the report because it is a 
scathing condemnation of the practices of the government on the 
question of food safety.  The report says that Canadians do not 
know if genetically modified foods are safe because the process 
of approvals by the government is so flawed and problematic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the concerns identified, will the minister at least do 
what we in the House and Canadians have been asking for many

society to undertake this work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have the safest food system in the world.  We want to 
keep it that way and we want to make it even better.  I am happy 
to see that the royal society raised no question about the safety 
of GM foods already on the market.  I am happy to see that it has 
added to many of the recommendations made in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be looking carefully at the recommendations.  We have 
set aside $90 million to strengthen the regulatory system.  We

says that the government approval process seriously compromises 
the confidence society can have in knowing whether or not 
genetically modified foods are safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Health do a couple of things that Canadians 
want and deserve?  Will he put in place a process of mandatory 
labelling of genetically modified foods, and will he put a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I hope the hon. member and her colleagues want the government to

from Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys.  It would lower the 
voting age to 16.  I think Canadians were greatly surprised that 
our voter turnout in the last federal election was at probably an 
all time low.  We have a very apathetic group of Canadians with 
regard to the electoral system.  People just do not have faith in 
the democratic system any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an opportunity for young people who are still in school 
and still learning about our electoral and parliamentary systems 
throughout the country to be active participants in the electoral 
system.  We often hear colleagues suggesting that 16 year olds, 
even 10 year olds sometimes, should be treated as adults through 
the adult court system. Certainly if anyone can suggest that 
young people be treated as adults through the adult court system, 
then young people should be given the opportunity to vote in 
federal elections.  This is the time for it and Canada needs to 
address the issue.

the threats posed to universal public health care by Alberta's

ensure that companies and employees have the skills to be 
competitive in a global environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a very complex and changing world, one which is more 
globalized and more interconnected.  What happens half a world 
away impacts upon our employers and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a changing demographic in our society that no one 
is talking about.  The population over the age of 65 is set to 
double in the next 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we ever hear from members on the other side of the House what 
they will do about that?  Do they ever talk about what will 
happen to old age security, guaranteed income supplements, GIS? 
Do we ever hear about what that will do to CPP?  Do we ever hear 
about what that will do to the changing age of our working 
population? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, we do not.  It is absolutely imperative, however, that we 
implement changes today so that our workforce will be able to 
provide for the social programs we have come to enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our demographic changes as more and more people retire, our 
tax base will shrink unless we make effective changes in all the 
areas I have mentioned.  Only then can we become competitive and 
have money through our tax base for a good health care system, 
for OAS and GIS plans and a CPP that works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those things must be dealt with proactively, not reactively. 
That is why many organizations do not support this bill.  Ones we 
might have expected to support it, such as the Canadian Labour 
Congress, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and 
others, do not.  The Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices 
Association does not support the bill.  Organizations in the 
maritimes, many of which rely on seasonal employment, do not 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  It is because the bill does very little to address the 
concerns of people.  It also does little for places that are 
underdeveloped and could have more, such as the maritimes or 
indeed my province of B.C. which has had the lowest growth of any 
province during most of the last seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have taken a cold, hard, pragmatic look at 
the EI plan, grounded it in true insurance principles and 
decreased the amount of money paid out of the pockets of 
employers and employees.  It also must work with the provinces to 
reduce the rules and regulations that choke off the private 
sector. It needs to work with the provinces so we can have a good 
education system that invests in people and lets the private 
sector invest in its employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to look at reducing other taxes because they are 
hamstringing the ability of private sector employers to be 
competitive, to hire people and to provide the most important 
social program of all, a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon the government to listen well and act 
responsibly.  If it does that and listens to members from across 
party lines, we can build a true and effective EI program on true 
insurance principles that can be sustained into the future.

draws attention to a very important issue.  There is not a single 
member of the House who does not want to see every Canadian fully 
employed.  There is not a single member of the House who does not 
want to see the future of the country be the best it can become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Nova Scotia who asked the question wants exactly 
the same as we in this party want. We have spoken at length about 
what we want: a future in the maritimes that is better than what 
it has been over the last 10 to 20 years.  We do not want in any 
way, shape or form the same level of mediocrity the government 
has offered to the people of the east coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have drawn attention to the example of Ireland.  We have said 
that the east coast can look at Ireland.  By reducing taxes, by 
eliminating egregious rules and regulations, and by working with 
the federal government to reduce interprovincial trade barriers 
the east coast could become an economic tiger in Canada.  There 
is no reason it cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many areas and economic niches that the east coast can 
maximize.  Furthermore, it can maximize north-south trade.  I 
know the member has worked hard in this area and knows that there 
is an enormous market companies on the east coast can maximize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we accept that people on the east coast want seasonal 
work?  They do not want seasonal work.  They want full time work 
and they want to make a lot of money.  They also want to take 
care of those people who cannot take care of themselves.  That is 
a Canadian sentiment.  That is what we stand for as Canadians and 
that is what we will strive for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Neigette-et-la-Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, except for today's question period, this is really the 
first opportunity I have had to rise in the House in this 37th 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to thank the constituents of 
Rimouski—Neigette-et-la-Mitis for their tremendous support during 
the last federal election. I am proud of the confidence they 
have shown me and I can assure them that I will continue to make 
their interests my first and foremost priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To you, Mr. Speaker, I also want to extend my congratulations on 
your election as Speaker of the House. I was very impressed by 
all the comments I have read about you in the papers. Best of 
luck in your new duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now turn to today's debate. Last Friday, February 2, the 
government introduced Bill C-2, an act to amend the Employment 
Insurance Act and the Employment Insurance (Fishing) 
Regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who have followed the recent election campaign of 
the Liberals, mainly in the maritimes, the lower St. Lawrence, 
the Gaspésie area, the North Shore and Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, 
expected the government to show a little more respect for the 
people and not to have so much amnesia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that had been the case, the government would have introduced 
a very different bill from the one now before the House. When I 
saw the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport, I told him “Now we 
will look for results. We have kept abreast of the promises you 
made”. He answered“ Do not worry, we will keep our promises”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are off to a really bad start.  The bill we have before us 
for study is, unfortunately, identical, but for a few commas 
here and there, to one introduced just before the House was 
prorogued, Bill C-44. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make some things perfectly clear concerning Bill 
C-44.  Just before the last general election was called, the 
Liberal government wanted to head off to the hustings with the 
advantage of Bill, C-44, which brought in a few changes to the 
conditions for eligibility for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It therefore sought the unanimous support of all House leaders 
in place at that time to help accelerate the process of getting 
Bill C-44 passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All opposition parties refused to give this consent to the 
leader of the government.  The Canadian Alliance had its reasons 
and the Bloc Quebecois had its own, as did all parties in 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were mainly opposed to the outright theft of the surplus in 
the employment insurance fund.  We had the support of Action 
Chômage and various lobby groups in the province of Quebec. They 
were not prepared to trade a few meagre improvements for the 
theft of billions from the fund's surplus.  We therefore opposed 
rapid passage of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government says that the Bloc Quebecois voted against 
the bill, it is engaging in misinformation, disinformation and 
even demagoguery, since a vote on this bill was never held in 
the House. It is true that the Bloc Quebecois refused to be an 
accomplice to the theft of the employment insurance fund, 
because we learned at a very early age that he who holds the 
loot bag is just as guilty as the one who fills it. So, we 
refused to be the accomplices of this government by agreeing to 
quickly pass this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then came the general election. What happened? Every day, there 
were all kinds of polls. Among other things, we heard that the 
Progressive Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party 
would disappear, that they would fall into oblivion, that they 
might manage to save a few seats, but that they would no longer 
be official parties in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard an increasing number of experts, analysts, 
parliamentary correspondents, journalists and professors of 
political science say that we seemed headed for a minority 
Liberal government, something which became a source of concern 
for the Liberal Party's top strategists. These people said to 
themselves “We need a good cause. We should make a good sales 
pitch so that Canadians will like our party and give us a 
majority government. Then we can do whatever we want”. It was to 
be promises during the campaigns and then arrogance, contempt 
and, above all, no recollection of the commitments made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to make sure the Prime Minister would get the Guinness 
record he wanted so badly, that is to get a third straight 
majority mandate, top Liberal strategists said “What would be 
good for the Liberals would be to make people from the maritimes 
and Quebec believe that if they elect us we will change the 
employment insurance program”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several ministers got down to work and travelled throughout 
Quebec and the maritimes, especially in the regions most 
affected by unemployment, and promised that the employment 
insurance plan would be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing how easily people let themselves be fooled once 
again. The government has broken its electoral commitments. The 
new Bill C-2 is the exact copy of Bill C-44, introduced before the 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done exactly what it did when it promised to 
scrap the GST, to use the Prime Minister's words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should examine what some members of the government said. It 
is a very revealing exercise. 
On January 17, 2001, <I>La Presse</I> reported comments by the 
Secretary of State for Amateur Sport, who never misses an 
opportunity to make promises concerning the employment insurance 
system. Unfortunately, he is not as good at it as when he makes 
promises about sports. He has a better command of his own 
portfolio than that of the human resources minister, who does 
not seem to understand the commitments he has made on her 
behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what <I>La Presse</I> wrote on January 17 “ If well reasoned and 
justified arguments are brought forward, we are open to change”. 
He further clarified “The public works minister and myself are 
open to this kind of dialogue. We are open to discussions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some openness. The government's mind is completely closed. 
We are caught in the same situation we were in with Bill C-44. 
The dilemma is absolutely unbearable: we are penalized if we 
vote for it and penalized if we vote against it. The government 
puts us in a very uncomfortable position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretary of State for Amateur Sport said that if we had 
good and justifiable arguments, his government would be open to 
change. We have been here since 1994. We were elected in 1993 
and began sitting in parliament in 1994. What have we been doing 
since 1994? Day after day, all the critics for the Bloc on that 
very important issue, be it the hon. member for Mercier or the 
hon. member for Kamouraska—Témiscouata—Rivière-du-Loup—Les Basques, 
asked questions about the issue first to Mr. Axworthy, then to 
Douglas Young and to the current Minister of International 
Trade. 
As for the present minister, we confronted her day after day, 
but to question her about a scandal so outrageous that we did 
not have time to ask questions about the employment insurance 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we did question her three predecessors about their 
employment insurance reforms. We reminded them of the position 
they had taken when they were in the opposition and were opposed 
to the changes proposed by Mr. Valcourt but that was like 
talking to a wall. They all had the same answer, always the same 
answer: “The hon. member did not read the documentation. He or 
she does not understand and will not understand anything about 
the reform”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we were told day after day. All those ministers 
showed how they betrayed Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have never been able to explain the real idea behind the 
reform. The government wanted to get more money into its coffers 
because it needed billions of dollars to pay for its scandals, 
for its expenses and to grease its friends' palms; that is why 
it had to reform the EI on the backs of workers and employers, 
that is on the backs of those contributing to the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and again at committee stage, we put forward justified and 
justifiable arguments showing the need to change that plan which 
is against the young and discriminates against them. 
It is so discriminatory to young people that I cannot see how it 
could be constitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I heard the member opposite—I do not remember the name 
of his riding, but it is close to Nunavut or Abitibi—say that 
young people do not leave our regions because they do not have 
jobs. Of course, they do. Over the past five years, in my 
region, we have seen 700 young people aged between 15 and 29 
leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what it means when young people aged between 15 to 
29 leave? It means that the population is declining, that we no 
longer have the resources we need to develop, that the 
government could not care less what happens to the regions. Yet, 
it is prepared to spend millions of dollars to get elected, as 
we have seen in the Gaspé, while letting people wallow in 
unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are asked to work 910 hours.  It is impossible for a young 
person to work 910 hours.  They really have to leave the region 
and go to a large centre to find other jobs in order to manage, 
and to work the famous 910 hours.  Then, they never come back to 
the region, or almost never. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself heard the Prime Minister, the member for Saint-Maurice, 
make his promise during the campaign.  He had forgotten, and his 
organizers made him get back up on the stage.  I saw him with my 
own eyes and heard him with my own ears say “Oh yes, that is 
true.  I had forgotten to promise that we will rework the plan”. 
What did he say?  He said that they would, in February, give 
money to the unemployed retroactively.  “Housing costs are not 
paid retroactively”, commented my leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister, who knows what really goes on in his 
government, say that there will be retroactive measures?  We 
tried for retroactive measures for those who lost their job 
between July 17 and September, so they would be included in the 
same plan as the temporary measures proposed by the government. 
The government refused to allow a retroactive arrangement for 
these people.  However, they will have to face the gap, as my 
colleague from Acadie—Bathurst said.  The spring gap is coming. 
The Prime Minister will not notice, any more than will the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport saying during 
the election campaign?  He said “Once a Liberal majority is 
elected”—ah, now the cat is out of the bag.  They wanted a 
Liberal majority so they could continue being arrogant with 
people—“we will reinstate the process and make sure that the 
changes are effective and meet the needs, for the most part, of 
the people of the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and Canadians as a whole. 
I have made a commitment to change the law and we will see to 
it”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretary of State for Amateur Sport, who is also a boxer, 
has become a featherweight in this government since he has been 
unable to include one single amendment in this bill. Not one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we may soon be gagged both in the House and in 
committee because the government will find that too many people 
are complaining about its arrogance. It makes no sense at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister added “We realized that it was not a good 
decision, and that we should not have done it”. That is what he 
admitted, in the Canadian Press, on November 4, 2000, in the 
middle of the election campaign, on the subject of the cuts to 
the employment insurance plan his government had imposed. He 
recognized that it made no sense but now that he is back in 
power with a majority government, it suddenly makes sense to him 
to keep on being arrogant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could keep on quoting clips collected during the electoral 
campaign, but it would remind Canadian and Quebec people too many 
bad memories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure they bitterly regret now what they did on 
November 27, because in other cases they did the right thing. 
In my riding, 60% of the people supported me when I told them I 
would come to Ottawa with a strong voice to represent them and to 
defend their interests about unemployment insurance and the Young 
Offenders Act. The government is up to its old tricks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for parental leave, the government has no idea of what makes 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, our critic on this issue, explained very well this 
morning that we will unfortunately be faced with having to vote 
against the bill, not because we are against tiny improvements, 
at least they are improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some improvements. There is the elimination of the 
intensity rule, the elimination of discrimination concerning the 
rule of tax clawback for frequent users, the change in the 
definition of new entrants or re-entrants to the labour force for 
special benefits, which applies mainly to pregnant women, the 
indexing of yearly insurable earnings and the reduction of the 
premium rate to $2.25, which is not enough but is still better 
than nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is terrible is the stealing of the fund. Never 
would I have thought that the Liberal government would do such 
despicable things. Once again, it has fooled the people on all 
counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada made some progress when minority governments were in 
office. It is very sad that there is not one this time. Imagine 
how different the bill would have been if the leader of the 
government had to deal with the four opposition parties to 
give us a bill that fulfilled the Liberal Party's promises. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, during question period 
today there were questions raised regarding the new employment 
insurance bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our colleagues, our critic on this issue, the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, asked the 
Minister of Human Resources Development why she felt justified in 
reintroducing the same bill that was proposed before the general 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said that the percentage of support that her party received 
in the general election gave her the legitimacy to go ahead with 
her contested bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague who defended this issue 
remarkably in her speech to explain her understanding of the 
situation. Did the people who voted in the last election really 
say to the minister to go ahead with Bill C-44, a bill which 
excludes four persons out of ten, which requires people to work 
more without qualifying for employment insurance and which gives 
back to the men and women who lost their jobs only 8% of the $6 
billion paid every year into the employment insurance account? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we can explain the results of the election in a 
more refined and accurate way, instead of interpreting it as 
support for the bill reintroduced by the minister, Bill-C-44, 
which will be discussed in committee. I would remind members that 
we will invite people to appear before the committee to voice 
their opposition to the minister and to tell her that the bill 
is not generous enough. I would like my colleague to give us her 
interpretation of the last election results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Quebec City for her question.  I would just like to make one 
small correction:  the number who do not qualify is six out of 
ten, not four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, according to official OECD figures, 30% 
of Canadians are illiterate.  We think this refers to adults. 
They are considered illiterate because they are unable to read 
the dosage on a bottle of aspirin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great sadness that I note there seems to be a 
heavy concentration of these illiterate adults among the members 
on the other side and among their handlers because they are 
incapable of understanding what is going on.  One of the reasons 
they gave for introducing reform was that the system was costing 
too much and they needed more money.  They solved that rather 
well. Their second goal was to adapt to the economic reality 
facing the country.  In my view, they are incapable of 
understanding that reality and no one is able to explain it to 
them. Concerning the minister's interpretation, in my riding I 
told people to vote for me and we would block Bill C-44.  Sixty 
per cent of them gave me their vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques said the same thing.  He won 60% of the vote.  The fact 
is that wherever there are unemployed workers, in the riding of 
Acadie—Bathurst, for instance, people were more inclined to 
trust the member who was there than the Liberal candidate who ran. 
In certain other ridings, one would have to look at how the 
campaigns were run and what the member did before and after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the campaign we learned about a few little things that 
had gone on. In addition, in the case of the minister, there were 
some little scandals in Nova Scotia.  We learned about it during 
the campaign.  We did not know about it beforehand.  I myself 
heard people say “We could perhaps vote for the Liberals.  They 
are the ones who have the money and give it to their friends”. 
These are not very good reasons to vote for a party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has it all wrong.  During the election campaign, 
when the Liberals talked about employment insurance, they told 
people to elect them and they would make changes.  Our response 
was to ask people to elect us and we would do the same. 
Since those for whom the public voted, whether Liberals or Bloc 
Quebecois, promised change, this change must come about or some 
of us will be liars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The member knows full well she cannot use that 
word in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques,

by my colleague who happens to represent the riding next to 
mine. We live in an area where there are a lot of seasonal 
workers, where people working in the forestry industry are 
experiencing hardship due to a slump in the U.S. market, and 
also as a result of the softwood lumber deal, which does not 
permit free trade and has killed a lot of jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For years we have been saying that the intensity rule is a 
punitive measure that had nothing to do with the reality of the 
labour market. It took three years for the government to finally 
admit it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not eventually going to come to the same conclusion 
regarding the eligibility of women and young workers? Between 
1993 and 1999, the percentage of women receiving regular 
benefits dropped from 63% to 38%. For young people aged 20 to 
24, it dropped from 70% to 24%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that we went from a plan that used to insure a 
majority of people to a plan that no longer insures women and 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government not going to reach the same conclusion as it 
did regarding the intensity rule, namely that after having 
harmed people for several years it will come to the conclusion 
that this rule, aimed at tightening up eligibility, was only 
punitive and in no way aimed at putting people back to work and 
that we are faced with the same situation as with the intensity 
rule? Would it not be better for the government to act right 
away and put something in the bill that would make it easier for 
people to qualify? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an excellent question. 
It goes without saying that the government, if it were truly 
aware of the facts, would ask itself right away why it should 
wait to make changes at a later date when they are needed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this afternoon, the human resources development 
minister—and the international trade minister said the same thing over 
and over again when he was the human resources development 
minister before her—said that the government's measures would 
help young people. On the contrary, they are hurting them. When 
will they understand? It is easy to understand. One does not 
have to be a rocket scientist to understand such a thing. It is 
very easy to understand. The measures are hurting young people 
and the women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some women in my riding have to work 600 hours while the guy 
next door has to work only 425 hours, do you think that is just? 
They have to do it if they want maternity leave. It is indecent 
for the government to be so dense. It does not make sense that 
the government does not realize right away that it should make 
the changes right now, just as it has promised.

Speaker, I join my colleagues in congratulating you on your 
election as Speaker.  We look forward to working with you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this is my first speech of the 37th parliament I take this 
opportunity to thank the constituents of Calgary East who, with a 
resounding victory, sent me back to represent them in the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also congratulate all members who have returned and those 
newly elected members who have received their own votes of 
confidence from their constituents and are here to represent 
them.  I want to go on record as stating that I strongly believe 
in Canada like most of us who have been elected in the 37th 
parliament.  Canada is a land of opportunity.  Canada has been 
built over the years by creating bridges.  These bridges are very 
important to our regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saddened today when my colleague from the NDP started 
accusing us and asking for an apology for someone else's 
comments.  This kind of rhetoric creates division among regions 
and creates a problem in our vast country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the Liberal government that there is western 
alienation.  It should not think for a moment that it does not 
exist.  It exists because the government has not built bridges 
over the years.  It has taken the west to be its backyard and 
western Canadians are saying that can no longer be the situation. 
They want to be equal partners in Confederation.  They are asking 
for change.  If the government keeps ignoring them it may have 
some serious repercussions for the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are debating Bill C-2, the Employment Insurance Act. 
The Employment Insurance Act is one of our social safety nets and 
one that we have talked about a lot.  Over the years it has 
assisted many Canadians during a time when they may have had a 
temporary break in their working career, which is an 
understandable thing and the reason the legislation was created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as time has passed something has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before being elected to parliament, I was a small businessman. 
In 1985 and for the past 15 years I had my own business.  With my 
accounting experience, I saw this one graph line that kept going 
up and up.  This graph line represented the government's 
increases in payroll taxes and EI, and its introduction of 
service charges.  These things created a heavy burden on Canadian 
businesses that had a hard time meeting their payroll 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New immigrants, especially from open markets like Hong Kong, who 
came to Canada to set up businesses, looked at the taxes and said 
that they could not survive.  They packed up and left.  These 
were warning signs that were ignored by subsequent governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Liberal government curtailed benefits to the EI 
program but at the same time leaving high premiums.  The result 
was a huge surplus in the EI fund.  This provided the government 
with the opportunity to reduce payroll taxes and EI premiums for 
both the employer and the employee.  This would have provided 
businesses with more opportunities to reinvest and create more 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc member spoke about the softwood lumber issue having an 
impact on his riding and creating unemployment. I would like to 
tell him that softwood lumber is not part of the free trade 
agreement.   It is tied to tariffs.  It is where the market is 
curtailed and Canadian companies cannot take advantage of that 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As borders open up there is a need for Canadian businesses and 
companies to stand up and compete with everybody from around the 
world.  As we open up free trade agreements and our borders, 
competition increases.  We have to compete with business people 
from other parts of the world selling the same product.  How are 
we going to compete? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that 43% of Canada's GDP is tied to international 
trade. This shows how important international trade is to Canada. 
One out of three jobs is tied to international trade.  Have we 
realized what has happened?  We are now in competition with 
everybody who is trying to sell the same product.  Whoever is 
more competitive and selling their product cheaper will take the 
market.  There is no more loyalty.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every corporate business person knows that loyalty does not 
exist any more.  Even I as a businessman knew that.  People are 
now looking for value for their money.  The same applies to 
businesses and corporations.  Therefore we have to say that we 
have products at good market value, that there is good value for 
what we are charging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have travelled with Canadian business people around the world 
where they sell products in competition with others.  The same 
happens.  Companies from every part of the world are bidding 
along with Canadian companies.  However, when foreign companies 
come back they have to work under the conditions that exist in 
our country.  Those conditions include high payroll taxes and 
high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a short example from Alberta.  As members of 
parliament we have constituents coming to our office.  My cases 
were concerned with EI because it is a federal responsibility. 
People who did not qualify or who had problems sought the 
assistance of their members of parliament.  However, I have 
noticed that the number of constituents looking for assistance 
with EI problems has diminished dramatically.  Why?  It is 
because today in Alberta they can find jobs.  They are no longer 
unemployed and fewer people are losing their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is there a market for jobs in Alberta?  Before the Klein 
government was elected, the previous government followed policies 
similar to those of the present federal government: high 
taxation, spending government money, pouring money into the 
economy, artificially propping up the economy, and saying it will 
to work.  It did not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the Klein government came in and said that this was not the 
way it would be.  It was simple mathematics:  it had to reduce 
taxes and reduce the debt.  It went on a cutting spree. There 
were protests by the people affected but the Klein government 
carried on.  It has reduced government expenditures and directed 
money toward the debt and toward creating an atmosphere of sound 
economic principles where businesses could compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people will say that Alberta is rich because of the high 
price of oil and the high price of natural gas.  Let me tell the 
House what just happened recently.  Alberta has put its house in 
order by laying a sound financial foundation.  That is the reason 
Alberta today is reaping the benefits.  We could contrast that to 
British Columbia where the situation is similar.  That is the 
problem, simple and straightforward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the government of Alberta can reduce taxes and can invest 
in health care.  It is investing in more equipment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was invited by the government of Alberta to attend a 
globalization conference which was held in Banff in October. 
There were CEOs from all across the nation, the key players in 
our economy. Message after message came through that we had to be 
competitive. If we are not, there will be clouds on the horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April this year, we are going to have a free trade of 
Americas conference in Quebec City. 
Now these people want to protest.  It is an old policy where 
they still want to go back to 30 years ago.  Anyway, they are 
welcome to protest.  They are already detached from the Canadian 
public, so it is okay they can protest.  It is no problem.  The 
fact of the matter is that the borders are going to open up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to say that globalization by itself unchecked is 
the best thing.  We have to make sure that everybody benefits 
from this opening up of the market and not create fortresses. 
Canadian businesses need to get into that place.  They need to be 
updated to grab the opportunities.  The way is not to keep 
taxing.  The way is not to keep a burdening us.  The way is not 
to reduce the competitiveness of a Canadian business.  It is as 
simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we need?  What did I hear from the business people? They 
need a lower tax regime so that they can reinvest, not make 
profit.  They need to be allowed to take advantage of emerging 
technologies.  They need a trained workforce.  They are willing 
to be partners in the training of that workforce but they need to 
have that room.  They then said they would be in a position to 
take advantage of the opening up of the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said this it in the House before.  The Minister for 
International Trade keeps going across the world signing free 
trade agreements.  If we are not going to take advantage of the 
free trade agreements for Canadian companies, what is the point 
of signing the agreements?  We can go on as many trade missions 
as we want.  Let us look at the result of Team Canada's trade 
mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is nice.  Business people are going there looking for 
opportunities.  When they come back, they find that they cannot 
take advantage of those opportunities because the economic regime 
allowing the competitiveness does not exist right now in Canada. 
The Minister of Industry, who is now the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, stated contrary to what his counterpart was stating.  He 
admitted to that.  He of course had to backtrack.  That was not 
the government line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never understand the transparency point.  The Canada 
Employment Insurance Commission looked at this thing.  It 
was independent but I do not know if it was really independent or 
whether it had patronage appointments or whatever.  Now that has 
been taken away.  Again the government controls it.  We have a 
massive overpayment in EI and the government does not want to do 
anything about it.  It does not want to clear the regime.  It has 
also taken the ability of somebody else to come along, an 
independent commission, and make sound recommendations.  The 
government wants to make the sound recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I will talk and try to improve on the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude, I want to make this point very clear.  Before 
the free trade of the Americas meeting in Quebec City, our trade 
minister is going to the USA.  The appointment of a new U.S. 
trade representative opened up an opportunity for us to become a 
world player and sell our products.  We will fail to take 
advantage of all this if we do not create sound economic 
principles.

makes a division in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the leader of the Canadian Alliance was in the west during 
the election he said that if he was elected he would cut employment 
insurance.  When he came to the east to support one of the 
candidates, Jean Gauvin, he said that he would save employment 
insurance.  I wonder why he had two different messages.  Is that 
the way to bring people together? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we have today is that we do not understand each 
other.  I am very proud that Calgary is doing well.  The problem 
is like being a millionaire.  When one becomes a millionaire, one 
becomes selfish.  When a province starts to do well I do not want 
it to become selfish and not do anything for its neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to be part of the country and be united, we must 
look after each other.  The fish plant workers did not choose 
that there would be no more codfish in the Atlantic Ocean. How do 
we expect them to be able to go from one season to the next?  Are 
we saying it is over?  Are we saying it is over to the 
woodcutter?  Are we saying it is over to all the people of the 
Atlantic provinces?

building bridges.  While we understand there are seasonal workers 
in the Atlantic provinces, I do not understand my friend saying 
that when we talk about employment insurance, it has something to 
do with Atlantic Canada.  It has to do with all of Canada.  The 
employment insurance program is for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says Albertans are selfish.  When his colleagues single out 
one region, they forget the fact that Albertans believe in, 
support and have been paying equalization payments.  The last 
report indicated Alberta was paying more than it was getting. 
Does it bother Albertans.  No, it does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are making sure that every Canadian from region to region can

with great interest.  I especially noted what he said about the 
Employment Insurance Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current legislation provides that the Employment Insurance

misappropriation of the funds contributed by employers and

several years? In fact, the surplus has reached more than 
$30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would this measure not make legal such misappropriation of

colleague for an excellent question.  I wish the NDP could 
think that deep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is absolutely right.  That is the problem with the 
legislation.  He said that it was a form of legalized tax grab.  That 
is one of the reasons why we have difficulty with this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to have an opportunity to join the debate on Bill C-2, 
especially following the eloquent remarks from the previous 
speaker.  Building from that, I will try to demonstrate that 
some NDP members are in fact deep thinkers and I will share some 
of those deep thoughts with the him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are discussing Bill C-2, which really seeks to fix what I 
believe is an irreparably broken program.  I believe we should 
start from the basic premise that the EI system is busted. It is 
broken.  The wheels have fallen off it.  It does not work any 
more.  It ceased to fill its mandate long ago.  Let us be clear 
that its mandate was to provide income maintenance to unemployed 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a program where less than 40% of unemployed people 
can hope to get any benefits whatsoever from the program.  What 
kind of an insurance system is that?  What if people had house 
insurance policies that they were forced to pay into because they 
had no choice.  However, when their houses burned down there was 
less than a 40% chance of collecting any benefit whatsoever. 
They would think they had been robbed.  They would think they had 
been fleeced by some clever insurance salesman.  That is the only 
conclusion they could really come to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the situation Canadian workers are facing today. 
Believe it or not but the figures are even worse for women. 
There is a gender issue here.  Unemployed women have a less than 
25% chance of collecting any benefit.  It is even worse for 
youth.  An unemployed youth under 25 years old has a less than 
15% chance of collecting any benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as though the fund is unable to pay those benefits 
out.  The fund is operating at a surplus.  There is $500 million 
a month, not per year, being paid into the program. That is more 
than is being paid out.  The dollar figures are the fund paid out 
$7 billion worth of benefits last year to unemployed workers and 
has a surplus of $7.8 billion.  Less than 50% of the revenue 
generated by contributions from employers and employees goes to 
its intended purpose, which is income maintenance and training 
for unemployed workers.  Over 50% goes into the general revenue 
for the government to do whatever it wants to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are pretty poor odds.  A person gets better odds than that 
from a VLT machine in Las Vegas.  They pay out 94% and they are a 
rip-off.  Frankly, we are being really ripped off when we pay out 
less than 50% of what we are putting in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us keep in mind another important fact.  The government 
ceased to pay anything into the UIC fund in the late 1980s.  It 
used to be kind of one-third, one-third, one-third.  The 
government stopped paying in at all.  It is now solely made up of 
contributions from the employer and the employee.  For every 
dollar the employee contributes, the employer contributes $1.40. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What gives the federal government the right to use the surplus 
money at all?  It is not its money.  The member for Mississauga 
West argued that because the government is responsible for any 
shortfall, when that happens, when there is a surplus it is the 
government's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we added up the total accumulated aggregate deficit that 
the fund had ever gone into, it was something like $11.4 billion. 
Over the course of many years, and during those years when there 
was not enough money in the fund to pay for all the unemployed 
people, we did go into the red.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a surplus of $32 billion and it is growing.  By the 
government's own logic, it should take back the $11.2 billion and 
put the rest back into benefits, into income maintenance for 
unemployed workers as it was intended.  In that case that would 
be fair and I do not think there would not be any protests from 
the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take that $32 surplus, pay back all the money that we 
were credited with by the government during those periods of high 
unemployment and use the rest for income maintenance for 
unemployed people.  What could be more fair than that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 tinkers with a broken system instead of taking active 
steps to repair it.  It tinkers with the intensity rule, the 
least of our problems.  It tinkers with the clawback provisions, 
again a minor detail.  The real problem unemployed workers have 
is the divisor rule.  The method by which benefits were 
calculated changed dramatically in 1996 and left people, if they 
were lucky enough to be eligible at all, with collecting less 
money per week for a shorter period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The divisor rule is so fundamentally wrong because eligibility 
is calculated based on the hours worked in the previous 52 weeks 
or one year prior to becoming unemployed.  In other words, if a 
workers get enough hours to qualify in that 52 week period, they 
will get a claim.  However the benefit is calculated on the 26 
weeks immediately prior to their filing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the carpentry industry some of those might be dead weeks. 
Maybe there was no work at all for many of those weeks.  It used 
to be that the benefit would be calculated by the previous weeks 
that one had worked.  Obviously the average benefit will be 
dragged down if in that 26 week period only 13 weeks were worked 
and the other half were not worked at all.  Right away, after 
making an average of that, it is 50% lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have unemployed trades people and unemployed seasonal workers 
filing their claims.  They used to receive maybe $400 a week in 
benefits because of the way it was calculated.  With the new 
divisor rule, it is not unusual to see those same people coming 
in with paystubs for $128, $213 or $34.  We had one actual 
illustrated example of a seasonal worker in New Brunswick who 
used to be able to count on approximately $315 a week.  She now 
receives $38 a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder there is a surplus.  Hardly anybody qualifies and 
those who are lucky enough to win the lottery and qualify 
receive dramatically reduced benefits.  There is a basic 
unfairness. If the system were being maxed out or there were a 
shortage in the system, we would have to be more miserly in the 
distribution of the benefits, but with a surplus of $500 million 
every month it is obscene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often said that if we deduct something from a person's 
paycheque for a specific purpose and then use it for something 
completely different, in the very best case scenario that is a 
breach of trust.  We entered into a trust relationship with 
employees when we took money off their cheques and told them we 
would hold it for them until they needed it.  Then, on the very 
day they need it, we tell them we have changed our minds and we 
are spending that money on building roads, hospitals or for 
whatever else the government is using its consolidated revenue 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is beyond a breach of trust.  It is out and out fraudulent. 
People have reasonable expectations which were created when we 
told them that we were taking the money off their cheque for a 
specific reason, to give them income security if they become 
unemployed.  We created that trust relationship and I would say 
it is a legal relationship.  As the hon. member from the Bloc 
Quebecois very accurately pointed out, Bill C-2 seeks to 
institutionalize what is fundamentally wrong.  It seeks to 
legalize what I believe is a challengeable situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is wrong with Bill C-2 in a nutshell.  It could 
have dealt with eligibility.  It could have dealt with the real 
issue that less than 40% of Canadians qualify.  It could have 
lowered the bar so that more people were eligible because the 
impact in certain regions is horrific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard members talk about Atlantic Canada today.  Let me 
give one example from my riding of Winnipeg Centre.  It is the 
third poorest riding in the country by whatever measurement is 
used, whether incidence of poverty or average family income.  In 
the third poorest riding in the country the changes made to the 
EI program sucked $20.8 million a year out of my riding alone. 
That is just one little neighbourhood in the core area of 
Winnipeg. That is $20.8 million of payroll that would otherwise 
have been spent in the local economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine that a company wanted to move into my riding with 
a payroll of $20.8 million.  We would pave the streets with gold 
to attract that company.  It would get government grants and 
subsidies.  We would welcome it with open arms because it would 
generate a level of activity of $20.8 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had $20.8 million sucked out.  The reverse happened in 
my riding.  When we add what happened in St. John's, 
Newfoundland, the total impact is over $100 million a year.  The 
very poorest and most vulnerable people have been pushed over the 
line from a reasonable income maintenance benefit into poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens to those people?  They go on social assistance, so 
the burden is offloaded on to the provinces that are already 
maxed out.  The CHST is cut back, adding to the burden of the 
provinces, and their ability to provide income maintenance to 
poor people is reduced because of the reduction of EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were sincere about fixing the EI program it 
would have talked about eligibility in Bill C-2, but there is no 
mention of that.  The government does not seem to think there is 
anything wrong with it.  Why?  It is a cash cow.  It is a goose 
that lays golden eggs.  It just keeps squirting out these 
treasures every month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has paid down the deficit on the backs of unemployed workers, 
the most vulnerable people in the country. Even worse, it has not 
just paid down the deficit with that money.  Now it is giving tax 
cuts to the wealthy with that money. It is a sick and perverted 
form of Robin Hood, to rob from the poor to give to the rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member across says that is nonsense.  What would the member 
call a further reduction in capital gains tax?  What would the 
member call a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 17% to 
16%?  Where is the government getting that money to give away? It 
is getting a considerable amount of that money, $32 billion of 
it, from the EI fund, from unemployed workers who would otherwise 
receive benefits and now get zippo, zilch.  They are shut out of 
the system.  We are not pleased with Bill C-2.  We are kind of 
upset by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one point that is even more galling.  As a tradesman I 
served a four year apprenticeship.  It is a beautiful system 
because one is engaged with the workforce.  One can earn while 
one learns.  One has an attachment to the workforce while in 
school with the community college component of the 
apprenticeship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I went to community college for my apprenticeship training 
I received EI benefits.  It is one of the designated uses listed 
in the EI act.  It was a great system.  The EI system used to 
purchase block seats in community colleges.  It would buy a whole 
classroom of seats and provide income maintenance to the students 
while they were there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is a two week waiting period.  Now EI is treating the 
students as if they are unemployed.  When they leave the job site 
and go to the community college, with no interruption in their 
work they are not unemployed.  They still have bosses and they 
still have jobs.  They are just going through the school 
component of their apprenticeships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An insignificant amount of money is being gained.  It is a 
miserly thing to do.  The total impact of this for all 
apprentices is about $80 million a year when a surplus of $500 
million a month is being shown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House the predictable consequence and exactly 
what is happening.  Apprentices are not taking their schooling 
when it comes up.  They get their notices from the community 
college that it is their turn to go to school. Struggling 
apprentices with young families are faced with two weeks with no 
income whatsoever.  They are just passing on it and saying that 
they will not accept it this year, that they will try next year 
when their number comes up again, extending their apprenticeship 
and disadvantaging the industry that needs graduating journeymen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one example of the many hundreds of tiny things the 
government did to the program in 1996 which has caused this 
incredible windfall surplus.  There is no mention of that in Bill 
C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be moving that as an amendment and we would seek broad 
support from the other parties for the basic, fundamental issue 
of income maintenance for apprentices while they are in community 
college.  I hope we will get broad support for that.  I 
understand that even the Progressive Conservative Party sees the 
logic in that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a huge gender issue here too, which I think should be 
raised on behalf of the many women who are disadvantaged by the 
EI system.  I have already said that less than 25% of unemployed 
women are eligible for EI.  There is a reason for this.  Women 
are often more likely to be in part time jobs where they have 
difficulty getting the number of hours they need to qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a charter challenge.  I am proud to say that the 
community unemployed health centre located in my riding has 
managed to succeed to the next level of federal court with an 
argument that the current EI system structure affects women in a 
way that violates article 15 of the charter which states that 
everyone deserves equal access to all the benefits and the 
provisions of being a citizen of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It disproportionately affects women in a negative way far more 
than it affects men.  I believe the women of Canada and their 
advocates have a legitimate case to make.   Whether it was by 
design, by omission or by accident, there is a gender imbalance 
disadvantaging women more than men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the whole hour system is structured in a way that fewer 
people qualify.  I am not trying to hearken back to the old 
system as if it were perfect, but if people worked more than 15 
hours in one week in the old days they were given credit for one 
insurable week.  Granted the benefit would be lower because it 
would be a low income week, but at least they received credit for 
the week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now 920 hours are required to requalify into the program, with 
700 hours being required for an initial application.  Rather than 
14 to 20 weeks depending on where one lives, one now needs 700 to 
920 hours.  That is a lot more.  It is like six months of work. 
The eligibility bar has been raised.  A lot of people working 
part time will never get 920 hours.  UFCW workers who are store 
clerks at Sobey's or Canada Safeway are deliberately held down to 
15 hours a week.  They will never qualify.  They have to pay in 
but they never qualify.  This is absolutely unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of things in the EI bill are fundamentally wrong.  It 
is a revenue generator for the government.  It is not an 
insurance system.  It ceased to be an insurance system a long 
time ago when it failed to provide reasonable income maintenance 
for unemployed workers as per its original mandate.  At $500 
million a month the Liberals cannot afford to be fair.  If that 
is the case, maybe we should pack the system up because it is 
failing to meet the needs of unemployed workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the intensity rule and the clawback rule.  Both of 
these will be changed by Bill C-2.  They are positive steps.  We 
do not deny that these are two of the things that needed to be 
changed.  However they are insignificant.  The intensity rule 
meant an individual was punished for being a frequent user of the 
system.  If one collected this year one would lose 1% of the 
benefit the next year on a rolling scale up to a total of 5%.  If 
one collected five years in a row, one would be 5% lower than 
one's colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Labour Congress put together a series of proposals 
to improve the system and make it more accessible.  It is 
shooting for 70% and 60%.  Seventy per cent of all unemployed 
workers should qualify and they should be compensated at sixty 
per cent of their gross earnings.  This would be an employment 
insurance system that would actually provide insurance for 
unemployed people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is supposed to be unemployment insurance system. The 
government changed the name in a very cynical way in 1996 to try 
to take the focus away from what it was originally intended to 
do:  to provide income maintenance and training for unemployed 
people so they could re-enter the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a lot about labour market training in the Speech from 
the Throne.  Suddenly there is a renewed interest in a highly 
skilled workforce where key elements in building a highly skilled 
workforce are being taken away.  I am talking about job security, 
income maintenance when unemployed and good access to labour 
market training so individuals can get back into the workforce 
should they be unfortunate enough to become unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would members say of home insurance program if they had 
less than a 40% chance to collect?  What would we say of any kind 
of system that paid out less than 50% or what was put in?  The 
odds are better in a Las Vegas VLT where at least 94% is paid 
out.  Here $7 billion is paid out and $7.8 billion is put into 
surplus and then squandered by the Liberal government spending it 
on whatever it wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployed workers in this province have been fleeced.  They 
have been hosed since 1996 and they are fed up.  They are coming 
to us pleading for the government to understand what it means to 
be a seasonal worker, a construction worker or any Canadian who 
finds himself unemployed and needing income maintenance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 is as flawed as the employment insurance system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for his 
remarks.  I was particularly struck by the figure he cited with 
respect to what was lost in employment insurance payouts.  It was 
$20.8 million in his riding alone, which works out, if he has 
about 80,000 people in his riding, to $260 a person.  That is 
just what is lost as a result of the changes, so I would 
understand from him that there is a very major and systemic 
problem in his riding in Winnipeg.  I have great sympathy, and I 
can see where he comes from when he has a situation like that in 
an urban community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him one question that has always bothered 
me, both with respect to this legislation and the legislation as 
we originally changed it.  One of the things that it did not 
properly address and still does not properly address now is the 
fact that in Manitoba, I believe it was, people working with 
school boards in clerical jobs and that kind of thing would work 
for 10 months, quit, collect employment insurance or unemployment 
insurance, call it what you will, for two months, and then be 
re-hired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that always distressed me about the system as 
it existed before we changed it, and as it still exists, is that 
this seemed to me to be an abuse of the system, because it was a 
classic case where the employer was taking advantage of 
employment insurance to pay the workers less for 10 months rather 
than paying the workers fully for 12 months.  Could the member 
opposite comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not have a lot of personal 
information on the specific job the hon. member raised in his 
question.  I do know that some industries use the EI system in 
order to maintain a skilled workforce for when the work is there. 
If we value those industries we need to find a mechanism by which 
they will not all wander away and move to Alberta.  Frankly, we 
would not have any carpenters left in Manitoba if we did not have 
some way of giving them income maintenance for the period of time 
when there is no work.  Unless companies want to retrain a whole new 
workforce every time the economy picks up, they try to retain the 
employees they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize for the fact that I am not personally familiar with 
the issue raised by the member.  I would be happy to see if I 
could find more information and get back to him. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the presentation of the NDP member, and 
from his comments I can understand why the NDP lost seats during 
this election campaign.  His solution to the problem in 
employment insurance seems to be to pay out the surplus through 
larger payouts to unemployed people rather than to do 
what would create jobs, in fact, and what would lower premiums. 
It has been well documented that payroll taxes, including 
unemployment insurance premiums, are big job killers.  Rather 
than focusing on having business create new jobs by lowering the 
premiums, he has taken the approach that we have this huge 
surplus and we just have to spend it, we just have to get it into 
the hands of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course coming from the NDP that is not too surprising. Coming 
from this member, it is not surprising at all, because this is 
the same member who on Friday, in introducing his private 
member's bill, proposed setting up a price setting commission. He 
referred to any Albertans opposed to a new national energy 
program as being somehow consumed by corporate greed and 
suggested that Albertans are selfish if they do not support some 
type of new national energy program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not believe that this member would propose such a thing. 
Certainly if we want to alienate western Canada, Alberta in 
particular, that is how it is done.  The member has certainly 
done a good job of that.  I have had very few issues on which I 
have had as many calls from constituents as I did on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the member proposing this change which would in fact kill 
jobs rather than create jobs?  Would he not prefer to see people 
work rather than see higher payouts?  I would also like him to 
comment on his proposal for a new national energy program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the issue of how any surplus 
in the EI fund should be used is really pretty straightforward. 
The federal government pays nothing into the EI program.  It is 
all made up of contributions by employers and employees.  It is 
our money, and income maintenance, frankly, is what the 
designated use of the EI fund was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member says the NDP would squander it by giving that 
money to workers, let me say that first, it is their money, and 
second, the Liberals already squandered it by spending it on 
whatever they felt like.  They had no right to do that.  They had 
no right to use that money for anything other than what the act 
states, and that is for income maintenance and labour market 
training.  That is why we pay into the fund.  It was the 
expectation, and a reasonable expectation, on the part of workers 
that they would qualify for some kind of income maintenance 
should they become unemployed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
somewhat surprised by comments from the government in regard to 
suggesting that employers circumvent the system to misuse the EI 
fund.  Employers pay into the EI fund as well, and I actually 
have very good knowledge of the situation with regard to school 
districts that the previous member asked my colleague about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been a former school trustee, I know that most schools 
operate 10 months a year.  That is the nature of the beast.  They 
do not operate 12 months a year.  There are some school districts 
that operate for longer than 10 months, but for the most part 
throughout Canada school districts operate 10 months a year.  The 
bottom line is that it was not a matter of school districts 
trying to rip off the government or anything of the kind.  There 
were 10 months of employment.  The work was in place for 10 
months and then the employees were laid off and re-hired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the suggestion that they were being unscrupulous really 
disheartening, as was the suggestion that school districts did 
that throughout the country.  I suggest, quite frankly, that all 
those employees, who were making good salaries in a good many 
cases, paid their income tax and paid into the EI fund.  It is 
wrong to suggest that those employers were being unscrupulous by 
allowing those employees to access EI during the two months when 
there were no jobs available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  It is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  It is not wrong.  To suggest that 
they did it as an underhanded alternative is quite unacceptable. 
On the other hand, what we do have is a Liberal government that 
nitpicked parts of the system to get some money from it so that 
the government could have its cash cow instead of putting back 
into the system.  Maybe it should have offered additional 
training for those workers.  Maybe it should be encouraging year 
round schools so that we can meet the educational needs of all 
Canadians.  That is what we should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for Churchill is 
absolutely right.  She seems to 
know what she is talking about on this matter.  I concur 
wholeheartedly with her remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the remark of my Liberal colleague 
across the floor when he says he sympathizes with my colleague 
from Winnipeg Centre who said his riding is losing $28 million in 
employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, Acadie—Bathurst loses $69 million of benefits 
per year, which really hurts small and medium sized businesses. 
That is why I say the whole program is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague from Winnipeg Centre explain to us how 
the people are affected in the Manitoba regions and in the city 
of Winnipeg? It seems to me that people think it is only 
the Atlantic provinces that have a problem with employment 
insurance.  I have gone across the country many times and this is 
a national problem.  I would like to hear more about is happening 
in Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in actual fact the Canadian 
Labour Congress, in co-operation with the unemployed, help centres 
across the country, paid for a very detailed and comprehensive 
study for every riding in the country, for all 301 ridings, and 
measured the actual impact of the cuts to UIC.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That survey was mailed to every member of parliament.  All

impact was of the cuts to unemployment insurance per year in 
their ridings.  In some parts of the country, it is horrific.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
to start with, I would like to congratulate you on your 
appointment as Deputy Chairman of Committees of the Whole House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this is my first speech since parliament resumed, I would 
like to thank voters in the riding of Chutes-de-la-Chaudière who 
elected me for the third time and for the trust they showed in 
me. I can assure them that I will do my best to honour their 
trust. I especially thank those who voted for me. At the same 
time, as you know, Mr. Speaker, when we are elected, we must 
work for all our constituents, and this is what I pledge to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am mentioning the election because this bill amending the 
Employment Insurance Act was introduced in the weeks before the 
election was called and an election was indeed called. As much as 
the government tried to blame the Bloc Quebecois for preventing 
the passing of the bill, it should be pointed out that 
we never got to vote on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We opposed it but I want to remind members why we opposed a certain 
part of the bill. It was because it made official the plundering 
of the EI fund surplus by the government to reduce the deficit 
or just show a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no vote and I will point out that the same thing 
happened with the bill on shipbuilding that I introduced. I was 
in the same situation. 
The bill had passed all stages, including second reading and 
clause by clause study in committee. Then suddenly the Prime 
Minister decided to call an election three and a half years 
after the last one. 
Why? Because he wanted to take advantage of what was 
favourable to him and his party. A number of bills such as this 
one died on the order paper. This is the reason the bill 
had to be reintroduced now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the topic we are dealing with today but 
the context in which a bill is introduced must sometimes be 
recalled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to relate the bill to something that happened during the 
election. 
Many, at least in Quebec, deplored the fact that a lot of young 
people did not exercise their right to vote because they felt 
abandoned by the government in many ways, including with regard 
to employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think they are not totally wrong. I talked to some young 
people who did not vote. First, they had a problem with 
registration; they were not on the voters' list. Moreover, there 
was only one office in each riding where they could register. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This feeling was shared by many young people. They told me 
afterward that they felt ignored, that they felt like they were 
being treated differently and that they did not get the special 
attention they needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign I often heard the Liberals, 
including the Prime Minister, try to ridicule the leader of the 
Canadian Alliance for wanting a two tier health care system. That 
is rather bizarre because, since 1995, we have had a two tier 
employment insurance system, one for those who have received 
employment insurance benefits before and one for those who have 
never received employment insurance benefits. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is that? Some people have to work 900 hours to qualify, 
which is more than for others. Obviously I will not get into the 
number of hours required by region because, as members know, it 
varies from one region to the next depending on the unemployment 
rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that we have a two tier employment insurance system 
because there is one set of rules for one group and another set 
of rules for another. Yet the Liberal Party kept criticizing 
the leader of another party or a member of that party for 
alleged plans with regard to health, never realizing that there 
was a contradiction between the words and the actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young workers were the first to be hurt by this two tier system 
for the new unemployed. Women were also affected. After deciding 
to stay home for a number of years to raise their children—and 
that is a choice they made—when they want to get into the labour 
market, and in some cases find their first job ever, women find 
themselves in the same situation as young workers who have never 
worked. The tough part is to work 900 hours to qualify for 
employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me digress once again. Lately I have seen the government ad 
we keep seeing everywhere, the one dealing with parental 
leave. That issue is not addressed in the bill but it is 
somewhat related to our debate. The employment insurance program 
is being used to provide parental leave to everyone. That is the 
impression we get but it is not so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mother or the father who has not worked the required number 
of hours to qualify for employment insurance cannot benefit from 
this program, where the leave has gone from six to twelve months 
as of, I believe, January 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I also find outrageous about this program, which is not, in 
my mind, a real parental leave program, is that it uses the 
employment insurance program. The government is trying to look 
good by saying “This is our program”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat on the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development 
when the consultations that led to the 1995 reform were carried 
out. The federal government has not put a single dime into the 
employment insurance fund since 1991, except to pay for 
outstanding deficits, which it does not have to do anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eligibility for the program was so reduced that the government 
now has a surplus that has reached a total of over $31 billion in 
five years.  That is an enormous sum.  It is almost as much as 
Quebecers provide to the federal government every year from all 
the various sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> They get plenty back in return, plenty of 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would greatly appreciate it, 
should the hon. member across the way repeat this behaviour, if 
you would ask her to pipe down. I can barely hear my own voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women and young workers are the main ones to bear the brunt of 
the deep cuts to employment insurance.  It is all very well that 
the government has managed to deal with the deficit but it has 
affected one category of the population, mainly the poorest and 
the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do these people do when they cannot receive employment 
insurance?  They are forced onto welfare, a provincial 
jurisdiction.  This program is now subject to the Canada health 
and social transfer in which the federal government has made 
substantial cuts.  Everything has been dumped onto the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for young workers, before the reform 54% of young people 
aged 20 to 24 were entitled to employment insurance; in 1999 the 
figure was only 24.9%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I endorse what the NDP member before me 
has said.  What would people think if this were another type of 
insurance, whether fire or theft insurance, crop insurance, or 
some other kind? There are many kinds of insurance.  If people 
knew in advance that they had only one in four chances of 
receiving any benefits, as the young workers do, would this be 
any encouragement to say “now I feel I am being treated fairly”? 
On the contrary, young people are justified in feeling that they 
are being treated unfairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, this is the case of the employment insurance system. 
This is the impression shared by all the people who pay 
employment insurance premiums, since only 41.9% of all 
unemployed workers, of all contributors, qualified for benefits 
in 1999. It is not only women and young people, but mostly young 
people and women. That is unacceptable. Yet, in its bill, the 
government did not change anything pertaining to eligibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my opinion and I know that our critic, the hon. member 
for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, agrees with 
me. I would like to take the opportunity to mention the 
absolutely remarkable work he has done since he was elected. 
He has been the Bloc Quebecois critic for human resources 
development since 1997 and he took part with me in consultations 
within the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development, 
during the first mandate. He is a formidable and relentless 
worker. This has led to many results. Many of my relatives live 
in his riding. I myself am a living example of the young people 
who leave a so-called remote area. Indeed, I come from 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques or, more 
specifically, from Sainte-Rita. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were not and there still are not many jobs in that area. 
I must pay tribute to the work of this member and to the work of 
others such as the remarkable work of the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst, who, although he is not a member of our party, 
has his heart in the right place.  He has vigorously defended 
and represented those who have felt the backlash of the cuts to 
employment insurance.  I also want to recognize the work of the 
member for Québec, who toured her region and all of Quebec in 
connection with poverty.  When we spoke of poor people, she 
spoke of people who had felt the downside of the employment 
insurance reform.  These members have done a phenomenal job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the member for Sept-Îles, who did terrific work during his 
campaign in eastern Quebec and on the north shore.  These people 
were re-elected.  The member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques increased his 
majority incredibly.  He should be congratulated. 
I think the members opposite should congratulate him, but they 
will do nothing.  However, they do recognize that he is a 
defender of the people, the poor, the people who face worry and 
insecurity daily. Mothers or fathers wonder every week if they 
will get through, be able to properly feed and clothe their 
children, and so on.  How many people worry, like the MP for 
Acadie—Bathurst, about the famous gap, the period that is missing 
in order to get through to the spring and for seasonal work to 
begin? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the opinion of all the members of the opposition, we 
have this problem. The members of the Alliance might be the 
exception, since I have already heard them say—although not 
today—that their approach to resolving the problem of 
unemployment is to abolish employment insurance.  That way 
everyone will go hungry and take ridiculous jobs, will move from 
one province to another and will end up finding work.  It is 
incredible.

health if hospitals were eliminated. It is incredible to hear 
such magical thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now go back to my point. As the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques said, we are once 
again subjected to blackmail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois would have supported a proposal to include 
the proposed amendments in a bill. 
While deploring the fact that this legislation was not changing 
anything regarding eligibility, we would have supported it, 
because we have a heart, and we care about our constituents who 
are going through a rough time. We would have voted in favour of 
this bill, even though we were hoping for a better program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government wants to formalize what the Minister of 
Finance has already been doing for five years, that is to take 
money from the surplus generated by the employment insurance 
fund to manage its mismanagement, and to counteract the 
continued laxness of a government which will just not cut 
certain expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the issue, since all the parties have found areas 
where government expenditures could be reduced. 
But no. This government makes cuts affecting the poorest in our 
society, those who should not be affected by cuts. It makes cuts 
to EI, and tightens up eligibility requirements. This is 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told the bill's effect would be retroactive to October 1, 
as the Bloc Quebecois leader pointed out. During the whole 
period that followed the election, however, the Prime Minister 
did not convene the House, while he could have done so before 
Christmas. People would have liked to see these amendments take 
effect before the holiday season. But no, the government took 
its time. There was no rush. The election had taken place and 
the Liberals had just won a majority government. So, the Prime 
Minister preferred to wait and then say “Yes, we will do this 
retroactively for you”. But people's rent and other expenses 
cannot be paid retroactively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day after the election I continued to see people in my 
riding office as though nothing had changed.  People asked me 
“If the government is talking about a retroactive system, will 
their wonderful parental leave be retroactive as well?”  No, 
it will not. Things are retroactive when it suits the government, 
because it has said that they will be.  I find this government's lack 
of compassion appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, when he called the election, the Prime Minister had 
only one thing on his mind: getting elected for a third majority 
mandate.  He was not thinking about the good of the country, 
about the plight of the poor and the unemployed.  He apparently 
wanted to go down in history as the prime minister who, after 
Laurier, had the most majority mandates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unbelievable, but there it is.  How can we complain about the 
poor voter turnout when there was so little to vote for? While 
not encouraging this, I can understand it.  The election was 
called for no other reason than opportunism, not out of any 
desire to tackle the real problems facing a certain segment of 
the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was re-elected for the third time with a strong majority. 
Members of the House know that shipbuilding is an issue of great 
concern to me.  It is an issue that is well covered by the media 
in certain regions but unfortunately not on Parliament Hill. 
No Hill journalists are interested in the topic.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year these people have lost 1% of their employment insurance 
benefits because there were periods of unemployment.  This 
represents millions of dollars in my region that were lost not 
just by unemployed workers at the Lévis shipyard but also by 
businesses in my region. 
When people have less money in their wallet they spend less. 
This has an effect on the whole community. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, allow 
me first to congratulate you on your new job. I am convinced you 
will use your wisdom for the benefit of the House of Commons and 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me also to say how much respect I have for my colleague 
from Lévis who works very hard for his riding and his whole 
region. As a matter of fact, I had the opportunity to see him 
work on the issue of shipyards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the issue we are dealing with today, namely Bill 
C-2 on unemployment insurance, I would like to say that I too was 
targeted. During the election campaign there was a lot of 
reference to what was called the theft of $40 billion over a 
period of several years. However, what they did not say is that 
the fund is actually managed as part of government operations as 
a whole. 
One should always look at it in the light of the planned tax 
reduction of $100 billion over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, people forget to say that lower premiums will result in 
savings of several hundreds of millions of dollars. The Bloc 
often asks, as a key element of parental leave reform, that 
funds be repatriated to Quebec. This reminds me of Quebec's 
traditional demands and positions regarding, among others, 
manpower training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four years ago there was a deal with the federal government. 
Some $700 million a year is transferred to Quebec via 
Emploi-Québec. One day I would like to have the opportunity to 
analyze the efficiency and productivity of Emploi-Québec in terms 
of the transferred funds. I may be wrong, but I keep on hearing 
negative comments in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn my colleague's speech into 
something more positive. Could he list some key elements that 
would help slow down or stop the exodus of young people? I know 
a brief was tabled at the United Nations by a group of 
world economists. Some important parameters are needed to ensure 
the economic development of a given area. I would like my 
colleague to talk about these instead of talking only about 
unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I also want to say that I had a 
lot of respect for the hon. member for Chicoutimi. I use the past 
tense because I lost some of it when he crossed the floor to sit 
with the Liberal government at which he had previously aimed what 
I consider just criticisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember some of his comments, even the last one about the 
Liberal government's lack of compassion for our young people at 
the time. He says that this is a positive initiative. I want to put to 
him a question dealing only with employment insurance, which was 
one of the major concerns I expressed in my speech. Would he 
support, like I would, an amendment to put an end to the two tier 
employment insurance system, one for the older workers and one 
for the younger ones? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my speech, I said that unfortunately our young people were 
the first ones to be hurt by this system. I believe that 
returning to a fairer system for everyone would encourage more 
young workers to stay in their ridings or their regions and to 
even create their own jobs in some cases. I do not want to go on 
and on about this, I will limit myself only to that one 
suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member would hence be able to follow the agenda and 
stay true to the criticisms he made while sitting on this side of 
the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, just for 
the information of the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, I will 
remind him that this is a debate on employment insurance and not 
on economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to changes to the employment insurance system, I 
would like my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois to tell us if he 
has had this experience. During the election campaign, it seems 
that if one wanted changes to the EI system, one had to vote for 
the Liberals because they were the only ones who could deliver on 
that. I remember that the Liberals in all the ridings in our area 
were telling people that if they voted for them, they would make 
changes to the employment insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Liberals use the employment insurance system only to win 
votes or were they really serious about correcting the problem 
that was created through changes that hurt 
employers and employees who contribute to the employment 
insurance plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the member has experienced the same 
thing I have in Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have the same opinion of 
what they were saying.  During the election campaign, I watched 
the news like everyone else. When the Prime Minister was 
campaigning, in your neck of the woods, I believe, he said this 
about Bill C-44 “We realized that it had not been a good 
decision; we ought not to have done so”. He was referring to the 
cuts to employment insurance eligibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Bourassa made a personal commitment to 
making corrections to the employment insurance legislation. Many 
people understood this to mean corrections that would improve the 
bill that had been introduced just before the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result as far as concrete measures are concerned, with the 
exception of a few lines or phrases, is that nothing substantial 
has been changed.  It is as if there had never been an election. 
It is as if those words had never been spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in the speech I have just given I said that, on 
occasion, I am beginning to understand why people are fed up with 
politics.  When a person listens to what is said during election 
campaigns, particularly by the people across the floor, words 
that are not respected afterward, not taken any notice of, it is 
as if nothing has happened at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say, however, that the voters did a good thing by 
re-electing a number of opposition MPs, particularly the hon. 
member for Acadie—Bathurst, and all the others I have just 
named, to act as watchdogs over this government. I would have a 
word of caution for the hon. member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, for 
whom I still have considerable respect. When a person crosses the 
floor of this House, before he does so, he needs to be vigilant 
about maintaining his opinions, his values, the things he wants 
changed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the hon. member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière think that the members for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok and for 
Bellechasse—Etchemins—Montmagny—L'Islet will vote in favour of the 
bill in its present form, a bill in which there is nothing that 
was not already in Bill C-44? Do these members go along with the 
Prime Minister's trickery, who said “Some major changes are in 
order and we will make them” whereas, now that the election is 
behind us, the Prime Minister is forgetting the reality? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague agree that during the election campaign the 
members representing the Gaspé and the Etchemins—Montmagny—L'Islet 
ridings came and told us that major, indepth changes were 
necessary? Today no such changes have been made. 
How will these members vote at second reading? Since no changes 
have been made to the bill, this means they now agree with the 
content of that bill, while they were opposed to it during the 
election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière think 
these members will do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, I think they will 
follow the pack, toe the party line and remain silent.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to make a brief comment. In the ridings of the Quebec 
City region, with the exception of Bellechasse, the candidates 
tried to convince voters to vote against the Bloc Quebecois to 
bring the issue of mergers to the Quebec political arena. This 
is our second week in the House and these members are no longer 
talking about mergers. They do not ask questions on this issue 
and they do not make comments.

people.  Those people said to me that they had no interest in the

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin, I would like to thank all those in my riding who 
gave me this opportunity to again represent the riding of

and I would once again like to thank the voters in my riding for 
giving me the responsibility of representing them here. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I approach this bill and think about what we are talking 
about, one of the things we are looking at doing is strengthening 
the economy as a whole throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before entering public life, I was a debt and deficit activist. 
I used to say about the debt that we were mortgaging the future 
for younger generations and we needed to get our fiscal house in 
order.  It is the minimum that we owe our future citizens. I also 
believed fundamentally that the best way for us to grow an 
economy was to ensure that our tax rates were competitive with 
those of our trading nations, primarily our American cousins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at free trade.  Our trade with the Americans in 
1988 was $90 billion.  Today we trade over $320 billion each and 
every year.  Those are the basics of our economic fundamentals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where we will have a February pass where we 
actually may not even see a budget, despite the fact that we 
could be on the eve of facing some form of a recession. The 
Americans are actually looking at a perspective where they may be 
lowering taxes en masse, and we will not be following suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I prefaced my comments with those remarks before talking about 
the EI bill because they are what drove my politics for the most 
part.  The Progressive Conservatives believe in a market economy, 
but we do not believe in a market society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate that, when the Liberal government chose to select 
its restraint measures, instead of actually looking at reducing 
spending on massive made in Ottawa programs, where do we see the 
bulk of its cuts, its draconian measures in terms of what took 
place?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It attacked the provinces with respect to gutting health care 
and post-secondary education by 35% in the budget of 1995. 
Post-secondary education and health care are fundamental 
priorities of our society, yet the government chose to attack 
those fundamental planks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also chose to attack the poor.  I campaigned in 1997 and if I 
were to review my remarks in the course of that campaign, I am 
sure I would have commented on the fact that there was at least a 
$5 billion surplus in the EI fund at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are draconian taxes that tax every new job created.  The 
chief actuary at the time, Bernard Dussault, mentioned to us and 
the public that the EI fund would be sustainable at around $2.40 
per $100 insurable earnings.  Today I believe it is around $1.75. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about the tax cut side of this matter because that 
money belongs in the pockets of Canadians.  I am proud to say 
that I learned a lot over the course of my mandate.  The other 
side of the equation is that 75% of the individuals who collected 
EI in the year that the Liberals made these draconian cuts earned 
less than $10,000.  They attacked individuals who earned less 
than $10,000 per year.  That is essentially the cause and effect 
of that initiative.  It was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that as a devout fiscal Conservative who wants to get our 
fiscal house to ensure that we pay down the debt for future 
generations and lower taxes.  This is not in any way socialist 
propaganda, as I heard a Reform member say in the past.  This is 
not a regional subsidy in terms of EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we talk to individuals in the northern regions of Alberta, 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, New Brunswick or even 
in my riding of Fundy—Royal, we see that there are pockets where 
seasonal work in winter has a cumulative effect on seasonal 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to have been in the coalition of Progressive 
Conservatives, social moderates, fiscal conservatives and some 
individuals who spoke out on the particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the NDP member for Acadie—Bathurst for bringing 
the issue forward.  I compliment Jean Dubé, the former member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche who is running in a byelection today.  I 
wish him well as the polls close in about two and a half hours 
from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, I compliment Angela Vautour.  Angela Vautour raised 
the profile of the EI seasonal worker and these draconian cuts in 
terms of the intensity measure.  She actually brought the issue 
before Canadians.  I almost call it the Angela Vautour bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her efforts, the efforts within the Bloc in defending its 
seasonal communities and the efforts within our Conservative 
caucus in terms of the members for New Brunswick Southwest and 
for St. John's East, formed a coalition that guilted the 
government into action.  Only on the eve of an election did it 
actually have the guts to go forward and do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was an ill-advised bill, particularly concerning issues 
relating to women.  The intensity rule actually attacked how we 
have our children.  A woman may have two children, but if she did 
not work the number of weeks or hours necessary between the two 
pregnancies, she would not be eligible for EI to start off with. 
Moreover, she would be cut from her previous benefits because of 
the intensity rule.  The legislation was anti-women and 
anti-family.

his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, both the employer and the employee pay employment 
insurance premiums.  Is it not true that if we cut the EI 
premiums to the auto giants, one of the major employers in the 
country, it will be a windfall profit worth millions of dollars 
to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, lowering EI premiums for 
the employee and the employer provides more stimulus in our 
economy.  As any economist who studied this issue has always 
maintained that payroll taxes are one of the largest deterrents 
of economic growth in our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies may actually make money and profits, one of the things 
Progressive Conservatives think is good and actually grows the 
economy.  Liberals would rather stifle the economy and shame on 
them for taking that perspective.  Lowering premiums for the 
employer and the employee is the right thing to do.  Almost every 
major economist will categorically subscribe to that perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the surplus is almost $9 billion on an annual basis, 
there is more than enough money in that process.  That money 
belongs to the taxpayers.  Through tax cuts that money should be 
put back in their pockets where it belongs to repair the 
draconian damage that Doug Young and the Liberals did in 1995.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the reason the Liberals 
were able to get away with it is was that there has not been a

the critical mass and strength to be able to hold the government 
accountable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the first leader that made an issue of the EI surplus 
and hammered it day in and day out, the Hon. Jean J. Charest.  He 
actually hit that issue time and time again.  Once the surplus 
started to evolve and build, he started pointing out the fact 
that the money belonged in the pockets of Canadians through lower 
premiums and that there was no need for the government to make 
the draconian cuts which it actually did at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the comment of using the money for other

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to put a question to my colleague from the PC Party. 
He said that his leader, Mr. Charest, fought about the employment 
insurance surplus.  With all due respect, it seems to be that 
every time they speak about employment insurance they talk about 
the premium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before bringing down the premium, would he agree with me that 
the real thing to do is to resolve the problem of employment 
insurance for people who do not qualify for it and then look at 
the surplus and the premium? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the magnitude of the amount 
of money that is involved from a surplus perspective is nearly 
$10 million annually.  The government is misusing or 
misappropriating so much money in terms of its intent about how 
it is collecting it that both can be done exactly at the same 
time. There is no reason to wait in that regard.  There is 
clearly enough room to be able to move in both directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democrats and the Conservatives at some point will say 
enough is enough in terms of the benefits.  The cuts that I am 
resisting relate to those made in 1996 that attacked people 
making less than $10,000 per year. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me a great deal of pleasure to say a few words in this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House have been calling for four years 
for changes to the employment insurance system. The first set of 
major changes brought in by the Liberal government about four 
years ago had the effect of making life very miserable for a 
number of my constituents.  It also had the effect of making life 
very miserable for people in Atlantic Canada generally who 
happened to live for the most part in a seasonal economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the unemployment insurance system became the employment 
insurance system, the new rules forced many people in Atlantic 
Canada to become mobile.  The new rules forced many seasonal 
workers to move because it became much more difficult to qualify 
for employment insurance benefits.  When they did qualify it was 
for fewer benefits for a shorter period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This caused quite a great deal of difficulty for Atlantic 
Canadians.  Seasonal workers were penalized for the intensity 
rule, which dropped their rate of benefit every year because they 
happened to be repeat users of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see too many changes in some of the really important 
aspects of the unemployment insurance bill.  The divisor rule had 
the effect of lessening the monetary value of the weeks worked 
and drove down the weekly EI benefit.  I do not see too many 
changes that would reverse that effect. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The net result is that about 35% of unemployed people actually 
qualify for benefits.  Because women of course have a different 
work pattern than men, about 30% of women actually qualify for 
benefits.  That is causing a great deal of hardship among the 
workforce generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland is the hardest hit of the Atlantic provinces with 
respect to the EI changes.  That, combined with the downturn in 
the fishery, has meant a steady out-migration of people from the 
province.  The population of the province is steadily going down 
because of many of the draconian measures the government has 
taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truly sad part of this is that the out-migration was not 
accidental.  It seemed to be a deliberate part of the whole plan. 
The architects of the new EI system knew that there would be a 
part of the year when seasonal workers would not be able to 
qualify for benefits.  If they did not qualify for benefits they 
would be faced with a choice.  They would have the choice of 
digging into their savings, going on welfare or moving to another 
part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might say so what if they have to move to another part of 
the country.  However, if they happen to be seasonal workers, 
their wages very often are low.  They cannot afford to move their 
families, lock, stock and barrel, to another part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes brought in by the Liberals in changing the system 
from UI to EI have cost the province of Newfoundland $1 billion 
annually.  The city of St. John's has been losing $75 million 
annually.  The riding of St. John's East, which is made up of 
part of the city of St. John's and the rural areas of Conception 
Bay, is losing about $52 million annually.  Neighbouring St. 
John's West is losing about $56 million annually.  Burin—St. 
George's is losing $80 million a year.  A lot of these towns and 
communities happen to be in a seasonal economy because of the 
fishery.  Newfoundland being on the government side did not seem 
to help either.  In the five ridings outside of St. John's, the 
EI cuts have had a really devastating effect on the rural parts 
of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall the government decided to loosen up on some of the EI 
rules because an election was in the offing, but it failed to 
pass the EI bill before the writ was dropped.  We were supposed 
to forget then, and we are supposed to forget now, that there has 
been a massive surplus in the EI account for quite some time. The 
government could have and should have acted on the unemployment 
insurance problems in Atlantic Canada long before it did.  It did 
not do so simply because it was leading up to an election, so we 
have an EI bill before us today that still fails to address the 
problems of a seasonal economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a few words about women and EI.  Earlier I said 
that about 30% of unemployed Canadian women qualify for benefits 
these days.  That is not my estimate; that is from Statistics 
Canada as well as the employment insurance commission.  Only 30% 
of unemployed Canadian women actually qualify for benefits.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spring budget the Liberals made much of the fact that EI 
maternity leave would be extended from six months to a full year. 
Given that only 30% of women qualify for any benefits and given 
that it is harder to qualify for maternity benefits than it is 
for regular benefits, only a political party with the gall of the 
Liberals would boast about improvements to maternity benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some good points about the bill and I do not think 
they should be overlooked.  One good point is that the bill 
raises the income threshold for clawback.  There is no clawback 
for first time claimants and for people who avail themselves of 
maternity benefits or sick benefits.  This is very good and I 
want to compliment the government on this.  People coming off 
maternity or parental benefits will now have an easier time 
getting back into the employment insurance system because they 
will no longer be treated as people with no attachment to the 
workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was all of this not done earlier?  Why was this not done 
this spring when the length of the maternity benefit period was 
increased?  If only 30% of unemployed women qualify for benefits, 
as I said earlier, all of these improvements are cold comfort to 
the other 70%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I do not see any changes in this bill with regard to 
easing up on the qualifying requirements for regular benefits, 
nor do I see anything that increases the time during which one 
can draw regular benefits.  This means that there is still a 
period of the year in which an unemployed person will have no 
income.  The divisor rule, which lowers the monetary value of the 
weeks worked, is still there and the value of the weekly benefit 
has not been changed.  While the improvements to maternity 
benefits and the clawback provisions are certainly welcome, for 
regular benefits the EI system is still nowhere as generous as 
what it should be.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for his 
remarks.  I listened very carefully.  Incidentally, I am very 
fond of his province.  I have been down there a number of times. 
It is probably one of the most beautiful corners in the country 
or, for that matter, anywhere in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do sympathize with him on this problem of the migration out 
that occurs in Newfoundland, because of lack of job 
opportunities, I suppose.  In that context, I would ask the 
member, then, if it would not be better to allow the rich 
corporations in central Canada to continue to pay relatively high 
premiums into the EI fund?  With that surplus the federal 
government can invest in infrastructure in Newfoundland that 
creates jobs.  Is that not a better solution for Newfoundland 
than reducing premiums? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, no, that is certainly not 
the way it should be.  I believe there should be a general 
recognition by the federal government of the fact that we either 
value seasonal workers or we do not.  If a province happens to 
have a seasonal economy as we do in Atlantic Canada, the federal 
government can and should be looking at making the employment 
insurance system a lot more generous.  If 10 and 42 was too 
generous, which it probably was, then 10 and 21 is certainly not 
as generous as it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the question we have to ask ourselves when we are 
talking about employment insurance:  do we value a seasonal 
economy?  Do we value the fishery in Atlantic Canada?  Do we 
value loggers in Atlantic Canada?  Do we value construction 
workers in Atlantic Canada?  These people make a very valuable 
contribution to the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only Atlantic Canada that has a seasonal economy. 
Parts of Ontario have a seasonal economy as well. 
I think it is incumbent upon federal government to realize that 
it has an obligation toward the regions of the country.  We 
should not always be looking to the centre.  To think that to 
make things better in the centre and things will all of a sudden 
become a whole lot better in Atlantic Canada is the wrong 
approach.

in Canada that makes a contribution to this economy.  The people 
of Atlantic Canada make that contribution as well.  Fish may not 
be very appealing to the member opposite, but fish are a very 
important part of this economy and we have fishermen in Atlantic 
Canada who need a more generous employment insurance system than 
what the federal government is providing now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the problems with what the 
Liberals have done with the draconian cuts to EI is that they 
have increased child poverty in this country.  They have also 
increased the number of food banks we have in this country. It is 
absolutely criminal that this government can get away with that. 
In my own riding, in Chezzetcook, they opened up another food 
bank the other day because people simply do not have enough money 
to buy their own food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what happens when we have a centrally based government 
that ignores the regions of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member from St. John's East tell us what effect 
it has in his communities in terms of the children of his riding 
when parents do not have enough money to clothe or feed their 
children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has asked 
a very good question and a very important one.  I believe that 
food banks are being used today at unprecedented rates, not only 
in Newfoundland but in a lot of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was part of a committee on poverty that travelled this country 
from Newfoundland to Vancouver.  We held public meetings and had 
people come forward and make presentations.  One of the things 
people said to us consistently was that the unemployment 
insurance system and the changes that the federal government made 
to the unemployment insurance system had lowered their income 
levels to such an extent that they depended on food banks on an 
almost weekly basis.  The government should be held to account 
for that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and

opportunity to speak on behalf of my constituents of Western 
Arctic and on behalf of my government in favour of these changes 
to the employment insurance legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been with HRDC since 1993, when EI was still UI, as it 
was known then.  It was under the leadership of former Minister 
Axworthy that the initial discussion on review and reform began. 
It was an attempt to look at the inequities in the system, at the 
issues and at the long outdated problems that had occurred within 
the system and needed to be changed.  The ensuing debate was on 
those issues.  Subsequently we went through successive ministers, 
four to be exact, the most important to date our current 
minister, who has undertaken to complete the file on the changes 
for these particular sections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes we are bringing forward under this bill are 
important and necessary.  As members of the House know, this bill 
was introduced in the House last fall and debated in second 
reading.  That is why we are reintroducing this bill.  The 
changes herein reflect the mandate that Canadians gave us in the 
last election.  They also follow from our government's ongoing 
monitoring and review of the EI system and our belief in 
fairness.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is always an effort made to ensure that the best results 
come from any reforms or reviews of legislations, programs and 
services.  This monitoring has led us to recognize that some of 
the changes brought in then have caused unanticipated 
difficulties, especially some of the impacts that they have had 
on seasonal workers and parents who take extended absences from 
the workforce to care for young children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to provide a program that is fair and that Canadians can 
count on for support when they are out of work or when they are 
preparing for work.  We have continued to monitor the process. 
By and large we can say that all the core elements of the reforms 
undertaken in 1996 are working well.  However, we also recognize 
that some improvements need to be made.  That is why we are doing 
this legislation reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the legislation as good news for families and their 
children.  By eliminating the intensity rule, for example, we 
will improve the situation of workers and their families who 
often have to rely on EI more than they would like to because job 
opportunities may be limited.  For many people in situations like 
this the existing legislation may be perceived to be punitive, 
especially in regions where jobs are scarce.  This is something 
that is recognized by these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember the intensity rule was put in place to discourage the 
repeat use of EI.  Unfortunately, it has not achieved the desired 
results.  Looking at my part of the country, for example, we do 
not have the same job opportunities as some other areas of the 
country.  In some regions of my riding of Western Arctic, jobs 
are very scarce or at best very seasonal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not everyone is in the same situation across the country.  Take 
for example the individuals employed in the transportation 
industry, the ferry workers and the longshoremen of the Northwest 
Territories.  These men and women ensure the transportation of 
vital goods to many small communities in the western Arctic. Many 
people would not know but we do not have a complete highway 
system.  We do not have 100% of the transportation grid in our 
area, neither does Nunavut and some parts of the northern areas 
of provinces.  These jobs are at best very seasonal.  These men 
and women, try as they might, cannot always work year around. The 
weather simply makes it impossible.  Should they be penalized by 
the intensity rule? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true in a number of other industries in northern 
communities, such as commercial fisheries.  Our communities also 
depend on firefighters to prevent and extinguish forest fires. 
Sometimes they work in very remote locations and sometimes they 
go abroad and assist because they developed the expertise and are 
asked to make a contribution nationally and internationally 
outside of our region.  Nonetheless, their work is seasonal work. 
Should these workers be penalized by the intensity rule? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oil and gas workers, as well as mining industry workers, are 
other groups who are a vital part of the communities of the 
Northwest Territories.  This work is highly seasonal for the very 
fact that we do not have permanent roads.  We depend on winter 
roads which have a very short window of opportunity because of 
the environment.  We are not allowed to continue with the 
transportation of goods once the ground softens.  This really has 
an impact on the livelihood of many of those people.  Once again, 
while they would like to work year around, the reality of our 
weather, climate and winter prevents this.  The intensity rule 
has caused hardship for many people in circumstances like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree that the emphasis should be on encouraging people 
to gain long term employment.  I know that is what people in the 
north want to do.  That is the long term strategic goal of the 
north, to become self-sustaining.  With the opportunity of now 
having two diamond mines in full swing, we anticipate camps that 
have 800 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the same, many of the people who transport fuel and goods 
are seasonal workers because of the very nature of the climate 
and circumstances that our environment entails in the north.  It 
is not a government device.  We report the weather but we do not 
create the environment that makes the weather.  That is the way 
it is.  Once again, while they would like to work year around, 
the reality is their circumstances prevent it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be realistic and we are.  We want a system that is 
fair to all Canadians including those whose incomes depend on 
seasonal employment.  We can do that by eliminating the intensity 
rule and backdating the change to October 1, 2000, as the 
legislation proposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know all members want this.  We want to restore the basic rate 
of 55% for everyone.  This is good news.  I also see good news in 
the proposed legislation for those individuals and their families 
whose income includes special benefits under EI.  By this, I mean 
benefits paid under EI for maternity or parental leave or in 
cases of illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current system special benefits can be subject to the 
clawback.  Under the legislation before us, that will no longer 
be the case.  When Bill C-2 is passed, people collecting 
maternity, parental or sickness benefits, will no longer have to 
repay their benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First time claimants will also get a break from the clawback.  A 
first time claimant has often paid premiums for many years 
without ever drawing on their benefits.  At the same time, the 
government proposes to raise the income level at which the 
clawback kicks in for repeat claimants, from $39,000 to $48,750 
net income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the legislation is passed, only higher income Canadians 
who have repeatedly received EI will face the prospect of paying 
back their benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note the legislation proposes we make this repayment 
adjustment apply starting from taxation year 2000. In other 
words, the change will provide benefit for all of 2000 and from 
that time forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also proposes changes that will help parents of young 
children to more easily qualify for regular benefits after they 
have re-entered the labour force.  If the bill is adopted, 
parents would require the same number of hours as other workers 
to qualify for regular benefits, between 420 and 700 hours 
depending on the unemployment rate where they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new rules will recognize the strong workforce attachments 
these parents had prior to taking an extended period away from 
work to raise their young children.  For example, we have heard 
about women who felt they had been penalized for taking time away 
from work to care for their children and that existing 
regulations did not give them adequate credit for past 
participation in the labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech gave a flavour of the kind of care, and 
previous budgets have also indicated the care, that we give to 
young children, to families and to the youth of the country. This 
is a reflection and an extension of that.  We want all young 
children to have a good start.  Any legislation that we have put 
forward has dealt with early intervention and prevention 
programs.  We will ensure that there is compatibility between 
these changes and the results that we desire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are extending the look back period used to determine 
eligibility for EI regular benefits by four years to make sure 
re-entrant parents are not treated unfairly.  This is an 
important amendment for my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House may not be aware that the Northwest 
Territories and its neighbour Nunavut have one of the highest 
birth rates in Canada.  In 1999 the birth rate for the Northwest 
Territories and Nunavut combined was 22.7 births for every 1,000 
residents.  This compares to an average of 11.2 births for every 
1,000 residents in Canada as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes will benefit many people in my riding and 
neighbouring ridings in the north.  I see this as another 
positive change for Canadian families, particularly in light of 
the new extended parental benefits.  It will remove the penalty 
these parents, and especially women, could face when applying for 
EI after an extended absence.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numbers of ways the changes in Bill C-2 will benefit 
unemployed Canadian workers and their families.  The bottom line 
is that by addressing some very real concerns which have been 
brought to our attention, concerns of my constituents and of the 
government itself, we are moving to ensure that northerners and 
all Canadian families are treated fairly under EI, and that they 
have more money to meet the needs of their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the bill is not the end of our work to ensure fairness 
under EI.  I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks that we are 
committed to an ongoing process of review, that we will continue 
to monitor and access how EI is working and to ensure that the EI 
system does the job we want it to do.  That is why I am pleased 
to speak in favour of the legislation for northerners and all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to the bill on employment insurance. I was listening to 
a woman in parliament talk about fairness and fair treatment, 
words that are to be found in Bill C-2. As we know, the treatment 
women are subjected to in order to qualify is totally 
unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister tells us this reform was necessary, I quite 
agree with her. However, when one looks at the bill with respect 
to parental leave, about which the minister was boasting in terms 
of what the government is doing, it is like putting one's head in 
the sand. This means that women are not eligible for employment 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one requires that women work 600 hours while in 
some regions where unemployment is high, men or women only have 
to work 420 hours in order to qualify for regular benefits, when 
one boasts about the parental leave bill, that means that one is 
not looking at how many women will qualify for parental leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that 42% of pregnant women are eligible for 
maternity leave. It is fine to boast about doubling the number of 
weeks and hours that a woman will be able to spend at home with 
her child, but it remains that she has to qualify and to be able 
to afford it. With 55% of a precarious salary, a woman will not 
be able to afford to stay at home for two years to care for her 
child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister talks about fair treatment, I do not believe 
it concerning women, for several reasons. As we know, women are 
the ones in precarious jobs. According to the Canadian Labour 
Congress, 10 years ago 70% of women had access to employment 
insurance. Nowadays, it is the reverse: 70% of women are 
excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dare the minister to tell me this is treating women fairly. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think members 
understand that these are very specific reforms.  These changes 
are not a panacea to all the woes, problems, hardships and 
challenges that face women.  There are many other opportunities 
that we have to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members in the House cannot distinguish between the issue 
of guaranteed income and a specific program like employment 
insurance.  We need to have a different set of discussions on 
whether or not there are other issues we have to look at to 
perhaps enhance the economic well-being of women.  It is a fact 
that women are benefiting from our economy as a whole.  There 
were 31,000 new jobs created for women in December.  Employment 
for women increased by 1.1 million jobs since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, we cannot resolve all the issues because these are specific 
reforms.  Look at the benefit repayment clawback, the re-entrance 
provision and the retroactive fishing regulations which ensure 
that women in the fishing industry can access the same parental 
benefits as other women.  This is progress and the hon. member 
should recognize that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to have some details from the Secretary of State for 
Children and Youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, when my predecessor, Doug Young, was in opposition, he 
said that he encouraged all New Brunswickers to fight any changes 
to the unemployment insurance system with vigour because they 
would spell disaster for New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1993, the leader of the opposition, who is now the 
Prime Minister of Canada, said that we should attack the economy, 
not the most vulnerable people in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the minister is telling us that minister Axworthy did 
what he had to do, which was to reform the employment insurance 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could she tell me the difference? When she was a member of an 
opposition party, that party was fighting any changes proposed by 
the Conservative government to the unemployment insurance plan. 
Now that the Liberals are in power, it is apparently all right to 
steal $32 billion from workers. Could she explain that to me? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps the hon. 
member should reflect on the fortunes of his party and consider 
the whole issue of reform and review.  That is where the reform 
needs to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is undeniable that we are living in a world of change.  We have high 
technology, mechanization, digitalization and a shift from a 
resource based economy to a high tech, innovative economy.  We 
have challenges to face and one of the challenges is adjusting to 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's comments serve to remind many Canadians that 
his party is unwilling to change, unwilling to meet the 
challenges and unwilling to make tough decisions in the short 
term for long term gain.  I think that is what it is all about. 
The hon. member should consider those comments.

Speaker, between 1993 and 1997, I sat on the human resources 
development committee and the secretary of state was performing 
about the same duties as today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since very few changes were made compared to what people 
requested throughout the consultation process and since the 
secretary of state is very much aware of the situation, how does 
she explain the fact that the eligibility rule has not been 
modified? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has to realize that no changes whatsoever were made to 
the eligibility rule. The changes only affect those who are 
already eligible to employment insurance benefits. There is 
nothing in this bill for those who could not previously qualify 
for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state has read the reports prepared by the 
committee that even travelled to my region. How can she justify 
and support this bill that does not include any of the 
suggestions concerning the eligibility issue? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
should recognize that we took on the reforms in 1996 to make the 
system fairer, reduce dependency, assist claimants in low income 
families with children, reduce program costs and emphasize active 
measures, all the while leaving the core elements of employment 
insurance intact.  Perhaps this is not his view, and I doubt that 
it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are facts.  These are not my opinions.  These goals are 
just as important today as they were in 1996.  This is what we 
aspire to.  I am sad and sorry that the members opposite do not 
feel the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the changes.  In 1997 we saw an inequity and 
created the small week pilot project.  In the 2000 budget we 
extended parental benefits.  These are all changes.  Today we talk 
about clawback and intensity.  These are very specific.  Do the 
hon. members not recognize that these are changes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how we can convince them.  I am sure that with 
more time we can, because they will come to their senses and 
realize this is the thing to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it incredible that those in power are able to say, during 
an election campaign, that they are there to make changes when 
young university students have trouble studying and working at 
the same time. 
Many of them work part time but some of them work full time. 
These people receive very little benefits if any.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the secretary of state how she can say such things 
during an election campaign, then introduce a bill without make 
changes to allow young university students to have enough money 
to get by, especially to allow them not to pay employment 
insurance premiums or, at the very least, to receive benefits. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the difference is 
that we believe in creating opportunities for those students 
rather than have a system where they depend on only one form of 
support, which would be EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would rather create economic opportunity for smart, clever 
young people who make an investment in their education and who 
want to work.  That is what we prefer to do.  We do so by 
investing a lot in post-secondary education.  We invest $1.2 
billion into youth programs and support programs.  We have a 
summer employment program.  All these things speak to the kind of 
world we want to create for young people.

Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise 
in the House in the final minutes of this debate on the very 
important issue of unemployment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to see the arrogance ooze from the pores of 
the Liberal members.  It is absolutely incredible that the 
government thinks for one second that it has not only the legal 
authority but the moral authority to tell businesses and workers 
what to do with their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not government money.  This is not Liberal money.  This 
belongs to the hardworking members of both the working class and 
the business community.  It is their money.  I doubt very much 
that an ounce of consultation went on with the various businesses 
or union organizations throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely astounding that in 1989 the Liberals agreed 
with an Ed Broadbent motion to eliminate poverty by the year 
2000.  Since 1993 when the government took power, poverty has 
increased four times.  More and more food banks are opening 
across the country because parents do not have the funds to look 
after their children's daily needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an absolute scandalous shame that government members can 
tell us that they are doing is a good thing.  They need only come 
to my riding, come to areas of Newfoundland and come to other 
areas throughout the country to see the devastation their 
policies have invoked across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let us completely ignore 
that man and carry on.  The Liberals wish to rise on a point of 
order simply because they do not understand what their 
devastation has done to the EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you did indicate that the 
member only had a minute left to speak.  I believe you may have 
lost track of time in his particular instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  No, I did not lose track 
at all, because before I gave him the floor I said “Resuming 
debate.  The hon. member has 20 minutes left”.  I give him back 
the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that shows the attention 
the Liberals pay to very important issues throughout the country. 
I thank you for correcting that error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the government has no understanding of 
what it has done.  I notice my new colleague, the member for Bras 
d'Or—Cape Breton, is in the House today.  I welcome him to the 
House.  No offence to him personally, but I do wish that Michelle 
Dockrill was back.  Now that he is here, however, I am sure he 
will stand up for the good fishing communities of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply scandalous that he can sit in the House and say his 
Liberal colleagues will do a good thing with EI.  I would love to 
tour with him in his riding after the bill gets through.  I know 
the Liberals will rush the bill through with no positive 
amendments from our side.  They will see exactly what happens a 
year from now, the devastation that the bill will continue to 
have on the good people of Cape Breton.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most unfortunate that this is happening.  In fact, my hon. 
colleague from Winnipeg Centre has clearly pointed out the fact 
that the two week penalty for employees who wish to go back and 
get training at vocational school is still in effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope the government will accept this amendment.  By taking 
away that two week clawback, the government will not penalize any 
person in this country who wishes to upgrade his or her skills. 
We would like the government to eliminate that penalty against 
workers so that they can have the opportunity to upgrade their 
skills, especially in aspects of the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most unfortunate that the government members in the House 
of Commons think that because they have 170 seats they have a 
mandate to do whatever they please.  We in the NDP, although we 
may have been reduced in numbers, will continue to stand up in 
the House for the workers of the country and for the small 
businesses of the country, because these are the backbone of our 
society, the backbone of the outer regions of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not help but notice that one of the members from Prince 
Edward Island is here.  It is an unfortunate shame that a lot of 
the shell fishers in his area have gone through a personal hell 
over the last four years due to what HRDC, Revenue Canada and DFO 
collectively have done to his good people in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we hear from the member for New Brunswick that the same 
thing is happening to the clam fishers in New Brunswick.  The 
same thing is happening to shell fishers in the Gaspé region as 
well and in other areas of New Brunswick.  It is unfortunate that 
the government continues to punish those people in our society 
who make under $10,000 a year.  It is absolutely criminal that 
the government can stand up and say it is going to do what is 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To do what is right is, first of all, to respect these people. 
Although they do not make an awful lot of money, they are still 
Canadian citizens.  The last time I checked, they had a right to 
be governed in a respectful way.  It is a shame that the federal 
government, through its departments, can display such arrogance 
toward these hardworking Canadians, when in actuality all they 
really wish to do is look after their families and live in the 
communities of their ancestors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Acadie—Bathurst went across the country a 
couple of years ago and came up with an EI report.  My colleague 
from the Conservatives gave a lot of credit to Angela Vautour, 
who, by the way, was a former member of the New Democratic Party 
before she crossed the floor, and I give her credit as well for 
raising this issue, but I believe the fact that the government is 
even talking about EI is due to the incredible hard work of my 
colleague from Acadie—Bathurst.  He deserves an awful lot of 
credit for bringing the issue to the House and shaming the 
government into doing something right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the Liberals some credit.  I do not often give them 
credit, but a couple of things in the EI changes are positive. 
The unfortunate fact is that the government has the money and the 
time to move forward, invoke all the changes and make sure that 
an awful lot of people can access EI funds for many positive 
reasons, but it does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing the government could do, which I offer to it. 
I could not help but notice in the throne speech the situation of 
parents who look after children needing palliative care.  The 
parents may be able to access income security and job protection 
at the same time.  That was taken right out of my private 
member's bill.  The only unfortunate part is a lot of it was 
missed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to give this advice to the Liberal government and to 
my good colleague from Cape Breton.  Here is what can be done. 
Any person that looks after an infirm relative, one under 
rehabilitative or palliative care, should be able to take time 
off work, access EI funds and have job protection for up to a 
year.  This gives the person the opportunity to look after a 
loved one, be it under a palliative care or rehabilitative care 
situation, and to care for him or her with some dignity. It also 
relieves our health care system and gives great relief to other 
medical concerns out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals would have taken up that one, they would be 
getting a lot of support and high praise throughout the country. 
They did not.  They just took a little bit.  In order to move 
this issue forward, I am offering them the entire private 
member's bill.  We all know that when we care for a loved one or 
an individual under a palliative care situation in our own home, 
it gives that individual a lot more care and dignity than would 
be the case if the person had to be institutionalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say once and for all that the government does not have 
the right to use the EI money as it pleases.  It belongs to 
businesses and the workers in Canada.  Before it invokes any 
major changes, the government should consult Canadians to see 
what should be done with the burgeoning surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I am sorry to interrupt 
my hon. colleague.  I would like to inform him that he still has 
13 minutes left in his speech when the matter is next brought 
before the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10.00 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
