</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have the honour to inform the House 
that when this House did attend His Excellency this day in the 
Senate chamber, His Excellency was pleased to make a speech to 
both Houses of Parliament.  To prevent mistakes I have obtained a 
copy which is as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Honourable Members of the Senate,</I><BR> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Members of the House of Commons,</I><BR> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Ladies and Gentlemen:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife, Diana, and I were happy to welcome Her Majesty the Queen and 
the Duke of Edinburgh when they arrived in Canada last June and to be 
their hosts during their stay in the National Capital over Canada Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Governor General I have visited every province and territory, and I 
wish every Canadian could share that experience. Our cities, towns, and 
villages reflect the diversity of all those who have come to this 
country. And yet our communities, whether on the coasts or the prairies, 
whether in the woodlands or on the northern tundra, show the same 
friendliness, openness, and generosity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People care for each other in many ways, and they give their time and 
their support to their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I became Governor General, I stated my intention to honour the 
generosity of Canadians, especially as demonstrated by volunteers. We 
have now created the Caring Canadian Award to recognize the most 
dedicated among them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my functions, I visit with many units of the Canadian Forces. They 
have impressed me with their dedication, as demonstrated by their 
peacekeeping role, their heroic work in search and rescue, and their 
immediate response to natural disasters such as the Saguenay region and 
Red River floods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me mention another source of great pride: the proclamation of the 
twenty-first of June, the longest day of the year, as National 
Aboriginal Day—a day to honour the First Peoples of this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>A New Parliament— </B> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today marks the opening of a new Parliament, the last Parliament of the 
20th century and the first Parliament of the 21st century, a Parliament 
with a unique and historic opportunity to provide leadership on national 
issues to secure the future for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 2, 1997, the people of Canada renewed the mandate of the 
Government. Over the course of this Parliament, the Government will 
fulfil the commitments it made to the people in its election platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliament of Canada is the only institution directly elected by all 
Canadians with the mandate to protect and express the national interest. 
Elected by all Canadians and endowed with the legitimacy that this 
bestows, the Government of Canada will stand up for the shared values of 
Canadians at home and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But governing in the 21st century also means recognizing that no one 
government can act alone. Given the complexity of the issues that face 
us as citizens in a global economy, collaboration is an essential 
ingredient for the success of Canada. More than ever, Canadians want 
their governments to work together in partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look forward to the beginning of a new millennium with new 
challenges and new opportunities, we can look back at the last century 
of Canadian history and state with certainty that Canada is rightly 
regarded, the world over, as an extraordinary success. Canada represents 
a triumph of the human spirit, bringing together the best of what people 
can do. 
</I></P><P align=left>—For a New Century of Canadian Achievement 
</I></P><P align=left>As the 21st century approaches, Canadians face changes in technology and 
information that are as profound as those of the Industrial Revolution 
and that are creating dramatic opportunities for our growth and 
development. As old and familiar constraints of time and distance are 
breaking down, individuals and communities can accomplish things once 
unimaginable. 
</I></P><P align=left>Canada is ready. We are poised for success. Our citizens have the 
qualities that are needed to succeed in the 21st century: 
</I></P><P align=left>We have the values of sharing and mutual help. 
</I></P><P align=left>We are well educated. 
</I></P><P align=left>We welcome innovation and new ideas. 
</I></P><P align=left>We are an open and democratic society. 
</I></P><P align=left>We are a bilingual and multicultural country at a time of increasing 
globalization. 
</I></P><P align=left>We have learned to accommodate our differences and diversity and turn 
them into strengths. 
</I></P><P align=left>Our federation makes the most of these talents. It gives us the cohesion 
we need to multiply our strengths by combining our talents, by pooling 
our resources and by sharing risks. It also gives us the flexibility we 
need to experiment and innovate in order to succeed in a rapidly 
changing world. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government wishes to recognize the important role of a professional, 
non-partisan public service in a well-performing civil society. Canada 
is served well by its public service, and the effort and dedication it 
exhibits in meeting the needs of citizens and in building partnerships 
among governments and other sectors of society. The Government will 
continue to renew the Public Service of Canada to ensure its members 
have the skills and dedication to continue serving Canadians well. 
</I></P><P align=left><I>We Have Already Built a Foundation for Our Success</I> 
</I></P><P align=left>In recent years, Canadians worked hard and sacrificed to overcome many 
of our nation's challenges. We succeeded, and have started to put in 
place a strong foundation for our success in the new millennium. 
</I></P><P align=left>This 36th Parliament opens at a time when we have brought order to our 
public finances, and the economy is entering a period of strong growth. 
While unemployment is still too high, hundreds of thousands of new jobs 
are being created by the private sector, inflation is at very low 
levels, and interest rates are lower than they have been in more than 
three decades. More Canadian companies are selling more goods and 
services to the world than ever before. 
</I></P><P align=left>Stimulating job creation and economic growth has been, remains, and will 
continue to be a major objective of the Government of Canada. The 
Government will build on the progress achieved and the foundations put 
in place over the last four years to strengthen the economy and increase 
confidence. We will pursue this course and take further action to 
encourage new investment, to create new jobs, and to generate the 
national wealth necessary to assure Canadians a stable and secure 
future. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government will continue to be vigilant and responsible about 
keeping the financial affairs of the country in order: 
</I></P><P align=left>It will put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a permanent downward track. 
</I></P><P align=left>It will balance the budget no later than fiscal year 1998-99. 
</I></P><P align=left>It will seek to devote one-half of the surplus in this mandate to 
addressing the social and economic needs of Canadians. The other half 
will go to a combination of reducing taxes and the national debt. 
</I></P><P align=left>It will introduce legislation to implement the proposed changes to the 
Canada Pension Plan and the new Seniors Benefit in order to ensure 
Canada's public pension system remains sustainable in the 21st century. 
</I></P><P align=left>One in three Canadian jobs depend on trade. Our prosperity and our 
ability to create jobs are directly linked to how well we capitalize on 
international opportunities. Team Canada trade missions have 
successfully generated new opportunities for Canadian businesses and 
have illustrated what we can accomplish when governments and the private 
sector collaborate. The Government will build on this success with a 
focussed strategy, developed in consultation with industry, to improve 
our international economic performance by expanding Canada's trade base, 
becoming the location of choice for global investment, and making Canada 
a preferred tourist destination. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government has regained the ability to address priorities of 
Canadians while living within its means. It is now in the 
position to make strategic investments in our children and our 
youth, our health, our communities, and our knowledge and 
creativity while continuing to improve the nation's finances. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government is committed to following this balanced approach of 
social investment and prudent financial management as it leads Canada 
toward renewed and lasting economic health and increased social 
cohesion. 
</I></P><P align=left>As important as all of these accomplishments is the fact that the 
federal, provincial and territorial governments are developing new and 
better ways of working together. We are making the federation better 
able to serve the differing needs of Canadians across the country. 
</I></P><P align=left>Canadians feel better about their own future and the country's future. 
We are looking to our future together with a new optimism. The fact that 
we have demonstrated our ability as a country to set ambitious goals and 
achieve them gives us new confidence to set higher goals for the 
years ahead and succeed. We need to go beyond the limits of our 
expectations. It is the task of Parliament and the Government to rise to 
this new spirit of optimism. 
</I></P><P align=left><I>Our Challenge for the Future</I> 
</I></P><P align=left>Our challenge is to ensure that no Canadian is left behind as the 
country moves forward. The future belongs to societies whose economy is 
sound; who invest in knowledge, education and innovation; whose 
population is healthy; whose children are well prepared to learn; and 
who focus on securing a high quality of life for all citizens. Canadians 
have already set these priorities for this new Parliament. These are the 
Government's priorities. 
</I></P><P align=left>Building a Stronger Canada 
</I></P><P align=left>The federal, provincial and territorial governments owe it to all 
Canadians to take responsible leadership on the unity of the country. 
The single most important commitment of the Government is to keep Canada 
united. The Government of Canada can have no greater duty or 
responsibility. The overriding goal of the Government of Canada as we 
approach the 21st century is both simple and ambitious. It is to 
strengthen and unite this country by joining in the common purpose of 
keeping Canada one of the best places in the world in which to live. 
</I></P><P align=left>Our values of openness, tolerance and sharing, our qualities of social 
and linguistic diversity, and our high standard of living equip us 
exceptionally well for the challenges of the new age. 
</I></P><P align=left>Canadians want a just and sharing society. A prosperous society. A 
tolerant and highly diverse society. A society that fosters excellence 
and creativity. Realizing these aspirations fully will require the 
active 
engagement of Canadians in all walks of life, as well as our 
institutions, businesses, voluntary organizations and our governments. 
It will require collaboration and partnership. It will require reaching 
out. 
</I></P><P align=left>The federal, provincial and territorial governments have been developing 
a more collaborative approach to strengthening and modernizing Canada's 
social union—the new National Child Benefit System is an early result 
of this new approach. In their meeting last week, nine Premiers and the 
two territorial leaders reiterated their desire for closer co-operation 
with the federal government in the areas of health care and social 
policy. The Government welcomes the Premiers' and territorial leaders' 
continuing interest in working together, and is committed to even closer 
collaboration on these important issues. As a next step, the First 
Ministers will meet this fall to work on co-operative approaches to 
address youth unemployment, health care and social policy renewal. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government will take a very broad and encompassing approach to 
promoting and strengthening our unity. All its major initiatives will 
serve to make Canada better and thus more united. The Government will 
approach its mandate committed to collaboration and partnership with all 
its partners in Canadian society. Canada provides our common space and 
our common means for realizing our potential. We would all be forever 
diminished, forever changed, should we fail to maintain the example 
Canada provides to the world. Our future as a country is too precious 
for us to risk losing it through misunderstanding. Therefore, the 
Government will bring frankness and clarity to any debate that puts into 
question the future existence or unity of Canada. It will create a 
better understanding of the true complexity and difficulty for all of us 
in severing ties that have developed in building a nation together. Most 
of all, it will demonstrate how much more we can do together than apart. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government will work closely with provincial and territorial 
governments to further advance the progress made by nine Premiers and 
the territorial leaders last week in Calgary toward the full recognition 
of the diversity inherent in the federation, including the unique 
character of Quebec society. 
</I></P><P align=left>We will build on the mutual respect Canadians have for one another to 
achieve our common aspirations for a better future. 
</I></P><P align=left>Investing in Children 
</I></P><P align=left>A country that has decided to invest in its children is a country that 
is confident in its future. A country that invests in its children 
successfully will have a better future. One of our objectives as a 
country should be to ensure that all Canadian children have the best 
possible opportunity to develop their full potential. We must equip our 
children with the capacities they need to be ready to learn and to 
participate fully in our society. 
</I></P><P align=left>While families have the greatest responsibility in the nurturing and 
development of our children, they are not alone. Developing our children 
requires a concerted effort and partnership by parents, governments, and 
the private and the voluntary sectors. It requires focussing on what 
children need to thrive. 
</I></P><P align=left>The experiences of Canada's children, especially in the early years, 
influence their health, their well-being, and their ability to learn and 
adapt throughout their entire lives. By investing now in the well-being 
of today's children, we improve the long-term health of our society. 
Addressing the needs of low-income families with children is therefore a 
priority of the Government. 
</I></P><P align=left>Federal, provincial and territorial governments have agreed to address 
in a co-operative way the problems of low-income families with children. 
Together we are now building the comprehensive and effective National 
Child Benefit System. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government has already demonstrated its initial commitment to this 
project by increasing its contribution to the Canada Child Tax Benefit 
by $850 million a year, with higher payments to families beginning July 
1, 1998. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government will work with its provincial and territorial partners to 
establish jointly a common timetable for increasing the federal 
contribution to the Canada Child Tax Benefit by at least an additional 
$850 million during the course of this mandate. The Government will also 
work with the provinces and territories to establish the National 
Re-Investment Framework to guide the re-allocation of our partners' 
savings into new services and benefits for low-income families with 
children. 
</I></P><P align=left>We can make a difference in the lives of all our children. Children need 
a substantial investment of time and attention for healthy development; 
they need strong families; they need safe, supportive communities. The 
federal, provincial and territorial governments agreed in January 1997 
to work together to develop the National Children's Agenda, a 
comprehensive strategy to improve the well-being of Canada's children. 
</I></P><P align=left>Federal, provincial and territorial governments will work together to 
develop this broader agenda for children, including clear outcome 
measures by which to gauge success. As part of this national agenda, the 
federal government will undertake three new initiatives: 
</I></P><P align=left>It will establish Centres of Excellence to deepen our understanding of 
children's development and well-being and to improve our ability to 
respond to their needs. 
</I></P><P align=left>It will expand our Aboriginal Head Start program onto reserves to 
ensure that all Aboriginal children have the opportunity to get a good 
start in life. 
</I></P><P align=left>It will measure and report regularly on the readiness of Canadian 
children to learn, so that we can assess our progress in providing our 
children with the best possible start. 
</I></P><P align=left>Investing in Quality Care and Good Health 
</I></P><P align=left>For decades, the Canadian health care system has been a source of pride 
for Canadians: it reflects the fundamental values that Canadians most 
cherish. Our publicly financed system of health care is recognized at 
home and abroad as simply the best in the world. 
</I></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, there is an increasing anxiety among Canadians about the 
present state and the future of our medicare system. Citizens worry 
about whether they will have access to the highest possible quality of 
health care when they need it. The anxiety arises from a number of 
sources, including the pace and extent of restructuring that has gone on 
in recent years. 
</I></P><P align=left>The federal government recognizes that this restructuring has been 
difficult for Canadians and, therefore, it will increase health care 
funding to the provinces from previously budgeted levels. It will 
introduce legislation to increase to $12.5 billion a year the guaranteed 
annual cash payments to provinces and territories under the Canada 
Health and Social Transfer. 
</I></P><P align=left>One of our goals as a country must be to continue providing all our 
citizens with access to the highest possible quality of health care and 
the other tools they will need to enjoy healthy lives as we move into 
the 21st century. Canadians have a right to expect their governments to 
work together in harmony to better meet the shared goals and desires of 
Canadians for a better health system. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government is firmly committed to a publicly administered, 
comprehensive health care system that provides universal access to high 
quality care for Canadians anywhere in the country. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government has a leadership role in preserving and enhancing 
medicare. It has a constructive role to play as a partner with provinces 
and other interested parties. The Government will play that role in a 
spirit of openness, pragmatism and innovation. There are steps that we 
can and will take to lead the efforts by all governments. 
</I></P><P align=left>Preparing Canada for the 21st century means ensuring the medicare system 
meets the needs of the future. It means responding to emerging issues in 
health care. Working with its partners, the Government will undertake 
the following initiatives: 
</I></P><P align=left>It will take measures to support Canadians in responding to the 
expanding needs for home care and community care. 
</I></P><P align=left>It will develop a national plan, timetable and a fiscal framework for 
providing Canadians with better access to medically necessary drugs. 
</I></P><P align=left>It will improve the quality and effectiveness of health services across 
Canada by establishing the Health Transition Fund to help the provincial 
governments innovate in the areas of primary care and provide more 
integration in the delivery of health services, home care and 
pharmacare. 
</I></P><P align=left>Canadians recognize that good health depends on much more than medical 
care. Our social and economic situations also help to determine the 
quality of our health. As a country, we must increase our efforts to 
promote healthy lives. The Government will contribute to this goal with 
an agenda to promote good health. Emphasis will also be placed on those 
factors that determine the health of a country's population, including 
the equality of economic and social opportunity for all citizens. 
</I></P><P align=left>Some of the most urgent health problems today are found in Aboriginal 
communities. The Government will work with other partners and Aboriginal 
communities to develop new initiatives to address the rapid increase in tuberculosis 
and diabetes in Aboriginal communities; and enhance research and dissemination of health information focussed on 
the needs of Aboriginal people through a new Aboriginal Health 
Institute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To fulfil other pressing health needs, the Government will expand the 
Canadian breast cancer initiative, renew the national HIV-AIDS strategy; 
and double the resources for the tobacco reduction strategy, with a 
particular focus on community-based programs to prevent young Canadians 
from starting to smoke and to encourage smokers to quit. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government will work with its provincial partners and other 
interested parties to improve Canadian health information systems to 
improve decision making about health and health care across the country. 
</I></P><P align=left>Building Safer Communities 
</I></P><P align=left>Safe communities are among the hallmarks of our Canadian identity. While 
the reported crime rate has decreased for four consecutive years, it is 
still too high. The Government is committed to ensuring that Canada 
remains a place where Canadians feel secure in their homes and on the 
streets of their communities. A safe society depends on strong crime 
prevention efforts as well as traditional legal responses. Governments 
around the world are developing community-based crime prevention 
programs. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government will help protect the right of all Canadians to feel safe 
in their communities by working with other governments, the private 
sector and voluntary groups. It will increase funding for community-based crime-prevention initiatives to 
$30 million per year; develop alternatives to incarceration for low-risk, non-violent 
offenders, such as sentencing reforms, community diversion programs, and 
alternative sanctions; and integrate information systems of all partners in the criminal justice 
system. 
</I></P><P align=left>Creating Opportunity for Young Canadians 
</I></P><P align=left>Today's generation of young Canadians is the best educated in our 
history. Young Canadians are living in a country well-positioned for 
opportunities in the new economy. Yet, the level of unemployment among 
Canadians between the ages of 18 and 25 is unacceptably high. The 
federal, provincial and territorial governments will act to address this 
problem, and First Ministers and territorial leaders will be working on 
this issue when they meet this fall. 
</I></P><P align=left>To secure our future as a society, our immediate challenge is to make 
sure that our young generation makes a successful transition to the 
world of work, that young people who want to continue to learn have 
access to education, and that young people who found it difficult 
getting started in the workplace get a second chance. 
</I></P><P align=left>All Canadians have a stake in meeting this challenge successfully. No 
single sector of society nor any one level of government has all the 
answers. We must all contribute, each in our areas of competency, to 
meet the challenge we have set for ourselves. The Government welcomes 
the action being taken by the private sector, through initiatives such 
as Career Edge and the Corporate Council on Youth in the Economy, and 
encourages the private sector to do more. The Government is committed to 
work with other governments, the private sector, communities and 
individual Canadians to help equip young people for the future. 
</I></P><P align=left>An important role for governments is to ensure the widest possible 
access to post-secondary education. Canadians are concerned about the 
increasing cost of higher education, and the resulting debt burden on 
students. The Government took some important measures to address this 
problem in its budget of February 1997. The Government will continue to 
reduce barriers to post-secondary education through further changes to 
the Canada Student Loans Program, increased assistance for students with 
dependents, and new scholarships to encourage excellence and to help 
low- and moderate-income Canadians attend university or college. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government finds it unacceptable that thousands of jobs are going 
unfilled in high-growth sectors of our economy at the same time as young 
Canadians are unemployed. The Government will work with the provinces, 
universities and colleges, the high-tech industry and other rapidly 
growing sectors to better forecast the number and types of jobs that 
will be available and to develop a plan for ensuring that people are 
appropriately educated to fill them. 
</I></P><P align=left>Three factors make a significant difference to young people getting 
started in the world of work—a good education, a chance at a first 
job, and a mentor to work with as they establish themselves. The 
Government will increase its resources devoted to helping youth to make 
a smooth and productive entry into the world of work. Internship 
programs have been particularly successful in helping young people get 
started. These programs will be extended and expanded. Enhanced funding 
of student summer placements will be continued. In partnership with 
provincial governments and the private sector, a Canada-wide mentorship 
program will be developed. 
</I></P><P align=left>To help those young Canadians who need a second chance, the Government 
will develop and expand community-based programs for youth with the 
greatest difficulty making the transition to the world of work because 
of low education and skills. These will include establishing 
multi-purpose Aboriginal youth centres that will provide targeted social 
and cultural support in addition to increasing work and learning 
opportunities for urban Aboriginal youth. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government will continue to support efforts of individuals, 
communities and other governments to improve Canadians' capacity to 
learn throughout their lives. 
</I></P><P align=left>Investing in Knowledge and Creativity 
</I></P><P align=left>The revolution in the knowledge and information economy is transforming 
all sectors of the economy from primary resources to service industries. 
Canada is well-positioned to be a world leader in the global 
knowledge-based economy of the 21st century. We have the talent, we have 
the resources, we have the technology, and we have the institutions. 
</I></P><P align=left>By rising to the challenge of mobilizing our resources well, we can 
enable our citizens to succeed in the global knowledge-based economy. 
This is how we will spur continuing job creation and sustained growth in 
our standard of living in the 21st century. The Government is determined 
to do more to support innovation and risk-taking in Canada and to 
attract more foreign investment in knowledge-based industries to Canada. 
We will build creative partnerships between the private and public 
sectors to accelerate the adoption of innovative technologies in all 
sectors of the economy. 
</I></P><P align=left>With targeted growth strategies, we will build those knowledge-intensive 
sectors where we are strong and where the opportunities for growth and 
global leadership is highest. Examples are aerospace; 
bio-pharmaceuticals; bio-technology in agriculture and fisheries; and 
the environmental, information, and telecommunications technologies. In 
particular, the Government will significantly increase the resources 
allocated to help small and medium-size businesses develop and 
commercialize new technology. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government will explore innovative policies and measures that give 
particular attention to increasing opportunity for Canadians in rural 
communities. It will adapt its programs to reflect the social and 
economic realities of rural Canada. Further, the Government will 
redouble its efforts to ensure that rural communities and all regions of 
Canada share in the economic benefits of the global knowledge-based 
economy. 
</I></P><P align=left>Governments have a crucial role to play in supporting science, 
technology, and the creation of knowledge. The Government of Canada's 
endowment of the Canada Foundation for Innovation in partnership with 
the private sector, the provinces and universities, is helping to build 
a leading-edge national system of innovation. All levels of government 
must do more to provide public support for research done in our 
universities. 
</I></P><P align=left>Support for knowledge goes beyond support for university research. 
Increasing support for the arts makes it possible for Canadian culture 
to reach audiences at home and abroad. Our movies, books, magazines, 
plays, videos, music, and multi-media productions speak to us about our 
experiences at the same time as they present Canadian creativity to the 
world. Therefore, the Government of Canada will provide increased 
support to the Canada Council and will make special efforts to support 
culture at home and to promote trade in Canadian cultural and 
educational products and services abroad. 
</I></P><P align=left>We will make the information and knowledge infrastructure accessible to 
all Canadians by the year 2000, thereby making Canada the most connected 
nation in the world. This will provide individuals, schools, libraries, 
small and large businesses, rural and Aboriginal communities, public 
institutions, and all levels of government with new opportunities for 
learning, interacting, transacting business and developing their social 
and economic potential. For example, we will enhance the voluntary 
sector's capacity to engage Canadians by improving their access to the 
technology they need to play a stronger role in Canadian life. 
</I></P><P align=left>A connected nation is more than wires, cables and computers. It is a 
nation in which citizens have access to the skills and knowledge they 
need to benefit from Canada's rapidly changing knowledge and information 
infrastructure. It is also a nation whose people are connected to each 
other. The Government will continue to work with provinces to ensure 
greater mobility for people with disabilities and to ensure their 
integration into the economic and social mainstream of Canadian life. 
The Government will also bring forward measures to strengthen networks 
among Canadians and to increase knowledge of Canada and understanding 
among Canadians; these measures will include enhanced exchange programs 
for young Canadians. 
</I></P><P align=left>Expanding Opportunities in Aboriginal Communities 
</I></P><P align=left>Thousands of years ago, Aboriginal people began building Canada's first 
communities. Today, by strengthening our Aboriginal communities, we are 
reinforcing the diversity that makes Canada unique in the world. The 
Government will 
</I></P><P align=left>develop relationships with Aboriginal people based on the principles of 
partnership, transparency, predictability and accountability; 
</I></P><P align=left>support the building of strong Aboriginal communities—communities 
that provide their members with better living standards and 
opportunities; and 
</I></P><P align=left>strengthen the capacity for good government in Aboriginal communities. 
</I></P><P align=left>To contribute, the Government of Canada is committed to respond to the 
Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples as soon as 
possible. 
</I></P><P align=left>Looking Outward 
</I></P><P align=left>Our country has a tradition of being a responsible, engaged, committed 
world citizen. This is a key characteristic of our national identity and 
a source of pride to Canadians. Canada is a force for peace and 
understanding around the world, for bridging differences, and for 
finding common ground. Canada espouses the common humanity that binds 
together the human family. 
</I></P><P align=left>This tradition is the legacy of Nobel laureate and former prime minister 
of Canada, Lester Pearson, whose 100th birthday we mark this year. 
Canadians want their government to carry on this tradition and give it 
new relevance as the world enters a new century. 
</I></P><P align=left>Nothing better illustrates the ongoing commitment to this tradition than 
Canada's leadership since 1994 in the international effort to ban 
anti-personnel mines. This Canadian initiative has evolved from a bold 
idea to be the focus of a large and growing international consensus that 
will culminate in the signing of an international treaty in Ottawa in 
December of this year. 
</I></P><P align=left>Canada's rich and diverse natural heritage is also a source of national 
pride and international acclaim. Canadians are both the beneficiaries 
and the stewards of a land that holds 9% of the Earth's fresh 
water, 10% of its forests, and 25% of its wetlands. 
</I></P><P align=left>Canadians both delight in our magnificent environment and fear for its 
future. Maintaining what is good, and improving what has been degraded, 
requires constant effort. It is an effort that the Government will make. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government is committed to working in the international community to 
promote sustainable development and to achieve practical solutions to 
global environmental problems, such as greenhouse gas emissions and 
toxic chemicals. It will also continue to address the serious 
international problem of over-fishing. It is committed to acting at home 
to reduce our contribution to these problems. 
</I></P><P align=left>In this same Canadian tradition of internationalism, the Government will 
undertake the following initiatives: 
</I></P><P align=left>It will promote Canadian values on the world stage by co-operating with 
like-minded countries to revitalize the United Nations and 
other key multilateral institutions. It will work directly with other 
countries to enhance and promote human rights, peace building and 
democracy. 
</I></P><P align=left>It will destroy the Department of National Defence's stock of land 
mines, in advance of the signing of the Ottawa Treaty in December, to 
continue its leadership and illustrate its commitment to a global ban. 
And Canada will continue to work toward an accompanying international 
strategy to help land mine victims recover and civilian populations 
reclaim their land from these mines. 
</I></P><P align=left>It will continue to move forward with reforms to the Canadian military. 
</I></P><P align=left>It will continue its campaign for liberalized trade. Breaking down 
trade barriers, both within Canada and around the world, helps ensure 
markets for Canadian goods and services and provides the best 
opportunity for greater prosperity. 
</I></P><P align=left>Celebrating the Millennium 
</I></P><P align=left>For Canadians, the start of the new millennium represents an historic 
opportunity to celebrate our achievements as a nation and our hopes for 
the future. It will be an unequalled opportunity to show ourselves and 
the world the richness of our diversity, the strength of Canadian 
values, and the great promise of our future in the 21st century. 
</I></P><P align=left>The Government will help build a partnership among governments, 
communities and citizens to mark the new millennium. Many Canadians have 
creative ideas and suggestions for millennium projects. There will also 
be an opportunity for parliamentarians from all parties to participate 
in developing ideas to mark the millennium. 
</I></P><P align=left>Moving Forward into the 21st Century 
</I></P><P align=left>Almost 100 years ago, Sir Wilfrid Laurier said, “The 20th century shall 
be the century of Canada and of Canadian development.” He was right. 
Today, we have the opportunity for success in the 21st century that is 
far beyond what Laurier could have ever imagined. 
</I></P><P align=left>To achieve this success we have more work to do—work that no one can 
do alone. Each and every one of us must assume personal responsibility 
for our community and our country. Our greatest responsibility is to 
build a new spirit of sharing and mutual respect for a new century. 
</I></P><P align=left>By working together, by respecting the value of our diversity, we will 
secure our future and build a stronger country. We will ensure that our 
future economic opportunities are sound, our children well prepared, our 
lives healthy, and our communities strong. 
</I></P><P align=left>Each generation has the opportunity to choose the society it wants to 
leave for its children. The greatest legacy we can leave to our children 
in the new millennium is a vibrant living legacy that will make Canada a 
better place: a stronger country with a brighter future and greater 
opportunities for its young people. By working together, we will build 
that future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a very great privilege and an honour that has been

to the Speech from the Throne. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the Prime Minister and the government for the 
honour they have bestowed on the people of Parkdale—High Park with 
their motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<I am a first generation Canadian, a child of eastern European 
immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the people of Parkdale—High Park who have 
placed their trust and confidence in me to represent their 
interests in the House of Commons.  As their member I vow to work 
with my colleagues and in partnership with the private and 
non-profit sectors to address the challenges which we face today 
and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to especially acknowledge and thank my hon. 
predecessor Mr. Jesse Flis who represented the riding of 
Parkdale—High Park for over 14 years.  I would like to thank him 
for the legacy he has left in the riding.  Mr. Flis, we salute, 
thank and applaud you. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Parkdale—High Park, a microcosm of Canada, is one of 
the most culturally and economically diverse ridings in this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very united riding, a riding that takes strength from 
its diversity and its sense of community, a riding which is 
exemplary of what can be accomplished through community based 
activities and initiatives, a riding that shows that diversity 
does not equate to disunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that fostering partnerships is a key to addressing the 
issues and challenges which we will face today and in the future. 
In that context I would like to address three issues: job 
creation, the development of safe and prosperous communities, and 
the importance of the arts in articulating Canada's identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its previous mandate this government committed to Canadians 
that it would ensure its strong economic fundamentals would be in 
place in order to promote economic recovery and job creation. The 
Prime Minister and his government have been successful at meeting 
and surpassing their targets of deficit reduction.  The 
government predicts that we shall see the deficit eliminated well 
prior to the end of this mandate. I commend my colleagues on 
their achievements. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our purpose must now be to take advantage of a vigorous economy and 
create jobs. In my opinion, the government has a duty to ease job 
creation by promoting the kind of economic environment we need and by 
nurturing partnerships with the private and non-profit sectors. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has completed the first task. The 
Minister of Industry and his colleagues are now responding to the 
second task with their jobs strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect of the jobs strategy is to target youth employment. 
As the mother of three children I commend the government for the 
initiative it has recently undertaken with the announcement of 
the youth internship program.  This program is a partnership 
combining the efforts of the federal government, the YMCA, and 
Career Edge, the non-profit agency developed by 100 Canadian 
corporations to promote youth employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of Canada's chartered banks has recently undertaken a 
comprehensive national study of the attitudes of Canada's nexus 
generation who are young people between the ages of 18 and 35. 
This study reveals that this group is much more entrepreneurial 
and positive than usually depicted.  One-third of nexus 
respondents stated that their most desirable profession was 
entrepreneur, suggesting that young Canadians are determined to 
turn their innovative ideas into business realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to this, it is my belief that government does not create 
jobs, the private sector does.  In Canada over the last three 
years 70 per cent to 80 per cent of new jobs were created by small and medium 
size businesses.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business needs access to capital, trade and technology. 
Government can help small business by encouraging banks, 
including the Business Development Bank of Canada, to lend money 
to these entrepreneurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, government can support small business by arranging 
trade missions such as the successful team Canada initiatives and 
the November trade mission to Washington for women business 
owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women-owned businesses are a significant sector of our economy. 
As a founding member of the Women Entrepreneurs of Canada, I know 
first hand about the strength of women-owned businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the recent Women Leaders' Network for APEC Economies held in 
Ottawa, it was noted that 700,000 companies in Canada are owned 
by women and that they employ 1.7 million people, which is 
greater than the <I>Canadian Business</I> top 100 companies.  They 
are also creating jobs at a rate four times the national average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private trade missions should be encouraged. Organizations such 
as Les Femmes Chefs d'Entreprises Mondiales are vehicles through 
which private citizens can act as goodwill ambassadors and 
introduce Canadian products and services to other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August I held job creation focus groups with business people, 
community leaders and residents in Parkdale—High Park.  I also 
met with leaders from the arts community and Women Entrepreneurs 
of Canada.  Several critical points emerged from these 
discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was emphasized that it was important to support small 
business and to reduce the amount of official paperwork and red 
tape that is required for the functioning of a small business. 
Further, I was told about the real importance of developing 
strong community structures such as co-operative business 
development and the need to continue spending dollars on 
infrastructure which brings new technologies such as fibre optic 
cable and ISDN connections to the community. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although supporting technology is of primary importance, we must 
acknowledge there is a need for a healthy environment as well as 
excellent basic facilities such as skating rinks, parks and community 
centres. A strong and prosperous community is safe and a safe community 
will be strong and thriving. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Parkdale—High Park just last month the Parkdale Community 
Watch won the distinguished 1997 International Society of Crime 
Prevention Practitioners community based program of the year 
award.  This award acknowledges the success and initiative that 
Parkdale residents have taken toward combating crime in their 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government recognizes the importance of these initiatives 
as evidenced by the recent announcement by the Minister of 
Justice that $150 million will be allocated over the next five 
years to foster such community based programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creating partnerships with communities is essential. The value 
of community impact statements must be acknowledged, particularly 
in the case of alleged victimless crimes such as drugs and 
prostitution where the impact on the community is significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consideration must be given to the imposition of more minimum 
sentences, allowing communities access to the briefing of federal 
judges and passing legislation to require the proceeds of crime 
to be reinvested into those communities affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents strongly believe that health and justice must 
work together in partnership with communities not only to fight 
crime but to fight the causes of crime. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young offenders are one of the greatest tragedies of crime. 
Victims of crime are not alone in feeling their loss, society too 
experiences a loss—that of the potential of a young life.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must redouble our efforts to rehabilitate young offenders 
and provide whatever support it takes to discourage repeat 
offenders.  We must, however, ensure that, in the case of violent 
young offenders, the needs and demands of the public form part of 
vigorous measures taken to protect society. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a lawyer I applaud the Minister of Justice on her commitment 
to work with her provincial colleagues to reform the justice 
system in such a way as to better acknowledge the voice of all 
victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to address one area about which I am 
particularly passionate, the arts in Canada.  As the former 
volunteer chair of one of Canada's foremost arts organizations I 
believe we must invest in programs, opportunities and 
partnerships which support our culture.  This is one of our 
greatest responsibilities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A country's real strength lies in its people.  The arts and 
the culture of a people are the expressions of its heart and soul. 
It is the movies, television, music, painting, dance and theatre 
that enable Canadians to laugh, talk and cry together.  Through 
them we can express our identity and our similarities and 
differences. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in investment, in investing in the development of 
original Canadian artistic product.  Without our own product, 
without our own voices, without a generation that shares our 
vision to keep our culture alive and meaningful, Canada will have 
no legacy.  Without this we will never get that opportunity to 
see our hopes and dreams reflected.  Instead we will have to 
watch and live vicariously through others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will hear me speak in Parliament about the arts industry 
because I believe it is just that, an industry.  When we start 
looking at it that way some surprising things turn up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cultural sector represents a significant part of the 
Canadian economy.  The cultural sector contributes $25 billion to 
Canada's gross domestic product.  This means 900,000 jobs or 6.9 
per cent of total employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year Canadians spent over $2.9 billion on arts events and 
products.  For every dollar that the federal government has 
invested in the arts industry ten dollars of economic activity 
has been generated, an excellent rate of return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These numbers do not even acknowledge the spin off effect the 
culture also brings to our economy.  “The House of Martin 
Guerre” a critically acclaimed production by Canadian composer 
Leslie Arden, brings people not only to the Canadian Stage 
Company but also to the restaurants, bars and hotels nearby. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, the arts play a leading role in enabling Canadians to 
define themselves in relation to one another and to the rest of the 
world. If we want a strong national identity, we must ensure that 
control over our cultural institutions, publishing houses, radio and 
television networks and film productions rests with us. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government believes that we should balance spending 
in this sector with a plan to invest in the future of Canadian 
culture.  Artists and arts organizations will play a major role 
in determining how Canadians see themselves in 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arts are on the cutting edge of the development of new 
communications and new technologies which will play a major role 
in not only the economic prosperity of Canada but in the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should remember that the arts industry's sustenance and growth 
and the commensurate benefit to government revenues and Canadian 
society can be assisted by the Government of Canada without 
increasing the federal debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the federal government's commitment to cultural 
organizations such as the Canadian Publishing Development 
Corporation and the Canada Council for the Arts, which is 
celebrating its 40th anniversary.  The creation of the Canada 
television and cable production fund has supported the creation 
of excellent Canadian programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should acknowledge the unique and important voice that the 
CBC provides to Canadian culture and Canadian life.  We must 
continue to ensure the long term health of Canada and at the same 
time we should make sure we put in place partnerships to ensure 
that Canada's arts organizations and artists have a chance to 
continue to promote and develop the ideas, hopes and aspirations 
of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come to show the world that Canada has writers, 
artists, directors and performers second to none, and that we can 
develop artistic endeavours here in Canada which will be produced 
all over the world. Canada as an exporter of Canadian cultural 
products and not an importer?  I say welcome to the new 
millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members we have all been entrusted with an important 
responsibility, that of giving political leadership to Canada as 
we move into challenging times.  While we may not all agree on 
the policy steps required, we do all commit to serving the best 
interests of our country.  It is this difference of opinion that 
divides us into five parties and which will lead to spirited 
debate in this Parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debates are at the heart of parliamentary democracy, where it is

Government of Canada.  I vow to facilitate a true partnership 
among all Canadians toward making Canada an even greater country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to pay 
tribute to His Excellency the Governor General, Mr. Roméo LeBlanc, and 
to thank him for giving the throne speech before both Houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, on being 
re-elected to the Chair.  We feel, and you have demonstrated to us, that 
you have all the qualities required for the important job of directing 
the work of the House. 
I would also like to thank the Prime Minister, who honoured me by 
asking me to move the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I would like to congratulate all my colleagues on 
being elected to office.  Representing one's constituents well is no 
small challenge and I know that each of us, with God's help, will carry 
out our duties conscientiously, with respect for the institutions we 
serve and, of course, for the citizens of our country, Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the wonderful riding of Beauce.  I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank all my constituents for the very great honour 
they have bestowed on me by electing me to represent them in the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our riding, the cradle of small and medium size enterprise and 
entrepreneurship, is located in the Chaudière-Appalaches region, in 
southern Quebec just across the border from the United States.  It is my 
fortune to represent one of the most beautiful regions in the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economy is made up of businesses working in very diversified 
sectors. 
From agriculture and forestry to manufacturing and the service 
industries, each sector is well represented in our economy.  And let us 
not forget our excellent maple syrup, a favourite with everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our region boasts several well known enterprises.  It is thanks to 
names like Dutil, Lacroix, Pomerleau, Poulin, Vachon, and the list goes 
on, that our region is seen as an economic leader and envied by all.  It 
is because of these enterprises that it has often been said that the 
Beauce region is the kingdom of SMBs.  The Beauce region, along with the 
Chaudière-Appalaches region, has one of the lowest unemployment rates in 
Quebec, 6.1 per cent in August of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What sets our region apart from others is that when we have a 
problem, we look for a solution, not a culprit. 
Instead of going over old ground when it was elected to office on 
October 25, 1993, the Liberal government helped put an end to the 
crisis.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, after four years of Liberal government, Canada's economic 
performance is one of the best among the G-7 industrial nations, 
and the future looks even more promising. That is why Canadians 
can look forward with great hope to the future. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the time of its first election in October 1993, the 
Liberal government has made job creation its top priority.  Since 
then, close to a million jobs have been created in the country, and 
the unemployment rate has dropped from 11.2 to 9%. The 
Liberal government's re-election will ensure that the policies 
responsible for revitalizing the economy will be continued.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In its Employment Strategy, the Liberal government has put 
public finances back on a sound footing, starting by addressing the 
problem of the huge deficits inherited from past governments.  It 
has reduced the deficit from $42 billion to under $14 billion. 
This is a remarkable drop, over $28 billion in four years, or a 
reduction of over 70 percent.  The Liberal government is committed 
to continuing along this same path, with a view to attaining a zero 
deficit by 1998-99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This good management has made it possible to keep interest and 
inflation rates at their lowest.  These rates, moreover, help 
businesses to invest and to create jobs, which encourages purchases 
of major consumer goods. 
Once the budget is balanced, half of each billion dollar budgetary 
surplus will be used to cut taxes and reduce the debt.  The other 
half will be invested in important social and economic programs, 
including job creation initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government believes in young people.  It invests annually 
in programs that enable young Canadians to acquire the knowledge 
and experience they need to get their careers off to a good start. 
In addition, it recently announced the youth internship program in 
the federal public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's priorities are first and foremost employment, 
improved public finances and Canadian unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past 130 years, Canada's achievements have earned this 
country the admiration of the whole world. 
In fact, according to the United Nations, Canada happens to provide the 
best quality of life of any country in the world. We have reached this 
level of excellence largely thanks to the values of equality and 
diversity which we hold dear. To preserve and improve our federation is 
to preserve and improve the way we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has demonstrated the flexibility and vigour 
of Canadian federalism. This same government has put forward new 
strategies for getting rid of duplication among levels of government, 
while showing greater respect for the jurisdictions set forth in the 
Constitution. The manpower agreement, for instance, is an example of our 
government's desire for a modern federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the provinces, we have also reached an agreement on 
environmental harmonization. We have withdrawn from programs of direct 
involvement in mining and forestry development and have suggested 
transferring management of social housing to the provinces. 
Finally, we suggested introducing federal-provincial mechanisms to deal 
with securities, food inspection and revenue collection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of a new federalism will continue to guide our 
actions during the government's present mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year, more than 300,000 Canadians learn French, in a country 
that should be proud of its two languages and two cultures. I am proud 
to be part of this beautiful country we call Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an honour and a privilege for me, as the new elected member 
for Beauce, to second the motion on the address in reply to the Speech 
from the Throne moved by the hon. member for Parkdale—High Park.
