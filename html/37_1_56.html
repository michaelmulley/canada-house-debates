<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-287, an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act (genetically 
modified food), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the bill is in favour of mandatory 
labelling of genetically modified foods in Canada, and for, 
understandably, good reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let me say that the debate today is timely.  Just last 
week Ottawa hosted a meeting of the Codex Alimentarius 
Commission's Committee on Food Labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month Canada signed a biosafety protocol to regulate the 
trade on living modified organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the European Union, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, 
South Korea and others are developing or implementing legislation 
requiring mandatory labelling on genetically modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Against this background, the issue of labelling genetically 
modified foods requires urgent attention because Canada's 
domestic labelling policy has implications for people, for 
international trade and for Canada's compliance with 
international agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain.  Members of the House, either through media or 
from letters, have been made aware of growing concerns over the 
pervasive presence of genetically modified foods in the food 
chain.  There is definitely a lack of public confidence due in 
good part to having been kept in the dark, beginning with the 
fact that the public does not know which foods are genetically 
modified and which are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the purpose of the bill?  Members of the House have 
probably receive all sorts arguments against the mandatory 
labelling of genetically modified foods.  I urge hon. members to 
keep in mind that this is not a complex, scientific nor technical 
issue.  It simply comes down to the fundamental right of people 
to know. Canadians want to know what is in their food.  It is as 
basic as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is a mandatory labelling system feasible?  Let me describe the 
key features of C-287 with respect to feasibility and reliability 
of a mandatory labelling system for GM foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are genetically modified foods?  There is confusion 
surrounding which foods should be labelled.  Should foods that 
are the result of traditional breeding be labelled?  The answer 
is, no.  The confusion arises from the fact that genetically 
modified foods in Canada fall under the broad definition of novel 
foods in the Food and Drugs Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contrast, international agreements are clear on that issue. 
As a result, members will find in Bill C-287 that genetically 
modified food is defined in accordance with the Cartagena 
protocol on biosafety.  This protocol has been signed by Canada. 
Consequently, the labelling would apply only to food or food 
ingredients that contain genetic material obtained through the 
use of modern biotechnology.  Nothing more, nothing less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having clearly defined GM foods, the bill aims at ensuring that 
the genetic history of a food or food ingredient be recorded and 
traced through all stages of production, distribution, 
manufacture, packaging and sale.  This is the only way to ensure 
the integrity of the documentation trail, to provide accurate 
labelling and prevent incorrectly labelled material from reaching 
the consumer.  The result of the documentation trail is that no 
person can sell genetically modified foods unless it is labelled 
“This food is genetically modified”.  Foods that have not been 
genetically modified do not need to bear this label. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposed system does not prevent a vendor from voluntarily 
applying a label describing the food as genetically modified 
free, if that is the case.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why mandatory labelling?  Opponents to mandatory labelling of 
genetically modified foods often refer to the process set up by 
the Canadian Council of Grocery Distributors under the auspices 
of the Canadian General Standard Board.  They form the committee 
called, and I quote, “The Committee on the voluntary labelling 
of foods obtained or not obtained through genetic engineering”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably, there has never been a consultation through this 
committee on whether to proceed with a mandatory or a voluntary 
labelling system for genetically modified foods.  The committee 
on voluntary labelling was struck to work only on a voluntary 
standard for labelling on genetically modified food.  I submit 
that such a voluntary system offers no guarantee that all foods 
containing genetically modified material will be labelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under a voluntary labelling system, some foods may be labelled 
and others may not be.  This would be confusing and deceptive to 
consumers who want to know what they eat.  Separation and 
tracking of genetically modified foods in our food system, as 
proposed in the bill, are essential features to providing 
consumers with accurate information.  This accuracy cannot be 
achieved with a voluntary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, a voluntary labelling system cannot offer any 
guarantee of the genetic integrity of experts to our trading 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee on voluntary labelling is currently contemplating 
a voluntary labelling system with four different labels: 
genetically engineered, genetically modified, non-genetically 
modified and non-genetically engineered.  This is utterly 
confusing to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-287 would put in place a simple mandatory label stating 
“this food is genetically modified”, or “this food contains an 
ingredient that is genetically modified”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee on voluntary labelling has had eight meetings 
since November 1999.  It may be meeting for a long time before it 
can reach consensus on a standard for voluntary labelling.  In 
the meantime, Canadian consumers and trading partners are kept 
waiting and will continue not to be informed about the content of 
the food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also mention this very important fact about voluntary 
labelling.  It is already possible under the Food and Drugs Act 
to identify biotechnology products under certain conditions.  In 
fact, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency states “Consumer 
choice can already be accommodated through Canadian legislation 
via voluntary labelling companies”.  Yet, although it is 
currently permitted under the law, food companies have not seen 
the necessity to label their products containing genetically 
modified ingredients.  Hence the need for a mandatory labelling 
system requiring companies to inform Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a final note on the voluntary labelling committee.  I 
believe industry sponsored, closed processes are inappropriate 
for dealing with an issue as important as food safety and the 
right to know what we eat.  Such debate belongs here, in 
parliament, and this is one of the reasons for bringing Bill 
C-287 before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a few words about the advantages of tracing 
genetically modified food and of labelling.  A mandatory 
labelling system would make available crucially needed 
information.  It would indicate where genetically modified foods 
can be found in the food chain, something we are not sure of at 
this moment.  Scientists and medical professionals have 
frequently made that request.  Let me quote from a statement last 
year by the British Medical Association: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Genetically modified foodstuffs should be segregated at source, 
to enable identification and traceability of genetically modified 
products.  This is important as there are considerable doubts 
about the behaviour of GMOS once they are released into the 
environment, and this will also facilitate monitoring in the 
interests of public health.  It is unacceptable that at present 
some GM and non-GM products are mixed at source, and are not 
adequately labelled. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite a firm statement by a medical source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Canadian policy is to limit labelling where there 
are proven health or safety concerns. 
However, how can potential long term health effects that may 
arise from the consumption of genetically modified foods be 
proven a priori in advance? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-287 at least we address this question by mandating the 
Minister of Health to use information provided by the labelling 
system and conduct research into the possible long term effects 
of the consumption of genetically modified food on health.  This 
approach is consistent with the precautionary principle, which 
Canada adhered to in 1992 at the Rio convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few words now about the loss of export markets.  Hon. 
members are being told it is not feasible, too costly and not in 
Canada's interest to label genetically modified foods.  This is 
not the case.  Mandatory labelling is necessary for trade and 
economic reasons.  Our farmers and agribusiness have already 
incurred costs as the result of the loss of export markets. 
Without a reliable system for separating genetically modified 
crops from non-genetically modified crops, we continue to lose 
export markets in countries that have banned genetically modified 
foods or require the labelling of genetically modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can no longer export canola to Europe.  We will soon not be 
able to export soya to Japan.  The Canadian Wheat Board is 
pleading with the Canadian regulatory agency not to approve 
genetically modified wheat for fear of losing export markets.  As 
a major agricultural producer and exporter of crops such as 
wheat, canola, corn and soya beans, Canada relies on their 
European market for export of agrifood products.  Canada cannot 
continue to lose markets because of an obsolete policy which is 
increasingly out of sync with the rest of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About the feasibility of separating GM crops and private sector 
initiatives in response to consumers' demands, this can be said. 
There is the argument that it is not feasible to separate GM 
crops from non-GM crops.  There are many initiatives by the 
private sector to the contrary.  For example, Casco Inc., a 
milling industry, announced in spring 1999 that in order to 
retain its European customers it would no longer be buying 
varieties of genetically modified corn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1999 the agribusiness company Archer Daniels 
Midland asked corn and soya bean suppliers to keep their 
genetically modified crops separate.  Then Commercial Alcohols 
Inc., Nacan, A.E. Stanley, McCain, Gerber baby foods and Seagram 
have joined the ranks of food processing companies that will not 
use genetically modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, members of the Prairie Oat Growers Association issued 
a news release stating that they do not favour the 
commercialization of any genetically modified oats until there is 
a clear market signal in consumer acceptance to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, the private sector is already responding to 
consumer demand by separating genetically modified crops from 
non-genetically modified crops so as to continue to supply to 
expanding markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that it is time for Canada to establish a system for 
separating genetically modified crops from non-genetically 
modified crops and go for a mandatory labelling system in keeping 
with market demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few words about farmers and genetically modified crops. 
Some will tell hon. members that genetically modified crops 
benefit farmers and are necessary for their survival.  Nothing 
could be further from the truth.  In fact the National Farmers 
Union adopted a new policy in December of last year which called 
for a moratorium on the production, importation, distribution and 
sale of genetically modified food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the policy, the farmers union speaks of markets in Europe, 
Japan and elsewhere that are closing and domestic markets that 
are being likewise threatened.  It states that closing markets 
and falling prices threaten to overwhelm any small, short term 
economic benefit genetically modified crops or livestock may 
offer.  The farmers union makes the very important point that the 
proliferation of some genetically modified crops has effectively 
deprived many organic farmers of the option to grow those crops. 
The National Farmers Union also states that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Food products which contain genetically modified ingredients must 
be subject to clear, consistent, mandatory labelling.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we need more evidence?  Is it not abundantly clear that the 
uncertainty surrounding genetically modified crops and the lack 
of public acceptance, the trend in foreign markets and domestic 
markets are real concerns? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, it seems to me the necessity of mandatory labelling 
is evident.  We cannot wear blinkers and pretend this is strictly 
an issue of our domestic regulatory system because it is not. The 
rest of the world has recognized the need for mandatory labelling 
of genetically modified foods and is moving ahead. Canada will be 
left behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reiterate the fact that mandatory labelling is a 
response to a basic right and that is that Canadians want to know 
what they eat.  Mandatory labelling is in Canada's economic 
interest.  Mandatory labelling corresponds to Canada's 
international commitments.  Mandatory labelling is relevant to 
human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opponents of labelling say there are already too many 
genetically modified foods on our store shelves to make labelling 
meaningful, that the horse is out of the barn and that it is too 
late to fix the stable door.  These arguments are weak.  The fact 
is that having invested so much in the diffusion of this 
technology we have an obligation, a clear interest and a 
responsibility to label.  Moreover, mandatory labelling would 
actually increase the public's acceptance of this technology.  It 
would remove the suspicion that there is something to hide. It 
would reduce the public's distrust in this technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, without mandatory labelling we would deny Canadians the 
fundamental right to know how the food they eat has been produced 
and to make an informed choice.  It that not the essence of 
democracy?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill C-287, which deals 
with mandatory labelling, as put forward by the member for 
Davenport, represents a personal interest of his.  I sat on the 
environment committee that he chaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is speaking on behalf of farmers and farm 
organizations.  The member should look at what the letters which 
received from the farm organizations actually state.  They do not 
support mandatory labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For quick reference, I will refer to a letter from the National 
Dairy Council of Canada addressed to the member for Davenport, 
which is also supported by corn and grain growers and other farm 
groups.  The essence of their letter was that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find it difficult to appreciate the need for mandatory 
labelling legislation at this time.  It is certainly not a food 
safety issue, as CFIA and Health Canada are reviewing stringently 
the safety of those products.  We doubt it can be a nutritional 
or allergy issue, either. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are also dealt with by the people who regulate our food 
safety in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do we have to look at the arguments put forward by the 
member for Davenport, we also look at the arguments of other 
players in this issue, including the many millions of Canadians 
who do not want mandatory labelling.  They want a voluntary 
labelling system that responds to their consumer demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that Bill C-287 acknowledges there is no safety risk to 
our food supplies.  Clause 7.1(1) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No person shall sell or offer for sale a food that contains more 
than one per cent of a genetically modified food. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to allow 1%, then we are consuming it.  The bill 
itself states that the food is safe.  The argument then gets down 
to why would we have mandatory labelling? 
It is due to a response that the member feels a significant 
number of consumers want it.  There are a significant number of 
consumers, people in agriculture in particular, who say that 
mandatory labelling is not required and let consumer demand, 
through the retailer and the wholesaler, make the case.  The 
consumers of course is spending the dollar, so if the demand is 
there the dollar will be spent on what the consumers wants.  If 
they are demanding mandatory labelling, they will say that they 
will not buy unlabelled food.  That is clearly not the case.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not be supporting Bill C-287 because it will implement 
the mandatory labelling, which is not the right approach for 
Canada.  The majority of farm organizations that I met with were 
not in favour of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that the Royal Society of Canada expert 
panel concluded in its report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The panel believes that strong government support for voluntary 
labels is an effective way of providing consumer input into these 
issues, and (the panel) encourages the Canadian regulatory 
agencies responsible to establish guidelines for the regulation 
of reliable, informative voluntary labels. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the essence of the argument.  There is no safety issue. 
The response to the consumer is the important thing.  I am a 
farmer; a cattle rancher.  I respond to the consumers and give 
them the products they want and for which they are willing to 
pay. That is the same with this labelling issue.  There is no 
reason to have mandatory labelling.  It should be left up to the 
consumer.  The Canadian Alliance policy refers to the fact that 
we support voluntary labelling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Lunney (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to also share in this time of debate. 
This is a very important issue.  I thank the hon. member for 
Davenport for bringing the matter before the House.  It is a 
matter of concern to a lot of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are the party of free votes, so members may find that some of 
my remarks will differ a little from my colleague for 
Selkirk—Interlake.  I would like to approach this from a health 
perspective since that is my primary concern and mandate on this 
side as deputy health critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin with a few remarks about basic biology and 
the adult human body.  We have a bunch of them in the House 
today.  An adult human being represents about 80 trillion to 100 
trillion cells.  We represent a fantastic organization.  If we 
think about it, there are 80 trillion to 100 trillion cells which 
are organized in about 200 different cell types in the body. They 
are very different.  Bone cells are different from cardiac cells. 
Liver cells are different from nerve cells.  Red blood cells 
are different from cartilage.  Yet amazingly they are all read 
the same blueprint.  The uniqueness that is expressed in us that 
makes us distinctly human is because of the blueprint, the DNA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The genome project recently made a milestone contribution to the 
understanding of how our diversity and our uniqueness is 
expressed.  It identified about 30,000 genes in a human being. 
The people were rather surprised because the humble fruit fly had 
about 13,000 genes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remarkable thing about the genome project was it found that 
as human beings we are remarkably alike, about 99.9% the same. 
Imagine there are about six billion people on the planet and as 
different as we are, genetically we are nearly the same.  It is 
that very small difference which accounts for all the differences 
we attribute and make such a big deal about between us as human 
beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a law in science called the law of biogenesis. 
Basically it says that when it comes to reproduction, every kind 
produces its own kind:  humans have humans; horses have horses; 
snakes make snakes; and flies make flies.  It is in the blueprint 
that we find this tremendous variation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By selective breeding, different traits or characteristics can 
be emphasized within any particular species.  An example is the 
tremendous variation found in canine species or even in 
selectively bred roses.  However, from the beginning of time the 
law of biogenesis has held true:  every kind brings forth its own 
kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically the development of improved crop characteristics 
has evolved in the same way as selective procedures found in 
other species, such as human, canine, butterflies and roses, 
selecting from the gene pool within the species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada's approach to date with genetically modified foods 
has been to say that food should be judged by the quality and 
nutritional value rather than how it was made.  What makes GM 
foods and GMOs different is that modern biotechnology has pressed 
beyond the marvellous gene pool that defines each species, with 
the intent of inserting a gene from a different species.  This is 
a major departure from what the world throughout the ages has 
known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are GM foods safe?  What are the long term effects of GM foods 
on human beings and on the environment?  Frankly, no one knows 
for sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might address the argument of substantial equivalence, that 
is, saying that a genetic change is so small that it does not 
change the outcome.  However, that argument is frankly not 
supported by an investigation done by the Royal Society, which 
looked into the matter at great length.  It rejects the concept 
of substantial equivalence as precautionary for the safety of 
these foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many concerns raised about genetically modified foods 
in terms of the biological implications.  When a novel gene is 
introduced the context is changed and the long term effects of 
that in regard to human illness have not been adequately studied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote the Royal Society, the panel said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a precautionary measure, the Panel recommends that the 
prospect of serious risks to human health, of extensive, 
irremediable disruptions to the natural ecosystems, or of serious 
diminution of biodiversity, demand that the best scientific 
methods be employed to reduce the uncertainties with respect to 
these risks.  Approval of products with these potentially serious 
risks should await the reduction of scientific uncertainty to 
minimum levels. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is my view that if we intend to introduce 
biological changes the world has never seen, we have an 
obligation to ensure that best science practices—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane Bourgeois (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-287, an act to amend 
the Food and Drugs Act (genetically modified food), which was 
introduced by the hon. member for Davenport and aims at making 
mandatory the labelling of all the food that is genetically 
modified or contains more than 1% of a genetically modified 
food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For almost three years now the Bloc Quebecois has been demanding 
mandatory labelling of genetically modified food and food 
products. In November 1999, the Bloc undertook a consultation 
and an information tour in all the regions of Quebec. This tour 
was a huge success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc also had a petition circulated that gathered close to 
50,000 signatures and was tabled in the 36th parliament by the 
then hon. member for Louis-Hébert, the former Bloc member who, I 
want to remind the House, rose dozens of times in the House to 
demand again and again the very same thing, the labelling of 
GM0s. 
Why? Because the Bloc Quebecois feels that each and every 
citizen has the right to know exactly what is in his or her 
plate. In spite of all the efforts the Bloc made in order to get 
this government to listen to the concerns of the population of 
Canada and Quebec, the federal Liberals turned a deaf ear on the 
demands made by the Bloc Quebecois, which are broadly supported 
by the population.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The single, and minimal, action taken by the government on GMOs 
was to strike committees to address the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>GMOs have been on the market for five years now, and at this 
time committees are looking at labelling standards.  Is this a 
really serious approach?  One might well ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, it is already predictable that these standards 
will be voluntary, and there is nothing to indicate that they 
will be adopted by companies not currently labelling GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps this government needs to be reminded of a few facts that 
seem to justify its laxness in the field of GMOs, since its 
position, essentially, like the major food industries, is that 
there is no proof that GMOs are harmful to health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This argument is correct, so far, of course, but that may be 
because there have been no studies on the medium and long term 
effects of GMOs on human and animal health, or on the flora and 
fauna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask this.  Can a responsible government treat such risks 
so lightly?  Of course not, particularly since we know that food 
products containing GMOs have been on the market for the past 
five years and that 42 genetically modified plants are 
authorized for use in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Suzuki, a well known journalist whose background is in 
genetics, has already said that politicians who insist GMOs are 
without danger are either liars or fools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the countries of the European Union recommend 
caution: first, in the absence of scientific proof, a prudent 
approach must be taken in order to prevent potential damage by 
GMOs to health and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, preliminary studies by scientists in a number of 
countries indicate that certain GMOs had negative effects on 
rats, insects and bacteria.  These studies, while not involving 
humans, should encourage us to further investigate their effects 
and to expand them to humans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it should be noted in passing that the companies claiming 
the GMOs they produce are risk free also oppose any sort of 
regulation that would make them responsible for damage caused by 
their genetically modified products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these companies refuse to assume this responsibility, if 
preliminary studies indicate that there are effects on certain 
beings, if certain countries are moving very cautiously on the 
issue of GMOs, is it not simple justice to give consumers 
freedom of choice to decide whether or not they want genetically 
modified foods in their plate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By playing the game of the food industry and not requiring it to 
separate products containing genetically modified foods from 
those that do not, the government is running the risk, over the 
medium term, of finding itself locked out of certain foreign 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall the remarks by the Commissioner of the 
Environment and Sustainable Development in his report, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Genetically modified crops constituted a relatively small 
proportion of this amount (roughly $840 million or four percent); 
however, because Canada's bulk commodity handling and 
transportation system is not currently equipped to segregate 
genetically modified varieties from the non-modified varieties, 
all exports of those crops ($2.8 billion) could have been 
affected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this perspective, farmers could find their genetically 
modified crops and food products made from them banished from 
the export markets of Europe and Asia.  Mexico and the U.S. are 
currently looking at mandatory labelling of GMOs, and in Canada, 
some of the major companies, such as McCain and Frito-Lay are no 
longer buying GMOs.

members opposite are well aware of the problems to which Canada 
might expose itself by not clearly identifying foods containing 
GMOs. These members finally understood that people's freedom to 
choose what they eat is a basic right. So voices are being heard 
from within the government party itself. As proof, this bill was 
introduced by a member of the government party.

labelling genetically modified foods and that he supported the 
efforts made in the past by the Bloc Quebecois in this regard. I 
sincerely hope that the introduction of his bill will get his 
party's other members and the ministers thinking about this so 
that the Canadian government, like several European countries, 
will make it mandatory to identify foods containing GMOs.

that are not inherent.  The purpose can be manyfold.  It can be 
to increase the yield of the product, to prolong shelf life or 
for crop resistance such as, for example, something that perhaps 
would be more resistant to drought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the work that has 
been done in this area, as my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois 
noted in her speech, by Madam Hélène Alarie, who was the member 
of parliament for Louis—Hébert in the last parliament and did an 
enormous amount of work on this, and by my colleague from 
Winnipeg North Centre, who also has a private member's bill on 
this topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall in the 36th parliament that at one point in our 
deliberations in the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food we were to have struck a subcommittee between the 
Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food to deal with the whole business of genetic 
modification, labelling, et cetera.  I still to this day do not 
know quite what happened, except that the then chair of the 
committee reported at some point that the notion of a 
subcommittee to look at it had fallen through.  Fingers were 
pointed as to which caucus was responsible.  I and my colleague 
from the Conservative Party who sits on the committee simply do 
not know what happened.  However, I think it was an important 
opportunity missed and I certainly hope the government is going 
to learn from that lesson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food did look at the question of labelling.  People from the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency were before the committee about a 
year ago.  I recall what I thought was a bizarre exchange at the 
time.  Someone from the food inspection agency was asked how a 
product listed as organic would be dealt with by the CFIA.  The 
answer was that the agency would look at it very carefully to 
determine that it was indeed an organic product and met all the 
criteria and guidelines.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then asked what would happen if the CFIA were handed a product 
to test that may contain genetically modified food or organisms. 
The answer that we got back at the time was that it would not 
consider it at all because when it was tested one day it may 
contain GMO, and when it was tested the next day it would be GMO 
free.  That flies in the face of what most Canadians want to see 
in terms of the labelling process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not heard from government members, but I suspect that 
when they get up to speak they will be opposed to the bill, 
although for the life of me I do not understand why.  We talk a 
lot in the House about democracy and transparency.  Public 
opinion polls indicate that in excess of 90% of Canadians believe 
they should have the right to know what is in the food 
they are ingesting.  I have difficulty understanding why the 
government has been dragging its heels to the extent that it has 
on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons consumers are interested and concerned about 
this issue is that they believe genetically modified foods 
may contain allergenic, toxic or even carcinogenic aspects.  They 
do not know and they darn well want the right to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue the member for Davenport is specifically concerned 
about in the legislation is that of labelling, whether it should 
be voluntary or mandatory, which he clearly demonstrated in his 
remarks.  Consumers associations, health and environmental groups 
clearly want mandatory labelling. The government and, admittedly, 
some agricultural organizations prefer to go in a voluntary way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With voluntary labelling, and this is part of our concern, 
consumers still cannot be sure the food they are buying is safe 
and farmers will not know if the crops they are planting will be 
marketable.  The member for Davenport talked about the fact that 
Canadian canola farmers have been shut out of the European market 
because more than 50% of the canola produced in Canada now is 
genetically modified and the European Union has a ban on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had the Canadian Wheat Board and other organizations 
talk about the need to prohibit the commingling of products.  We 
could very clearly have non-GMO products and products that have 
been genetically modified so that we can market our crops around 
the world, and not be shut out of markets in the way that it is 
happening today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do favour mandatory labelling.  We have called on the 
government to take immediate steps to implement a labelling 
process that will make consumers aware of all genetically 
modified products, produce and components in processed foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other matter that needs to be touched on is that there was a 
lot of emphasis six or eight months ago on the government telling 
us to wait for the Royal Society of Canada to make its report. 
That came down earlier this year and amounted to a scathing 
condemnation of the practices of the government on the question 
of food safety.  The report says that Canadians do not know that 
genetically modified foods are safe because the process of 
approvals by the government is so flawed and problematic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given those concerns, we have been asking for months, as the 
private member's bill indicates, for a process of mandatory 
labelling of all genetically modified foods so that Canadians 
know what they are eating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talked about this at committee, we had the bizarre 
argument that if we had to put labelling on a product that was 
genetically modified, we would end up with a label on an eight 
ounce jar that was perhaps two feet long. That would be 
ridiculous.  I submit that in this day and age it would be 
relatively easy for a company that had a genetically modified 
product to be able to say that the product contained GM food. 
They could send people to their website for details on the 
product without increasing the size of the label in any way.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have basically summarized the New Democratic Party's position

introducing the bill.  This is the first of three hours on the 
bill and other members of the New Democratic Party will be 
speaking in favour of the bill at subsequent opportunities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to stand in the House today to represent the 
position of the Progressive Conservative Party on Bill C-287. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I congratulate the member for Davenport who is seen in 
the House as being an effective spokesperson for the environment 
and a very passionate advocate with respect to mandatory 
labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party does say quite emphatically 
that it would work toward mandatory labelling and do so in a very 
logical and cautious way.  We will initially support the 
legislation in order to move it into committee because there are 
a number of areas that need to be debated and discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sit on the agriculture committee. I must congratulate a 
previous member, Ms. Hélène Alarie, who was a passionate advocate 
of this particular topic.  She put forward a private member's 
motion which I and my party voted against.  We did not vote 
against it because we did not feel very strongly about mandatory 
labelling but because the agriculture committee was going to 
strike a subcommittee to discuss in detail the positives, the 
weaknesses and the flaws in mandatory labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many questions on mandatory labelling need to be debated and the 
best place for that debate would at committee where the necessary 
stakeholders, consumers, producers and corporations can put their 
positions forward on mandatory labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is refreshing to see a bill come forward from a member of the 
government where it is contrary to government policy and a 
votable item.  It will be interesting to see how the government 
deals with this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does have a number of flaws.  One of the specific flaws 
is that the bill calls for a very narrow definition of GM food to 
go into the Food and Drug Act.  Canada's novel food regulations 
uses a very broad definition in capturing the regulatory system 
of anything with a novel heritable trait.  This minimizes 
negative environmental and biodiversity impacts.  Because the FDA 
supersedes the novel food regulations, the breadth of the 
products that go through the regulatory system would be narrowed 
to the product of one GM technology and everything else would 
pass into the food chain unregulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that most Canadians support the principle of 
openness and transparency within the bill.  However, achieving 
the end results will be a very difficult task, as I am sure the 
member for Davenport accepts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party believes that Canada's 
biotechnology industry, along with genetically enhanced food, has 
for the most part benefited our agriculture and agri-food 
sectors, and Canada as a whole.  Biotechnology offers major 
opportunities to improve both our environmental integrity and 
improve our food quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenges that we must face in creating a solid and dynamic 
biotechnology industry are twofold.  First, we must create a 
climate in which industry sectors can flourish, both here and 
internationally.  International trade is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we must meet the public's concerns about their own 
health, environment and the safety of GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be unrealistic to think that we can put an end to the 
biotechnology advancements.  We do not want that.  I do not 
believe anyone in the House believes we should stop the 
advancements of biotechnology.  What we can do is find ways to 
improve the system as it stands today and help improve consumer 
confidence in the foods that we eat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last federal election, our party stated that it would 
ensure greater public involvement in the setting of policy and 
regulations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would work closely with the provinces, industry and the large 
number of consumer stakeholders interested in the question of 
biotechnology generally and GMOs in particular.  We would work to 
create ways in which the industry's need and the public's real 
concerns about the health and environmental safety of genetically 
modified foods could be addressed and resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would commit to a law requiring the labelling of all 
genetically modified foodstuffs and products for human 
consumption.  It would include a caveat that mandatory labelling 
could only occur in the future if done in a cost effective 
manner, in concert with food labelling policies of other major 
food processing and trading countries, and by using standards 
consistent with those of current Food and Drugs Act regulations 
and international standards.  That goal could be achieved if 
these conditions are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are few issues today that are as complex and as detailed 
as the issue of labelling food products derived by genetically 
modified means.  There have been ongoing discussions on this 
topic for over 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the benefits of the biotechnology and GMOs is their 
multitude.  They increase our competitiveness as Canadian 
agri-food processors and producers.  They increase the yields 
needed to compensate for the increase in world population.  They 
develop more sustainable agricultural practices like zero till 
and less pest control.  In our opinion we should look forward to 
the benefits of biotechnology and genetically modified organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there are some issues that are still outstanding with 
mandatory labelling such as, as was mentioned earlier, the 
segregation of foodstuffs.  We have some difficulty right now in 
our food production, segregating the food product itself, for 
example the grains we put into the international marketplace.  We 
have to get that aspect under control as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Testing is a very important aspect of the whole issue.  We have 
to know that testing can be done economically as well as 
effectively so that we know which is a genetically modified 
organism and which is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to look at world standards.  We have to make sure 
we work in concert with the rest of the world.  We cannot sit in 
isolation, deal with mandatory labelling and put in different 
standards that are not accepted in the world marketplace.  Our 
export markets are absolutely vital to the lifeblood of 
agriculture.  Therefore we must make sure that any standard we 
set with labelling is a standard that is acceptable by our 
trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is unfortunately no standard at this point in time.  We 
have labelling rules that are being set by communities throughout 
the globe that are totally different from others.  For example, 
the United States, our major trading partner, is currently only 
looking at rules for voluntary labelling and not mandatory 
labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the European Union all products containing 1% or more GM 
material must be labelled.  Japan is looking at some new changes 
to its labelling process.  It is to take effect this year and 
require mandatory labelling for food products and processed foods 
that include one or more genetically modified organism as one of 
the top three ingredients include.  Australia and New Zealand 
have some very strict labelling requirements, whereas in China 
there are no labelling requirements at all.  We must get together 
and try to work out a standardized world labelling system so that 
we can compete in a very competitive world market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for our position, it is clear that consumers demand to be 
informed and we as legislators should look at ways to make 
changes to cater to these demands.  A substantial amount of 
misinformation continually comes forward with respect to 
genetically modified organisms and labelling.  As 
parliamentarians we must make sure that the misinformation is 
backstopped by the proper and correct information.  To stick our 
heads in the sand and not have this go forward is not the way 
that producers would have us look at the changes in our products 
and how we market those products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see this go forward, with the condition that we 
do not compete with those people who are already out there doing 
an awful lot of work on GMOs.  We should sit down and listen to 
all the stakeholders.  We could then decide how best to put the 
rules and regulations into place.  The proper rules should be in 
place that would be accepted by consumers and by the marketplace.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, but certainly not least, the rules we put into place 
should be accepted by the food producers, those in the 
agricultural community, our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to perhaps debating the bill in committee.  We 
will wait and see how far it can go. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure my colleague, the hon. 
member for Davenport, has the right motivation in bringing 
forward Bill C-287.  However let us reflect for a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada asked the Royal Society of Canada to 
examine how we should prepare to regulate food biotechnology in 
the future. The Royal Society came to the conclusion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are not currently sufficient reasons to adopt a system of 
general mandatory labelling of GM foods. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Society came to this conclusion after examining 
whether food biotechnology causes health or environmental risks 
that would warrant general mandatory labelling.  The panel 
concluded that such risks do not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say labelling of biotechnology foods should go 
unregulated.  The Royal Society concluded that labelling should 
be mandatory in certain circumstances, such as when the food 
could cause allergic reaction or where the modified food has a 
different nutrient profile than the original. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These conditions for mandatory labelling, recommended by the 
independent experts, match the rules Health Canada already has in 
place.  If a genetically modified food is potentially allergenic 
it absolutely must be labelled.  If a food's nutrient profile is 
significantly changed it absolutely must be labelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, both the Royal Society and Health Canada agree that if 
there are health or safety reasons to label biotechnology foods 
then labelling will continue to be mandatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This takes us to the next question, the question of voluntary 
labelling.  Here again it is useful to refer to what the Royal 
Society panel of experts concluded in its report to the 
government.  The report reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Panel believes that strong government support for voluntary 
labels is an effective way of providing consumer input into these 
issues, and (the Panel) encourages the Canadian regulatory 
agencies responsible to establish guidelines for the regulation 
of reliable, informative voluntary labels. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Royal Society is calling for is already well underway. 
The Canadian General Standards Board has a comprehensive process 
in place to develop a national labelling standard for foods from 
biotechnology.  This is an excellent approach to the 
biotechnology food labelling issue.  By working together the 
stakeholders will develop a national labelling standard that will 
meet the needs of consumers and be workable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European Union rushed to put labelling regulations in place. 
It was among the first in the world to have a mandatory regime in 
place.  However the result of rushing has not been positive.  Few 
products are actually labelled because the scheme is not 
practical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The virtue of the Canadian General Standards Board process now 
underway is that the participants intend to come up with a 
practical approach.  A dialogue is taking place among all the 
players so that everyone clearly understands what is practical 
and what will meet the needs of consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One final issue needs to be addressed.  Public opinion polls are 
telling us that the vast majority of Canadians want mandatory 
labelling rules for foods from biotechnology.  We have an 
obligation to consider the views of our electorate.  At the same 
time, however, the people most intimately involved in the 
labelling debate are coming to a different conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a split between informed opinion and opinion as measured 
by opinion polls.  Canadians are concerned and they have a right 
to be concerned.  When people become more knowledgeable or 
engaged in an issue they often change their minds.  I submit that 
we need to listen to informed views.  We need to listen to 
Canadians.  We should let the Canadian General Standards Board 
complete its work.  We should not pre-empt informed debate on 
this topic.  We should not quash the work they are attempting to 
conclude.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FEDERAL LAW—CIVIL LAW HARMONIZATION ACT, NO. 1 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK13">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill S-4, a first act to harmonize 
federal law with the civil law of the province of Quebec and to 
amend certain acts in order to ensure that each language version 
takes into account the common law and the civil law, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there have been discussions among the 
parties and I believe you would find unanimous consent that Bill 
S-4 be considered at all stages today, that is, second reading, 
committee of the whole, report stage and third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill 
S-4, the federal law—civil law harmonization act, No. 1.  I will 
start by providing some of the historical and legal context of 
bijuralism in Canada, which is at the heart of the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a bilingual and bijural country. Common law and civil 
law traditions have been co-existing since 1774. In practice, in 
the area of private law, the civil law is used in the province 
of Quebec and the common law, in the other provinces and 
territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitutional Act of 1867, which divided legislative powers 
between parliament and provincial legislatures, did not change 
the situation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By giving the provinces jurisdiction over property and civil 
rights the Constitution Act enabled provinces to pass legislation 
in key areas governing legal relationships between individuals. 
Some examples include the rules governing family, estates, 
property, contracts, liability and prescriptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When federal legislation uses or refers to principles and 
concepts found in provincial or territorial private law, it 
interacts with the two legal traditions that co-exist in the 
country.  This interaction occurs in both the English and French 
versions of federal legislation.  However in many cases over the 
years federal legislation has not succeeded in giving civil law 
the same resonance as common law. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Quebec civil code came into force in 1994. This code 
deeply changed the civil law of Quebec. In the fall of 1997, at 
the symposium on harmonization of federal legislation with the 
civil law of Quebec and Canadian bijuralism, in Montreal, I 
officially launched a lengthy process that led to Bill S-4. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 is the first in a series of bills intended to harmonize 
all federal legislation with the civil law of the province of 
Quebec.  This is an enormous task and one that will have 
significant practical implications for lawyers and notaries that 
practise law in Quebec.  It has received widespread support from 
all stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objectives of harmonization of federal legislation with the 
civil law of Quebec are to ensure that federal legislation is 
fully consistent with the new civil law concepts and 
institutions, that federal legislation employs correct and 
precise terminology, and that amendments to federal legislation 
take into account French common law terminology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear that Bill S-4 does not create substantive rights 
or enshrine any new individual or collective rights. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 is aimed at ensuring that all Canadians have access to 
federal laws that respect the legal tradition of the province or 
territory where they live: the civil law in Quebec and the 
common law in the rest of the country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT14"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT14"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1210

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, while federal law may apply a single principle nationally, 
for example, the liability of the crown in tort, it will do so in 
a manner respectful of the common law and civil law traditions in 
each province or territory.  There is therefore co-existence 
between uniformization and harmonization of federal statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal laws are uniform in the sense that they apply a single 
rule throughout Canada.  They are also harmonized in that federal 
statutes, in relation to matters of property and civil rights, 
respect the particularities of the civil law or common law as it 
applies in a given jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 reflects the principles and concepts of both our great 
legal traditions.  In some small way I hope we are providing 
further roots for the civil law system in our country, 
acknowledging that it stands on an equal footing with the common 
law system in federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the innovative character of the harmonization program, the 
preamble puts the bill into context and explains the importance 
of the initiative.  The preamble recognizes the bijural character 
of Canada in two ways.  First, it recognizes that Quebec is the 
only province in Canada that has a civil law system and that the 
bill represents a concrete effort to reflect civil law principles 
and concepts in federal legislation where it is relevant to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the preamble fully acknowledges the common law as the 
other half of Canadian bijuralism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our bijural tradition gives Canada an advantage internationally. 
It enables us to better understand the legal systems of countries 
with a common law or civil law tradition, and it facilitates 
communication with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the age of globalization of trade, our harmonization program 
is timely.  This provides Canada with an enormous advantage in 
terms of what we bring to the table, of crossing the lines and 
bringing people together to not only work in French and English 
but to have a degree of confidence and assurance with both common 
law and civil law principles. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are fortunate, as a country, that two of the great legal 
systems in the world are represented here and that more and more 
people can easily work or give advice in one system or the 
other. This is true not only here, but also in our work at the 
international level. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The harmonization program is a totally unique and innovative 
initiative that does not exist in any of the countries that share 
a dual legal tradition with Canada.  It is tangible evidence of 
the government's commitment to our two great legal traditions and 
to achieving full equality between them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 will concretely acknowledge the existence of the two 
great legal systems of our nation in a manner not done before in 
Canada or anywhere in the world.  The bill will ensure that 
federal statutes equally take into account, in both official 
languages, each of the traditions that make up the legal fabric 
of our nation.  It will also allow Canada to play a leading role 
in an increasingly globalized world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all who have contributed to and supported this immensely 
challenging project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I thank my hon. colleagues for their support for 
this groundbreaking legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in today's debate on Bill 
S-4, an act to harmonize federal law with the civil law of the 
province of Quebec and to amend certain acts in order to ensure 
that each language version takes into account the common law and 
the civil law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will keep my remarks very brief.  As we know, Quebec has its 
own civil system of law based on the French model, whereas the 
other nine provinces have a legal system based on English common 
law.  The bill is a reflection of a work plan established by the 
federal government to ensure that the federal law which applies 
in all 10 provinces has the same vocabulary as the Quebec code 
and that the federal law takes into account both law traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reviewing the federal law some laws were found still in force 
by virtue of having been adopted by the pre-confederation 
parliament but made only applicable in lower Canada.  In Bill S-4 
the statutes are being repealed or amended to reflect the current 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case the bill enacts necessary amendments.  I have no 
issues with either the intent or the substance of the bill.  I 
therefore support the immediate passage of the bill through the 
House.

<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be brief.  I had not intended to rise at this time since we 
object neither to the form nor to the substance of the bill 
but, a comment by the Minister of Justice almost forced me 
to do so because I have to take at least five minutes to set 
some things straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During her speech, the Minister of Justice said that the 
legislation proves that the government wants to take into account 
the particularities of the two legal systems we have in this 
country. 
That might be true inasmuch as they are using the vocabularies 
of both the civil code and the common law in order to please 
everyone, but it is not the case in all jurisdictions of the 
justice department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the minister had a good opportunity with the Young 
Offenders Act to show that both legal systems can cohabit in 
this wide and beautiful Canada but she failed.  In that 
particular case, she simply imposed her views on something of 
such importance as the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no problem with Bill S-4. However, as far as the remarks 
by the minister to the effect that with this legislation her 
government, and her in particular, are taking into account the 
interests of Quebec and the other provinces, I think that is a 
half truth and I wanted to make that clear.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this debate promises to be probably one of the shortest second 
reading debates in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have much more to add to the extensive contributions of 
my colleagues from the Alliance and the Bloc in the debate on 
Bill S-4.  We all know the merits of the bill.  I do not want to 
assume anything on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party, 
but all of us assume its speedy passage.  Having listened to the 
Minister of Justice and having familiarized myself with the 
legislation it seems to me that the sooner we accomplish this, 
the better.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to put some comments on record with respect 
to Bill S-4.  I will indicate at the outset that the Conservative 
Party is similarly disposed.  We want to see the legislation pass 
quickly through the House and take effect.  We recognize its 
importance and recognize the entire principle behind the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the title suggests, the bill is to harmonize federal law and 
civil law in the province of Quebec and to amend a number of acts 
in order to ensure that each language version will take into 
account common law and civil law principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill respects the traditions of both common law and civil 
law in Canada, as has been stated.  It is also interesting to 
note that it originates in the other place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Beaudoin and Senator Andreychuk, both very learned 
counsel in their own right, have spoken in favour of the 
legislation, as have other senators including Senators Murray and 
Nolin.  They have made very valuable contributions to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a country with two legal systems, public law and 
private law, better known as the civil and common law.  Canada 
also has provincial jurisdiction set out under subsection 92(13) 
of the Constitution Act, 1867, which legitimizes most of what is 
considered property and civil law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec these notions are traditionally included in the civil 
code of Quebec, which concerns itself with the following: 
successions, the management of immovable property, hypothetic 
securities and property laws, consumer protection, civil 
incapacity and tudorship, celebration of marriage, the 
obligations and contracts of civil liability, and the regulation 
of professions and occupations under Quebec's exclusive 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other provinces the corresponding matters defined under the 
common law are also under provincial jurisdiction.  The main role 
of civil law in this sense is to supplement federal legislation 
for the following reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1867 the Parliament of Canada has enacted more than 300 
statutes.  Some or all these provisions are designed to regulate 
matters of private law.  It has done so primarily under 
parliament's exclusive jurisdiction over matters that had it not 
been for the division of powers established in sections 91, 92 
and 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867, would have fallen under the 
province's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has also done this indirectly by enacting 
statutes designed primarily to regulate questions of public law 
with some provisions relying upon private law concepts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The field of private law thus is not solely a provincial 
jurisdiction.  The federal government has exclusive authority in 
a number of areas under the private law which include banking, 
monetary transactions, interest on money, bankruptcy and 
insolvency, maritime law, patents, copyright, marriage and 
divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the federal government takes away from or adds 
provisions to the civil law of each province, it does not mean 
all these statutes constitute a separate legal system.  For 
example, the civil code of Quebec also supplements the federal 
statutes while assisting in their interpretation and application. 
It can therefore be said that there is a complementary 
relationship between the federal legislation and the civil law 
practices of the provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party supports the principles 
underlying Bill S-4 on harmonization between federal law and the 
civil law in Quebec. The goal in this bill is to make sure 
federal law provisions are harmonized with those in the civil 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of harmony has been more crucial since the enactment of 
the new civil code in Quebec in January 1994. 
Bill S-4 reflects the need to have a smooth interaction between 
the federal and provincial legislation. Harmonization of federal 
law and the Quebec civil code will help reduce interpretation 
problems caused by the use of different terminology in federal 
and provincial legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need to harmonize therefore is clear.  In 1994, after more 
than 50 years of talks and plans for reform, Quebec replaced the 
civil code of lower Canada, which had come into force in 1866, 
with the civil code of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time extremely important and existing federal 
statutes have had to be harmonized to be made consistent with 
current civil law.  The changes in vocabulary and substance made 
to the civil code were not without effect on federal laws.  The 
resulting change in vocabulary and language of federal statutes 
is no longer exactly that which occurred in civil law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That language had to be modernized.  It was a language of that 
period.  Regardless of language there is often the need to 
modernize, particularly with technical aspects of a bill such as 
this one. 
Substantive changes, changes in traditional institutions and the 
formalization of new concepts and reform of existing rules are 
also taken into consideration.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Problems can exist through the survival of a number of 
provisions from the civil code of lower Canada which Quebec had 
not been able to repeal because they had related to matters since 
that time in 1867 and have been within the jurisdiction of 
parliament.  The federal government has now looked at these since 
the new civil code came into force.  They are thus isolated from 
the body by which they once were formed and in their relation 
with the civil code of Quebec may have become and have become to 
some extent controversial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a number of experts the civil code reform is not 
the only reason for the law to be harmonized with federal laws 
and with private law.  The federal government still has not 
managed to take into account Quebec's civil language and law in 
the wording of private law provisions that were enacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the federal Department of Justice has reviewed more 
than 700 statutes to determine which ones would be most affected 
by the amendments, substance and form planned in the new civil 
code.  Based on that analysis it identified 300 laws that would 
have to be harmonized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1998 the federal government under the leadership of the 
Minister of Justice considered that it would be able to do so by 
tabling one bill a year over the following nine years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Department of Justice this harmonization would 
ensure that federal laws which are implemented under private law 
include Quebec civil law terminology, notions and institutions. 
It would also enhance the effectiveness of the courts by making 
parliament's intention clearer and by reducing the problems 
involved in interpreting federal laws when they are applied in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally it would facilitate access to justice for all Quebecers. 
The details are often very critical to this process.  The 
preamble of Bill S-4 recognizes in particular that Quebec's civil 
law tradition which finds its principal expression in the civil 
code of Quebec reflects the unique character of Quebec society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been somewhat controversial.  I refer to some comments 
on the record in the other place which touched upon that subject 
matter.  There was a reference to the highest court of the land 
in terms of its use and expression of the terms Quebec society 
and distinct society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the late Brian Dickson, former chief justice of the 
Supreme Court of Canada, took a stand on the concept of Quebec's 
distinct character.  At a conference organized by the Military 
and Hospitaller Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem, Grand Priory 
of Canada, which took place in Winnipeg, he stated the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say right from the start that I am very comfortable with 
this concept 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was speaking in this instance of Quebec society.  He 
continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts are already interpreting the Charter and the 
Constitution with an eye to the distinctive role of Quebec in 
protecting and promoting its French-speaking character.  In 
practice, therefore, enshrining formal recognition of the 
distinct character of Quebec in the Constitution would not be a 
great departure from what our courts are already doing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put this on the record, in 1997 the second red book of the 
Liberal Party of Canada said that a Liberal government would work 
toward the constitutional recognition of the distinctness of 
Quebec society which includes the French speaking majority, a 
unique culture and a tradition of civil law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be no hesitation on the part of the Liberal 
government to wrap its arms around this initiative.  It provides 
all Canadians who are certainly entitled to access to federal 
legislation with the common law and civil law traditions.  It 
harmonizes the interaction of federal and provincial legislation 
in that it is essential and lies in the interpretation of both 
these common and civil law traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will receive smooth passage, certainly through this 
place.  I would deem that it has received a significant review 
and attempts by the senators to improve and put before us a very 
sound piece of legislation.  There was talk of amendments with 
respect to the harmonization of other statutes in the future. 
According to the federal Department of Justice, tax law, 
regulatory law and commercial law were identified as other key 
areas in which harmonization would be the subject of new bills in 
coming years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that many organizations including 
the Barreau du Québec, la Chambre des notaires du Québec, le 
ministère de la Justice au Québec and a number of other law 
professors have assisted significantly in the drafting of the 
legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 3 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-15, an act to amend the Criminal Code and to amend other 
acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate today in debate on Bill 
C-15, an act to amend the criminal code and to amend other acts. 
When the bill was first introduced almost two months ago, one of 
my new colleagues asked “Animal cruelty, child pornography, and 
firearms, what do any of these issues have to do with one 
another?” and said he did not understand why they would all be 
put in one bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While past practice has often demonstrated that logic is not 
essential to the legislative process or for the legislative 
provisions themselves, there is a clear logic to grouping 
together the diverse provisions of this bill.  It is a 
Machiavellian logic motivated by the politics of cynicism.  It is 
a logic that raises the spectre of the worst of the American 
legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a logic that attempts to coerce agreement from opposition 
parties by requiring their consent to a political agenda of 
flawed partisan legislation as a precondition to the enactment of 
legislation widely recognized as necessary for the protection of 
the most vulnerable in our society.  How else can one logically 
explain, for example, the coupling of the provisions seeking to 
amend the fundamentally flawed legislation concerning the billion 
dollar long gun registry failure with provisions that seek to 
protect our children from sexual predators? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This omnibus bill is a deliberate and cynical attempt to curtail 
any substantive debate on the flaws of the political agenda 
evident in the long gun registry provisions and to require 
members either to accept legislation that our constituents 
fundamentally disagree with or to vote against legislation that 
our constituents would never want to oppose, such as laws aimed 
at protecting children.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that there are some good provisions in the 
bill.  Most important, the legislation contains long overdue laws 
against luring children over the Internet for the purposes of 
committing a sexual offence.  I commend these initial efforts to 
protect children from criminals using the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has consistently called for legislation to 
protect children from those who keep finding ways to prey on 
their vulnerability.  Law enforcement agencies and child care 
agencies regularly advise the public through the media or 
otherwise that predators frequently use the Internet, mask their 
identities and pretend to be children or young adults in order to 
lure children into a situation where they could be sexually 
abused.  These situations are becoming more common and I am 
relieved to see that the government has finally recognized the 
great need to amend the law.  It is a good first step, at any 
rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have serious doubts whether the legislation, which 
attempts to provide protection to children from sexual predators, 
will be either effective or sufficiently broad.  The same 
government that has to date failed to create an effective 
national sex offender registry now wants us to believe it can 
keep track of the criminals who lure children over the Internet 
or who deal in child pornography.  Why should we believe that it 
would follow through with effective measures that enforce the 
legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, these provisions would only provide legislative 
protection for children who are less than 14 years of age. 
Canadians would be shocked to learn that even under this 
legislation an adult could lure a 14 year old girl or a 14 year 
old boy over the Internet with no legal consequences.  Parents 
and children deserve a greater measure of assistance and 
protection from these predators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with those law enforcement and child care agencies that 
recommend that the law set out for child luring should be 
extended to all children under the age of 16.  This way parents 
and other concerned authorities would have some legal recourse to 
protect children of 14 and 15 years of age who fall prey to 
sexual predators they encounter over the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also new offences set out for transmitting, accessing 
or distributing child pornography over the Internet, punishable 
by a maximum of 10 years.  This is a laudable goal, but I would 
be interested in being advised of the practical difficulties 
involved with these kinds of investigations and prosecutions in 
order to determine whether these legislative proposals meet those 
very real concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, I would like to point out that in Bill C-15, although 
there are provisions for substantial maximum sentences for 
accessing child pornography, luring children for sexual purposes, 
animal cruelty, criminal harassment and a variety of other 
offences, the legislation will be ineffective if judges will not 
impose appropriate sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When maximum sentences are increased it is rare to see a 
proportionate increase in sentences, as many judges simply ignore 
the direction signalled by parliament when it enacts these 
changes in legislation.  Not only do the appeal courts appear to 
be reluctant to establish sentencing ranges that are 
proportionate to the crime committed and the legislative penalty 
provided, there is a corresponding reluctance on the part of the 
government to send clear, legislative directions to the courts 
that the sentences imposed on many serious and repeat offenders 
are simply inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This apparent reluctance on the part of the government is 
compounded by the imposition of new and fundamentally misleading 
sentencing tools that encourage the pretence that offenders are 
in fact imprisoned, while the truth is that they are free to 
exploit more victims in our communities.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer of course to the practice of authorizing and imposing 
conditional sentences.  As crown attorneys continue to advise, 
the enforcement of breeches of these conditional sentences are 
increasingly rare because of the lack of adequate resources to 
apply these very complex provisions.  Then the failure to provide 
the appropriate resources fulfils another political agenda of the 
Liberal government to make it appear that these sentencing 
provisions are in fact working because there are so few reported 
breeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, unless the government takes the necessary steps to 
implement effective and truthful sentencing in the Canadian 
justice system, these important child protection provisions in 
the bill will simply be another example of the failure of our 
laws to protect the vulnerable in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the animal cruelty sections of the bill, I am aware 
that the government has made certain changes from the previously 
proposed legislation, Bill C-17.  However there are still 
significant concerns that many organizations, businesses and 
individuals have in respect of these provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that some of my colleagues in the Canadian Alliance will 
go into further detail on many of these issues, but I would also 
like to touch briefly on the issue on behalf of the various 
groups that took the time to contact me personally to raise their 
concerns.  These groups included the Ontario Federation of 
Anglers and Hunters, the Ontario Farm Animal Council, the Ontario 
Veal Association and the Canadian Cattlemen's Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These organizations have consistently said that they welcome 
amendments to the criminal code that would clarify and strengthen 
provisions relating to animal cruelty and that they do not 
condone intentional animal abuse or neglect in any way.  Many of 
these groups support the intent of the bill as its objective is 
to modernize the law and increase penalties for offences relating 
to animal cruelty and neglect.  However, despite the minor 
improvements to this legislation, they advise that this bill 
requires significant amendments before it becomes acceptable to 
the vast majority of hunters and farmers, many of whom are 
dependent on the harvesting and husbandry of animals for their 
livelihood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the central concerns with the bill is that the criminal 
code would no longer provide the same level of legal protection 
presently afforded to those who use animals for legitimate, 
lawful and justified practices.  The phrase “legal 
justification, excuse or colour of right” in subsection 429(2) 
of the criminal code currently provides protection to those who 
commit any kind of property offence.  However in the new bill, 
the fact that the animal cruelty provisions would be moved out of 
the general classification of property offences and into a 
section of their own would effectively remove these provisions 
outside the ambit of that protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving the animal cruelty sections out of the ambit of property 
offences to a new section in its own right is also seen by many 
as emphasizing animal rights as opposed to animal welfare.  This 
significant alteration in the underlying principles of the 
legislation is something that needs to be carefully considered. 
These groups are concerned that elevating the status of animals 
from property could in fact have significant and detrimental 
implications for many legitimate animal dependent businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major and very serious concern is that the definition of 
animal is too broad, subjective and ambiguous.  The proposed 
definition of animal in Bill C-15 includes non-human vertebrates 
and all animals having the capacity to feel pain.  This 
definition marks a significant departure by providing protection 
for an extremely wide range of living organisms which have never 
before been afforded this kind of legal protection.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of practical difficulties, this definition as worded 
could cause potentially enormous problems by extending the 
criminal law to invertebrates, cold blooded species such as fish, 
as well as the extremely wide variety of other types of both 
domestic and wild animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her speech last Thursday, the justice minister assured us 
that what was lawful today in the course of legitimate activities 
would be lawful when the bill received royal assent.  She 
promised the House that these changes would not in any way 
negatively affect the many legitimate activities that involve 
animals, such as hunting, farming or medical and scientific 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her statement was at the same time self-evident, but also 
misleading.  Of course the new provisions would not prevent 
legitimate activities from being carried out.  The law only 
prescribes illegal activities.  The problem is, and therefore the 
concern, that these new provisions would arguably narrow the 
scope of what constitutes legitimate activities by increasing the 
scope of this provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is not the minister's intent to prohibit the presently 
acceptable and legitimate activities in Canadian agricultural or 
fur industries, I would suggest that the wording of the 
legislation be amended to clarify the intent of these provisions. 
If it is not amended, I and many of my colleagues will have a 
very difficult time supporting the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Provencher, which I have the honour to represent, 
is primarily a rural riding.  The farmers and hunters and other 
businesses associated with those activities have enough to worry 
about these days without having to wonder if they are going to be 
criminalized for practices they have been carrying out their 
entire lives.  I have the option of voting against the bill on 
the basis that farmers and others who use animals legitimately 
have voiced reasonable and serious concerns regarding the 
implications the bill would present.  However, in this case I 
would also be voting against new laws to protect children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a difficult situation and one of which I am certain will 
be exploited by the Liberals for crass political advantage.  It 
is truly unfortunate that the minister is asking us to consider 
provisions that deal with the lives of children in the same 
context with provisions that impose conditions on how farmers and 
hunters and related businesses should handle animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no legal requirement to proceed to weigh the merits of 
this bill on the basis of such inappropriate relative comparison. 
It demeans the value of human life and at the same time prevents 
the House from fully considering the impact of the animal cruelty 
provisions on the economic circumstances of many rural people of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 contains a number of good things.  As I have said, it 
contains updated legislation to protect children to some extent 
from sexual predators on the Internet.  It would make viewing, 
transmitting and distributing child pornography over the Internet 
an offence punishable by up to 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, the bill would increase protection for police by 
creating the new offence of disarming a police officer.  The bill 
outlines reforms to rules governing criminal procedure.  These 
are procedural reforms that are long overdue.  Much of this 
legislation in the bill is in fact badly needed.  The opposition 
has been calling for these provisions for years.  Personally, I 
am relieved to see that the measures are being finally 
introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said before, I would like to support the bill.  The 
bill presents a very difficult situation.  I am disappointed that 
the government would put such diverse and I would argue 
completely unrelated issues in the same bill.  As I stated 
earlier, I see this approach to lawmaking as a blatant and 
cynical political move on the part of the Liberal government to 
force flawed legislation through the House.  More important, it 
shows a callous disregard to the constituents who have asked us 
to serve their best interest in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the minister to consider introducing a motion to 
split this legislative package into several bills.  That would 
remove the provisions that have a broad base of support in the 
House so that those provisions could be fast tracked and 
proclaimed.  We saw an example of that this morning with Bill 
S-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members in the House are willing to co-operate.  I believe that 
on many provisions there is broad if not unanimous consensus in 
the House to move them forward.  The technique of bringing 
forward a motion to split the bill would accommodate the need to 
move those provisions that do have that broad consensus, while 
subjecting the others to a more rigorous debate and, I suggest, 
to better legislation.  If need be, I am prepared to sit down 
with representatives from all parties to facilitate that 
discussion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-15, at this stage. It is a very 
important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before discussing the legislation further, I would like 
to repeat what I have already said on other omnibus bills. I 
think it is inappropriate that so many different things should 
be put into such an important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill, there are provisions on animal cruelty offences, 
on the sexual exploitation of children involving the use of the 
Internet and on sexual harassment. Amendments are proposed with 
regard to the way in which this will be brought to court. 
The bill deals with harassment, home invasion, disarming a 
police officer, judicial errors—all this is very important—and 
with the whole issue of criminal procedure, which is also very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill, some things need no explanation. We totally agree 
with some of the changes the minister is introducing; we were 
hoping for them. We commend the minister for the changes that 
she is proposing. However, there are certain 
aberrations. What do we do? We do not support the bill because 
part of it does not interest us and part of it goes 
against certain positions of Quebec or of our party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with regard to the sexual exploitation of children and 
the modernization of the criminal code to take into account 
today's reality in terms of the Internet, we are in agreement. 
What are we supposed to do? Vote against the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Minister of Justice is not disinterested. I 
believe she knows very well what she is doing. We lack 
neither time nor opportunity in the House of Commons to study 
subjects one after the other, in their proper context and with 
the help of experts in each field. We have what we need to do 
good work. Why use an omnibus bill like this to confuse the 
issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be strange when the bill is in committee to hear people 
from humane societies, crown attorneys speaking on criminal 
proceedings and university professors speaking on research. 
At one point, we will have to focus on a subject in particular. 
It will take a lot of time if we really want to do good work and 
hear witnesses. In the end, we are not saving any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the legislator works better when the 
government introduces a series of changes in an catch-all bill. 
In this sense, I believe the minister failed. I think 
we could have worked diligently on amending bills as we did 
earlier with Bill S-4. That is a very good example, in my 
opinion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all the parties in the House get along, partisanship can be 
set aside and we can move ahead with a bill to improve the 
justice system and better meet the concerns of people. We had a 
demonstration of that this morning by all the parties. We 
co-operated and were able to go through all the stages in the 
same day, with the result that Bill S-4 has now been passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that the same could have been done regarding the 
sexual exploitation of children. We could have done it to 
modernize the criminal code regarding the criminal use of the 
Internet and make this an offence. It should be pointed out that 
these changes are often made in response to decisions by the 
higher courts. 
This whole part of the criminal code could have been passed very 
quickly, so that these provisions could take effect as soon as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also other issues, such as disarming a policeman. This 
has been a concern of police officers, including the RCMP, 
municipal police forces and the Quebec Provincial Police, for a 
long time. We have already heard a number of witnesses. The 
spokespersons for political parties, including the Liberal 
Party, the Canadian Alliance, the Bloc Quebecois and the others, 
are all aware that police officers want this amendment. One does 
not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that if the 
government introduced a bill that dealt strictly with this 
issue, we would pass it more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the beginning, the bill contains amendments to 
which I am totally opposed, perhaps not in principle as such 
but with respect to how they are worded.  It seems that the 
legislator, or those who took the time to draft the bill, 
forgot certain particular situations.  Quite honestly, if the 
government had produced bills addressing each situation 
separately, the House of Commons would have passed them very 
quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the Department of Justice appears to be out of touch 
with the public.  We have seen, and are still seeing, the 
results of this with the whole issue of young offenders in 
Quebec, where nobody is in favour of this bill.  The minister 
does not even want to hear from the representatives from Quebec 
in committee. 
The government has bulldozed right over everything, as only it 
can do.  We will eventually end up with this bill at third 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To show just how strange things sometimes are in the life of the 
Minister of Justice, the young offenders bill has not even been 
passed at third reading and we realize that we are going to 
repeal the Young Offenders Act with Bill C-7, which we recently 
passed.  We realize that certain of the clauses in this bill 
amend the Young Offenders Act.  We are amending this legislation 
when we know that we have a bill that is going to repeal it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to describe the context in which the bill seems to 
have been drafted, and particularly to point out the 
government's, or the Minister of Justice's, lack of understanding 
of what is going on within that department.  Apart from coming 
here to the House and listening to what we have to say, I do not 
get the impression that the minister has much control over her 
department.  She needs to keep much more of an eye on things 
because this is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been an MP since 1993.  If there is one bill that has 
been very hard to get through this House and that has divided 
just about all caucuses, it has been the firearms legislation. 
The minister has seen fit to change certain aspects of the 
Firearms Act with Bill C-15, as well as certain definitions in 
the criminal code, and this has greatly expanded the definition 
of a firearm. 
The legislation we had was already hard to understand and now, 
with the amendment the minister is bringing in with Bill C-15, I 
must say the definition of a firearm will be as clear as mud.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the clauses that surprised me when I examined Bill C-15 
was clause 4.  It says, and I will take the time to read it 
because it is somewhat complex, that subparagraphs 84(3)(<I>d</I>)(i) 
and (ii) of the Criminal Code are replaced by the following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) a shot, bullet or other projectile at a muzzle velocity 
exceeding 152.4 m per second or at a muzzle energy exceeding 5.7 
Joules, or 
(ii) a shot, bullet or other projectile that is designed or 
adapted to attain a velocity exceeding 152.4 m per second or an 
energy exceeding 5.7 Joules. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just a lawyer; I do not know whether it will take engineers 
to enforce the Firearms Act in future because apparently a 
series of multiplicative factors are needed to arrive at the 
number of joules: the length of the barrel, the radius of the 
barrel, the size of the bullet, the weight, multiplied, divided—I 
no longer know what all—to calculate the number of joules.  With 
a definition like this, I have serious doubts with respect to an 
industry that is in full expansion in Canada and Quebec.  I am 
referring to the whole paintball industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the biggest operation in all of Canada is located in my 
riding—its sales are considerable—and it is called BigFoot 
PaintBall.  I am told that, obviously, the rubber bullet filled 
with paint does not travel 152.4 metres per second, but has a muzzle 
energy around 12 joules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will these guns that look like something from out of this world 
with their silver and blue and all sorts of other colours have 
to be registered? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department assures me that this is not the intent.  I read 
the definition, I read the provision that applies in such cases, 
and it is “or”.  It is “either or” the way I see it.  If it is 
not, I hope they will correct it.  But “either” the bullet 
travels faster than 152.4 metres a second “or” it develops a 
muzzle energy exceeding 5.7 joules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under such an interpretation, the gun belonging to my 
constituent, who earns a living with it in paintball, a new 
sport, should be registered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support such a law because it totally distorts the 
point of registering firearms. 
As regards my position, which I spoke of at the start, do I vote 
for or against the bill given this aberration in it? 
I think we will vote for it and try to convince the minister she 
is headed in the wrong direction in certain respects, in certain 
ways the bill is drafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that if the past is any indication of things 
to come, I have little chance but we will try.  We have 
succeeded on a few occasions in getting certain things changed 
in the department.  We will continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The drafting of Bill C-15, in certain cases, 
is confusing and will have to be given careful consideration. 
However, we could have amended the bill with a series of small 
bills, which could have been quickly passed. 
With regard to the more complicated bills that do not get the 
unanimous approval of the House, more time and effort could have 
gone into understanding and improving them but the minister 
decided otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point has to do with the whole question of child 
pornography.  As drafted, I think this part of the bill is in 
keeping with requests made and decisions given by the courts. 
It also updates legislation.  So, there is no problem.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue that concerns me is animal cruelty. At the 
present time, we have legislation. I agree its provisions are 
obsolete. This whole part has not been changed recently. It no 
longer properly reflects reality. It is not as modern as we 
could wish. There is an approach that deals in a modern way with 
the improvement of legislation. There is another approach, which 
is too broad and which encompasses almost anything and, once 
again, does not achieve the objective sought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sincerely, I agree with the principle of protecting animals. I 
am against cruelty toward any kind of animals. 
I will tell the House a story showing how sensitive I am. Once 
I accidentally hit a cat that was roaming the street and I 
stopped to see whether I could save it. It was an accident. 
Thus, I want to show the House that I am in favour of protecting 
animals and I think the current legislation does not achieve 
this objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way this provision is written, I understand the people who 
are worried and who feel targeted by it, while they are doing 
nothing illegal and they are not being cruel to animals. The 
definition is so broad that I understand them. The minister will 
also have to understand the people who are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the definition of cruelty to animals, which is totally new 
and which applies to many animals, the bill says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>182.1 In this Part, “animal” means a vertebrate, other than a 
human being, and any other animal that has the capacity to feel 
pain. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision includes just about every animal, from a little 
mouse to a moose in northern Quebec. It also includes fish, not 
just endangered whales and belugas but all vertebrates. Frogs 
are also targeted since they are vertebrates—at least I think so, 
I am a lawyer, not a biologist—but I think they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition is very broad. There is a whole series of 
issues relating to cruelty to the animals, namely any 
vertebrate that has the capacity “to feel pain”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>182.2(1) Every one commits an offence who, wilfully or 
recklessly: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) causes...unnecessary...suffering or injury to an animal 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean? The clause also says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) kills an animal...brutally or viciously... 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill is passed without being amended, will a person who 
hunts with a bow, which is legal, now commit an offence if he 
continues to hunt with a bow? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go fishing, the fish that I catch does not seem to like 
to get caught by a hook. Am I guilty of cruelty to that animal, 
to that vertebrate? These issues must be raised. 
This is a very broad definition and this is why I understand all 
the hunting and fishing associations' concerns. I received 
letters from people in my riding who practice these sports, 
since there is a lot of hunting and fishing in 
Berthier—Montcalm. It is a beautiful riding. Mr. Speaker, let 
me know if you ever want to go hunting or fishing in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my riding are interested in this legislation. Sports 
associations from across Canada and Quebec also sent me e-mails 
and letters saying “Listen, this is dangerous”.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation really needs to be looked at in order to see 
what its objective was.  It then becomes clear that, although 
the present wording may attain the objective, it will end up 
covering a lot of people who were not necessarily meant to be 
part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have touched on just two points but there are a number of 
actions the legislators may consider cruelty to animals.  I 
wonder where this leaves the pig farmer, for instance.  With the 
definitions given, I am a bit worried for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, where the shipping of animals is concerned, clause 
182.3 (1) (<I>c</I>) reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>negligently injures an animal while it is being conveyed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the minister has ever seen how pigs are loaded 
onto trucks and chickens into cages for shipping and so on, but 
the expression “negligently” is very broad, as is “injures an 
animal while it is being conveyed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very often, any manner of unexpected event can occur.  Even with 
the best of intentions and care for the animals being shipped, 
sometimes an animal gets injured.  Its leg may be broken, or 
something of the sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the riding of Berthier—Montcalm, we have poultry farms. 
I have seen such things as a whole shipment of chickens being 
suffocated by the heat, something that was unavoidable because 
the outside temperature was 35 degrees Celsius, with high 
humidity and no wind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the person shipping these chickens be charged with 
“negligently injuring an animal while it is being conveyed”, in 
this case of causing its death?  I wonder, and I am not the only 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, there are all those involved in hunting and 
fishing.  Then there are the farmers as well who are also 
raising such questions.  We have received a letter from the 
Ontario Federation of Agriculture raising objections to certain 
points in the bill and asking us to look into certain things or 
to propose amendments.  Quebec farmers have also made us aware 
of this problem.  Some pig farmers have telephoned me to check 
out certain things they had heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hunters, fishers, farmers and even academics are asking 
questions.  On April 6, we received in our offices a copy of a 
letter from the Association of Universities and Colleges of 
Canada to the Minister of Justice.  I will read the resolution 
adopted by the Association of Universities and Colleges of 
Canada, which is very significant and speaks for itself.  The 
letter concerns Bill C-15, which we are currently studying. The 
resolution reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada make 
known, in the strongest possible terms, to the Minister of 
Justice and the chair of the House of Commons' Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights that it and the 
institutions that are members of it fear that the proposed 
changes to the Criminal Code on the treatment of animals 
inadvertently threatens legitimate university research done 
using animals, in accordance with the standards recognized in 
Canada and abroad of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from the wording that even academics, professors and 
those doing research, who have a highly developed professional 
conscience, have doubts about these provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of people who have doubts about the very ordinary but 
very badly drafted provisions is beginning to add up: hunters, 
fishers, farmers, producers, professors, academics, researchers 
and all that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Terrebonne—Blainville will speak on the part 
concerning the protection of animals and all that concerns this 
issue once I have finished speaking.  I know that there is a 
whole very important issue here. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that is missing right now but that could have been 
changed given the objective pursued is the recovery of costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Breeders and people who keep animals are currently being 
prosecuted for cruelty under existing provisions, and it is 
difficult to recover all the expenses incurred to get to the 
animals, try to save them, care for them and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, proposed amendments to Bill C-15 are designed to 
facilitate cost recovery, or at least to try to recover some 
money. 
This is fine. However, the same goal could have been achieved 
with more restrictive provisions and definitions, such as those 
I mentioned earlier, to deal specifically with the cruelty, not 
in a restrictive way but in a more targeted way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that we will have good discussions in committee 
on this, because it is a very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other amendments included in the bill 
concern the whole issue of miscarriage of justice. A 
fellow Bloc Quebecois member took a very close look at this 
issue. 
He has already proposed amendments to the criminal code. He has 
introduced a bill to facilitate future prosecutions and the 
compensation of individuals, men and women alike, who have been 
treated unfairly or have been found guilty when in fact they 
were not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of miscarriage of justice is very important. It 
is an issue that has interested the Bloc Quebecois for a long 
time. The hon. member for Repentigny has been following it 
closely. He even had a constituent, whose name I forget, who was 
finally found not guilty and had his rights restored. However, 
this individual had to live through being unfairly accused and 
being found guilty of an offence when he was not guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole issue is important, hence our support. 
But here again, this section is in the bill, which contains 
certain provisions with which we are not in agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same question I had at the beginning arises. Do I or do I 
not support the bill?  We will probably support it again but 
we will try to improve as much as possible all these provisions 
which, as far as judicial errors are concerned, are not a 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister could have introduced a bill amending the whole 
issue of judicial errors.  First, this would have shown that 
this is an issue of importance both to the minister and to the 
government.  Everything seems to have been thrown into a huge 
salad bowl, as it were, and mixed around as if to get rid of it. 
This would have shown the government's interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill could have been passed very quickly, so that 
the new legislation could be implemented as quickly as possible 
because, when we look at the provisions proposed by the Minister 
of Justice regarding judicial errors, we see that they are not 
necessarily simple.  It is not because we support it that it is 
simple.  The implementation is very complex.  Care must be taken 
to ensure that errors are not made with respect to the judicial 
errors themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This must be applicable to everyone.  Everyone must be treated 
equitably, without political interference.  The approach must be 
acceptable to everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We seem to be getting there.  It could have been passed.  If it 
were passed quickly, the people who implement it will be able to 
become familiar with this new legislation and do a more 
effective job as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, by introducing an omnibus bill, the minister 
deprives herself of any possibility of proceeding rapidly in the 
sections not contested by anyone in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try, as we go along, to separate them and I think in fact 
that this was already done with another bill.  We will see if it 
is possible to do so.  I will look at this with the House law 
clerks in order to see whether certain parts of the bill can be 
separated before the vote.  It would be very interesting for 
everyone if we could do this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last section deals with firearms.  It is certain that it is 
intended as a response to certain problems, because the minister 
has a problem when its comes to applying the Firearms Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will recall that the Bloc Quebecois voted in favour 
of this bill, but under circumstances which included certain 
comments by the minister of the day which led us to believe that 
the Firearms Act would be implemented and certain common 
objectives would be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they were saying at that time was that implementation of 
the Firearms Act would cost some $100 million to $125 million 
and would thereafter be self-sustaining, year after year, by 
licence fees and so on.  Here we are in 2001 and firearms are 
not even all registered in Quebec.  Perhaps 65% or 70% are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the implementation of this act we are talking not $125 
million but more like $875 million.  Now they are telling us 
that it will not be self-sustaining but will instead cost some 
$100 million to $150 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had been given the right figures in 1995, perhaps our 
position would be different.  We might have voted in favour but 
our position might have been a bit different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have amendments to Bill C-15 that amend the already very 
complex regulations of the Firearms Act.  I would hope that the 
final result of all that will be a faster or improved way to 
register firearms.  I say in all honesty that when I see 
how things work at the Department of Justice, I have my doubts. 
At the point we have reached, however, we will trust the 
government on the registration of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that there is a whole other aspect 
that is not a source of problems either.  Many amendments have 
been made with respect to Nunavut, including certain regulations 
and procedures, and so on, which apply only there.  There is no 
problem, and I think these amendments were sought by the local 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying earlier, other provisions in the bill amend the 
Young Offenders Act. 
I find it very strange that the Minister of Justice is changing 
a law she well knows will be repealed shortly by her decision, 
especially the way she is going about it, not wanting to hear 
any witnesses from Quebec.  The National Defence Act, the 
National Capital Act and other similar acts are being amended as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, I have tried to do a very quick overview. 
This bill will come before the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights.  I will be there, as I am for each and every bill. 
I know that the member for Terrebonne—Blainville will closely 
follow the deliberations of the justice committee and 
consideration of this bill, because she is very interested in 
certain aspects of it.  I invite her to come to the committee 
meetings and I am sure that together we will do a good job with 
Bill C-15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this note, I will reiterate our final position. Even though 
we have a problem with many provisions of Bill C-15, we will 
support it at second reading, while hoping that we can convince 
the Minister of Justice, or rather her department, since it is 
obviously the department that is calling the shots, that they 
are off track with some definitions, which are much too broad. 
There are also a number of difficulties with procedures 
regarding arms, paintballs, the number of joules and the number 
of metres per second being much too complex. A cumulative 
process, not an either or situation, is required. We will try to 
propose all sorts of amendments to the Minister of Justice, to 
improve this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the NDP caucus we find ourselves generally speaking 
in support of the bill at second reading.  There is much work to 
be done in committee as some members have already pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by saying how much I regret that the government 
has decided to bring in an omnibus bill of this kind.  In 
listening to the debate it is already clear that we could have 
had a different scenario before us.  It could have been more 
pleasing to parliamentarians and more pleasing to the public in 
terms of passing expeditiously a number of measures that have 
broad support in the House and among the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the situation we are faced with.  Bill C-15 is an 
omnibus bill containing controversial items which have the 
prospect of delaying the passage of the legislation, and I find 
that very regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not have been better if parliament could speak swiftly 
and emphatically, with one voice, on matters such as: the luring 
of children on the Internet for the purposes of sexual 
exploitation, child pornography with respect to the Internet, the 
seriousness with which we want the criminal code to take the act 
of home invasion, and the disarming of police officers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a short list of the kinds of things that are in the 
bill.  We could have said with one voice that we want these 
things to happen quickly.  We know that our laws need to be 
updated with respect to the new phenomena of the Internet and all 
the criminal possibilities for the exploitation of children that 
the Internet provides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something that is long overdue because it is not as if the 
Internet just showed up yesterday.  It has been around for a long 
time, yet it is only now that we have legislation before us.  It 
is better late than never.  It would have been better if we had 
been presented with a legislative scenario in which we could 
have proceeded to do that right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same applies to home invasion.  This is a relatively new 
phenomena but it has been around for far too many years already. 
There has been a cry on the part of the Canadian public for the 
criminal code and our laws to reflect the seriousness with which 
people regard home invasions.  This is not just any sort of 
ordinary break and enter, not that we should convey any kind of 
ordinariness on acts of break and enter, but home invasion.  Some 
of the things that have gone on offend the senses of propriety, 
decency and morality of all Canadians.  It is something that we 
could have proceeded with quite expeditiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have also proceeded swiftly with the new provisions 
having to do with the luring of children on the Internet.  This 
also applies to the disarming of police officers.  It is not so 
long ago that the Canadian Police Association had its week of 
lobbying here. 
I am sure that it found very few members of parliament who said 
that they were against bringing in the provision dealing with the 
act of disarming police officers.  That too could have been 
proceeded with expeditiously.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps those things could have gone into an omnibus bill and 
they could have been done all at once.  What makes an omnibus 
bill offensive is not necessarily what is in it but what the 
government may be trying to bury within it that it would rather 
not deal with on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a couple of examples of that, and I am not saying that 
because I am necessarily opposed to what the government is doing 
in the bill.  It just makes for bad politics in the best sense of 
the word politics.  It makes it hard for parliament to speak 
clearly about these issues if we must always be speaking about 
more than one issue at the same time when we are speaking about a 
particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may look like good politics in the more pejorative and 
cynical sense from the point of view of the government that it 
insert something that is obviously controversial and was 
controversial in the last parliament.  I refer, for example, to 
the provisions having to do with cruelty to animals.  Instead of 
having them in a separate bill, the government put them in the 
omnibus bill.  People who have concerns about that, whether they 
be right or wrong, would be open to the charge that they are 
holding up new provisions for dealing with the luring of children 
on the Internet when what they are really trying to debate is the 
merits of what the government is doing with respect to cruelty to 
animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is true, as the member from the Alliance alleges, that the 
way in which the legislation is drafted represents a conceptual 
transition or a conceptual leap from regarding animals as 
property to regarding animals as having rights, this is a 
significant conceptual development.  If it is done in a certain 
way it may be a conceptual development that my colleagues and I 
would be in favour of and that would not be unreasonable with 
respect to all the things many people would have to continue to 
do, whether they be hunters, fishermen, farmers or whatever the 
case may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it is something that merits debate in its own right.  It 
should have been dealt with in a separate piece of legislation 
rather than in the context of all the other things I have already 
spoken about.  It could have been dealt with in a way that 
reflects the agreement that exists among members of parliament 
about those provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to bring legislation forward, particularly if we 
are trying to make some kind of moral statement, which I presume 
we are trying to do in Bill C-15, about luring on the Internet, 
child pornography, home invasion and the disarming of police 
officers, in a way that ascribes controversy to those measures by 
tacking them on to things which are controversial.  Why would we 
not want to do that in a way that conveys the full measure of 
support that exists in parliament and in the Canadian public? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the argument to be made for splitting the bill.  I do 
not know if the government is open to that but I doubt it.  It 
seems that it has already made a decision not to do that because 
it has taken formerly separate pieces of legislation and put them 
into the omnibus bill.  I regret it has done that for all the 
reasons I have already discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a lot of work to do in committee, particularly 
with the issue having to do with cruelty to animals, not just in 
terms of that conceptual leap but in terms of definitions and 
just exactly what is meant here.  It may be that I do not know 
what the government has in mind.  There are issues to be looked 
at in terms of cruelty to animals that may not have to do with 
the destruction of animals but with the treatment of animals in 
factory farms. 
I am not even sure it comes within the ambit of the legislation 
but I know there are many Canadians who are becoming concerned 
with the way in which their food is being produced, as well as 
the living conditions of animals.  In some cases it is more the 
pre-dying conditions of animals that are raised and harvested for 
human food purposes.  This is something that obviously has to 
continue to happen but surely there must be a way in some 
instances to do this better than we do now.  However, that may 
well be outside the range of the bill, and I digress.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of controversy in the bill has to do with the 
firearms legislation.  Bill C-15 proposes to put in place certain 
efficiencies with respect to registration so that people can 
register on line, et cetera.  It would change some definitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, although very few of us in the House would look 
forward to a debate centred specifically on this legislation, or 
on firearms registration and control because it has been so 
controversial, I still have to say that it would have been better 
to deal with this by itself.  There is already a lot of suspicion 
out in the community about what the government may or may not be 
up to with firearms registration, and changing definitions in the 
body of a big omnibus bill gives rise to a lot of anxiety and 
suspicion, which may or may not be warranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and perhaps other members of parliament have had a great deal 
of mail from people who enjoy the sport of paintball.  People 
wonder whether or not the definitions in the bill are designed in 
some way, either accidentally or intentionally, to eliminate the 
game of paintball.  I had my staff check with the firearms 
control folks and they say that paintball will not be covered, 
but others say that it might be.  Therefore this is obviously 
something that we need to address in committee not just with 
respect to paintball but with respect to any new definition of 
what constitutes a firearm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is the government's intention to restrict things that are 
not now restricted, such as the registration of things that are 
now not registered, it should be very upfront about it. It should 
not hide it in some type of microcosmic detail about length or 
width of a barrel, how many joules, how many feet per second or 
whatever it is that is used to describe the speed of what comes 
out of the cannon.  It should be very clear with the Canadian 
public about what it is up to.  At this point I do not have that 
feeling.  Maybe the government is not up to anything at all but 
it has not been very clear about making that clear either. This 
is something that will have to be dealt with in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member from the Bloc said, another element of the bill 
deals with the whole question of judicial error, wrongful 
conviction and the setting up of new procedures in respect of 
that.  Again, this is something that could have been done better 
on its own.  After what we have learned with regard to Donald 
Marshall, Guy Morin, David Milgaard and variety of other 
occasions, surely an attempt to put in place new provisions with 
respect to how we deal with wrongful conviction or judicial error 
would have been something that would have merited its own 
legislation and debate and yet the government has chosen not to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all those reasons I want to register our strongest objection 
to the way in which the government is dealing with the bill and 
the fact that it brought in the bill in the first place as an 
omnibus bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister in her presentation said that we had an omnibus 
bill in 1994 and 1996 and she cited examples as if it were some 
kind of virtue or justifying precedent.  The fact is omnibus 
bills have always been offensive to members of parliament. 
Omnibus bills have always allowed governments to put members of 
the opposition, and presumably many of their own backbenchers, in 
a difficult position.  Members who want to vote for A and are 
against B must choose to vote for A and explain why they also 
voted for B, or vice versa.  It does not make for good 
law-making.  It does not make for good politics in the sense of 
having clarity as to what people are for and against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same government that brought in the clarity bill 
which said it was important that the question and the verdict be 
clear.  The government is engaged in an exercise that is quite 
the opposite.  It is engaged in an exercise which, by design, is 
intended to confuse Canadians as to who is for what and in what 
context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I look forward to the bill going to committee 
and to hearing what I am sure will be a great many witnesses.  I 
am sure we will hear concerns about its cruelty to animal 
clauses, its firearms control and registration clauses and 
perhaps a number of other issues.  I regret very much that we 
could not have dealt today with some of the clauses having to do 
with child pornography, luring on the Internet, home invasion and 
disarming a police officer.  I regret that we could not have 
dealt with that in the same way we dealt with Bill S-4 earlier. I 
do not think we would have or should have dealt with it that 
quickly.  It certainly could have gone to committee, witnesses 
could have been heard and this kind of thing could have been on 
the books very soon.  Instead, because the government chose to 
play politics with other things in the bill, it may well take a 
lot longer.  The Liberals will answer to the public for that, not 
the opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise to take part in this debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important debate.  To pick up on the tone of my 
learned colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona, opposition and 
government members alike find themselves in the unfortunate 
situation of having to debate a bill of substance and importance 
that has been essentially cross-threaded and put together in a 
way that is unsettling and disquieting for many Canadians outside 
of parliament.  The bill brings together a number of criminal 
code amendments that are inconsequential and do not connect in 
any rational way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 touches upon issues of wrongful conviction, disarming 
a police officer, cruelty to animals, amendments to the Firearms 
Act and the National Defence Act, and home invasion.  Some of the 
issues are straightforward and deal with changes or modernization 
within the criminal code.  One such change would acknowledge the 
seriousness of trying to take away a police officer's weapon. 
Such changes to the act would allow the judiciary to respond in a 
more proportional way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the bill has controversial aspects as well, particularly 
as they relate to firearms legislation which a growing number of 
Canadians are finding cumbersome, unenforceable and intrusive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps more graphic are concerns over the cruelty to animals 
provisions.  However, because of the omnibus nature of the 
legislation, it is before us as a package.  Hon. members opposite 
applaud that because they know it forces members of the 
opposition to vote for the entire package.  Such members may 
support nine-tenths of the bill yet find in it something 
unacceptable to themselves, to their constituents or to the 
interests they represent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw unanimous consent today for Bill S-4.  The bill went 
through at record pace.  We debated all stages and passed the 
legislation with the greatest spirit of co-operation.  Bill C-15 
is the antithesis of that.  The government is force feeding the 
opposition and saying that while we may not like some of the bill 
we must take it all.  The bill contains very good and needed 
legislation.  However, it is like vanilla ice cream with a little 
motor oil poured on that the government is telling us to eat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Short of dividing up the bill, taking out the offensive 
legislation and studying it separately, there is no way to allow 
opposition members the opportunity to deal with it when it comes 
to a vote.  They can do nothing more than put comments on the 
record.  At the end of the day the final verdict will be whether 
we support the legislation or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us delve into the substance of the bill.  The brave new 
interconnected world is posing new and sadly innovative ways in 
which to transport information.  That of course has implications 
for things like pornography.  Purveyors of child pornography have 
in recent years taken advantage of the new technology.  Internet 
sites and chat rooms are not generally controlled or monitored. 
That raises questions about the responsibility of owners and 
managers of computer networks, such as private Internet access 
providers and universities, for the content of the websites and 
chat rooms they offer their customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Courts in Canada and elsewhere have given little direction in 
this new area of technology.  The Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service, CSIS, 2000 annual report states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The distribution of child pornography is growing proportionately 
with the continuing expansion of Internet use.  Chat rooms 
available throughout the Internet global community further 
facilitate and compound this problem.  The use of the Internet 
has helped pornographers to present and promote their point of 
view. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very disturbing trend.  The legislation would at least 
attempt to control or police the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 deals with the issue in the following ways.  It talks 
about the luring of a child via the Internet.  Clause 14 of the 
bill adds the offence of luring.  The clause states that every 
person commits an offence who, by means of a computer, 
communicates with persons in various age groups and does so for 
the purposes of facilitating the commission of the following 
offences: sexual touching, making of child pornography, procuring 
prostitution of a child under the age of 18, sexual assault, 
sexual assault with a weapon or threats, and aggravated assault. 
These of course are some of the more serious and damaging 
offences that can be committed under the criminal code.  Any 
means, therefore, by which those offences can be perpetrated 
should be governed by criminal legislation.  The bill would do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a defence, I might add, for the accused to say they 
believed the child was over a certain age, whether 18, 16 or 14, 
unless reasonable steps can be demonstrated to ascertain the age 
of the child.  This is a responsible interpretation and expansion 
of the criminal law and it would certainly stabilize efforts to 
police the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to that point, sub-section 11(2) of Bill C-15 adds a new 
offence.  Under the bill, the making, distribution and sale of 
child pornography would also be criminal code offences when 
committed via the Internet.  This is in keeping with supreme 
court decisions, the Queen v Sharpe being the most recent case in 
which the judges had an opportunity to deliberate on the subject. 
The sentence for this type of offence would lead to a person 
being liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or 
an offence punishable on summary conviction.  The Conservative 
Party is in favour of this type of policing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new provision would not criminalize the inadvertent viewing 
of child pornography on the Internet.  The accused must have had 
knowledge of the presence of child pornography on the site or the 
specific intention to use it.  However, the bill would perhaps 
open the door for the justice department to further expand on the 
ways it can prevent and hopefully deter pornography on the 
Internet. 
Bill C-15 gives a rather vague commitment to do so in the future 
and any type of sexual exploitation is something that we must 
condemn in the strongest possible terms.  The Liberal government 
could have passed measures in advance of the supreme court ruling 
in Sharpe.  One of the minister's favourite phrases “In a 
timely fashion,” is code for “When we get around to it”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent examples are the Youth Criminal Justice Act which has 
taken seven years to reach fruition.  It is now of being jammed 
through without proper consultation on some of the changes it 
would bring in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last general election, the Conservative Party was the 
only party to propose a national strategy to combat child 
pornography.  Our proposal would have included Internet safety 
education for children, the training of police in the tracking of 
pornography and the revamping of current laws to ensure we were 
not facilitating high tech prostitution.  We would suggest, in a 
constructive way, that this is another area the government and 
the Minister of Justice look at exploring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concern has been expressed by Internet service providers and the 
high tech industry generally that subclause 163.1(3) would 
subject Internet servers to criminal liability for third party 
content unless they could prove they did not have actual or 
constructive knowledge of the existence of the material.  We will 
perhaps have an opportunity to delve into those issues at the 
committee level when we hear from those affected by the 
legislation.  We look forward to getting their perspectives in 
the hope of amending or tightening up the provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly a positive step, as I indicated.  We must ensure 
that child pornography is not stored on or made available through 
Canadian computer systems without being subject to the criminal 
code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Possible amendments to the section would require that Internet 
service providers, in particular large providers, such as AOL, be 
able to police sites and access information.  This would come at 
great expense but steps have already been taken to do just that. 
Service providers hire staff to take complaints from their users. 
They also monitor Internet chat rooms and supply information to 
the proper authorities if they have reason to believe these 
nefarious activities are taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other aspects of the bill that have been touched upon are the 
provisions that affect paintball operators.  That is the extreme 
sport, as it is sometimes called, with respect to the use of 
paintballs.  The limit of velocity at which paintballs can leave 
the guns is, I understand, 5.7 joules.  I suspect the minister's 
intention was to ban certain types of pellet guns but the limit 
also affects paintball users and operators.  There is concern 
that the technical description of the velocity limit may need to 
be amended with respect to paintballs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding, from talking to people who manage those 
activities, that they are already taking steps to adhere to 
safety standards.  The bill as it is drafted would have serious 
implications for those types of businesses with respect to the 
pointing of a firearm.  If the description of the velocity is not 
amended it may make it a criminal offence to participate in such 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Home invasion and criminal harassment are other areas of 
the bill that we support unequivocally.  Under clause 23 of the bill 
the courts must consider break and enter, robbery and extortion 
as aggressive and aggravating circumstances.  They must consider 
whether a dwelling house was occupied at the time of the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize we must start question period so I will continue my 
remarks at the conclusion of question period.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it appears that some in the Liberal 
cabinet are beginning to warm to the grand theme of democratic 
reform proposed by grassroot citizens of the Canadian Alliance 
right across the country.  We are excited about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that the finance minister's surrogates are telling 
reporters that there is too much power in the office of the Prime 
Minister.  That is a revelation to them and we are excited about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Finance share with us his list of what 
specific powers he will take away from the Prime Minister?  Does 
that list include the requirement to table an annual budget, not 
an update, something that does not happen right now? 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance is an active and very successful 
member of the present Liberal team.  I am glad to hear that the 
Leader of the Opposition is agreeing that whoever follows the 
present Prime Minister in the future it will not be the Leader of 
the Opposition.  It could well be the present Minister of 
Finance. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is very weak.  The Canadian 
Alliance has long insisted on there being an independent ethics 
counsellor for parliament. And, perhaps—surprise, surprise—the 
Minister of Finance, it would appear, is of the same opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did he vote against this idea? 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. leader is speaking of democracy.  If he considers he is 
truly in a democracy, when will he lift the gag on his own 
members? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, avoiding the question will not help 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has said that he will take powers away 
from the Prime Minister's office.  It was the Minister of Finance 
who wrote the red book on the promise to have an independent 
ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the question again, and instead of evasiveness, I 
would ask for a simple yes or no.  Will there be support from the 
government when we return with the question about having an 
independent ethics counsellor?  Will the government follow the 
Minister of Finance who has now changed his mind and is saying 
that we should have an independent counsellor? 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first, the member's premise is wrong.  He is not quoting 
the Minister of Finance.  I read the article very closely.  The 
comments in the article are not those of the Minister of Finance 
himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. Leader of the Opposition not to be evasive.  If 
he believes in democracy when will he take the gag order off his 
own alleged supporters?  Why did he discipline and kick out of 
his caucus a member of his group?  Where is democracy in the 
Alliance?  There is not very much in that party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government cannot get our facts 
right and it cannot get its facts right.  Nobody has been kicked 
out of our caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the Prime Minister my question.  When this came to a 
vote in the House of Commons, why did he order all Liberal MPs to 
vote against their own word of honour, to break their promise and 
to vote against having an independent counsellor?  Could he 
answer that?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if the hon. member were so concerned about parliamentary 
democracy he would not break a fundamental rule and reflect on a 
vote in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members in the House voted in the way that was consistent 
with their own consciences, and what they did was consistent with 
the support of the Canadian people.  If we compare the support of 
the Canadian people in the last election for the Alliance Party 
and the support of the Canadian people for the Liberal Party, the 
present Prime Minister and the people on this side of the House, 
there is a world of difference.  The Alliance Party was 
categorically rejected and it will be rejected again if it 
continues this course of action. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is an interesting juxtaposition.  We have the finance minister 
over here and the industry minister who is actually in charge of 
the ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the industry minister whether or not he is 
willing to bring in legislation, since he is in charge of the 
ethics counsellor, and maybe to nudge his cabinet rival a little 
bit and say that he can bring in new legislation for an 
independent ethics counsellor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am willing to do exactly what the Deputy Prime 
Minister tells me to do.  The Deputy Prime Minister is willing to 
do exactly what this cabinet under our great Prime Minister 
decides to do.  Nothing more and nothing less.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
April 1999, Groupaction contributed $52,000 to the Liberal Party 
and was awarded a $3.5 million contract to manage federal 
sponsorships related to outdoor activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One month later, that same organization, Groupaction, was 
awarded another contract of $615,000 to check if these 
initiatives were good for the federal government's visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the minister of public works explain Groupaction, 
which is a generous Liberal supporter, being  awarded a $615,000 to 
evaluate its own work? 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Groupaction was not awarded a 
contract to evaluate its own work. 
It was awarded a contract to evaluate our sponsorship system 
across the country. Groupaction reported back to us. We also had 
an internal audit. We have issued new guidelines. We have also 
launched a new competition for agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on, we will have an even better program. 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
1997, Groupaction has contributed $122,000 to the Liberal Party. 
It was awarded a $615,000 contract without any call for tenders. 
The minister sees nothing wrong and says that the evaluation was 
not exclusively on Groupaction's work, but it was primarily on 
its work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister admit that this group is not at all in a 
position to evaluate a group of companies of which it is part 
and to set rules to determine if the work was properly done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister not agree that there is a conflict of interest 
here? 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Groupaction qualified as a 
communications agency through a call for tenders in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an accredited agency, it receives mandates from us to seek 
opinions and it also gets contracts. This is a competitive 
process. It is not just a contract. 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Groupaction not only received a generous contract from 
the federal government to manage outdoor activity sponsorships, 
but it was later awarded another generous contract to ensure, 
after the fact, that the work had been productive and well done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest, would 
the minister not agree that it would have been appropriate for 
the contract to do follow-up on the operation of sponsorships to 
be awarded to a company other than the one that had done the 
managing and was then assigned the job of evaluating its own 
performance? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is more than one agency. 
Several agencies handle sponsorships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Groupaction was therefore not evaluating just its own work, but 
the work in general.  We asked it to look into how such a program 
could be improved.  That is what was done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, there has also been an internal audit of the system. 
We have issued new guidelines.  We have launched a new 
competition, which is almost over.  And, as of now, we have a 
better program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is interesting to note that Groupaction recommended 
that the federal government continue these sponsorships, which 
were felt to be very productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately, if the government decided to award the contract to 
evaluate the effectiveness of the sponsorships without going to 
tender, was it not because it knew that this company would tell 
it what it wanted to hear and endorse this new facet of its 
policy of propaganda? 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that the last word of the 
member's question says it all.  That is their problem.  Every 
time they notice the presence of the Government of Canada in 
Quebec, they get nervous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The company in question was successful in a competitive bidding 
process, as were all the other agencies, and a contract was 
awarded in order to evaluate whether sponsorship programs were 
going to meet the objective we had set.  That is what was done, 
in compliance with all the standards and all the rules.

<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
federal Liberals since 1983 have talked about the need for 
enforceable regulations to assure safe drinking water.  After a 
14 year delay, the government finally introduced legislation and 
then let it die on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six more months have past since the most recent election and 
still no federal leadership and no federal legislation.  People 
are dying as a result of this shameful neglect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government address this urgent priority and 
introduce tough, enforceable, national standards to safeguard 
drinking water? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there are national standards.  They were negotiated among all 
governments and Health Canada took the lead in creating them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to the issues that arise is not to simply adopt a new 
law or a new set of guidelines or standards.  If the media 
reports are correct, what is wrong with the water in North 
Battleford is something that is contrary to the existing 
guidelines.  The issue is enforcing them and making sure we have 
follow through by local and provincial governments.  In that 
regard, we intend to continue our efforts working with our 
provincial partners. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is 
exactly the operative word, enforceable.  We thought the 
government was coming to its senses.  We actually thought it was 
about to do something about mandatory, enforceable, national 
water quality standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we hear today from the member for 
Bonavista—Trinity—Conception, the minister of everything?  He 
said that Ottawa was not about to take a leading role, that the 
provinces were responsible.  He said that the provinces should 
develop a plan to fix the problem and then the feds might 
co-operate.  That is what I call leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many Canadians is the government prepared to see die before 
it finally acts? 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the reality is that we have developed, with our provincial 
partners, the very kind of standards that the member is talking 
about.  Access to safe drinking water is one of the fundamental 
rights of citizenship.  We are determined, working with our 
partners, each doing our own part and playing our own role, to 
see that safe drinking water is available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just note something before sitting down.  When we 
introduced Bill C-14 some three years ago dealing with materials 
through which drinking water passes to establish legislative 
standards, the NDP opposed it saying that it was a case of 
misguided— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Fundy—Royal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister says “the reality is”.  The reality is that Canada has 
mere guidelines.  We do not have national, enforceable drinking 
water standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragic events of last year in Walkerton and the recent water 
contamination in North Battleford have shattered Canadians' 
confidence in their drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, Canada has mere guidelines.  Will the government act 
now on a law where Health Canada would provide for national, 
enforceable drinking water standards to protect the health of all 
Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
working with the Minister of the Environment, I would be happy to 
speak with the provinces and territories about building on the 
existing national guidelines, determining whether they are 
prepared to see federal legislation, and finding out how we can 
make them more effective than they already are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not want the member to think that we can solve all 
the problems in drinking water simply by snapping our fingers in 
Ottawa or creating further guidelines or standards.  There has to 
be follow through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a national infrastructure program, for example.  We made 
billions of dollars available to provinces so that working with 
municipalities they could put new treatment systems in place.

</P>
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
comes down to leadership.  In the January throne speech the 
Government of Canada pledged that it would “fulfil its direct 
responsibility for water”.  The federal government has the 
responsibility to provide leadership on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow the House will be voting on a motion that calls for the 
government to enshrine into law national drinking water 
standards.  Will government members join others in the House in 
signalling that parliament cares about drinking water in Canada, 
and will the government vote for the Progressive Conservative 
motion tomorrow? 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we recall that party was in office for many years.  I do not have 
any record before me that during its years in office it created 
any such national legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will look at the resolution tomorrow and we will debate it at 
the appropriate time.  However let me make the point that the 
interest of the government is in seeing that Canadians have 
access to safe and clean drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we worked with the provinces as we have.  That is 
why we made infrastructure money available, and we will continue 
in those efforts.

<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, statistics released today prove what Canadians 
already know, that under the Liberal government we are getting 
poorer and our standard of living is falling behind that of our 
major trading partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact Canadian disposable incomes fell from about 80% to only 
70% of U.S. levels over the past decade.  Why does the finance 
minister keep telling us that everything is A-OK when in fact 
Canada continues to fall behind economically? 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, improving labour productivity is 
a complex, long term problem that requires long term solutions, 
not the kind of quick fixes they are used to over there.  In fact 
they cannot even get their own management regime sorted out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the government introduced policies that would get 
our fiscal house in order, and we have made tremendous progress 
acknowledged the world over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that, the government has made a lot of investments in 
research and development and in policies that encourage 
innovation and entrepreneurship.  Businesses are responding big 
time with investments in machinery and equipment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, no one is accusing them of quick fixes.  What is 
happening big time is a decline in our standard of living.  Per 
capita incomes have fallen to 78% from 87% of U.S. levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about productivity.  Our productivity growth 
is about one-third as high as in the United States.  Why does he 
continue to give us this kind of warmed over Liberal rhetoric 
when Canadians continue to see their standard of living, their 
disposable income and our wealth as a nation decline against 
those of our major trading partner? 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, before the government could deal 
with productivity, we had to get our fiscal house in order.  That 
is why we eliminated the deficit.  We are paying down the debt. 
We are cutting taxes.  We have low inflation.  We have low 
interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business is responding to this positive environment.  In fact 
machinery and equipment investments were up 18.9% in the year 
2000, the fifth consecutive year of strong growth.  Corporate 
taxes will be 5% lower than the combined U.S. state taxes in 
about nine of the bordering states.  We are making the biggest 
tax cuts in Canadian history and our productivity is turning 
around.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, an internal Bank of Canada document indicated that it 
does not in the least reject the idea of a form of monetary union 
between Canada and the United States.  Moreover, Governor Dodge 
seems to be more open than his predecessor to this.  The 
existence of this document, coupled with recent statements by Mr. 
Dodge, suggests that this government is talking out of both sides 
of its mouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Is the government 
not merely trying to conceal the fact that it has gone much 
further than it would like people to think in its consideration 
of a form of monetary union between Canada and the United States? 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance,

like to quote the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, who 
said “Mr. Governor, it is not the floating system I object to, 
far from it.  I think it is the right way to go”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has said time and time again that we are 
committed to a sovereign monetary policy.  That is the best thing

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois, the premier of Quebec, Nobel 
Laureate Robert Mundell, the Fraser and C.D. Howe Institutes, the 
TD Bank, and in particular the Bank of Canada itself are looking 
at the advisability of forming a monetary union between Canada 
and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  When the Minister of 
Finance speaks out against those who defend the principle of a 
single currency, is he trying to lead us on the wrong track or is 
he indicating real disagreement with the Bank of Canada, which 
would surely be a great cause of concern?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are very 
concerned by the American administration's decision to go ahead

Mr. Speaker, NORAD's agreement has just been renewed for a 
further five years between Canada and the United States.  It is a 
very key defence document and is one that works quite well. Both 
countries, working together, can make sure we can survey the 
airspace and the outer space areas in which any object, plane or 
missile could affect security in North America.  It will continue 
to be the case.

like to know how the government can let us think that no decision 
has been made, when the army is proceeding with the joint $600 
million space project, which is linked to the space shield 
project, according to the Canadian army's documents?

<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is not directly linked to national missile 
defence.  It is linked to our responsibilities in NORAD in terms 
of surveillance.  Surveillance of incoming missiles is a part of 
NORAD's current responsibility, so the joint space project fits 
in well with all that.  It does not necessarily relate at all to 
missile defence.

<A NAME="LINK189">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill S-17, an act to amend the Patent Act, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in my place to begin 
second reading of Bill S-17, an act to amend the Patent Act. The 
amendments contained in the bill are simple.  They are 
straightforward.  They have one purpose and one purpose only, and 
that is to bring Canada's Patent Act into compliance with two 
separate rulings of the World Trade Organization, the WTO. They 
maintain the balance that has been struck in Canada's patent 
regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the rulings dealt with a dispute with the United States. 
The U.S. argued that certain old act patents, that is, pre-1989 
patents, do not benefit from a minimum 20 year term of protection 
from the date they were filed as required by the agreement on 
trade related aspects of intellectual property rights, known as 
the TRIPS agreement.  In September 2000, the WTO body sided with 
the U.S. interpretation of the dispute and ruled that Canada's 
patent terms for certain old act patents were inconsistent with 
obligations under the TRIPS agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17 complies with the ruling by establishing the term of 
protection for outstanding old act patents as the greater of 17 
years from the date the application was granted or a minimum of 
20 years from the date the application was filed in Canada as 
defined by the patent rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada already provides a TRIPS compliant term of 20 years from 
the date of filing for patents granted under the new act regime. 
The new act regime has been in effect in Canada since October 1, 
1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second WTO ruling addressed by Bill S-17 is a dispute with 
the European Union.  In the second dispute the WTO ruled in March 
2000 that Canada's stockpiling exception was inconsistent with 
the TRIPS agreement. 
This exception allowed generic drug manufacturers to make and to 
stockpile their version of a patented product during the last six 
months of the patent term.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recall that as part of the same ruling, the 
WTO confirmed the consistency of our early working exception, a 
fundamental component of our patent regime.  The early working 
exception allows third parties to use a patent invention during 
its term of protection for purposes of regulatory approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has already complied with the WTO ruling on 
stockpiling, by way of regulation.  The repeal of the stockpiling 
provisions simply ensures that the Patent Act itself conforms 
with our TRIPS obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today deals exclusively with the issues of 
patent term and stockpiling.  It does not attempt to go into the 
broader aspects of patent protection in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said when I appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Industry, there will be other opportunities to have a broader 
consideration of our intellectual property laws, but it is very 
important that we proceed expeditiously with the amendments 
before us because the WTO has imposed a deadline for compliance 
with the patent term ruling.  Canada has until August 12, 2001 to 
comply.  Otherwise we could face retaliatory trade action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments contained in Bill S-17 would provide extensions 
to certain old act patents that are still in force and that do 
not benefit from a minimum patent term of 20 years from the date 
the patent application was filed.  I should point out that there 
are, relatively speaking, a small number of patents that will be 
affected by this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of January 1, 2001, there were 138,800 outstanding old act 
patents.  Of these, 53,500 had patent terms of less than 20 years 
from the date of filing.  It is important to note that not all of 
these patents have commercial value.  The vast majority do not. 
To date, only the pharmaceutical industry has identified 
commercially significant patents that would be affected by this 
ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also emphasize that not all the old act patents are 
affected by the WTO ruling on patent term.  Of the 138,800 
outstanding old act patents to which I referred, 85,300 of them 
have terms of greater than 20 years from the date of filing. 
These patents are unaffected by the present amendments, as are 
all patents currently being granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because some have expressed concern about how a change in the 
term of patent protection will affect drug costs, let me go into 
this issue in greater detail.  We estimate that the number of 
commercially significant drugs that would benefit from a patent 
term extension is 30.  Of the tens of thousands out there, 30 
would benefit.  The number of affected drugs is relatively 
insignificant when compared to the 5,200 patented and 
non-patented prescription drugs available to Canadians.  The 
average term extension for the patents on the 30 drugs is about 6 
months.  The maximum amount of lost savings resulting from these 
patent term extensions has been estimated at less than one-tenth 
of 1% of drug sales over the eight year period during which the 
affected old act patents expire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These foregone savings can be this great only if two things 
actually happen, the first being that every one of them is copied 
by a generic manufacturer.  This is not likely to happen because 
not every drug has enough of a market to warrant a generic copy. 
However, let us assume for the sake of argument that a generic 
copy is in fact produced.  Second, let us assume that the generic 
copy would capture the entire market for this product immediately 
after its entry.  Again, this is very unlikely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us make our estimate based on these two extreme 
scenarios.  It gives us the worst case scenario.  This is the 
absolute maximum that these amendments would cost our health care 
system:  less than one-tenth of 1%.  The amendments contained in 
Bill S-17 will have no sustained impact on drug prices.  In fact, 
the impacts will be barely noticeable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that members on the other side of the House will 
remind you, that I was once among those who were 
concerned about the impact of our patent regime on drug prices. 
I remain concerned.  When I sat on the opposition benches I 
feared that changes to the Patent Act might tilt the balance 
between supporting innovation and providing drugs at reasonable 
prices. I was concerned that changes would lead to rapid 
increases in drug prices but that quite simply did not happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure all members of the House, although there may be some 
exceptions opposite, will share my satisfaction that drug prices 
have not risen dramatically in Canada since the Patent Act was 
first modernized in 1989.  This year the Canadian Institute for 
Health Information has stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the drug price index(es) have remained relatively 
stable since the early 1990s, it appears that increased 
utilization and the entry of new drugs are the main factors 
behind the increase in drug expenditures. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should quote from authoritative impartial sources when 
engaging in the debate and not quote in a partisan manner the 
views of members on either side of the House.  There are many 
reasons drug expenditures are climbing, but I want to emphasize 
that drug prices are being kept in check. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our current patent regime serves Canadians well.  According to 
the latest report from the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board 
prices in Canada are 11% below the median foreign prices. 
Canadians currently pay 40% less for their patented drugs than 
Americans do.  Americans continue to come to Canada to take 
advantage of our lower drug prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we sit in the House debating the issue, busloads of Americans 
continue to cross the border to buy brand name drugs in Canada at 
up to 40% less than the cost of the same drugs available to them 
in the United States.  I recall that our early working exception, 
which was successfully defended before the WTO, would continue to 
provide Canadians with access to lower priced alternatives as 
soon as possible after expiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out the simple and straightforward nature 
and purpose of the amendments to Bill S-17.  They bring the 
Patent Act into compliance with our intentional obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite may say what they will, but unless Canada does 
as is suggested by members of the New Democratic Party, which is 
to withdraw from international trade rules to establish a fence 
around Canada and say that we will trade only with ourselves, we 
have to comply with WTO rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that in the province of British Columbia the 
New Democratic Party is about to suffer a humiliating defeat when 
its members live with their heads in the sand and do not respond 
to the needs of ordinary working Canadians?  Is it any wonder 
that people currently working in the auto manufacturing plants in 
southern Ontario and in the province of Quebec have 
overwhelmingly turned away from the New Democratic Party?  Is it 
any wonder they have turned away when all of these people rely on 
exports for their jobs, and when all these people have been 
described by the leader of the NDP as being rich Canadians not 
paying enough taxes because they work an overtime shift at an 
auto plant? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder the party is going the way of the dodo bird.  It is no 
surprise the member opposite lost his pants recently when he was 
out in the middle of a melee in the protest of Quebec City. 
However, I digress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, now is not the time for a protracted debate about 
whether Canada's patent laws need to be changed.  Once the bill 
is passed we will have other opportunities to engage in a broader 
dialogue on the role of intellectual property, building an 
innovative economy and sustaining an attractive environment for 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's objective is to build a world leading economy, 
one that is driven by innovation, ideas and talent, an economy 
that produces goods and services which compete in terms of 
quality and price with the best in the world.  We need a strong 
and moderate intellectual property framework, one that protects 
creativity and innovation, one that helps us attract talent and 
investment from around the world.  The amendments to Bill S-17 
would help maintain Canada's leadership in the global knowledge 
based society.

their consideration of the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to take part in the debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize the Minister of Industry was away from the House and 
from parliament for a few years.  I thought he was down east in 
Newfoundland but obviously he was further east than that.  He was 
in the Middle East on the road to Damascus because he certainly 
had a conversion along the way in this drug patent regulation and 
on free trade.  I would say good for him.  He may have been slow 
but he finally got there, and I am glad he and the Liberal Party 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise to speak today on the subject of Bill S-17, an act to 
amend the Patent Act.  The purpose of Bill S-17 is to bring the 
Patent Act into compliance with our international obligations, 
obligations that Canada signed many years ago.  These obligations 
stem from the trade related aspects of the intellectual property 
rights agreement, commonly known as TRIPS, which Canada and all 
other members of the World Trade Organization, approximately 145 
members now, are signatories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17 would amend the Patent Act to implement two rulings 
made by the World Trade Organization against Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October of last year, the WTO ruled against Canada on a 
complaint initiated by the United States.  At issue was Canada's 
term of protection of old act patents or pre-1989 patents that 
did not conform with TRIPS.  The TRIPS agreement requires WTO 
members to provide a patent term of 20 years from the date a 
patent application is filed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New act patents are those patents that were granted since 1989 
and already conform with a patent term of 20 years from the date 
of filing and are not affected by the WTO ruling.   However old 
act patents, patents that were made before 1989, were only given 
17 years at that time.  Bill S-17 would change section 45 of the 
act to provide old act patents a 20 year term of patent 
protection which is in line with our TRIPS agreement.  According 
to Industry Canada, the amendment would affect 53,500 patents, of 
which 30 are commercially significant drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second ruling was from 1997.  The European Union initiated a 
WTO dispute settlement process against Canada over two exceptions 
to an action for patent infringement.  Since 1992 the Canadian 
Patent Act allowed generic drug companies to develop a generic 
version of the patented drug in order to obtain regulatory 
approval and to manufacture and stockpile a patented drug before 
the patent had expired.  The European Union claimed that both 
these exceptions were inconsistent with the TRIPS agreement. 
However the WTO determined that Canada's early working exception 
was consistent with TRIPS but not the stockpiling provision that 
we had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17 would implement the WTO ruling by revoking the 
manufacture and storage of patent medicine regulations, 
regulations to prevent the infringement of a patent by any person 
that would be enacted by order in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance recognizes that the right to own property 
and benefit from private property is an important aspect, 
including intellectual properties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to briefly mention that a relative of mine from 
Peterborough by the name of John Stephenson patented the first 
Peterborough canoe in about 1879.  I recently had the opportunity 
to see that patent when I visited the Peterborough canoe museum. 
Canoeing was a way of travel in those days.  There were no 
railways and no highways.  The lakes and rivers were the highways 
of Canada.  He developed a new cedar strip canoe what eventually 
went on to become the Peterborough Canoe Company known all over 
the world.  He applied for and received a patent for that over 
100 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that it is important to protect one's property.  It 
lies at the very heart of our legal and economic systems and it 
distinguishes us in a free society.  Moreover, the protection of 
intellectual property, domestically and internationally, is the 
foundation necessary for a knowledge based economy.  By passing 
the bill, Canada would send the right signals to the 
international community that we take our obligations very 
seriously. 
We need to do that because so much of our trade depends on 
outside sources.  I believe that over 45% of our gross domestic 
product now comes from exports and it is rising every year. 
Canada's prosperity depends on trade that is based on rules and 
international agreements.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a medium sized economy, Canada cannot compete with the big 
players who can throw their weight around on the world scene in 
terms of subsidies, countervailing duties and trade wars.  We 
simply cannot afford to do that.  We need the rules based system 
to protect us.  However, we can compete and win in an open rules 
based trading regime with a dispute settling mechanism based on 
law, such as the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will digress for a moment and talk about the softwood lumber 
dispute that is currently happening with the expiry of the 
softwood lumber agreement.  This could well end up at the World 
Trade Organization.  Canada could win that dispute but we need 
international organizations, like the WTO, with the rules that 
are provided, in order to ensure Canada's prosperity in things 
like our forestry industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, we cannot ignore rulings when they go against us. 
We have to bring our laws into line with the obligations we 
signed internationally, which is what we are doing here.  We may 
not like the decisions that come out against us from time to time 
but there is no question that we benefit from the stability and 
clarity that the WTO provides to world trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, it was the United States that challenged 
Canada's treatment of pre-1989 patents at the WTO.  Two way trade 
in goods and services between Canada and the United States jumped 
up from $626 billion in 1999 to $700 billion in 2000.  Canada 
exported $130 billion more worth of goods and services to the 
United States than we imported from our southern neighbours. This 
is a fantastic achievement for a small country of 30 million 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada also sells more to the United States than any other 
country does by a wide margin.  In 1999 Canada's market share in 
key markets in the United States was close to 20% of its overall 
consumption in the United States.  Mexico's market share in the 
same markets was just over 10%.  A lot of people in the United 
States and even in Canada do not realize who is the biggest 
supplier to the United States.  We are by far.  While Mexico is 
making inroads, Mexico's market share in the same market was just 
over 10%.  A combination of all 15 countries of the European 
Union together have a market share roughly the same size as 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian-American rules based trading relationship is very 
important to Canadian prosperity and has been the model for the 
world to follow.  In fact 87% of our exports last year went to 
the United States and it is rising every year.  We benefit 
greatly by having a terrific neighbour to the south that takes a 
lot of the good products that we manufacture.  However, we do 
need the protection of trade agreements, like NAFTA and the World 
Trade Organization, to ensure that continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The generic drug companies have expressed their understanding 
that the WTO rulings must be implemented.  They have also 
indicated their dissatisfaction with the way the drug patent 
regulations are being implemented.  For example, the generic 
companies feel that the research based drug companies are able to 
extend their patent beyond 20 years through the notice of 
compliance linkage regulations.  Some argue that this two year 
process is not in Canada's best interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate over the regulatory environment for drug patents is a 
very important one but it should not slow down the passage of the 
bill.  Bill S-17 is basically a technical bill designed to enable 
Canada to comply with its international obligations.  The WTO 
gave Canada until August 12, 2001 to implement the 
recommendations and the rules arising from the U.S. and European 
Union challenges.  It is time to pass the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the debate on drug patent regulations is very 
significant, it should not affect the passage of Bill S-17. 
While appearing before the Senate banking committee on trade and 
commerce, the Minister of Industry had to eat a little bit of 
crow about his past comments regarding drug compliance.  He 
promised to take a much broader look at the drug patent 
regulations in the fall. 
I applaud him for both admitting that he was wrong in the 1980s 
and now looking at how we should handle our new drug patent 
regulations.  I am also pleased he recognized the current dispute 
between the generic and research based drug companies and 
promised a role for parliamentarians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the industry committee should do a separate study 
regarding the issue of notice of compliance and the two year 
stay.  It is an important debate and all things have to be put on 
the table.  It would be a good opportunity to do it at the 
industry committee.  I suggest to the minister that is where it 
should start, but it should not affect the passage of the current 
legislation we have before us.  Bill S-17 should be passed and 
then let us deal with that issue to see who is right on the 
notice of compliance.  It should be a separate issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will co-operate from our side.  We want to see Bill S-17 
passed.  We think the issue of the generic and patent drugs with 
regard to the timeframe pass the 20 year patent, the notice of 
compliance and the two year stay are all important issues that 
need public airing.  I challenge the Minister of Industry to make 
sure that happens. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise to speak to Bill S-17, an act to amend the Patent Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois believe that the issue of intellectual 
property is fundamental and important in the context of 
stimulating innovation and creativity, especially in the health 
sector where access to the latest discoveries and to new 
technologies enables us to make extraordinary discoveries that 
help treat diseases, old or new.  Huge effort and investment in 
research and development is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to encourage research and development in business, 
discoveries must be properly protected through the protection 
of intellectual property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill corrects two discrepancies that unfortunately had to 
go through an international body.  We could have done the work 
ourselves without waiting for the WTO to reach its decisions, 
which informed us that old provisions with respect to products 
covered under old legislation dating from the early 1990s 
created a problem with respect to the effective protection 
afforded these patents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will therefore be technical amendments, in short, nothing 
basic, to the focus of the policy on the protection of 
intellectual property.  I hope the bill will not, once again, 
become a debate on the need to protect those doing research and 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, if we were to go in that direction, I hope 
we would insist on strengthening and improving the protection 
afforded to those who make discoveries. Even though we are 
complying with international conventions, the level of 
protection of patents is lagging somewhat behind that of the 
United States and the countries of the European Union, among 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be realized that the discovery of a drug is not a simple 
process. It is extremely costly. On average, we are talking 
about an investment that may vary from $300 million to $500 
million U.S. to discover a drug that will be a significant 
improvement. A patent for a new product is a huge investment 
that must later be recovered by these companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shorter the period the higher the price will be. However, 
if the period of protection of the product on the market is 
long, the recovery of that investment may take place over a 
longer period. We will then have access to a quality drug that 
will cost less than if the protection period were very short. It 
may well take 10 years before a promising molecule or a 
brilliant idea is marketed as a commercial product, given the 
process at Health Canada, among others, for certification, the 
clinical tests, the four test phases and so on. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, the patent has an actual lifespan of about 10 years 
on the average.  We are not necessarily talking of those that go 
on for 20 years in practice.  Obviously the product is patented 
as soon as it is discovered but just being discovered does not 
put it on the market the very next day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this situation, when protection is given for a certain 
length of time, the day that protection expires we hope to see 
the dynamics of competition set in.  Thus there will be generic 
versions that are far less expensive because copying a product 
does not require anything like the investment discovering one 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to be sure of is that once a patent has expired 
there will be a competitive market in which the various 
companies operate on the marketplace.  There is a special 
situation in the Canadian market, however, because of the highly 
aggressive nature of the generic industry.  It has every right 
to be that way.  In each of these debates, it voices the same 
desire to at last find ways of reducing the true scope of patent 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no objections once a patent has expired to the industry 
having access to the market within the normal rules of 
competition. 
We do however have to ensure that there is a proper period of 
protection for patented products, so that the public can have 
hopes for significant discoveries relating to numerous 
conditions and health problems that cannot yet be treated and 
investment can be attracted to our country's high calibre 
scientific community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course I am most familiar with the situation in Quebec but I 
do know that the industry has also developed in other provinces. 
Ontario too has a sizeable industry.  As well, there is a very 
strong emergence of biotechnology research in this area.  In 
order to develop and maintain our quality of research and keep 
our researchers here, however, they need to be able to work 
within a framework in which there are advantageous rules on 
intellectual property.  This we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, with the university network, for instance, and many 
companies, we have know-how that makes us one of the best places 
in the world in which to do this kind of research.  We have every 
interest in further developing this industry, which will benefit 
citizens through the discoveries we make in health, as well as 
economically, and in having a scientific community such as this 
present in our territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is to say that, although this is a good opportunity to 
pay tribute to all the work done by those working in this 
industry and to encourage them to invest even more because we 
want more research and development, I do not want to see this 
debate drag on too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obviously a bill intended to comply with WTO rulings.  We 
are therefore going to treat it accordingly.  We hope the debate 
in committee will be rapid.  The committee is obviously its own 
master but as a member I can already say that we will be among 
those who hope that the debate is speedy, that the bill will be 
approved in committee and that eventually it will come back to 
the House for final approval in order to clarify the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we are going to send a clear 
message at the same time that there is no question of reviewing 
or weakening the rules of intellectual property.  The Minister of 
Industry is with us on this.  I know the government has set 
itself the ambitious goal of ensuring that research and 
development Canada wide will double in the next 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will require a framework to protect intellectual property 
and freedom from the fear of threat for those working in 
innovative industry.  These people must be told clearly that 
the measures to be taken in the future, if there were to be 
others, will not weaken intellectual property but rather 
strengthen it and further develop all those who contribute to 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Quebec, they are many, and I hope there will be 
more of them in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, 
all of this within certain restrictions but in a context in 
which the industry has essentially honoured its commitments to 
increasing research.  I think over $900 million is spent on 
research annually.  The number of jobs has grown since the 
passage of the legislation on patent protection. 
This is what the industry had predicted and this is what 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude I would point out that there is an important 
body whose role it is to protect consumers.  It is the Conseil 
du prix des médicaments brevetés.  Its role is to ensure that 
the price of patented drugs on the market is reasonable and does 
not rise inordinately.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the limits of a protective framework for intellectual 
property, with an efficient Patented Medicine Prices Review 
Board, we are in a position to have a balanced approach to permit 
the emergence of a very solid industry.  We are also in a 
position to produce products of increasing value to consumers, 
which in some cases will help reduce hospital stays and provide 
non-surgical solutions without increasing health costs.  There is 
often a perception that drugs increase health system costs. In 
some cases, drug use can reduce costs because hospitalization 
will be avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With our greying population, we have a duty to provide a 
context, an environment that is favourable to research and 
development, in this sector as in others.  This one, however, is 
a sector that affects all those whom we represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will co-operate in ensuring that the bill gets through as 
promptly as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of members of the New Democratic Party to say that 
we are strongly opposed to this unfair and inequitable bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was frankly very disappointed to hear members of the Bloc 
Quebecois, who claim to belong to a social democratic party, 
giving such amazing support to the demands of pharmaceutical 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, there is only one party in this parliament which is 
fighting for the poor, for ordinary people, who are saying that 
the big pharmaceutical companies do not need more handouts from 
their friends in government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the Minister of Industry in the House today.  We have had 
the privilege of serving together in the House since 1979.  I am 
one of the few members of the House who was in the House with the 
minister in 1987 when he spoke with passion, eloquence and vigour 
in total opposition to Bill C-22.  He called it a giveaway to the 
multinational pharmaceutical companies.  He was absolutely right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one memorable quote he said that Bill C-22 would suck the 
life's blood out of Canada's poorer citizens.  I recall it well. 
The minister was up on his hind legs speaking out and screaming 
out strongly for justice for Canada's poorer citizens. That was 
he and the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 passed.  Then in 1992 what did we have?  We had 
another bill, Bill C-91, another Conservative bill and another 
giveaway to the pharmaceutical drug companies.  What did the 
Minister of Industry have to say at that time?  On behalf of his 
Liberal colleagues, along with the member for Dartmouth and many 
others, he denounced that legislation and bitterly complained it 
would lead to a massive increase in the price of pharmaceutical 
drugs in Canada.  The minister was absolutely right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the increases in the price of drugs in Canada, 
it is the fastest growing component of our health care system, 
far faster than the increase in the price of physician services. 
Indeed it is the biggest single component of our health care 
system, as my colleague for Winnipeg North Centre pointed out so 
strongly on a number of occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past 15 years I would point out that Canada's 
prescription drug bill has jumped by 344%.  That is 15 years 
since the Minister of Industry warned Canadians about what would 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as if these pharmaceutical drug companies are 
suffering. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is suggesting that the poor pharmaceutical 
companies must be defended.  It is sad, such a pity, the poor 
pharmaceutical companies need defending by the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look, for example, at the largest pharmaceutical company, 
GlaxoSmithKline, which made profits of some $11.9 billion in one 
year.  It does not need the Bloc Quebecois to defend it.  That is 
clear.  Those who need defending are consumers.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the consumer, patients, the poor and provincial drug plans 
that need defence from the government and from their allies in 
all of the other opposition parties.  What an unholy alliance the 
Liberal government, the Alliance, the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Conservatives.  At least the Conservatives have been consistent. 
They have been consistently wrong but at least they have been 
consistent, not like the Minister of Industry who has done the 
most extraordinary flip-flops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a sight to behold in Davos, Switzerland.  I wish I could 
have been there to see the Minister of Industry speaking in 
Davos, Switzerland and saying “I fess up, I was wrong Brian”. 
Brian Mulroney was standing there as proud as punch as the 
Minister of Industry stood and said he was wrong, the Liberals 
were wrong and that he was right, NAFTA was a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks later he stood in front of the senate, that great 
bastion of democracy.  That was another occasion when he said he 
had it all wrong back in 1987 on Bill C-22, that the 
Conservatives were right and the pharmaceutical industry was 
right.  He was there to defend the interests of those poor, 
suffering pharmaceutical companies.  Why?  Because the WTO told 
him that they no choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a shameful spectacle this is.  Why should we ever believe 
anything the minister and the government have to say.  I know the 
Speaker, a man of integrity and respect, will recall those 
debates because he was in the House.  Indeed I dare say he 
participated in one or two of them.  I am not going to pull out 
the speeches of the Speaker because I know that would be entirely 
unparliamentary.  However it is certainly appropriate to remind 
the Minister of Industry of exactly what he said.  We used to 
have the lowest priced pharmaceutical drugs in the world.  Now, 
as we have seen, drug prices have risen dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister indicated, the purpose of the legislation is to 
implement a WTO tribunal order.  We were challenged by the 
European Union and the United States that our existing generous 
provisions for patent protection were not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until this bill becomes law, the generic drug industry is at 
least allowed to stockpile and to get their drugs ready six 
months before the expiry of a patent so that when that patent 
expires consumers, Canadians who are sick, will be in a position 
to buy those generic drugs quickly.  That is something the 
Minister of Industry supported long ago, but not anymore.  Now 
they are saying no.  Even that six month stockpiling opportunity 
is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is retroactively extending from 17 years to 20 
years the patent protection.  This is a retroactive gift to the 
pharmaceutical industry approved by the Bloc, the Alliance and 
the Conservatives.  Why on earth would the government give this 
retroactive gift to the struggling pharmaceutical industry that 
just reported massive record profits?  In another day the 
minister would have been the first on his feet condemning this 
largesse to an industry that has already been treated far too 
generously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As New Democrats, we say that this is unacceptable.  When we 
look at the history of this legislation, it is quite shocking to 
know that not that long ago under GATT there was no reference at 
all to intellectual property.  In fact it was only after the 
Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that 
intellectual property was protected in these so-called trade 
deals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is another reason why as New Democrats we are deeply 
concerned about the impact of the proposed FTAA, the free trade 
of the Americas agreement.  We know what the Americans are 
pushing for even more protection.  Let us be very clear, it is 
only the Americans in this hemisphere that are exporting that. It 
is only those big, multinational American pharmaceutical 
companies that benefit from this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Government of Canada and the Minister for International 
Trade standing up on behalf of Canadians and people throughout 
the hemisphere and saying to the Americans that there is 
something wrong with this picture and that they do not support 
extending the patent protection to 25 years from 20 years?  No, 
there is not a word, not a peep.  There is silence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trade department keeps telling us to go to its website to 
find out what Canada's position is.  If we go to the website, 
under intellectual property rights is a summary of Canada's 
position.  Where is the leadership?  Is the government speaking 
out for consumers?  Is it speaking out for the poor?  This is 
what the department had to say on intellectual property rights. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, Canada has made no submissions to the Negotiating Group 
on (intellectual property rights).  Any submission made by Canada 
will be made available on the website. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the leadership.  The government has nothing to say. 
The Minister for International Trade has nothing to say about one 
of the most shameful abuses of power by pharmaceutical drug 
companies.  That is their attempt to muscle the government of 
Brazil in this hemisphere into increasing dramatically the prices 
of drugs that are made available for people living with HIV and 
AIDS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently there was a major victory in South Africa when under 
tremendous international pressure 39 pharmaceutical companies, 
which were suing the South African government under the WTO, were 
forced to withdraw that suit because it was obvious they were 
suffering from international shame.  They were trying to tell the 
South African government and health ministry that they had no 
choice that, even in the face of a catastrophic epidemic of 
HIV-AIDS throughout sub-Saharan and South Africa, the interests of 
multinational drug companies had to come ahead of the interests 
of patients.  Profits before patients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of South Africa, they were shamed into backtracking 
and with no thanks to the Government of Canada or the Liberal 
government.  We called on them to show some leadership in a 
situation of absolute crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 25 million people infected with the AIDS virus in 
sub-Saharan and Africa out of 34 million globally.  The 
multinational pharmaceutical companies want to prevent them from 
having access to affordable drugs. That is absolutely shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we see the same thing in this hemisphere in Brazil.  We 
know that in Brazil the government has shown some extraordinary 
leadership in making generic drugs available.  It has had a very 
powerful and significant impact in reducing the incidence of 
HIV-AIDS.  In 1994 the World Bank predicted that by the year 
2000, Brazil would have 1.2 million AIDS carriers.  Today there 
are less than half of that.  There are about 540,000.  There are 
still far too many.  Thanks to the courage of the Brazilian 
government in taking on these multinational pharmaceutical 
companies, it was able to make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As New Democrats we do not want to see the intellectual property 
rights of pharmaceutical drug companies enshrined and enhanced in 
the FTAA. 
We want to see a new regime where people are put before profits 
and pharmaceutical drug companies are accountable to the people 
in the hemisphere and globally.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not speaking in any way on behalf of my party, but I often 
wonder why we believe that in an industry as fundamental to 
public health and security as the pharmaceutical industry should 
be driven on the basis of profit.  We have a situation now in 
which only a tiny amount of money, something like $300 million 
globally, is being spent by the pharmaceutical drug industry in 
the struggle to find a vaccine.  Why is that?  Because if it 
finds a vaccine, it finds a cure and then shares in the 
pharmaceutical drug companies will not be worth as much money. 
There is something obscene about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation as well where researchers are working for 
this pharmaceutical drug company or that pharmaceutical drug 
company.  They are all working in splendid isolation, not 
co-operating with one another and desperately trying to find what 
will make them more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that instead of accepting that the market is God when 
it comes to pharmaceutical drugs, it would make a lot more sense 
for us to say that this should be in the public domain, those who 
serve in the health care industry, those who research, those who 
try to find cures and the government.  The public domain should 
be involved.  Health care, and in particular the pharmaceutical 
industry, should be owned by the people not by those who seek to 
maximize global profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, as New Democrats we do not accept this loss of 
democracy through the WTO, through the TRIPS agreement, the 
expansion of GATT and now the FTAA.  More and more we are losing 
democracy in this country.  More and more as elected 
representatives we are losing our ability to make decisions about 
what is in the best interests of the people who we represent. 
Bill S-17 is an other example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As elected representatives, as members of parliament, why should 
we not be in a position to have a public policy debate in Canada 
about whether 17 years is good enough, or 20 years is good enough 
or whether compulsory licensing is acceptable as a means of 
ensuring that, as long as this is in the private sector, there is 
still an incentive to bring new drugs on the market?  However not 
in a way that jeopardizes access to affordable drugs for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That should be a decision we make.  However, the Minister of 
Industry comes before the House and says, “Tough luck. Forget 
it.  You no longer have an option”.  As an elected government we 
no longer have an option.   We have no choice because the WTO is 
forcing us to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason why every member of the New Democratic caucus marched 
in the streets of Quebec City against that FTAA agenda was 
because we believe in democracy.  The agenda of the FTAA, the WTO 
and GATT is an assault on that democracy.  This bill is an 
example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of moving forward with this legislation, which we 
vigorously oppose as New Democrats, I call on the government to 
take a strong stand at the WTO and in the negotiations on the 
FTAA for affordable accessible drugs for people who are suffering 
from HIV-AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, Médecins Sans Frontières called on the minister of 
trade not to bow to pressure from pharmaceutical drug companies 
to further strengthen drug patents.  John Foster from the 
North-South Institute said “It's is absolutely tragic that the 
minister of trade has absolutely no position on this issue”, the 
issue of access to affordable pharmaceutical drugs in Brazil.  He 
went on to say “although from prior positions we believe he goes 
along with United States, drug companies and those in favour of 
even firmer patent laws”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We call on the government to stand up for democracy and 
affordable drugs.  Not extend even further the patent protections 
that are afforded to pharmaceutical drug companies, but recognize 
that they have already done very well under this legislation. 
They say they need resources for development of new drugs, yet 
the reality is that these same drug manufacturers spend twice as 
much money on marketing their drugs, on pushing their drugs, as 
they do on research and development.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the member for Burnaby—Douglas for a passionate 
speech and a speech that I know comes from the heart.  As a 
veteran in this place, he has seen this debate come and go 
through many incarnations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member pointed out some things that took place before I came 
to the House of Commons.  One is the unbelievable reversal in and 
around 1992 and 1993 when the Tory government brought in Bill 
C-91.  I remember it well.  There was outrage, a hue and cry, and 
activists were taking to the streets over Bill C-91.  The Liberal 
Party, at that time in opposition and running for government, 
condemned Bill C-91.  It actively hammered away at the ideas that 
Bill C-91 would jack up and spiral and escalate drug prices.  The 
Liberals said it would limit the ability of generic drug 
companies to put necessary drugs into the hands of Canadians at 
less cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I even remember when the member of parliament for Winnipeg North 
Centre at that time, David Walker, the candidate I ran against, 
toured a task force on Bill C-91 right around the country.  In 
fact, on the behalf of some people there was great hope and 
optimism when the Liberal government took power that this task 
force would come back with some relief, some hope, some optimism, 
and that we would be able to get out from under this millstone of 
this lengthy patent protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the results of that touring task force, chaired by the 
member for Winnipeg North Centre at the time, were that the 
members came back and said there was nothing we could do, that we 
had traded away our ability to have a domestic pharmaceutical 
policy and even our ability to look after the interests of 
Canadians before the interests of multinational drug companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly I would like to hear more recollections from the member 
for Burnaby—Douglas in regard to exactly what transpired in that 
period of time.  I would like the member for Burnaby—Douglas to 
explain what he thinks the Liberals' thought process was to 
enable them to do such a dramatic flip-flop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly I appreciate 
the comments and the question of the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Centre, who has been in the forefront of the struggle in the 
House, and indeed in his previous life, for affordable, 
accessible drugs for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not for a minute suggest that the flip-flop of the 
Liberals from their position in 1987 on Bill C-22 and from their 
position in 1992 on Bill C-91 had anything to do with the massive 
amount of money that they get every year from pharmaceutical drug 
companies as donations to the Liberal Party of Canada.  Of course 
not.  That has absolutely nothing to do with it.  I know that the 
Bloc position has absolutely nothing to do with that either. J'en 
suis certain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to take advantage of the opportunity that has been 
afforded to me by the member for Winnipeg Centre to share with 
the House some of the statements that were made by the Minister 
of Industry, then a member from Newfoundland and Labrador.  On 
November 16, 1992, the Minister of Industry spoke in the House, 
then in opposition of course, on Bill C-91.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said we have lower health care costs in Canada on a per 
capita basis than they do in the United States largely because of 
our prescription drug program, which this government wants to do 
away with.  What are we to conclude from that other than that the 
government wants to increase the cost of health care in Canada? 
It will do that at the expense of the taxpaying public and at the 
expense of the provincial governments because provincial 
governments in many cases will buy, through their drug plans, 
significant quantities of these same pharmaceutical drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry went on to read from a text that talked 
about the burden of changing patent legislation.  He said 
“Extending the patent life of drugs is likely to cost consumers 
immediately and also add to the burden on the government health 
plans, which are already under economic pressure.  Compared with 
hospital and doctors' bills, prescription drugs are a relatively 
small though rapidly growing expense”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member pointed out that even in the United States people 
were lauding Canada's generic drug system, saying “However, here 
in Canada the government wants to do away with it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would note, and my colleague from Regina pointed this out a 
few minutes ago, that the cost of just this one amendment to Bill 
S-17 will be over $200 million to Canadian taxpayers, both 
through pharmaceutical drug plans and of course directly for 
those who are not covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that we are giving a $200 million gift to 
pharmaceutical drug companies in this country?  There is 
absolutely no excuse whatsoever for that.  For that reason as 
well, we as New Democrats strongly oppose this legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
clarify a couple of things for the benefit of those who are 
following this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, the hon. member just made a very simplistic speech 
that borders on demagoguery for a number of reasons. His 
position can be summarized as follows: if a private company in 
which individuals invest does research and makes a discovery, 
the next day anyone should be allowed to copy this discovery. 
Basically, companies are expected to discover drugs and develop 
new products in a philanthropic fashion. That pretty much sums 
up the NDP's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad that the hon. member mentioned AIDS. I will tell him 
about 3TC, a medication he knows a great deal about, which was 
discovered by BioChem Pharma, precisely in an environment that 
provided some protection to intellectual property. A drug must 
be discovered before it can be made accessible. And for it to be 
discovered, we must invest in research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the hon. member's model, the state must engage in research 
and development so that everything will be fine. I doubt it. It 
is a very good thing in an industry to have motivated people who 
are knowledgeable in their field doing research in partnership 
with health care and educational institutions and discovering 
new products. Naturally, some are motivated by profit, but so 
what? It just makes them spend even more time and energy on 
research. What we are doing is providing some protection to 
these people for a while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the protection is reduced or the protection period shortened, 
it will not result in cheaper prices for drugs, on the contrary. 
The less time these companies have to recover their investment, 
the more they will charge for their products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solutions proposed by the NDP would result in drug prices 
that would be even higher than they are now. I hope that the 
hon. member does not really believe what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope the Bloc member will 
take another look at history, because he totally lacks any 
historical perspective on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the Patent Act of 1987, pharmaceutical companies were 
making huge profits. They had one of the highest levels of 
profits among Canadian industries. In the meantime, because of 
the compulsory licensing program set up in 1969, under a Liberal 
government I must add, drugs were quite affordable, especially 
for the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion that we cannot have at the same time drugs being 
sold at a reasonable price and large pharmaceuticals ringing in 
huge profits is patently false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, in the NDP, do not agree with the Bloc members that we have 
to focus on the profits of the pharmaceutical companies. 
It may be their objective but that is not a very social 
democratic position for the Bloc to be taking.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I as well listened to the 
Minister of Industry's speech, the general drift of which was 
that we should just let Bill S-17 pass and there would be ample 
opportunity in the future for us to revisit the whole idea of 
lengthy patent protection and some sort of domestic 
pharmaceutical policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for Burnaby—Douglas believe that we still have 
the domestic ability to negotiate these things or have trade 
agreements limited our ability to have a domestic policy in that 
regard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the short answer is that 
we have ceded much of our sovereignty already.  Surely before we 
succeed in dismantling democracy and sovereignty in Canada, we 
have to stand up and fight back and say no to the WTO forcing 
this kind of change on Canadians in our pharmaceutical drug 
policies.  Unless we say no now there will be no opportunity to 
change this in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to say a few words on Bill S-17.  It is an 
interesting day in the House as we see the debate unfold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people across the country think that when one is in 
government one agrees with certain things but when the shoe is on 
the other foot one always objects to whatever government does. In 
a couple of cases here, that is not factual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After listening to the debate from our friends in the NDP, I 
would say that it is quite clear that they stand where they 
always did on the issue.  I will be making it quite clear that in 
my party we stand where we have always stood on the issue.  In 
this case, we support the bill, as we did when the original bills 
were introduced by the Tory government and, as has been pointed 
out a number of times today, objected to strenuously by the then 
opposition party, which is now the governing party.  It is 
amazing how the tide turns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not think I would be supporting my friend and colleague, 
the minister of trade and industry.  It is very difficult to do 
in light of several issues about which we thoroughly disagree. 
However, my party does support him on this issue because the bill 
itself was a Tory initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain to my friends from the NDP why we support it and 
I think by the time I am finished they will also perhaps agree 
with us and support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is interesting to note that the government of today 
was against the original bills, Bill C-91 and Bill C-22, when 
they were introduced in 1987 and 1992.  The more interesting 
parts of all of this are some of the comments made by those who 
are now government members.  Some of the people who voted against 
those bills, by the way, were the present Deputy Prime Minister 
and present government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 during the debate on Bill C-22, the minister of industry 
and trade, who is sponsoring this bill, said “It is 
inconceivable to me that parliament finds it necessary yet again 
to deal with yet another measure proposed by the government 
because it is bound and chained to some ideological dictate which 
says this kind of patent act is necessary”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure he was reading from a prepared speech when he said 
that.  However, at the time he was against the very bill which he 
is now proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another interesting quote from him, which leads into 
what I have to say.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens will need more than generic drugs to recover from 
the festering wounds which are about to be inflicted on the 
exposed ankles of Canada's poorest citizens when the Minister 
sinks his teeth in past the bone, into the marrow and sucks the 
life's blood out of Canada's poorest citizens with Bill C-22. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are strange and interesting words, which came from the 
present Minister of Industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are allowed to change their minds.  People see the light 
and become converted.  The minister said today that he had been 
concerned about the increase in drug prices at the time, but they 
did not happen.  He said indirectly that Prime Minister Mulroney 
had been right to bring in such a bill.  Just a short while ago, 
as has been pointed out today, the minister said that Prime 
Minister Mulroney was right about free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be interesting to see over the next while how many 
things the minister agrees with that he fought so hard against as 
a rat packer before his party became the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP has expressed a concern, of which all of us are 
conscious, that the bill might lead to increased drug prices for 
people with major illnesses, many of whom cannot afford the drugs 
they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most memorable occasions for me during the last 
campaign, and I am sure members on all sides of the House 
remember talking to people affected by the cost of drugs, was 
meeting a gentleman who had just been diagnosed with Alzheimers 
and whose wife was trying to cope with it.  A drug had been 
prescribed to retard the advancement of the disease, a drug 
called Aricept I believe.  The drug was not covered by medicare 
and the family had to pay the extremely high cost themselves. 
That meant other pleasures of life had to be sacrificed, 
including a little car that enabled them to get back and forth to 
the cabin.  They had to sell the car to pay for the drugs.  That 
is not the way it should be in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we blame pharmaceutical companies for that?  The answer is 
no.  We blame governments for that, because if an effective drug 
is brought on the market, tested and approved, the government 
should immediately sponsor it under medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP has expressed major concerns about drug companies 
getting rich and the impact of drug costs on poor people. 
However one important element has not been raised:  Those who 
need drugs would not have them if somebody did not put the time, 
effort and money into their development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at cancer.  Very few of us in the House are not 
affected, directly or indirectly, by that dreaded disease.  Will 
we ever find the cure for it?  The answer is that we are hopeful. 
Will we find the cure for AIDS and other dreaded diseases 
worldwide?  Luckily our country is not affected to the same 
degree as other countries but certainly we are affected by it. 
Will cures be found for dreaded diseases?  They will be found in 
only one way:  If somebody puts the dedicated research into 
coming up with a drug that will kill or retard the growth of the 
agents causing those diseases.  That can only be done, as I said, 
by time, concentration and funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues to my right, ideologically to my left, are very 
supportive of the arts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask them about the art industry.  What if a recording 
artist made a big hit which took a lot of time, involvement, 
practice and rehearsals?  What would the hon. members think if 
other performers, who were not as dedicated or bright or could 
not put together that one great hit, knew it was coming on the 
market, copied it and pirated the copies around the country? How 
would it affect the person who put the time and dedication into 
developing the product? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drugs are not unlike that.  Our hope of combating the major 
illnesses that affect people across the country may lie in the 
hope that a pharmaceutical company will develop a cure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could say governments should be the ones doing that and 
pumping money into research.  I certainly would not disagree. 
However, if governments were the ones responsible for doing 
research, I would question whether the work could be done. 
Government cannot be as efficient as the private sector.  That 
has been proved over and over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern lies with the people across the country who are faced 
every day with having to buy drugs.  I point to the government 
opposite and say that should be its main concern.  It has the 
mechanism to alleviate the costs shoved upon people for drugs to 
treat illnesses.  In a lot of cases there are drug assistance 
programs to do just that.  There are always those who fall 
between the cracks but a smart, sharp government could deal with 
such cases if it had any vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the people who put their time, effort and money into 
developing the needed drugs are not given the freedom and 
protection to do so, they will not do it.  They are not in the 
business of trying to make a breakthrough only to have it taken 
away from them.  When another company immediately starts making 
generic drugs or starts to stockpile so it can wipe out the 
company that developed the original drug, that is not fair 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fallout can be handled by government.  We could have the 
best of both worlds if we had a government with brains and 
vision.  Protection and help can be given to those who develop 
the drugs we need, but assistance can also be given to those who 
rely on them and cannot afford to pay for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to see the government trying to solicit 
support for a bill it was once so much against.  I know the NDP, 
even if it does not agree with us, is saying what it has always 
said.  It has not changed its opinion because the stripe of 
government has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying the same thing we have said and the same thing the 
Bloc is saying.  I agree totally with its last speaker.  The 
Alliance is also saying that if we are to produce the drugs 
needed to combat the concerns the NDP talks about, freedom and 
protection must be given to companies that put the time and 
effort into developing the cures that are so badly needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, however, has switched back and forth, which 
shows that its concern is not for people or companies in Canada. 
Its concern is for itself.  That has become more and more 
evident.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to make a slight comment.  I 
enjoyed the member opposite's speech.  I think on this side we 
all agree that if research in pharmaceuticals is to go ahead then 
there has to be some sort of profit incentive for that research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to make the observation that the generic drug 
producers, the people who sell generic brand drugs, do not do 
research.  One of the ironies of the whole situation is that the 
generic manufacturers of drugs produce drugs at low cost and 
these low cost drugs are consumed in great quantities.  One of 
the ironies in the situation that has always struck me is the 
fact that the easy accessibility, for example, to new antibiotics 
has created a situation where we have growing and more rapid 
resistance to antibiotics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very ironic situation where the more we make drugs 
available cheaply through generic manufacturers, the harder the 
pharmaceutical companies have to work to design new drugs.  We 
have a very, very difficult situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the solution is.  I do know that we certainly 
have to put incentives in place as best we can to make sure that 
those who are designing new drugs have the incentives to do so. I 
am one who believes that I would like to see government 
involvement, but I really do think this is a private sector 
initiative that needs to be encouraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member 
that there are concerns in this area.  Because of the amount of 
drugs we see, the cost of drugs, the effect of the cost on our 
population and the need to develop drugs to combat major diseases 
such as cancer and AIDS, perhaps it is time for somebody, whether 
it be the Minister of Industry, who is by the way a constituent 
of mine, or someone else, to take a hard look at the whole drug 
operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult perhaps for people to think that after they put 
time and effort into developing a product others will duplicate 
it quickly and sell it at a lower cost.  If people do the 
original work developing something, whether drugs, cars or 
records, as I talked about, and others are allowed to copy, 
reproduce and make money on those efforts, the original investors 
will get fed up with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if new drugs are not developed?  That is the 
question we must face.  How can we create an environment in which 
everyone benefits?  It can be done.  It takes leadership, 
co-ordination and proper legislation.  If protective measures are 
not there for the forerunners in all this I am not sure what the 
result will be.  We will have a lot more concerns than just the 
cost of drugs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
would the member for St. John's West agree that the goal, for all 
the moral and ethical reasons one could cite, must be to get 
drugs into the hands of the people who need them most at the most 
affordable cost?  Would he not agree that our single and most 
primary objective as legislators is to put in place a legislative 
slate that would enable drugs to get into the hands of people who 
need them at the cheapest possible cost? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That raises the question.  We have heard the argument in 
speeches today and on other occasions that even prior to the 
existing intellectual property patent protection the drug 
companies were making good, vast, healthy profits.  What we are 
seeing now is their relentless effort to increase profits more 
and more.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard earlier that not all their costs go into research. Over 
half their costs go into advertising, glossy promotions, TV ads, 
et cetera, trying to promote their products.  We cannot argue 
that the costs of all drug companies are in research and 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member think is a reasonable patent 
protection period of time?  Would 10 years be adequate?  Have we 
ever studied this issue in an objective manner?  Where is the 
market research to say or where is the empirical evidence to 
prove that drug companies need 20 years and now 25 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he change his mind if we could illustrate to him that if 
we gave a five to seven year patent protection drug companies 
could make a good profit?  Would he not agree that generic drug 
companies should be able to take over and get more drugs into the 
hands of people who need them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are probably three 
points tied up in the overall question.  In asking the question, 
I think the hon. member agrees with me that it is time we looked 
at the whole issue.  Perhaps there will be some variation in 
time.  However the other side is that generic groups, not only 
generic drugs but all generic groups, would have nothing to copy 
if somebody did not do the original work and put the money up 
front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The change being asked for in Bill S-17 is because of compliance 
with World Trade Organization rulings.  NDP members are against 
free trade.  They are against the private sector. They are for 
getting money into the hands of average people and making sure 
their costs are minimal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also agree with the last one point, but unlike the NDP we 
know we cannot help people have access to cheap drugs, receive 
the social services they need and obtain the health care 
assistance they need unless somebody generates the dollars which 
enable us to reinvest in that.  We could only do that through 
trade, commerce and investment by the private sector. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the Conservative member whom I respect 
very much in terms of his honest contribution to this debate and 
other issues.  However we are obviously at fundamental odds 
philosophically and politically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that on the one hand we are dealing with a 
party determined to seek progress through commercial interests 
and through aiding and abetting private needs in society, versus 
a philosophy epitomized by the NDP of putting the public good 
first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the hon. colleague justify his pursuit of private 
control and international control over something as fundamental 
as access to necessary medications when many people are being 
left behind and not served by that kind of shortsighted policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure whether I 
agree with the hon. member's opening remarks that we are 
fundamentally different in many of our views.  I suggest there is 
no one in the House perhaps more concerned about the plight of 
average citizens, of which I am one, than I am.  As I mentioned 
earlier, I also know full well that to be able to assist those 
who need assistance somebody has to pay the bills.  People say 
that government should do it, but from where does government get 
the money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are people who because of illness, disabilities or 
whatever cannot contribute to the public coffers, it is our duty 
to make sure they get every benefit they deserve.  The dollars 
needed to do that have to be generated by someone, and that 
someone has to be the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If government is conscious of what is happening we can have, as 
I said earlier, the best of both worlds.

it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House 
that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment 
is as follows:  the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville, Gun 
Control. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this important debate today on Bill S-17. 
I listened carefully to the member for St. John's West who just 
spoke on behalf of the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for people who are listening at home, as well as 
members in the Chamber, to know that we are talking about part of 
a bill which would extend patent protection from 17 years to 20 
years.  It is not a question of a company coming up with a new 
discovery for AIDS, for example, and the next day a knock-off of 
the drug is put on the market by a company that specializes in 
generic drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were talking of 17 years worth of patent protection.  Now the 
WTO has come along and said that Canada is not in compliance with 
that.  Therefore, in order to comply with the WTO, we have to add 
another three years to make it a full 20 year patent protection 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the Minister of Industry say that this would only 
involve about 30 patents, but he neglected to say those were 
worth an estimated $200 million that will be absorbed by Canadian 
consumers as they purchase higher priced drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO found Canada not to be in compliance with the idea that 
a generic drug company could manufacture and stockpile drugs so 
that on the day the patent protection ended they could have their 
products on the market and ready to go.  This too has been termed 
illegal by the WTO and is dealt with in the bill.  We are rushing 
against the clock to come up with a bill by August 12 of this 
year to comply with yet another adverse ruling by the World Trade 
Organization against the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987 a number of significant changes were made to the Patent 
Act.  Five years were added in 1992 when the infamous Bill C-91 
passed in the House of Commons.  A number of concerns were 
expressed at that time by provincial governments about the impact 
Bill C-91 would have on prescription drug prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after that bill became law I had the privilege of 
working in the department of health in the province of 
Saskatchewan, the province which pioneered prescription drug cost 
and benefits for its people.  The government at the time felt 
that it had no alternative except essentially to gut that 
legislation as a result of the changes brought about by Bill 
C-91. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the costs of prescription drugs increase by several 
hundred percentage points over the last number of years.  They 
have increased to the point that now, as the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas noted in his remarks, it is the single biggest 
expense on a line item as to what any province pays for its 
medicare system.  It is far more than doctors, far more than the 
cost of hospitals.  Prescription drugs now top the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not the way that it used to be, but that was then and 
now is now.  Some members have done some serious somersaults on 
this issue over the past 10 years.  I will get into that in a few 
minutes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Predictions are that prescription drug prices will soar even 
higher under trade pacts like the one being negotiated now and 
scheduled to come into effect in 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From heart drugs to chemotherapy, essential medications 
represent the fastest growing expense in health care today.  In 
the past 15 years, from roughly 1987, Canada's prescription drug 
bill has jumped by 344% according to a study last month by the 
Canadian Institution for Health Information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many reasons for the increase.  As the member for St. 
John's West indicated, new drugs have been approved for 
everything from arthritis to Alzheimer's, adding to the total 
drug bill.  We recognize demographically that an aging population 
is demanding and requiring more essential medication. 
International trade deals like the agreement on trade, related 
aspects of intellectual property rights, or TRIPS as it is known 
by its acronym, have strengthened the patent protection enjoyed 
by big name pharmaceutical companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The TRIPS deal has allowed these companies to keep their prices 
high for the 20 year lifespan of drug patents.  It has helped 
pharmaceutical companies net unbelievably high profits on 
billions of dollars on research into new medicine.  The argument 
goes that without the profits derived from those patents 
innovative medicine would languish.  I do not think there can be 
much doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scott Sinclair, a trade policy analyst, put it well when he said 
that there was no coincidence escalating drug costs occurred 
during this period of excessive patent protection.  He went on to 
add that 20 years was a very long time, particularly when we are 
talking about access to essential medications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other comments were made by Médecins Sans Frontières and Dr. 
John Foster, a principal researcher at the North-South Institute. 
They are also very concerned and urge the countries in the free 
trade area of the Americas agreement not to bow to pressure from 
pharmaceutical companies to strengthen further drug patents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to some of those opposed, pharmaceutical companies are 
not interested in making drugs that help poor people, and most of 
the people in the world are poor.  They say that it is a matter 
of political will that we can put solutions in place but 
political will is very weak from what they have seen.  We in this 
caucus would certainly agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members on the government side who were on the 
opposition benches 10 or 15 years ago.  It is a veritable who's 
who.  In some of the time I have remaining I would like to make 
some reference to them.  The Minister of Industry, as member for 
Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte, talked about the changes that were 
brought in by the Mulroney government.   He asked this question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are they really serious when they say that the sick, the poor, 
the elderly, and those who live on fixed incomes have to 
subsidize R and D in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are they really serious when they say that the only way the 
universities, the post-secondary institutions, the centres of 
excellence of Canada will have any money for R and D is if we 
take it out of the pockets of Canada's senior citizens and 
Canada's sick. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were comments of the Minister of Industry, the minister 
who is piloting the legislation through the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What a disappointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Indeed, what a disappointment.  The 
current government House leader, the member for 
Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, read into the record on November 
16, 1992, a stack of postcards. 
He guesstimated them to be four or five inches thick.  One 
postcard read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“On June 23, 1992, the federal government introduced Bill C-91, 
legislation intended to extend retroactively to December 20, 
1991, patent protection for brand name pharmaceuticals and 
eliminate Canada's system of compulsory licensing.  This 
legislation will result in significantly higher drug prices in 
Canada and its retroactive provisions will cripple the Canadian 
owned generic pharmaceutical industry”.  This is not what I 
said.  This is what hundreds and hundreds of Canadians have said.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Solicitor General of Canada, the member for 
Cardigan, also entered the debate at that time and quoted from 
Green Shield.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average cost of a prescription claim has risen at a rate in 
excess of 11% compounded annually for the period 1987 through 
1991, well above the CPI rate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for Veterans Affairs and Western Economic 
Diversification, the member for Saint Boniface, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk about Canadians who will need assistance with drugs 
and medicine, I am of course referring mainly to seniors.  Except 
in rare cases, the need for medical attention tends to increase 
as we grow older.  I suggest it is unfortunate that legislation 
such as this be allowed to cause hardship to the elderly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who are sick often, sometimes over the course of 
several years, and who will require medicine during most of their 
lives.  Costs are already prohibitive.  We suggest, and there is 
evidence to back this up, that they will only go higher with this 
legislation.  I find it is absolutely irresponsible on the part 
of this government to go ahead with this 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wound up his diatribe against Bill C-91 by saying: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—I have no choice but to say no to Bill C-91 for those Canadians 
who will need medication and in particular the seniors and those 
who have need of medication because of their medical condition. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief government whip, the member for Ottawa West said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to reiterate what this bill is all about. 
It is not about extending patent protection for pharmaceutical 
drugs.  It is about completely eliminating, for the entire 
20-year patent period, the right of any generic manufacturer to 
produce a drug that is under patent and to compete with that drug 
on the open marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the impact going to be?  The impact for Canadians is 
going to be higher drug costs.  Right now, generic drugs being 
produced while the original is still under patent cost 53 per 
cent of the cost of the patent drug.  That is a saving of 47 per 
cent for Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have in Canada is branch plant drug companies.  We do 
not have basic research.  We do not have the kind of foundation 
that this country wants to see in this industry that is the most 
profitable in our economy and it does not deserve the kind of 
protection that this Conservative government is now proposing to 
offer. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would limit competition.  It says that for 20 years 
one does not have to compete against anyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She concluded by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If NAFTA tells us what we can and we cannot do to provide health 
care for Canadian citizens then we do not need NAFTA.  That is 
just one more reason to vote against it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was one more dissertation that I would like to acknowledge 
and that is the member for Kenora—Rainy River currently the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
The minister said in December 1992: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact that Americans pay 62% more for prescription drugs 
than the average Canadian citizen.  If we were to follow that 
through, that means by the year 2010 we will be on a level 
playing field with the Americans.  Our drugs should rise 
proportionately to the point where we will be equal to the 
Americans as far as the price that we pay for drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question has to be asked in this place.  That is why we are 
debating this, not because we are the loyal opposition and we 
disagree with the legislation.  It is our responsibility, as 
members of parliament, to put the facts before the Canadian 
people so that they can decide whether the legislation that the 
government is presenting today is a good piece of legislation for 
the good of all Canadians.

<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Canadians, as consumers, are going to give up roughly $4 
billion out of their pockets for higher drug prices because now 
what we are talking about is going from the Canadian system to a 
level playing field similar to the American system. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see from that lineup that this is one reason we are very 
concerned about it.  The flip-flop by the Liberals on this issue 
is absolutely breathtaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada today we spend more on drugs than on doctors. 
Prescription drug costs are the fastest growing cost of health 
care forcing provincial and territorial governments to pay more, 
causing fewer families to be able to afford the drugs they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity on Saturday night to hear from a well 
known physician in the Saskatoon community, Dr. John Bury, 
who was talking about 
the impact that prescription drugs have had. He recalled the drug 
benefit plan the Saskatchewan government put in place many years 
ago that worked so well for such a long time. Essentially it was 
eroded because the government in the early to mid-1990s could not 
afford to continue as drug prices increased by the 344% that I 
talked about earlier.  His point now is that there are people in 
Saskatoon who are unable to afford to purchase drugs.  Drug 
prices have risen so much they are now out of the reach of many 
ordinary and poorer Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A personal friend of mine is in hospital recovering from a 
stroke brought about, almost certainly, by the fact that she 
neglected to have her blood thinners upgraded or the prescription 
renewed.  In some ways we are putting additional costs on our 
medical health system by examples such as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a country with $100 billion to spend on tax cuts, one in ten 
Canadians do not fill prescriptions because he or she cannot 
afford it.  Since 1990 drug prices have risen by 87%.  If drug 
prices are not brought down increased health funding will not go 
to patients but to multinational pharmaceutical companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public health care needs to get its fast rising costs under 
control.  Families need lower prices to afford the drugs they 
need.  However that is not what the government has been offering. 
It chose to break promises it made as recently as 1997, let alone 
in 1987 and 1992 in its red book on a national pharmacare plan. 
It chose to ignore new ideas for health care like a national bulk 
buying project that would bring costs down.  I note that 
Australia has such a program.

which provides for longer patents.  When in opposition, the 
Liberals promised, as I have tried to point out in my speech, to 
rescind the law.  The Liberal government chose to support more 
powerful trade agreements even though these agreements make it 
harder for Canada to use cheaper generic drugs.  It chose to 
accept one trade ruling that made it harder for Canada to use 
cheaper drugs.

thank the member for Palliser for a very good speech.  I learned 
a great deal, and I know that all who are listening here and at 
home probably benefited as well from the historical references 
that the hon. member made about what those who currently sit on 
the government side felt about Bill C-91, the drug patent 
protection act, when they were in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that I come from the third poorest 
riding in all of Canada.  I know personally of stories brought to 
my office of senior citizens who actually cut their pills in half 
to make their medications last longer because they cannot afford, 
on a month to month basis, the drug prices for the regime their 
doctors have given them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that we know this to be true, and it is not the first time 
it has been raised in the House, one would think that the bill we 
would be debating today would be some kind of intervention by the 
government to advocate on behalf of those people and to put in 
place changes in the system that might champion this issue.  One 
would think the government would advocate on behalf of those 
seniors who are having such a difficult time.  Rather, we are 
seeing what has been called the greatest corporate giveaway in 
Canadian history, Bill C-91, augmented, added to and made even 
worse by Bill S-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member give us some indication as to whether he 
has heard stories of senior citizens struggling to cope with the 
costs of their monthly medications?  Would he not agree that 
there is something completely ass-backwards having us debate a 
bill that will actually make the situation worse rather than 
having a proactive government intervene on behalf of Canadians to 
try to remedy this terrible situation of rising drug prices? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the question, and yes, I think all of us in the House could 
probably point to examples of people who have diluted their 
prescription drugs in order to make them stretch a little 
further.  Sometimes that can complicate their health and 
well-being.  Instead of helping, it often adds to their 
difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What my colleague is talking about is the need for a concerted 
effort by government to campaign for cheaper medicine.  Some 
countries, and the name of Brazil has come up a couple of times 
today, have basically thumbed their noses at the multinational 
drug companies and have said that they will do something, that 
they will provide drugs for people who are victims of HIV and 
AIDS.  The South African example has been instructive on that 
topic as well.  These are the sorts of things and the kind of 
leadership we are looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of South Africa, the decision of the drug companies 
to drop the case amounted to a huge victory for millions of 
people who are suffering from treatable diseases.  It is all well 
and good to talk about being on the leading edge and coming up 
with drugs that will cure very nasty and lethal diseases. 
However, if the vast majority of people in the world can in no 
way afford to buy those kinds of drugs, what does that say about 
a public health care system such as the one that has been 
pioneered in Canada over the years?   It was pioneered first by 
the CCF and then by the New Democratic Party in Saskatchewan and 
extended to the rest of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians are desperately looking for leadership in this 
area and the drug patent protection of 20 years is not the way in 
which most of them want to see the country continue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad for the opportunity to participate in the 
debate.  I have patiently waited for my turn so I could have my 
say and join with my colleagues in expressing our absolute anger 
and opposition to Bill S-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been fascinating listening to the debate.  Although I 
have enormous respect for some of my colleagues in the 
Conservative Party, including the hon. member for St. John's West 
who spoke this afternoon, I want to put on record that we are 
vehemently and fundamentally opposed to the kind of logic and 
reasoning that has come from the Conservative benches and in fact 
from all sides in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I sat and listened to the hon. member for St. John's West and 
heard some of the heckling from the Liberal benches across the 
way, I tried to think of what was most disturbing about the 
debate.  What I found most disturbing about the debate was the 
question of whether or not the public good was being served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the issue that when private gain surpasses 
the public good then government must act.  The responsibility of 
government is to ensure that Canadians, regardless of their 
income, where they live or their family circumstances, have 
access to basic public services.  One of those basic services is 
health care.  What is very essential and very key in terms of 
health services is access to medications that people need when 
they are sick.   We are talking about medicare.  We are talking 
about universally accessible, publicly administered health care 
and the threats that are causing the system to be eroded and to 
come undone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think about the debates we have had in the House over the last 
while on the problems facing medicare.  I have heard the Alliance 
and sometimes the Conservatives talk about questioning the wisdom 
of our public system and that maybe we should look at some 
private elements.  I have also heard them say that perhaps we 
need to bite the bullet and go to two tier health care.  Does 
anyone know what they did not address in that debate?   They 
refused to address the fastest growing cost of our health care 
system and the fact that it falls almost entirely within the 
private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were truly concerned about dealing with a health care 
system that is in a critical state of affairs, then we would look 
at the root causes of those problems.  We would look at what 
causes the prices to rise beyond our abilities as a government 
and as citizens to support a universally accessible health care 
system.  A prime example of those problems is our drug system and 
the control brand name drug companies have over of our health 
care system.  It is these Liberals and the Conservatives before 
them who have catered time and time again to every whim of those 
brand name drug companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat here and listened to the heckling from the Liberals 
asking who will pay for all the new drugs, how will new 
breakthroughs happen, who will make them happen, and that we need 
the private sector.  Yes, we need the private sector.  We are not 
here to say we will stamp out the private sector.  We are saying 
that there needs to be a balance, that the government's role must 
be to ensure that drugs are available at a reasonable price so 
that everybody in our society can have access to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all my colleagues have said, drugs constitute the most costly 
item of our health care system today.  This is partly due to the 
fact that it is dominated by the private sector and where the 
government has abandoned the field, ignored the public good and 
dropped the ball. 
We are paying the price today because the government keeps 
breaking its promises, flip-flopping and abandoning its 
commitment to serving the public good.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very hard to sit in this place and hear Liberals today 
speak on this issue when we consider the record, what they have 
told the Canadian public and what bill of goods they have sold 
the people of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to before the 1993 election when the Liberals 
regained power after a long time in the wilderness.  Let us go 
back to those debates leading up to the 1993 election when the 
Brian Mulroney Conservatives brought in Bill C-91.  This is again 
where I have problems with the Conservatives' participation in 
the House today.  The root of our problems today in terms of 
health care and in terms of trade organizations, unaccountable, 
unelected bodies having authority over this place, was the 
decision made by Brian Mulroney and the Conservatives to open up 
the floodgates and allow world trade organizations and 
international bodies to set the rules and brand name drug 
companies to set the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of my colleagues have pointed to the Liberal rhetoric 
leading up to the 1993 election.  We heard all about how the 
present Minister of Industry, part of the rat pack back in those 
days, was champing at the bit to get after the Brian Mulroney 
Conservatives for daring to bring in patent protection 
legislation.  We heard about some of the words he used and how 
they managed to fool the public with false promises and fake 
rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go over it one more time.  The present Minister of 
Industry, then the member for Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte, said 
on December 10, 1992: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member and all these members who at some time, 
when they screw up their backbones and courage to do it, have to 
go back and face their constituents:— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was quite forceful and powerful rhetoric.  It was a 
vigorous, vehement statement and a strongly articulated position. 
It was good before the election.  It was good for leading up to 
1993 when the Liberals were able to con the public into believing 
they were on the side of truth, goodness and light and that they 
would correct all the errors of the past caused by Brian Mulroney 
and his Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the 1993 election.  I gave up a good seat in the 
provincial legislature in Manitoba to run federally and had to 
face that kind of con job by the Liberals, and of course we know 
the results.  The Liberals swept the polls and got into office. 
All of us, no matter what side we sat on, looked to the Liberals 
to keep their promise to uphold their commitment to rescind Bill 
C-91 and stop the tremendous hold patent protection had over drug 
prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, the rest is history.  I remember well that the only thing 
the Liberals did was to set up a committee that would consult 
with Canadians on Bill C-91.  I was part of those hearings in 
Winnipeg, part of a community that spoke up and said “Keep your 
promise. Do not back off this very important issue because it is 
fundamental to our ability as citizens to access quality health 
care today”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That charade of a consultation process went on and on.  Finally 
in 1997 the Liberals won another election after pulling off 
another con job on Canadians by promising a national pharmacare 
plan.  Does any member of the House know where the national 
pharmacare plan is today?  I think that says it all.  We returned 
to the House after the 1997 election to finally get a report from 
the government about the results of its consultations.  I do not 
need to tell you, Mr. Speaker, how it soon became apparent that 
there was some discrepancy between the first report of the 
industry committee and the report that finally was tabled. 
We raised questions at that time about the evidence suggesting 
that the minister or the minister's office had in fact seen the 
draft minutes and had a role to play in ensuring that the 
recommendations were more in line with this new direction of the 
Liberal Party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not stop there.  The Liberals did not stop at breaking a 
promise and not rescinding Bill C-91.  They went on to make a 
number of regulatory changes, actually bowed to the international 
trade organizations and catered to the brand name drug companies, 
and extended the patent protection and the provisions for brand 
name drug companies.  Each time the government took a step it 
made it harder and harder for provincial governments to provide 
drug coverage to their citizens so they could to access the drugs 
they needed to stay healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are paying the price now.  As my colleagues for Palliser and 
Winnipeg Centre have said over and over, many of us have had 
calls and direct contact from constituents, especially seniors, 
who cannot afford to fill their prescriptions or follow their 
doctor's orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who pays the price?  The senior citizens who end up getting 
sicker because they cannot afford the medicines they need and, of 
course, all of us, because the senior citizens will now be in and 
out of hospitals, in and out of their doctor's office and will 
need to seek home care and other support.  We pay the price 
because of the shortsighted decision making of the government and 
its absolute preoccupation with catering to multinational drug 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose we should not be surprised at Bill S-17, given the 
whole history of broken promises, but could the government not 
have at least put up a fight?  Could it not have at least tried 
to pursue another path instead of catering so quickly to the WTO? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The World Trade Organization made its decision on September 19, 
2000.  The government leaped to the pump and brought in Bill S-17 
on February 20, 2001, only a few months after the WTO decision. 
We know from the facts of the case that the government has many 
more months left to pursue its decision.  It has time to talk to 
Canadians and to get support for a different path.  It has until 
December 2001 before it actually has to make a final decision. 
The government has time to rally Canadians and to pursue some 
alternatives.  It has time to develop a national pharmacare plan 
based on bulk buying and on the use of generic drugs.  It has 
time for all kinds of options if it is truly committed to serving 
the public good, as opposed to catering to private gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the haste in which the government proceeded to 
implement the WTO ruling to Bill S-17 disconcerting, but the way 
in which it did it is also disconcerting.  If the government were 
not embarrassed and ashamed by this deed and by this obvious 
breach of a commitment to the Canadian people, why did it not 
bring the bill directly to the House where it could have been 
debated forthwith?   Instead, the government slipped the bill in 
through the other place, which has now found its way here for 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That kind of secrecy and speed, and that kind of failure to be 
direct with the Canadian people is the obvious result of a 
government that should hang its head in shame for the kinds of 
actions it has taken on this fundamental element of our health 
care system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is so much that needs to be said.  However, the most 
important issue today is that what we are really talking about is 
access, access by the Canadian people to a necessary component of 
our health care system.  It needs to be said over and over again 
that drug costs are going through the roof, that rising 
pharmaceutical costs are creating enormous difficulties for our 
provincial governments and that people are feeling the squeeze 
day in and day out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had several opportunities to redress the 
situation and bring balance to this serious matter.  It had an 
opportunity through the last federal-provincial meeting of 
premiers in September to actually bring to fruition a plan to 
ensure that the concerns of provincial governments around rising 
drugs costs were dealt with and that there would be some 
meaningful plan in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national pharmacare plan did not make it to the final 
accord.  The government was not interested in using that 
wonderful opportunity to advance the agenda and to pursue its 
commitment to the Canadian people for a national drug plan that 
would ensure equitable access for all Canadians and deal with the 
incredible pressure on medicare today.  The government had a 
wonderful opportunity.  It was not mentioned.  It was not on the 
table and it is not being pursued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be very wrong for the government to suggest, as it 
tried to do in the last election, that it did not have the 
co-operation of provincial governments to pursue a national drug 
plan.  The fact of the matter is that there was ample willingness 
on the part of many provincial governments to ensure that 
collectively we would deal with one of the gravest problems 
facing our health care system in recent times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of health in Manitoba was quite direct and blunt 
with the federal government about the need to have the item 
pursued.  He was actually quoted in the press as saying, tongue 
in cheek, that he would gladly give up the transfer payments the 
federal government provides to provincial governments if the 
federal government would look after the drug bills and take 
charge in terms of the pharmaceutical pressures on our system 
today.  That was wishful thinking on the part of the Manitoba 
minister of health, because the federal government not only 
refused to take up the challenge of a national pharmacare plan, 
it has not even made an attempt to bring all parties and players 
together to develop a national pharmacare plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many options.  There are many models with great 
possibilities.  My colleague, the member for Palliser, will 
probably remember that it was in Saskatoon in 1998 that the 
Minister of Health brought together all the players in the field, 
all the experts around drug prices.  They pooled their ideas and 
talents in order to develop the idea of some kind of national 
pharmacare plan.  There were great ideas and all kinds of 
studies.  There is no shortage of proposals that are workable, 
that would make a difference, but the government refuses to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question in all of this debate is why.  Why did the 
government have to jump to the pumps when it came to the WTO 
ruling?  Why did it break its promise in 1993 on Bill C-91?  Why 
did it, through the back door and different regulatory 
procedures, actually augment and improve the situation facing 
patent drug companies?  Why in each and every case did the 
government put private gain ahead of the public good? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know the answer, other than to say that in every part 
of the government and in every aspect of its decision making 
process it caters to the private sector and pursues an agenda of 
deregulation, privatization and off-loading to minimize the 
barriers facing our private sector, to create an unfettered 
marketplace for our multinational corporations, and to buy into 
this agenda of globalization and corporate control over the 
welfare and well-being of all our citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a shame.  We are paying the price today.  We would hope 
that somehow this government would reconsider, pull Bill S-17 off 
the books and get down to a serious discussion in parliament and 
with the Canadian public about a national drug plan. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, beneath the rhetoric that you are hearing 
today lurks a very, very serious issue.  The member opposite has 
asked why members of this party have changed their attitude 
toward giving patent protection to drugs, why they have changed 
their position in 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell her why they have changed their position in 10 years. 
It is that in 10 years there has been an enormous advance in 
antibiotic resistant bacteria.  The classic case is tuberculosis. 
We now have a strain of tuberculosis out there that is resistant 
to every known antibiotic but one.  There is a great number of 
these old diseases that have developed resistance to the drugs 
that we counted upon in the past.  Much of this has occurred in 
the last 10 years.  What is happening is that we have to, as a 
government, do everything in our power to encourage private 
industry or anyone else to develop new drugs to resist these 
diseases that have developed resistance to the antibiotics that 
we have had to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious problem.  It is a deadly problem, Mr. Speaker. 
It is a problem in the scientific and biological communities. 
They regard it with great trepidation.  If we do not do something 
very quickly about it, if we do not develop new drugs as fast as 
possible by encouraging the incentives of the marketplace, we are 
going to be in a lot of trouble and some people, and I do not 
want to sound overly dramatic, are going to die.  We actually 
have to develop new drugs and if we have to encourage 
manufacturers by extending the patent protection law, then we had 
better do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hear the member's 
question and I have heard it before in his previous questioning 
of some of the speakers.  Frankly, I do not quite understand the 
logic.  Is the member in fact saying that the only breakthroughs, 
the only scientific discoveries of importance to humankind 
developed in our history, are a result of commercial interests? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  The profit motive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Are they the result of the 
profit motive, as my colleague, the member for Winnipeg Centre, 
has said?  I do not understand.  We could spend hours listing the 
kinds of improvements that have occurred in our society.  I think 
of the polio vaccine.  These breakthroughs occurred because of a 
commitment on the part of individuals to improve the condition of 
humankind, not because they were in it for the money or to make a 
profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not here to say that no one should ever make any money on 
developing drugs and other scientific breakthroughs, but we are 
saying there has to be a balance.  My question for the Liberal 
member is this:  how much profit does a company have to make 
before it is prepared to invest in improving society and 
operating in the best interests of our community?  How much 
protection do they need in order to contribute to the welfare of 
our society?  That is what this debate is all about.  Why do we 
have to go toward more protection with every step the government 
takes?  How much profit do these multinational brand name drug 
companies have to make? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another question that has to be addressed.  There is a 
lot of emphasis being put on the incredible investment made by 
these brand name drug companies in our society and on meeting 
their needs in order for us to have any breakthroughs.  I do not 
know if the member has read all the information on this topic, 
but the fact of the matter is that the brand name drug industry 
has benefited enormously from taxpayers and from government 
subsidies.  That industry has not taken the bulk of that 
investment and used it to ensure that we have drugs on the market 
available to everyone in our society regardless of where they 
come from and how much money they make.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we often see a lot of that public investment going 
toward the development of me too drugs.  We see a great deal of 
that money going to advertising and promotions.  We see a lot of 
that money going to ensuring better benefits and salaries for 
executive officers in these drug companies.  We see a lot of 
money going toward the consolidation of an agenda that has a 
reach around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking for today and what I think Canadians want is 
some balance in this issue.  We want to see the government take 
some action to ensure that public investment goes toward the 
public good. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
follow up on the question that was asked a minute ago by the 
Liberal member and I would like a comment from the member for 
Winnipeg North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was astounded in doing research on this issue to learn that 
more than $350 billion U.S. in brand name pharmaceuticals is sold 
around the world annually.  As an aside, HIV and AIDS drugs 
account for approximately $4 billion of that, a very small 
percentage.  I am assuming, and I know that the member who is our 
health critic will undoubtedly know the answer, that there must 
be a vast majority of pharmaceutical companies around the world 
that would be realizing that combined total of $350 billion in 
brand name pharmaceuticals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to comment as well because in her speech 
she did talk about this having been snuck in through the Senate. 
Maybe it is just a coincidence, but this is the second bill that 
we have had today in the House that has come in via the Senate. I 
wonder if the member sees a pattern in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
questions from my colleague.  He raises several important points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point is about the amount of business that a number of 
multinational brand name drug companies control and the kind of 
power they exert, obviously over this government and over 
citizens globally.  We only have to look at the battle as 
referenced by my colleague from Burnaby, the battle of the 
citizens of South Africa to get access to generic drugs to deal 
with the spread of HIV and AIDS and the kind of opposition they 
encountered from the brand name drug companies.  That kind of 
power has to be stopped.  That is why we have government:  to 
bring some balance into this whole area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue pertaining to the Senate is certainly an 
important one.  It surprised us on February 20 to learn that this 
issue was being dealt with through the other House, the other 
place, through the back door.  We have a lot of questions for the 
government.  Why did it choose that route?  Why was it not at 
least direct with the Canadian people and with parliament?  The 
situation speaks for itself.  The government must be embarrassed 
by this kowtowing to the these corporate brand name drug 
companies and international bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it is very important to point out again how many voices 
are on the other side of the issue.  I want to refer very briefly 
to a letter from the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, which 
expresses anger over the Canadian government's capitulation to 
the demands of transnational corporations and international trade 
agreements instead of defending Canadian citizens.

says:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would deny a pharmaceutical manufacturer a healthy profit for 
an effective drug?  But is that the reason legislation has been 
introduced in the Senate...to extend patents from 17 to 20 years? 
No.

pharmaceutical manufacturers are extremely profitable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It went on to say:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrast this with the plight of many other older Canadians or 
the working poor who must spend what little money they have on 
prescription drugs.  As you know, some seniors face the nightmare 
of choosing between heating, eating or prescription drugs.  Not 
all seniors face this kind of crisis, but most report that 
prescription drugs take a huge bite out of their budget at a time 
in their lives when few can afford it.  In fact, though many are 
covered by provincial pharmacare programs, they don't cover the 
first hundred or more dollars in drug purchases.  Even these 
seniors will be affected.

the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, the Canadian Teachers' 
Federation, the Manitoba Society of Seniors, the Canadian 
Association of Retired Persons and other groups that know what it 
is like to deal with the pressures on their members and citizens 
they encounter on a day to day basis.  It is time for the 
government to act for the public good.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to start my speech on Bill S-17 by following up on 
some comments from the member for Winnipeg North Centre in answer 
to questions from the member for Palliser.  The member asked why 
we were dealing with this bill which originated from the Senate 
and why did we think the bill originated in the Senate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no secret there.  It is obvious why the government 
chose to introduce this bill through the back door, through the 
unelected Senate.  It was put forward by the hon. leader of the 
government in the Senate, a member from Winnipeg.  It is to her 
great shame and discredit that she is doing the government's 
dirty work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not want to introduce this bill in the House 
for fear of reprisals from Canadians and from seniors' 
organizations.  There is a growing and mounting movement against 
this regressive step that this was the path of least resistance 
for the government.  It was an expedient move to introduce this 
bill through the Senate so it would come up for debate without 
the usual public announcement from the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry spoke at length on this bill earlier 
today.  He was quoted extensively, when he represented the 
opposition, as speaking against any such move to extend patent 
protection.  He is now the champion for international 
pharmaceutical companies to increase their profits yet again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address another point which was very well made 
by the member for Winnipeg Centre.  Just how much profit is 
enough profit to keep drug North companies doing the important research 
work they do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker after speaker has said that the NDP does not understand 
how necessary it is for drug companies to do research and should 
they not be compensated for doing that research.  There is no 
disagreement on this side.  We value the scientists who work hard 
to find new cures to many ailments.  We are balking because we 
have never really tested the water.  We have never had a debate 
as to what a reasonable profit would be for these companies.  How 
many years of patent protection do they really need to not only 
pay for their research costs, but to appreciate a reasonable 
profit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the whole debate, some of us believe that this 
sort of scientific pursuit should be above and beyond the realm 
of the free market altogether.  Perhaps we should start with that 
basic premise.  Some of us still believe that some things are too 
important to leave up to the profit motive and to the free hand 
of the marketplace.  That it is somehow the be all and end all 
and the only thing that would motivate people to do something as 
humanitarian as finding cures for illnesses and getting necessary 
drugs into the hands of people that need them most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there are a significant number of Canadians, 
scientists and business people who would agree that the single 
most important thing we could do for moral and ethical reasons 
would be to find a way to get drugs into the hands of people who 
need them without bankrupting our health care system and our 
seniors who find it difficult to meet the costs of the 
medications they so desperately need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill further accentuates the problem of the high cost of 
drugs.  It makes us wonder whose side the government is on. Whose 
side is it championing here?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We find this inexorable link between the Liberal party and the 
pharmaceutical international drug companies.  It makes one wonder 
whose interests it is bound to represent in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians hoped that they would have a champion in their 
government and that someone would be there advocating on their 
behalf to represent their interests in this very serious problem 
that faces the nation.  Yet what do we find?  Rather than 
legislation being introduced that might provide some relief or 
some plan to reduce the cost of drugs, we are once again fighting 
this decade long battle of trying to hold back the length of the 
patent protection on intellectual property, so that the generic 
drug companies can start to replicate these necessary drugs and 
make them cheaper and more affordable so our health care system 
is not crippled or hog-tied by this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17 builds off of Bill C-91.  Bill C-91 was called the 
greatest corporate giveaway in Canadian history.  I remember the 
challenge and the demonstrations in the streets.  Canadians came 
out en masse to voice their disappointment with the then Mulroney 
government when it introduced Bill C-91.  They were furious and 
outraged.  The Mulroney Tories were crazy enough to take on 
senior citizens again.  They did it once when they wanted to 
de-index the pension and they got their wrists slapped pretty 
quickly and they withdrew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, just like a kid who puts his hand on the hot element of a 
stove, they chose to do it again and infuriated citizens all 
across the country.  They introduced another bill that would cost 
them more in direct out of pocket expense than even the dastardly 
plan to deindex the pension.  When Bill C-91 came along, it 
mobilized a whole cross generation protest movement to fight 
against this thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it was one of the key issues in the 1993 election, on 
October 25, 1993, when Canadians kicked the Tories out in the 
most humiliating defeat in Canadian history and reduced them to 
two seats.  They did this partly to voice their strong objection 
to the changes proposed under Bill C-91. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals took over in 1993, rather than do what they 
promised to do and bring in a national pharmacare plan that would 
relieve people from the crippling costs and spiralling out of 
control drug costs, they embarked on a cross-country national 
tour, a task force, and the best way to buy time.  We They did 
not do away with Bill C-91 or reverse its terrible impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The findings of the task force were the most disappointing 
flip-flop in recent memory.  The Liberals were elected on the 
promise that they would champion the interests of Canadian people 
in terms of high drug costs.  What did they do?  They came back, 
shrugged their shoulders and said that they had studied the issue 
to death.  They said they had investigated it thoroughly and 
heard from Canadians, but there is nothing we can do. Therefore, 
the 20 year patent protection stood.  In other words, there was 
no relief is in site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was in spite of predictions from people in their own party. 
Prominent Liberals of the opposition, some who are now cabinet 
ministers in the Liberal government, issued dire warnings.  They 
said that if they went ahead with Bill C-91 and the 20 year drug 
patent protection, it would cause an enormous compounding 
escalation in drugs costs to ordinary Canadians.  That did not 
deter them one minute.  That did not hold them back one iota. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess that is the beauty of being a Liberal.  They do not see 
any contradiction in that kind of flip-flop whatsoever.  They 
seem to hold their heads high, take a 180° turn and say the 
opposite to what they were elected on in the fall of 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have quotes of prominent Liberals of what they said in the 
House of Commons.  Dramatic speeches were made on this issue. 
Some of my favourites came from the current House leader of the 
Liberal party who was absolutely passionate about this issue.  He 
was making the case that this kind of a drug patent protection 
would be devastating to our health care system.  Even then many 
of us who were monitoring these things knew that the single 
biggest cost to our health care system was soon to be drugs, and 
that is the case now.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On a chart on the wall we can see the costs of hospitals and 
doctors are going up.  Drug costs are skyrocketing through the 
ceiling.  Our worst fears have been realized.  In fact the worst 
fears of the hon. House leader for the government were realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 he said “I turn the argument right around on the 
members across”, meaning the government side members. “Doing 
something that will damage our health care system in Canada is 
not going to make us more competitive”.  That is a given. “It 
is perhaps one of those things that in the long run and perhaps 
even in the short run are going to make us less competitive as a 
nation because it is removing from us one of those useful tools 
that we have now”, meaning affordable health care and affordable 
access to pharmaceutical drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate those remarks and can associate them.  I would have 
been proud to know that individual when he that thought that way. 
I am not so crazy about the point of view that seems to be 
adopted by those same people across the way today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation now where the Liberal Party and the 
government of the day are being the champions and advocates for 
the multinational drug companies or chief apologists for the 
multinational drug companies.  Whose side are they on?  Canadians 
are desperate for somebody to advocate on their behalf.  They are 
desperate to have somebody speak out loudly for them, to stand on 
hind legs and if necessary oppose the WTO or at least put up a 
good fight instead of kowtowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time we send one of our representatives to one of these 
meetings, whether it is in Davos, Switzerland or wherever the 
ministers are meeting to deal with the WTO, they always come back 
the bearers of bad news.  They say they thought they might be 
able to do a little something or a little horse trading, but in 
actual fact they could do nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a parliament are being rendered more and more irrelevant, 
because we have lost our ability to put in place a domestic drug 
policy that would act on behalf of the people of Canada.  We are 
being told that we have traded that ability away.  It is 
shameless.  Whoever traded away that ability, frankly has not 
done a service to Canada.  If our chief negotiators cannot do 
anything better than that, if they cannot come back with a better 
package than that, we better start looking for better 
negotiators.  They are clearly not representing the interests and 
the points of view of Canadians very adequately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certainly other prominent Liberals who spoke out over 
and over again on this back in the days when Liberal members 
stood up in defence of Canadians who needed relief on drug 
prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current solicitor general pointed out that the average cost 
of a prescription claim had risen at a rate in excess of 11% 
compounded annually for the period of 1987 through 1991, well 
above the CPR rate.  That was a good observation.  I have bad 
news for the current solicitor general.  Even though he was 
concerned back in 1991-92 about the escalating costs of drugs, he 
would be surprised to learn that cumulatively from 1987 to today 
the cost of drugs increased 340%.  That is the single highest and 
fastest growing cost in our health care system.  It is out of 
control.  He was worried about 11% annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, rather than some plan from the Liberals on how they might 
cope with this and help us deal with the crisis, all we have is 
another bill, which came in through the back door through the 
unelected Senate, that will compound the issue and make it even 
worse.  It will extend the 20 year patent protection to the 
remaining 30 products which are still at 17 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP caucus argues that even if we do accept that the private 
sector has to be involved in research and development of new 
drugs and that they deserve to recoup their costs and make a 
reasonable profit, we argue that 10 years is more than adequate. 
I challenge them to make the case as to why they need more than 
10 years.  I do not think the debate has been put to 
legislatures.  We have not debated here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that prior to the free trade agreement having imposed 20 
year patent protection, the pharmaceutical drug companies were 
the most profitable industry sector in our economy.  If people 
owned shares in those companies they did well.  We found it 
necessary to buy into their line, and they always wanted more.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old adage where I come from that says capital has no 
conscience.  These guys have an insatiable appetite for profit. 
They have an obligation to their shareholders to show the best 
possible rate of return.  If they can increase their profits just 
by coming to government and saying they deserve and need 20 year 
patent protection, and if we blindly tell them to take their 20 
years and let them compound their profits yet again, we are not 
doing our job in representing the interests of Canadian people. 
We are yielding far too readily.  We are not putting up a good 
fight.  We are not even putting up a good debate or a good 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 11 or 12 lonely NDP speakers in the House of Commons are the 
only people we have heard today advocating on behalf of the 
Canadian people.  All the other parties are advocating on behalf 
of multinational drug companies.  Not even our domestic generic 
drug industry is being represented here today.  We are hearing 
speaker after speaker on the government side say the poor 
international drug companies do not make enough money or have the 
tools they need to find cures to the illnesses we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is anyone speaking for Canadians here, for senior citizens who 
must cut prescriptions in half to make them stretch for the whole 
month?  Does anyone even care about that any more?  In listening 
to the speakers one would not think so.  They are not advocating 
on behalf of Canadians.  They are advocating on behalf of drug 
companies that do quite well around the world, frankly, without 
gouging Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17 would go even further.  It would tie our hands further 
by limiting the ability of generic drug companies to ready 
themselves for the day they are allowed to sell their product. It 
prohibits them from producing and stockpiling new drugs so that 
on day one after the 20 year patent expires they would be ready 
to release them into the community and into the hands of the 
people who need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill S-17 that would be limited and restricted, and I know 
why.  Although pharmaceutical companies enjoy a 20 year patent 
protection a bit of a charade goes on.  When the companies get 
close to the 20 year deadline they modify their drug a bit and 
ask for an extension.  They explain that it is not the same drug 
it was 19 years ago when they first developed it.  They say it is 
now a new and improved drug.  They negotiate and are often given 
another five to seven more years of holiday, of exclusive 
monopoly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that competition?  Is that what the champions of free 
competition support?  I hear the Canadian Alliance Party and 
people like it advocate giving one company an exclusive monopoly 
for 20 years in spite of all reason and logic, in spite of all 
the moral and ethical arguments associated with getting drugs 
into the hands of people who need them.  They are willing to turn 
their backs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are almost as chameleon-like as the Liberals in this 
regard.  They are willing to change their colour all of a sudden 
and say competition is good and healthy, but in this case these 
companies should be given an absolute monopoly for 20 years.  Let 
them really rake in the dough and then maybe they will find a 
cure for cancer.  If their only motivation is to make money they 
will not do the type of research we need them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of medical conditions for which it is not 
economically viable to do research.  Let us imagine an obscure 
condition which is probably curable but which perhaps only 
afflicts 5,000 people across the country.  If profit, not the 
well-being of humanity, is the sole motive no one will bother 
doing the research to find a cure for that condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point that out to illustrate what is fundamentally wrong with 
accepting that drug companies can, will and should be driven only 
by profit.  That is the only interest here.  There is a broader 
public interest to be served than just enhancing the profits of 
international drug companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out the inexorable link between the Liberal Party and 
the international drug cartel, arguably the single most effective 
and powerful lobby group in Ottawa.  That is probably why we are 
seeing this rammed through by the parties which benefit so 
greatly from the largesse of the drug companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prominent Liberals like Judy Erola did not even miss a step when 
she went from being a member of parliament to being the chief 
lobbyist for international drug companies.  It seems that any 
Liberal hack who runs out of gas in his or her political life can 
find a job in the offices of the drug companies.  There is a 
connection there. 
There is a link that borders on conflict because we are not 
looking after the best interests of Canadians.  We are being 
coerced more and more, through powerful people, their powerful 
contacts and their powerful cheque books, to look after the 
interests of drug companies before we look after the interests of 
senior citizens and Canadians.

Canadians instead of the drug companies, except those in the NDP 
caucus today.  There will be a record of this debate.  I hope

the final stake through the heart of any notion of a 
comprehensive plan to make drugs affordable for the Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's comments on Bill S-17.  We 
have similar constituencies.  Our constituencies are 
predominantly made up of people on modest or fixed incomes who 
have a hard time keeping up with the rising drug costs they are 
experiencing on a day to day basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one example and I wonder if my colleague could indicate 
whether his constituents have had similar experiences.  Not long 
ago a woman wrote to me and indicated that the price of a heart 
drug, digoxin or lanoxin, had gone from $18.30 for 120 tablets in 
May 2000 to $30.67 for 120 tablets in August 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an incredible jump for a drug that has been on the 
market a long time.  In this case it appears to be the result of 
one pharmaceutical company being taken over by another.  It 
illustrates the point we have been trying to make today that this 
is not about breakthrough drugs or about more public support for 
scientific discoveries.  It is about brand name drug companies 
trying to make every penny they can off drugs that were invented 
a long time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for my colleague, the member for Winnipeg 
Centre.  Is this the kind of experience he is hearing about in 
his own constituency?  What other impact is patent protection 
having on the ability of ordinary citizens in our constituencies 
to get access to necessary medications? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too have had residents of 
my riding come forward with horrifying stories of seemingly 
arbitrary increases in drug prices.  The stories pertain to 
standard drugs that are commonly prescribed and have been around 
a long time.  Out of the blue the cost often goes from $30 to $50 
for a bottle of pills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Winnipeg North Centre pointed out, if 
competition is to keep prices down, who will regulate the 
industry to make sure a monopolizing force does not gobble up 
other companies for the sole purpose of taking out the 
competition? When a larger firm gobbles up its only competition 
in the manufacture of a certain drug, what is to stop it from 
arbitrarily increasing the price of that drug? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It hearkens back to some of the points made earlier.  Without 
intervention or regulatory review the free market does not serve 
Canadians well in terms of the provision of health care.  Some 
things, frankly, are too critical and too important to be subject 
to the free hands of the market.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote the member for Ottawa West when she spoke 
to Bill C-91 while sitting in opposition to the Tory government. 
She was trying to make the same point and maybe did it better 
than I did when she was aggressively arguing against the 
implementation of a 20 year drug patent period.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to rise to speak against the 
bill.  It is about completely eliminating, for the entire 20 year 
patent period, the right of any generic manufacturer to produce a 
drug that is under patent and to compete with that drug in the 
open marketplace. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words the government was granting an absolute monopoly 
to a certain company, ostensibly to help it make up its research 
and development costs.  Our party would argue far beyond that. 
She went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the impact going to be?  The impact for Canadians is 
going to be higher drug costs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Ottawa West must have had a crystal ball 
because she was right.  From 1987 to today there has been a 344% 
increase in drug costs, far beyond the cost of expanded research 
and development and far beyond any increase in the cost of 
living.  It is wild gluttony in terms of gouging Canadians and 
the health care system for as much profit as it can possibly get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party would like to ask a question.  Is there 
not a moral and ethical argument that we in the House should be 
searching for ways to get those necessary drugs into the hands of 
Canadians who need them, and not finding ways to further pad the 
pockets of the brand name drug companies that are now seeking 20 
year patent protection, even on the 30 products that were left 
behind 17 years before? 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to follow up on the very eloquent comments of my colleague 
from Winnipeg Centre and to note that earlier in the debate one 
Liberal member suggested that the only way we could develop 
quality pharmaceutical drugs was if a healthy profit went to the 
private sector to develop those drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House of the pioneering work of Jonas Salk who 
refused to patent the polio vaccine.  He said that it would be 
like patenting the sun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals prattle on about how we have to make sure that 
the profit levels are high enough for the pharmaceutical 
companies, I say that there are dedicated women and men, 
scientists working in this field, who would be quite prepared to 
ensure that the product of their deliberation and research goes 
into the common good and does not go to contribute to corporate 
profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Winnipeg Centre referred to the member for 
Ottawa West.  I have a speech here that the member for Ottawa 
West made on December 9, 1992, an eloquent and passionate 
denunciation of Bill C-91.  She went on about the obscene profit 
levels of the pharmaceutical companies and said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to ask who pays for these great gains?  As I 
said, there are billions of dollars of revenue to be gained by 
the drug companies.  Seniors will pay.  Taxpayers will pay 
through medicare.  Anybody who is too poor to have a drug plan or 
who works for a company that does not have a drug plan will pay.

asked what is a healthy profit, how much was enough of a profit 
for drug companies.

the fact that there would be private sector involvement in the 
research and development of drugs.  However we have never debated 
what is a reasonable markup.  Yes, people should be able to 
recoup their research and development costs.  Yes, they should be 
able to make a reasonable profit, but how much is reasonable? 
That debate has taken away our ability to even review it in the 
House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that we have lost or have voluntarily forfeited 
our ability to implement a domestic strategy that might put drugs 
into the hands of Canadians a little more readily and in an 
accessible way.  Through the free trade agreements that were 
cited back in the Bill C-91 debate, we have sent negotiators to 
the table that bargained and traded away our ability to dictate 
our own domestic wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that most Canadians are of the view expressed by the NDP 
today.  Most people see the common sense in doing everything we 
can to be the champions and advocates of Canadians. We should 
take the courageous steps necessary to make sure we can get drugs 
into the hands of people who need them at an affordable price. 
However, if we voluntarily go into these trade agreements with 
blinders on and without any ability to dictate our own domestic 
control, it is not progress.  It is retrogressive.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to have this opportunity to speak to Bill S-17, an act to amend 
the Patent Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure for me to talk about the bill but I find it 
quite unfortunate that the current government, the Liberal 
government, cannot solve the problem with patent drugs here in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known that there is a problem with the health system 
everywhere in the country and not only in New Brunswick. I am 
sure that it is not limited to Quebec or to Ontario. It is a 
problem everywhere. However, there is another problem related to 
that one and it is the issue of patent drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could tell all sorts of stories about this. 
Usually it is the people from poor families who are the greatest 
consumers of patent drugs. Poor families do not have enough 
money to feed their children properly and they often end up in 
the hospital. They are the ones who consume a lot of patent drugs. 
Moreover, they do not have enough money to take care of their 
children's well-being, and not only their children's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell a little story. It deals with patent drugs. The 
story even made me cry, and the member for Acadie—Bathurst 
usually does not weep easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One day I received in my office a tape that was sent to me by a 
man from Val Doucet, in New Brunswick. The man could neither read 
nor write and he had sent me a tape on which he told me a sad 
story. I took the tape and brought it home. 
I sat in the living room and listened to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a sad story. It made me cry. It had to do with the 
document I have here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The man was telling me that he drew $404 a month from the Canada 
pension plan and had a card to get free prescription drugs 
through welfare. When his pension was increased by a few cents, 
he fell into a new bracket and lost his drug card. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the tape that he sent me, he told me that now, when he went 
to bed at night, he cried in pain because he could not afford to 
buy drugs. The patent drugs he needed were too expensive. 
He also needed to go to the dentist but because he could not 
afford that either he had blood on his pillow when he woke up 
in the morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad when people in Canada have to go through that because 
they cannot afford to buy patent drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met families last week who were saying the same thing, that 
drugs were too expensive and that they did not have a drug card 
and could not get one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As reported in <I>Hansard</I> on December 8, 1992, the government House

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, Liberals are standing up to say “We are doing this to 
save the world”.  Where were they in 1992?  This is shameful. 
They are working along with the drug companies on drug patents in 
the same way they operated with the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said that if they were in power they would do away with 
the GST.  Once in power, they continued it.  They said that if 
they were in power there would be no free trade.  They now are 
and we did get free trade.  They said that if they were in 
power they would remove the patents so the sick and the poor 
could buy drugs at affordable prices.  That is what they should 
have done. 
Well, they changed their mind and now, because they are the 
government, they do not have a choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have lots of stories to tell about the Liberals. We could 
talk about the $35 billion they took from workers who lost their 
jobs. We could talk about that too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could tell stories that are rather funny. We know, for 
example, that one company gave $100,000 to the Liberal Party, 
including $33,000 from Glaxo Wellcome, $25,000 from Merck Frosst 
and $10,000 from Dupont in the same year. I understand why they 
are saying today that the drug regulations should not be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds us of the U.S. health care system. Why is the U.S. 
health care system private? For the same reasons. It is because 
corporations pay politicians to keep it private and in turn get 
money from them. This is what is happening here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals do not care about people who are sick. The Liberals 
do not care about people who suffer from liver disease or other 
ailments. The Liberals could not care less. 
It is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I spent a whole day at the Bathurst 
hospital. There were people, women and children, on stretchers 
while on the third floor some departments were closed and beds 
were empty. The situation is that bad in this country. It is a 
disgrace to see such a thing in Canada, the most beautiful 
country in the world. We should be ashamed to go around claiming 
we have the most beautiful country in the world when sick 
children spend three or four hours crying in the emergency 
department. They cannot get service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people enter hospitals, nurses tell them “I am exhausted”. 
They also told me “Sir, I am exhausted, I cannot cope with the 
situation any more”. Doctors say the same thing “I worked all 
weekend, all week and I am exhausted”. I have a nephew who is in 
hospital in Quebec City. As soon as he came back from the United 
States he was hospitalized in Quebec City. This was the third 
hospital he had gone to. Overnight, we found ourselves without 
any services. That is what the health care system is like in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals were in the opposition they boasted. They 
shouted out “Vote for us, we will change everything”. They gave 
us back the GST. How very kind of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, I spoke to some employers. One of them told me “The 
only thing Liberals did is that they gave me their work; I 
collect GST from people and every three months I have to do the 
books for them. After that, they put us into debt”. Thanks a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing Liberals did for us is that they privatized 
everything around us, even Petro-Canada last week. Liberals were 
supposed to be on the left, in the centre or wherever. However, I 
know where they are. They are in the Pacific and in the Atlantic 
but they have forgotten to come to Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the Liberals are because they do not care about 
Canadians. They make promises but in fact they are lies. Mr. 
Speaker, excuse me for using those words, but this is the truth. 
This is what is really happening. This is what people in my 
region and all over are saying. You are smiling for a good 
reason, Mr. Speaker, you know I am right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is no joke. 
I talked earlier about all the money the government stole from 
the EI fund. I also mentioned that more than 800,000 workers are 
not eligible for EI benefits and that 1.4 million children go 
hungry. Can the members imagine how destitute these people are? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the weekend, as I toured my riding, some people asked me 
“Where are we going as a country? What are politicians thinking 
about? Are they not supposed to stand up for us?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing we hear from right wing governments is: how can 
this large company make a profit, how can this big insurance 
company manage, how can we protect this business here and that 
business there? But then in the throne speech the government 
tells us that it wants to take care of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, the House passed a motion calling on the government to 
eradicate child poverty in Canada by 1999. Children would no 
longer go to school on an empty stomach. Nowadays, not only are 
these children still hungry but they also cannot afford whatever 
medication they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could be considering a bill to set the price of drugs and 
make them more affordable but no, we need to take care of the 
large companies, those that make $100,000 donations to the 
government party. Those are the people we need to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to the United States and talked with some people who have 
a private drug plan. Life can be tough for workers with a 
private drug plan who end up sick in hospital. 
If they do not have hospital insurance and have to sell their 
house and their car and declare bankruptcy, it is no joke.  Is 
that what we want as Canadians?  The government is doing nothing 
to stop this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid of free trade and I am afraid of NAFTA.  I am still 
afraid of the free trade area of the Americas as in the 
negotiations we had in Quebec City and the way those peacefully 
demonstrating were treated.  Not everyone went over the perimeter 
fence.  People were sitting there peacefully demonstrating and 
the RCMP shot them with plastic bullets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They used tear gas on people who were fighting against the big 
machine.  The big machine was inside. I was proud to be in Quebec 
City, to be outside the security perimeter fence with the people 
who elected me.  I much prefer to be with those who elected me 
than to be inside the fence with the Bush gang and all the 
others, with the American helicopters flying overhead.  We felt 
like we were not in Canada any more. This is the way we will be 
run by a country called the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be unfortunate if the government passed the bill.  I 
am sure that if the government took just a half an hour, not much 
more, and looked back over its years in opposition in 1989, 1991 
and 1992, it would say “We were pretty smart then”.  We all 
complained about what the Progressive Conservatives were doing. 
The only problem is that the day after the election the 
Liberals had a shot and it was just as if the Conservatives were 
there. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what it looks like. You know what? I pray God that I 
never become a government member because some magical thing 
happens as soon as one is in office. It would seem that one 
instantly forgets everything he or she said before and everything 
that Canadians wanted.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not deny the fact that during the election campaign the 
NDP talked a lot about health care. According to the polls, 
Canadians felt that health was the number one priority in Canada. 
Canadians did not want to go to the hospital and find their 
grandfather or grandmother in a corridor. Nor did they want to 
find their children in the corridors. They wanted to find them in 
a hospital bed and they wanted them to be cared for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go to a veterinarian there are no dogs or cats in the 
corridor because they are being treated. Humans, however, are 
left in the corridors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent the whole day in the hospital yesterday. I saw a woman 
with a child wrapped in a blanket and everybody was just 
walking by. It is shameful to have this kind of health care in 
Canada. Then the government tells us that it has nothing to do 
with money if we do not have a good health care system, that we 
should be doing things differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we could do things differently. We see people take to the 
hospital someone who is scheduled for surgery in three weeks, 
and that person is kept in the hospital for three weeks just to 
ensure he or she does not lose his or her place. Maybe it would 
be less expensive to send that person home. That would be doing 
things differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot come here and say that we must protect 
companies by allowing them to sell their pills and make profits 
for 20 years while another company could sell the same pills for 
less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the free market the Liberals used to talk about so 
much? Now they no longer support the free market because they 
know they have to protect a couple of companies that will give 
over $100,000 to the government for the next election. That is 
what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the health care situation in Canada, hospitals are 
in pretty bad shape, as are long term care facilities. 
Governments send people from the hospital to a long term care 
facility and there is nobody to take care of them there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago I visited a long term care facility. It 
reminded me of an assembly line. An elderly man and an elderly 
woman were sitting there and somebody had a plate and was 
feeding them as if they were animals. That is how it is now in 
Canada. It is a disgrace. 
This is what is happening in the country.  I am not here this 
evening to make things up.  This is what is happening in the 
country and it is a real disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are the people we are talking about?  Us. We will 
perhaps be the next ones who will need to go into a nursing home.  We 
will be the next ones sitting in a hospital waiting for care. We 
will be the ones asking where the nurse is.  The poor nurse is 
pretty tired.  She works a 12 hour shift five or six days in a 
row.  The doctor is pretty tired too.  The one I met yesterday 
sure was.  He said “There are people to hand out pills to them 
from time to time but they have to come to the hospital”. After 
that, they are on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the way things are going in our country we can have 
a great old time here.  It is not hard for us.  If we are ill, we 
go to the pharmacy, get a prescription filled, send it in to the 
government and it is paid for.  Decisions such as these are all 
very fine and well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the poor father who works as a logger, for instance, who has 
no drug plan or who does not receive welfare will have to pay $50 
or $60 dollars for pills for his child who comes home sick after 
a day at school.  There is also the 64 year old woman who came to 
my office and said “The pills for me and my husband cost $200 a 
month”.  Do people think I am kidding?  Do they think this is how 
these people want to die? Do they think they want to die 
suffering like this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should do some soul searching. They may be boasting 
that there is no problem but we are still in this predicament. 
The Prime Minister is bragging that he has been here for 38 years 
and that he will stay until it is 40. We will soon have a 
celebration. It is going to be a lot of fun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, Canadians suffer, people have a hard time 
and the government is not doing what it should be doing. It is 
not keeping its election promises. During a campaign it makes a 
lot of promises but as soon as the election is over, it does not 
give a hoot. It is laughing at people. 
This is unacceptable. As human beings, Canadians deserve more 
than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, if someone is seen hitting a dog that person is 
picked up and locked up. The same thing can happen to those who 
do not feed or care for their pet.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, those who do not feed their child because they have no 
money, if the government says the word, will have to pay. There 
will be nothing on this point in the legislation.  That is the 
law in Canada.  It is possible to make people suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say there should be a law against this.  We should not be 
allowed to make people, youngsters suffer.  The elderly, those 
who retire should be able to pay for their drugs without skimping 
on food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals had a place in their hearts for Canadians, they 
would take the appropriate measures. They would change the law 
and pass a real bill that would please Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst for what is once again 
a very passionate presentation.  He put across the views of many 
Canadians in the way they would expect a member of the House of 
Commons to do on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes me as we wind down to the final moments of the debate 
today on Bill S-17 that there has only been one party, one 
collective voice in the House of Commons that is advocating on 
behalf of ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from party after party, from the ruling Liberal 
Party to the Alliance Party, to the Bloc, to the Conservatives. 
All of them seem to see nothing wrong in the bill.  It would in 
fact further augment and further enhance unreasonable profits for 
brand name drug companies.  It is a bill which says nothing about 
the urgent situation in which Canadians find themselves in terms 
of affordable drug costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put it to the hon. member that we are sent here by Canadians 
to advocate on their behalf, not to be corporate shills to 
advocate on behalf of multinational pharmaceutical drug companies 
that are frankly quite capable of taking care of their own 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were sent here with a message.  The message I get from the 
people in my riding, and I would like the hon. member for 
Acadie—Bathurst to concur, is that they are asking me to go to 
Ottawa and do something about the spiralling, out of control, 
escalating costs of drugs.  Then we could put drugs into the 
hands of people who need them most at an affordable price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member agree that throughout the debate today 
there has only been one collective voice, the voice of reason on 
behalf of Canadian people, and that is the voice of the NDP 
caucus? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Winnipeg Centre for the comments he made.  I am proud of what the 
NDP has said today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign the Liberals asked me why I did not 
switch to the Liberal Party.  I said that the reason I would not 
switch to the Liberal Party is that it has no values.  The only 
values it has is 35 days before an election.  After the election 
it loses all its values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have said very clearly that they do not want to pay 
the price they pay for medication.  If we had a referendum in the 
country today about whether or not Canadians want the bill to go 
through, they would say no very loudly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what the Liberals will do.  They have to answer to 
the big corporations, the ones that lobby them, the ones with the 
big wallets that are nice to them.  They give a lot of money. 
That is what they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is another thing.  On the issues of health care and 
pharmacare, we are the ones who have pushed those issues for 
Canadians.  I am very proud of that.

eloquent speech. He spoke with a lot of passion about this very 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has always spoken out on behalf of the elderly, the 
poor and the less fortunate, not only in his riding but anywhere 
in Canada. As New Democrats, we know very well that this bill

programs an extra $200 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is frankly unbelievable that we are now the only political 
party in parliament that stands up for the consumers, for the 
poor and for sick people, as the member for Acadie—Bathurst has 
already done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I am sorry that the Bloc Quebecois is voting in 
favour of the bill. As far as the Canadian Alliance is 
concerned, it is understandable since that party has always 
supported the large corporations. As for the Liberals, we heard 
what they said in 1987. I was here. My colleague from 
Winnipeg—Transcona was here. It was in 1987. I remember. The 
Minister of Industry said “We will do all we can to stop this 
bill.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the same thing in 1992 with Bill C-91. 
I am sure the member for Winnipeg—Transcona remembers it very 
well. The Liberals were there. They said that they were against 
the bill because it was a gift to the large pharmaceuticals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that they are in office, what are they doing? They are 
handing out gifts like this one they are bestowing on the large 
pharmaceutical companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Acadie—Bathurst pointed out, we were in 
Quebec City. All our members, including our leader, the member 
for Halifax, were in Quebec City, because we say no. We say no to 
this agenda, which would change our hemisphere forever by using 
the rules governing intellectual property to protect the rights 
of private businesses throughout the Americas, the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very familiar with what is happening at the WTO and under 
NAFTA. We have seen what is happening, for instance, with the 
price of patent drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my hon. colleague could explain why we were in 
Quebec City to protest against these deals that would bestow more

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, the reason we went to Quebec City 
is that we believe in the people. Our place was there in 
Quebec City with the people who voted for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Conservatives were in power, the Liberals were against 
free trade. Then, when they formed the government, they started 
promoting free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not against free trade. We are, however, in favour of 
fair trade. We are not willing to bargain away our country, our 
environment, our water and our drugs as this government is doing, 
and go the American way as it is proposing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not willing to do that. We are not willing to accept 
that. We like our country and we want to keep it. We have no 
links to the big corporations such as Bronfman or Irving in New 
Brunswick. We are not their puppets. We do not get up in the 
morning asking “What should I be doing, Mr. Irving? What is my 
agenda for today?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to do that. I was happy to be in Quebec City to 
speak up for ordinary Canadians. I believe that today Canadians 
are happy that we were there so that today we can ask more 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I could add that the current government House leader had 
continued his speech in 1992. As I have a couple of minutes left, 
I will continue quoting what he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Medical Association told us that the amount now 
spent on drugs exceeds the amount spent on physician care in this 
country. It is a large component of our healthcare costs. 
The CMA should know something about it. It appeared before our 
committee and said that unless the bill—it was a Conservative 
bill—was amended, it could not support it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal House leader said “I challenge any member across to 
say otherwise”. That is what he said to the Conservatives. 
Because of that, there is no doubt about it, the people across 
the way are two-faced.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government House leader who said that and he is now 
sitting across the way. He should be ashamed of himself for 
changing his tune like that. This is how the Liberals lose the 
people's confidence. The Prime Minister of Canada may have been 
in the House for 40 years but one day he will be kicked out, 
perhaps for a long time, along with the rest of the members who 
support him because they do not care about Canadians. I am 
convinced that Canadians will see the light one of these days.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the House on February 12 the 
Minister of Justice and the Deputy Prime Minister denied that the 
government was privatizing the gun registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then in a media scrum outside the House the minister said she 
was outsourcing, not privatizing the gun registry.  Since that 
time she has been unable to successfully describe to anyone's 
satisfaction the difference between privatizing and outsourcing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 3 the Moncton <I>Times and Transcript</I> reported that 
a crowd of 700 demonstrators protested in Miramichi because they 
were upset over reports that the Canadian Firearms Centre would 
be privatized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same newspaper on April 24 it was reported that 70 
employees were to be laid off on May 6.  The article stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the union believes the federal government plans to 
privatize the entire licensing and registration system, taking 
all the workers off the federal payroll and with no guarantees a 
private company would hire any of them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 27 the Edmonton <I>Sun</I> reported that the RCMP 
were laying off 130 civilians working the national gun registry. 
Lynn Ray, president of the Union of Solicitor General Employees, 
said the layoffs and transfer of another 130 employees from the 
RCMP to the Department of Justice was the first step toward 
privatizing the registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>National Post</I> ran a front page story on March 1 which 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a document that seems to contradict assurances by...the 
Minister of Justice, that only parts of the registry and 
licensing functions would be outsourced, Public Works Canada has 
assured 12 prospective bidders that the successful contractor 
would conduct “all transactions with clients except certain 
investigations” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“More specifically, we mean that the vendor will own and 
operate the business process delivery component as identified in 
the letter of interest”— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 1 the Edmonton <I>Sun</I> printed comments by Edmonton 
city police Staff Sergeant Al Bohachyk.  Bohachyk called the 
privatized gun registry a frightening prospect because: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—no private company could guarantee personal information in gun 
licence and registration databases won't get out to the wrong 
people, organized crime figures, for instance. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 16 I received a letter from Mr. George Radwanski, 
the privacy commissioner of Canada.  The privacy commissioner 
confirmed that the justice department did not even consult with 
his office about its privatization initiative.  In his letter he 
stated that he was deeply concerned that justice may privatize or 
outsource the Canadian firearms program.  He intends to pursue 
the matter with the department.  This is very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 4 the Library of Parliament discovered that there were 
already seven private firearms officers working for the gun 
registry in New Brunswick.  One of these privatized firearms 
officers even has his own private investigation firm in 
Fredericton.  His appointment letter gives him the power to 
conduct investigations by reviewing police files and by 
conducting interviews with applicants, spouses, relatives, 
neighbours and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This firearms officer, a private eye, told my office that he 
told a newspaper reporter he was doing firearms background checks 
because he thought it would be good for his business.  How could 
he possibly keep the information he gathers as a private firearms 
officer separate from the information he uses to advance the 
interest of his own private investigation firm and his private 
clients?  The privacy commissioner is investigating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An April 20 headline in the Moncton <I>Times and Transcript</I> 
read “Gun registry privatization nears reality”.  Union leaders 
call what the government is doing with the gun registry 
privatization.  Every newspaper story written on the issue calls 
it privatization.  Robert Klassen, professor of operations 
management at the University of Western Ontario, told the 
<I>National Post</I> that it sounded like privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The documents provided by the Department of Justice to the 
private companies bidding on the job say the successful bidder 
will own and operate the business process and will conduct all 
transactions except certain investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister insist on calling it outsourcing?  Why 
will the minister not admit in public that which everyone else 
knows and what she privately tells the private companies she is 
negotiating with?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the question of outsourcing for some services and products to 
support the firearms program has become an issue before the 
House.  This is in no way privatization of the program, as some 
opposition members would have us believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has made it clear to the House that she 
will remain fully accountable for the firearms program.  However, 
if there are private sector companies that can provide off the 
shelf technology, then it makes sense to outsource as opposed to 
recreating such products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Firearms Centre is simply looking at ways to ensure 
that the program is delivered efficiently and cost effectively 
without compromising public safety.  The centre has solicited for 
ideas on how the objectives of the program could be met while 
lowering costs and improving client services.  This an 
exploratory exercise to determine what services and products are 
available that could help reduce costs and do the job effectively 
and efficiently, while adhering to our high public safety 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outsourcing is not new to the firearms program.  For example, an 
Ottawa firm has been providing assistance in processing licence 
application forms.  Another firm provided expertise in developing 
the automated registry system.  We know the private sector can be 
a partner in support of the program by providing cost effective 
and efficient services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public safety is paramount and it guides all changes made to the 
administration of the program.  Public safety and the security of 
personal and other information remains the cornerstone of the 
firearms program.  Security and privacy protection will remain as 
stringent as the current system and improved if possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Canadian firearms program evolves toward a steady state, 
it is important to consider all options aimed at lowering costs 
and increasing efficiency while maintaining the safety and 
security of information.
