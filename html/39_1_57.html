On May 31, you invited members to comment on whether Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A> would require a royal recommendation. Without commenting on the merits of this private member's bill, it is the government's view that this bill requires a royal recommendation since the bill proposes the creation of an entirely new category of grants, which would modify the purpose of the existing act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121313"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para121317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirement for spending is clear in the text of the bill itself, which specifies that grants for disabled students not exceed $2,000 and that those for low income students not exceed $3,000.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members might argue that the original act provided students with financial assistance and that the new original royal recommendation covers this new bill. However, the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act was enacted to provide the authority for repayable loans. In creating an entirely new non-repayable grant, this bill changes the purpose of the bill and involves a new and significant appropriation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I believe that the bill, in its entirety, requires a royal recommendation.</div>

    </p><a name="Para121321"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed to get this kind of reaction from the government benches to a bill that is very important. He talks about non-repayable loans and so forth. This is about the Canada access grants program. It is a program of grants, not of loans. These are grants that are already paid to students.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe his statement is inaccurate, Mr. Speaker, and I think if you examine the nature of the present program and the nature of my bill you will find that all it is talking about is extending the program over the course of four years. The government has various flexibility in terms of how it does that and I do not think, therefore, that it does require a royal recommendation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what is disappointing this morning for me is to see this reaction from the government which indicates a lack of interest in supporting this bill as it is. Raising this objection indicates its lack of desire to provide the support that our students in this country so badly need. I look forward to speaking to the substance of the bill in a moment.</div>

    </p><a name="Para121326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I note there has been an objection from the government in terms of the question of royal recommendation, I still hope that hon. colleagues from all sides of the House will find favour with the bill and will recognize the importance of this issue. I think the bill could have a dramatic impact on the future of not only students across this country, young people, particularly those from low income families and those with disabilities, but also on our country and its future prosperity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am well aware these days of the issue of post-secondary education because my oldest daughter has joined the many thousands of young Canadians who go off to university and community colleges across this country every year. This fall she started at Acadia University. I wear what is called an X ring, which indicates that I am a graduate of St. Francis Xavier University. Although I did point out to my daughter the odd time that in fact St. FX was selected over and over, and again this year, as the number one undergraduate university in the country, that did not seem to persuade her. Sometimes we parents do not get our way, but I must acknowledge that Acadia is certainly an outstanding institution as well. I know she will enjoy herself there. She is a good student and I am sure she will do well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mount St. Vincent University is located in my riding of Halifax, Nova Scotia, as are many others in my province. We have St. FX, as I mentioned, Cape Breton University, St. Mary's University, Dalhousie University, Acadia University, King's College University, the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design and the Nova Scotia Community College. We do have a large number of universities and post-secondary education institutions in my province where this issue is particularly important. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the concerns people in Nova Scotia have had for many years is that funding for education is provided not on a per student basis, but on a per capita basis. When many students immigrate into a province to study then that province incurs the cost of educating those students who from other parts of the country. The real concern is that funding is not provided in relation to the fact that a province has all those additional students. It is a real challenge.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the national level and in my region there are some disturbing trends at the post-secondary education level. First year enrolment is starting to go down a bit now that the double cohort from Ontario has passed through its first and second year and is moving on. For instance, first year enrolment at St. Mary's University is down 7%. This is expected to continue at many schools and universities across my province and across the country over the next decade. Acadia also reported this year that first year enrolments were sluggish, at least in August, although I think they may have picked up since.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveys have found that as many as 36% of high school graduates cite financial reasons as a barrier to going on to university or community college. This bill would help to eliminate some of those barriers. Let me go through some of the highlights of the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A> would expand Canada access grants, which is a program that already provides financial assistance to students from low income families or those who are disabled. Currently, the grants under this program are available for the first year of study for those who are from low income families and for those with disabilities. The bill would extend the availability of this grant to all four years of study. This is an important measure for low income students and those students facing the challenge of having disabilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would also create a statutory base for the Canada access grants, making it, in my view, much more difficult to cancel or change without Parliament having a say in the process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investing in education is not about promoting the individual wealth of those lucky enough to be able to afford to go to higher education. It is about creating a stronger, more prosperous, more personally enriched, in a sense of enriched with knowledge, society. We do that by providing opportunities to all Canadians. As government, as Parliament we have a responsibility to improve our country by improving opportunities for all our citizens, and this bill would help to do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is a nation-building investment. We have an education deficit in this country that needs to be addressed through measures like those in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A>.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110">(1110)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para121336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that nine million working age people, or 42% of Canadians, have literacy skills that are below the level considered necessary to function in our society today. This relates to the whole question of education and higher education. I was quite alarmed last week, and colleagues on both sides of the House should be alarmed as well, at the government's decision to cut $17.7 million from funding to literacy groups across the country. That funding is very important for those groups to train the teachers, to develop curriculum and to keep the programs going all over the country that helps adults to learn to write and read.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Canada is to be productive in the future and have a more competitive economy, I believe, and I think most hon. colleagues will agree, we need to invest in those people and in those kinds of programs. I think cutting that program is a huge mistake. I hope my colleagues on the Conservative side of the House will work to persuade the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> to rescind that cut. It is wrong to write off these adults who are working hard to learn to read and write. It is not the answer at all.

    </p><a name="Para121338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far we have seen no indication from the government that it intends to help low income students or those with disabilities to obtain higher education and to pay for it. Otherwise, if the government were really interested in these things, it would not have cut, for instance, the summer career placement program, a summer employment program for students. Next year that program will be cut in half. Many employers in the country are already saying that if they do not have that kind of funding to assist them in paying the salaries of these students that they will not be hiring those students. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many students will be affected by that program being cut because they will not have the income they need next summer to return to school in the fall. This program is being cut in half. I hope my hon. colleagues will be lobbying the ministers and pushing them to rescind that cut as well. I think it is an error. It is not a huge amount of money in terms of the overall budget of the government. I think the government could certainly afford it in the excellent financial condition in which it has been left.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Federation of Students estimates that up to 25,000 summer jobs for students are being eliminated by that cut. As the Canadian Federation of Students has pointed out, university and college is already beyond the means of thousands of Canadian families and cutting the funding for that program will mean that many students will not be able to go back to school next year and those who do return will be saddled with even more debt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that tuition fees have been rising dramatically in recent years. Nationally, the average undergrad tuition is $4,347 for the 2006-07 academic year, which is a big hike from the $1,464 average in 1990-91. This is another reason for us to provide more assistance to students. We should be keeping the pressure on the government to move forward and keep its promise of a dedicated education transfer. We have not seen it. We did not see it in the budget. We have not seen any indication of that promise being kept. It is important that we see some action on this important point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the government is holding post-secondary education and training consultations but who is it consulting with? A number of student groups, such as the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations and the College Student Alliance, have written to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78764,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78764&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development</A> to express their concern about not being invited to take part in this process. That seems an odd decision. If the minister is going to consult about post-secondary education, surely the students should not be totally ignored. Surely that should be corrected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has also cut or eliminated a series of youth and international internships, such as the Fulbright scholarships, which provided the opportunity to study between the U.S. and Canada, for students to go to another country and have exposure there and learn about that country. Those are very important programs for our students to get exposure to the rest of the world and to develop a network for the future. As a trading nation, a nation that exports so much of its goods and services, it is absolutely important that we continue to develop the contacts we have and the understanding our young people have about other countries. Cutting these kinds of international scholarships is a grave error. Again, I hope that the government will reconsider this approach.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115">(1115)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para121344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we saw a very different approach a year ago when our government was prepared to, for instance, expand the Canada access grants to cover all four years of study and to have the fifty-fifty plan, which would have paid for half the tuition for all Canadian students for both the first and the last year of study. Of course, what we need to see here is a comprehensive review of student assistance in total. That is an important step to take. We should not just look at some small aspect of this, but at the whole picture of how students are paying for their education and what government can do to assist them, because Canadian students need more support if they are to be able to afford their education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last fall's fiscal update, we did see additional funding for Canadian students studying abroad and a 50% increase in funding for graduate scholarships. However, forcing students from low income families to shoulder heavier and heavier debt loads to get their education is unconscionable. It is not in the interest of our country. It is not in the interest of our economy. Those people need to be able to get a good start in life as they come out of university. If they have huge debt loads, it is a lot harder for that to happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in terms of our future productivity, the imminent retirement of the baby boom generation demands that we train and educate as many Canadians as possible to replenish our workforce. This is an absolute priority. I think we need to see more recognition of that from the government side.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a comprehensive grant system, the kind this bill would create, thousands of Canadian students who qualify for post-secondary education and have the marks to get in will not be able to attend. We should be gravely concerned if that occurs, whenever it occurs, and it is occurring now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding the Canada access grants is the most effective and efficient way, I believe, to provide support to Canadian students who need it most. The average debt for university graduates with a bachelor's degree is $20,000. That is according to the latest information available from Statistics Canada. The average debt for college graduates is almost $13,000. Fourteen per cent of university graduates have $25,000 or more in student debt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing a statutory base for the Canada access grants, as the bill would do, would make it much more difficult to end or change the program without parliamentary scrutiny. I think it is important that this be the case. It should not be the case that the government can simply scrap this willy-nilly. I think this Parliament has supported this idea or concept of support for students with the Canada access grants. I think we need to put this into law and make sure it is a permanent program, because education and training are clearly a fundamental cornerstone for building a sustainable economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are we going to have a competitive nation? How are we going to have a competitive economy and a more productive economy if we are not prepared to invest in these areas?</div>
    </p><a name="Para121351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Council of the Federation recently reported that 70% of the jobs created in the coming years will require a post-secondary education. Let us imagine that. It seems to me that one of the challenges we face with high school and pre-high school students is to make more of them aware of what it means to have a university or community college education and what it can mean for future income. There is the fact that one's chance of being unemployed if one goes on to higher education is dramatically lower and one's income will be dramatically higher. We see that in study after study.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that when we see a situation like the boom in the petroleum sector in Alberta, for instance, there are a lot of jobs right now that may not require a higher education, but more and more of them do. When we look at the skilled trades, for example, we see that those trades are becoming more and more complex. Reading the manuals alone is becoming complex. Higher levels of reading, arithmetic and mathematics will be required. Higher levels of education will be essential for for all those things. This bill would help those students who are facing the challenge of being from low income families or the challenge of disabilities to afford to go. I think it is an important measure. I hope my hon. colleagues will support the bill. </div>

This tax credit would provide students basically about $80 toward their textbooks. I do not know if my hon. colleague has children in university. She is probably much too young to have children in university yet, and I can hear my colleagues agreeing with me, but she undoubtedly eventually will have students in post-secondary education. Many of us here have been students, of course, and we know that it is pretty rare for students' books not to cost a lot more than $80 a year. Eighty dollars is a drop in the bucket compared to the real needs that students have. I do not think that credit responds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, my bill is trying to deal with particularly those students who come from low income families and those students who have disabilities. I think we should focus on aiding them with this bill. There should be other measures like a dedicated education transfer, which was promised but not delivered by the government. There should be an overhaul of the Canada student loan program. We are not seeing any of that happening. We are talking about consultation, but we are not seeing results. It looks like the government is not even talking to the students.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121358"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague mentioned infrastructure. We saw a drop in the bucket in that regard in the budget this year, but it is a long way from what is needed and it is a long way from what we in our party proposed in the election campaign. We proposed a $1 billion fund. In fact, we need more than that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are universities in this country that have absolutely enormous maintenance deficits, because for many years they have been putting off maintenance in order to look after other things, to pay for the groceries, basically. I understand that. It is quite understandable that they have to look after the education of their students first. At times it has meant that they have put off repairs to and the maintenance of important buildings and other systems. It is absolutely critical, of course, that they have more funding for that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121360"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are other measures that I think the government should take, but the bill today is talking about one measure, and that is the Canada access grants. I did not hear from my hon. colleague that she supports this bill or the idea of the Canada access grants. I hope all colleagues recognize the value of supporting these kinds of students, the students from low income families and those with disabilities, to help them get into university and pay for the cost of their education.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I begin I would like to acknowledge that there is a common consensus in the House, indeed among all Canadians, on the tremendous value of post-secondary education, for a high quality education represents a crucial stage in tapping the potential of future generations of Canadians. Not only will it provide them with the knowledge, skills and experiences to acquire well paid jobs and fulfilling careers, but it will provide Canada with the skills and the imaginative human capital we need to succeed in the increasingly competitive global economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121366"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sir Winston Churchill so accurately forecast over half a century ago, “The empires of the future are the empires of the mind”. In this spirit, I join with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78801,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78801&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Halifax West</A> in recognizing the need to support students from low income families in access to post-secondary education. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121367"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as we endeavour to pursue these objectives, we must ensure that we do so in a manner that achieves the desired results through the most effective and efficient methods possible. As a result, I welcome the opportunity to engage in today's discussion on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before getting into specifics, I believe it is important to frame the discussion in the larger context of the Government of Canada's current support for post-secondary education. It is important to recall the substantial overall investments the Government of Canada makes in post-secondary education in a variety of interrelated ways.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121369"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it should be noted that we cooperate closely with our provincial and territorial counterparts in this area. For instance, in the last fiscal year the Government of Canada transferred $15.5 billion to the provinces and territories for post-secondary education and social services. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the government provides another $1.8 billion through various grants and loans to help students obtain a post-secondary degree. For instance, through the Canada student loan program, we provide $1.6 billion annually in loans to nearly 340,000 students.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121371"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, in addition to this direct assistance, the Government of Canada also has a range of other incentives to help Canadians finance their post-secondary education. These include tax measures such as the student loan interest credit, the tuition tax credit and the education tax credit, all of which help cover non-tuition costs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have incentives to help Canadians save for post-secondary education, such as the Canada learning bond and the Canada education savings grants. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121373"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ongoing support, in all of its many forms, reflects a broad commitment to post-secondary education, but Canada's new government is not content to stop there. In budget 2006, we brought forward tangible measures and made a substantial investment to help Canadian students and their families meet the rising costs of post-secondary education. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121374"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures included the introduction of a new textbook tax credit, the expanded eligibility for students seeking Canada student loans by reducing the amounts parents are expected to contribute toward their children's education, and the creation of a tax exemption for all scholarship and bursary income.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, our government is acknowledging the groundbreaking research on Canada's university campuses, and to support further breakthroughs and innovations, budget 2006 provided an additional $100 million on top of the $1 billion the Government of Canada already provides for post-secondary research and technological development, including $40 million per year for the indirect costs of research programs, $20 million per year for the leaders opportunity fund of the Canada Foundation for Innovation, $17 million per year for the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and $6 million per year for the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130">(1130)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para121376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures are concrete examples of our new government's recognition of the importance of research to increasing Canada's productivity and our standard of living. Claire Morris, President of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, stated:</div>

</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para121378"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more, budget 2006 strengthened the entire post-secondary sector with an allocation of $1 billion to the provinces and territories for pressing investments in post-secondary education and infrastructure such as libraries and laboratories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121379"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to keep these substantial investments and incentives in mind when assessing the merits of the proposals contained within Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A>. It is also critical to remember that any legislation affecting education by definition involves a cooperative approach with the provinces and territories. It is also important to recall the bleak record of the defeated Liberal government after 13 years in power. </div>

To begin with, it has been suggested that due to the fact the grant under discussion is merely one year old, the availability of comprehensive data to inform our decision is somewhat lacking which as a result may hinder our ability to properly determine whether additional measures are needed. We must be mindful that such proposed changes would require consultations with provincial and territorial governments.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional issue that merits mention is the fact that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A> proposes to repeal the Canada access grants provisions in the Canada student financial assistance regulations and integrate them into the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, since other grants under the Canada student loans program would still be governed through regulations, the proposed bill would create a two tiered approach to governance.

I will begin by giving an overview of the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121392"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I will remind members that, in keeping with its unconstitutional tendency to intrude into the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces, the federal government has already stuck its nose into the field of education by providing Canada access grants.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of Canada access grants: assistance for students from low-income families and assistance for students with permanent disabilities. These grants are a type of bursary, and the grant amount depends on a number of criteria.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider, for example, the first form of grant: the Canada access grant for students from low-income families. The Canada Student Financial Assistance Regulations, adopted under the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act, provide that the federal government or its intermediaries can provide initial Canada access grants to students from low-income families who are in their first year of post-secondary education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations also specify that the Canada access grant paid to a qualifying student can cover up to half of the student's tuition, based on need, but must not exceed $3,000. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations set eligibility conditions that applicants must meet. They are as follows: the applicant must be in the first year of a program of studies and must never previously have been enrolled in a post-secondary program; the applicant must enroll in a post-secondary program of studies within four years after leaving secondary school; the program in which the applicant is enrolled must be offered by a recognized institution, must be at least two years in length and must lead to a certificate or diploma; the program must be full-time; the net income of the student's parents must fall within the range that qualifies them for the national child benefit supplement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of grant is the Canada access grant for students with permanent disabilities. Just like the Canada access grants for students from low-income families, it is the Canada Student Financial Assistance Regulations, passed under the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act, that defines the list of criteria for being considered a student with a permanent disability. One of the conditions is the requirement to provide proof of the permanent disability by way of a medical certificate, for instance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations stipulate that the grant to an applicant with a permanent disability corresponds to the student's assessed need, up to a maximum of $2,000 a year, for every year he or she is eligible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now comes Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is simple: it extends the availability of grants for low-income students from the first year of post secondary education to all years of post secondary education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121401"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the criteria and terms for granting the Canada access grants for students are set out in the regulations, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A> integrates these criteria and terms directly in the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act and, accordingly, repeals them from the Canada Student Financial Assistance Regulations.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, by incorporating regulatory provisions into an act, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284 </A>would make subsequent amendments more difficult. Although an ideological Conservative government that cuts programs for under-privileged citizens might see this as a good thing, it would make it much more difficult to improve measures. Furthermore, changes to the access grant program for students, especially amendments affecting the indexation of amounts granted, would have to be legislated. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is no indexation mechanism for the amounts set out in the act. This is significant because $2,000 today will no longer be worth $2,000 in four, five or six years. Students' needs are of vital importance, but the money the federal government gives to education, primarily through the Canada social transfer, is not nearly enough, nor does it not enable Quebec to finance its post-secondary education system as much as it would like. We must ensure that the funds provided are adequate and take into account the rising cost of living. The lack of an indexation mechanism is therefore a serious shortcoming.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284 </A>is just a band-aid, not a long-term solution. Until the fiscal imbalance is resolved, and until Quebec can count on additional own-source revenues of $30.9 billion per year, the post-secondary education system will continue to be underfunded.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121411"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our position is simple. The Bloc Québécois will support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284 </A>in principle so that it can go to committee for further discussion of the amounts to be offered to students and the absence of an indexation mechanism. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121412"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois is fully aware that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A> is acceptable only because the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act contains a clause for opting out with compensation. This legislation constitutes an infringement on a jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces. Yet Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A> does not help Quebec and the other provinces provide quality education, because it does not give them the means to do so. It makes students pay for part of the cost of their post-secondary education, but does not improve the quality of instruction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best solution to help students, and the solution recommended by the Bloc Québécois, involves a considerable increase in direct federal transfer payments to Quebec and the provinces until the fiscal imbalance issue is resolved. In Quebec, the government, students and educational institutions issued a joint statement to the effect that transfer payments must be increased to $4.9 billion a year. It is because of the fiscal imbalance, created by the federal government itself, that Ottawa must now help students financially so that they can access post-secondary education, since transfers to the provinces for education have been considerably reduced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, I would remind the House that, fortunately, section 14 of the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act gives those provinces that wish to administer their own loans and scholarships program the right to opt out with compensation. This is the case for Quebec, which has its own program. </div>

Last week we saw cuts to student employment programs and literacy. Over the summer we saw a consultation process that was really not a consultation process at all. It seemed to exclude many student groups which are most concerned by the issue of post-secondary education. It seems as if the Conservatives want to leave us a paper country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, there are ways to meet the unique cultural needs of Quebec while providing equitable treatment for all parts of Canada. It is upsetting to see young people mortgaging their lives—the result of many years of cuts to provincial transfer payments by the former Liberal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121417"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That government had 13 years to implement the type of progressive legislation introduced by a member this morning. The situation could deteriorate with the Conservatives' “every man for himself” policy.The goal in Canada should be for all graduates of secondary schools to have access to post-secondary education or training. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A> is a first step in that direction. It would ensure that Canada access grants for students from low-income families, presently available for only the first year of education, would be available to eligible students for each year of a program of studies . Low-income families are not benefiting from current programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121418"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill does have significant shortcomings but it represents the most progressive and effective way of putting money directly into the hands of students who do not have the means to pay their tuition fees, that is at the time they most need these monies. This approach would allow us to increase access to post-secondary education in contrast to the number of disparate federal and provincial programs presently labelled as student financial assistance such as tax credits, savings plans, the Millennium Scholarship Foundation and the very unwieldy Canada student loans program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121419"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP will support this bill because, as I stated, it is the first measure—one we have been awaiting for a long time—to help students and their families with rising education costs, which have become prohibitive in many of our provinces.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para121420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go back to this grant. In its first year, Canada access grants for students from low income families were for the first year of study only, the lesser of $3,000, assessed need or 50% of tuition. The Canada access grant for students with permanent disabilities was for each year of study, but the lesser of $2,000 or assessed need. This was clearly inadequate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121421"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to look at who is benefiting from our existing policies. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121422"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their first year, Canada access grants were awarded to roughly 3% of full time college and university students, 22,000 students from low income families and approximately 9,100 students with permanent disabilities, costing almost $52.6 million. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121423"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the other programs. During that same period, $462 million was paid as matching Canada education saving grants, CESGs, to 1.8 million children in families who could afford to invest in RESPs many years before their children's studies. In contrast, the new Canada learning bond for low income families to invest in RESPs, helping 7,271 children in families who could not invest in RESPs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121424"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001 individuals with income over $70,000 claimed over $164 million in federal education and tuition tax credits. As Ross Finnie, a research fellow at the School of Policy Studies at Queen's University said, “These huge chunks of money are going where it's not needed. It wouldn't be so bad if there was enough money going into where it's really needed, but there isn't”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The millennium foundation is set to expire in 2009. There are a number of lessons to be had from its work, in particular: its focus on grants over loans; its needs-based assessment rather than income-based; its experience collaborating with provinces and territories; and its high ratio of direct assistance to operating costs. We should examine these experiences and best practices in developing a national needs-based grants system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the patchwork of student assistance in Canada does not adequately target those students and families in greatest need. This is why we support the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Federation of Students, which has sent over 50 student leaders to the Hill this week, will look very closely at the support for the bill as expressed around the House. The Canadian Federation of Students and the Canadian Association of University Teachers have both called for a simpler, central system of needs-based grants to replace this patchwork assistance that we call financial aid.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP vigorously opposed reliance of Liberal and Conservative governments on tax credits instead of real investment in post-secondary education. Research substantiates our concern. Through this debate, I will reiterate our alternate vision of a national needs-based grants system.</div>

Let us look at some of the amendments that will be necessary. One is a needs-based assessment rather than an income-based one, Others are removing exclusionary clauses against mature students, introducing a mechanism to include financially independent students and including targeted grants to account for the realities of rural and aboriginal students.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is about the role of the federal government in post-secondary education. The Conservatives would have us believe that there is no role for the federal government in social programs and in post-secondary education, and that seems to suit the Bloc Québécois. However, let there be no mistake. Under the Conservatives, we are returning to the pre-1950s, where provincial governments had sole responsibility for post-secondary education, with the horrific inequities that existed between provinces. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By turning post-secondary education back entirely to provinces, as the Conservative government seems to be leaning toward, many Canadians will begin to wonder just what it means to be Canadian.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For centuries now, the importance of a sound education has been one of the hallmarks of public policy, not just in Canada but across the nations of the world. A sound and fulfilling education not only serves the interests of the students who benefit from their studies, but the society in which they choose to practice the skills they have learned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121434"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By ensuring that our young people receive the best possible education, we are also ensuring that our society thrives, grows and prospers. It was the Irish poet, W.B. Yeats, who stated: “Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire”. In providing young Canadians with the opportunity to obtain a thorough and balanced education, we are, as a society, lighting the fire of wonder in their hearts and minds, a fire that will illuminate our country for generations to come.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this vein that I support my colleague's bill, which would amend the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would provide for Canada access grants to eligible Canadians who have permanent disabilities. It recognizes, implicitly, the unique challenges faced by persons with disabilities in their efforts to obtain a post-secondary education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one in the House will be unfamiliar with the very real challenges that face students in contemporary Canadian society. It is truly heart-rending to hear the stories of so many young Canadians who simply cannot afford to pursue their education to the extent that they would like, simply as a result of financial barriers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This challenge is particularly real for persons with disabilities, who may not have the same opportunities to supplement their incomes while attending school as other students might find available to them. Furthermore, I believe we, as Canadians, have an obligation to assist those with disabilities to ensure that they have the same opportunities as their fellow citizens to choose whatever career path they wish to pursue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121439"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I join with my colleagues in wishing to see this bill pass, but fear that it might not succeed. This is because the government seems to have decided to abandon the important role of the federal government with respect to education. The delivery of education may be a provincial responsibility, but as the last government demonstrated, there is much that the national government can do as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the members of the New Democratic Party decided to bring down the previous Liberal government, they chose political expediency over the best interests of Canadians. As a result, much was lost for students.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members might recall the financial statements of the then Liberal finance minister, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78924,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78924&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Wascana</A>, as he outlined an enormous progressive plan to assist young Canadians to realize their full potential in terms of educational opportunities. This plan committed $2.2 billion over five years to improve financial assistance by making post-secondary education more affordable for lower and middle income Canadians. This was an incredible commitment to help ensure that all Canadians, regardless of their means, had the opportunity to obtain a sound education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121442"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal fiscal plan also called for $550 million over five years to extend Canada access grants, the subject of our discussion here today. This would have covered 55,000 students from lower income families in all years of undergraduate education. We would also have seen $265 million over five years for Canadians with disabilities to assist them in participating in the workforce.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These commitments were real and they would have gone a long way toward assisting young Canadians with their educational objectives. Members of this caucus have and continue to hold a solid and real commitment to Canadian students. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the most fundamental requirement for education and career advancement is the ability to read and write at a reasonable level of proficiency. The reality is that illiteracy in this country costs the economy approximately $10 billion annually, not to mention the ongoing daily struggles of those who have to contend with limited skills when it comes to reading and writing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, it is also true that there is a serious lack of funding for literacy programs in Canada and an even more pressing need for a coordination of services. We need to implement a national literacy strategy with long term programs designed to assist all Canadians who need this kind of help in realizing their full potential both in their academic and professional careers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House have acknowledged that without proper educational training the future of many young Canadians is less than bright. There are fewer and fewer jobs available to those who do not possess the kind of skills now required in the workplace. The quandary many young Canadians find themselves in is that they cannot access those jobs without the needed education, yet they cannot afford to obtain the skills that are needed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we act on this issue of the need for literacy programs and financial assistance for students, particularly those with disabilities. We must also ensure that we recognize the need to make a real commitment to adequate funding of education in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121449"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is the foundation upon which the future of this country will be built. There is no benefit to shortchanging our future by failing to adequately invest in the education of young Canadians. The reality is simply that in creating the kinds of programs that will encourage support and sustain our young people in their educational journey, we will be ensuring that the workforce of the future will be able to meet the needs of our economy.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78801,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78801&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Halifax West</A> for bringing forward this important topic for discussion.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill seeks to amend the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act in order to extend the provisions of the Canada access grants. This bill raises two important questions. The first is whether or not this is the appropriate time to be making changes to this relatively new student support measure. The second is whether or not amending the act is the right way to proceed. Let me address each of these in turn.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of extending the financial support now provided by the Canada access grants, the member opposite has identified a concern which Canada's new government definitely shares. We want to make sure students from low income families and students with disabilities have access to post-secondary education and can receive the financial support that they need. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, this government wants to look at the whole issue of how post-secondary education is financed in this country. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78764,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78764&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development</A> has indicated that she will be initiating discussions with the provinces and territories to discuss the overall objectives for post-secondary education and training appropriate roles, while at the same time working toward developing a framework for ensuring measurable results and accountability in respect of funding support. Issues like those raised in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A> may very well be considered during the course of those discussions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding access to post-secondary education to students from low income families and those with disabilities is a concern Canada's new government recognizes and is sensitive to. However, it is important to keep in mind that the Canada access grant is not the only way the Government of Canada helps finance post-secondary education in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief overview of the current measures in place clearly demonstrates the Government of Canada has a broad commitment to investment in education and training on behalf of all students. Budget 2006 is a demonstration of this commitment as it included concrete measures in support of post-secondary education. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having the lowest debt to GDP level in 24 years is bound to help all aspects of our economy, including children looking to obtain post-secondary education, but this government did far more. There are investments such as $15.5 billion annually to the provinces and territories for post-secondary education and social services through the Canada social transfer; $1.7 billion to fund research in post-secondary institutions; $1.8 billion in loans and grants for post-secondary education; $1.5 billion in tax credits and education savings incentives; and another $1 billion in federal funds to help provinces and territories make urgent investments in post-secondary infrastructure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, we also introduced a new textbook tax credit, a measure expected to benefit millions of students over the next two years. We expanded eligibility for the Canada student loans program, meaning an additional 30,000 students will now be able to access this program. That is right, I said an additional 30,000 students.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, when it comes to supporting post-secondary education and helping Canadian students and their families with its costs, Canada's new government has demonstrated its willingness to make the necessary--</div>

    </p><a name="Para121465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want a law-abiding peaceful society. They believe in secure streets and neighbourhoods where children can play in safety and where families can go for evening walks. In doing our part to protect our communities, roads and highways, the Government of Canada is taking the issue of street racing head-on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been far too many examples of Canadians being injured or killed because of street racing. On a regular basis there are reports of deaths across the country relating to this dangerous activity. We have seen horrific deaths recently in Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton and Winnipeg. These risks, injuries and deaths are senseless and do not need to occur.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criminal law seeks justice, the protection of the public and the establishment and maintenance of social order. Ultimately the purpose of the criminal law is to contribute to a just, peaceful and safe society through the establishment of prohibitions, sanctions and procedures to deal fairly and appropriately with blameworthy conduct that causes or threatens serious harm to individuals and society. Street racers must be explicitly subject to such sanctions and prohibitions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criminal law can be, and in this case should be, a tool for shifting public perception. In this regard the message needs to be made clear: street racing is not a game, it is not carefree and it is not harmless. Pure and simple, it kills.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In establishing such a system we must first examine the existing legal scheme on which Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> would build, namely the way the Criminal Code currently deals with street racing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Codes does not specifically identify street racing as an offence, although certain of the code's offences can apply to fatal and injurious collisions where street racing is involved. These offences are: criminal negligence causing death, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment; dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death, which currently carries a maximum of 14 years' imprisonment; criminal negligence causing bodily harm, with a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment; and dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm, with a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment. In addition, the offence of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, with a five year maximum imprisonment on indictment, can be applied in cases where a street race has occurred but no one was killed or injured.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, under the Criminal Code, if convicted of any of those five offences, currently the court may order a period of driving prohibition of up to three years in the case of a dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, of up to 10 years in the case of a dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm or death, and criminal negligence causing bodily harm. In the case of criminal negligence causing death, the court may order up to a lifetime driving prohibition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these existing provisions and the discretionary driving prohibition orders, street races are still occurring and Canadians are still being injured, and tragically, killed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason the government is doing its part in reinforcing the criminal law in this area and sending a strong clear message that street racing is a crime with real and significant consequences. Creating a separate offence in the Criminal Code will specifically denounce this form of crime. In addition, these proposed amendments permit increased punishments with regard to minimum driving prohibitions and increase periods of imprisonment in street racing situations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (street racing) and to make a consequential amendment to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act</A> proposes the creation of a specific street racing offence in the Criminal Code based on the offences of dangerous driving, dangerous driving causing bodily harm, dangerous driving causing death, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and criminal negligence causing death. The bill proposes key reforms that would increase, in street racing situations, the maximum punishments for dangerous driving causing bodily harm and criminal negligence causing bodily harm from 10 years to 14 years, and for dangerous driving causing death from 14 years to life.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is taking a holistic approach to criminal law reform. In this regard, it is significant to note that the government's conditional sentencing bill, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172003,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172003&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-9</A>, if passed as is, will eliminate the use of a conditional sentence in those street racing cases where someone is either injured or killed. As we know, conditional sentences are essentially house arrest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street racing reforms would also provide minimum driving prohibitions that would increase on each subsequent offence, instead of the present discretionary prohibitions. In particular, the mandatory driving prohibitions range from a minimum of one year on a first offence, all the way up to a maximum of a lifetime driving ban. The minimum driving prohibitions increase to two and three years for subsequent offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of note is the proposed mandatory lifetime driving prohibition. This mandatory lifetime minimum driving prohibition will apply if an offender has two convictions, where someone is injured or killed as a result of street racing, and at least one of these offences causes a death. For example, if someone is convicted of dangerous driving causing bodily harm while street racing and then convicted of criminal negligence causing death while street racing, the lifetime mandatory driving prohibition will apply.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> would provide judges with discretion in setting the appropriate length of prohibition, in some cases, all the way up to a lifetime ban, but in every street racing offence, the offender would have a period of mandatory driving prohibition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the introduction of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>, some have asked, What is street racing and how will the courts interpret such a definition? Clause 1 of the bill defines “street racing” as:</div>
    </p><a name="Para121480"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--operating a motor vehicle in a race with at least one other motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place;</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para121481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term “race” is an undefined term in the bill and is therefore meant to be applied by the courts, based on existing common law principles, after an examination of the trial evidence. The courts will turn to context in which the term is used, dictionary definitions of a race, as well as Canadian jurisprudence defining this term. At the end of the day, all sources of interpretation generally point to the common theme of a race amounting to a contest of speed, which will be determined on a case by case basis on the evidence presented at trial.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the structure of the proposed reforms, the prosecution will be required to prove a race; that is a contest of speed plus dangerous driving or criminal negligence. This construction responds to fear that revving one's engine would amount to an offence. The driving must also meet the existing standards of dangerous driving or criminal negligence in order to attract criminal liability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, by the design of the scheme, if the court is not satisfied that a street race was involved, then the law of included offences would apply. Therefore, if the prosecution has not proven a street race but has proven all the essential elements of either dangerous driving or criminal negligence, then the offender may be convicted of these included offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that the Criminal Code contains an offence, at section 259, prohibiting the operation of a motor vehicle while a person is disqualified from driving. This driving while prohibited offence would also apply if a person drives during the prohibition period imposed for the offences in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many provinces have used provincial highway traffic legislation to combat street racing, including provincial fines, licence suspensions and vehicle impoundment. In British Columbia, for example, the province introduced legislation that gave the police the authority to impound, immediately, any vehicle used in a street race. In some matters, there can be federal and provincial constitutional authority, and each level of government may properly enact legislation. In the matter of street racing the provincial legislature has constitutional legislative authority to enact highway traffic and driver licensing legislation against street racing. Parliament may enact legislation against street racing, using its constitutional legislative authority for criminal law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a number of earlier bills directed at combatting street racing. During the 37th Parliament, the late Mr. Chuck Cadman, M.P., introduced private member's <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1182390,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1182390&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bill C-338</A> and reintroduced it as Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2152894,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2152894&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-230</A> in the 38th Parliament aimed at this form of crime. These bills provided that the existence of street racing was to be an aggravating factor in sentencing and provided for mandatory minimum driving prohibitions, increasing on second and subsequent offences. I think the Prime Minister said it very when he described Mr. Cadman as “a selfless man who devoted his years in Ottawa to fighting for safer streets”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Cadman's bill was built upon the existence of a repeat aggravating factor. However, the dependence on the aggravating factor in the sentencing hearing that involves a prior conviction, in order to trigger an increased penalty for a subsequent offence, raised some concerns. First, there is no reference to street racing in the substantive offence. Second, the CPIC, the Canadian Police Information Centre, does not report the existence of aggravating factors. Therefore, the Crown would have no consistent way of knowing that a prior offence had involved street racing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 38th Parliament, the previous government introduced Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1993382,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1993382&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-65</A>, an act to amend the Criminal Code, street racing. It also provided that street racing, if found by the sentencing judge to be present, was to be used as an aggravating factor in sentencing and included mandatory driving prohibitions, although repeat offenders were not subject to increasing driving prohibitions. All these bills eventually died on the order paper. However, given the efforts made by Mr. Cadman and by the former government's response, we are now counting on everyone to support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequency of and the conviction rate for offences involving street racing are presently not available at a national level as there is, currently, no systematic way to identify the cases that have involved street racing. One of the indirect benefits of the reforms proposed in <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> is that the creation of separate offences will allow such data to be captured and monitored in a systematic national way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have noted, in some matters, and street racing is one such matter, there can be federal and provincial constitutional authority and each level of government may properly enact legislation. The provincial legislature has constitutional legislative authority to enact highway traffic and driver licensing legislation against street racing. Parliament may enact legislation against street racing under its constitutional authority for criminal law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complementary provincial and federal tools would provide a strong and effective response to the scourge of street racing on Canadian roads and street. I, therefore, compliment the efforts of local police forces in getting street racers off our streets on to closed race tracks. These efforts will no doubt contribute to public safety on Canadian roads and highways.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe streets and safe communities are a hallmark of life in Canada. The government is doing its part, through a number of important bills currently before Parliament, to ensure that this fact remains true. The government has made a clear and unequivocal commitment to work toward a safe and secure Canada. This Canada is one in which its citizens can walk the streets without fear of being struck by reckless street racers.</div>

However, many have indicated that branding or terming a new section of the code “street racing” is rather superfluous when, as the minister has indicated, multiple sections are already in the Criminal Code, dealing with dangerous driving, dangerous operation causing bodily harm, causing death, criminal negligence, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, causing death. There are already a number of sections within the Criminal Code that speak to this type of activity. We on this side are concerned about the deterrent aspect of the proposed legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any instances in which a judge has said, “The factual situation before me falls short of dangerous driving, falls short of criminal negligence and what a shame that there's nothing in the Criminal Code which talks about street racing?” Does such a situation exist? I would be pleased to be educated in that regard.</div>

For example, we can ask why do we have the hate laws that were passed after the second world war in Canada? There are adequate laws to deal with that issue in the Criminal Code, yet it was seen as important to specifically denounce that type of conduct. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121499"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a similar type of situation where given the frequency of this type of occurrence, there needs to be a specific section denouncing that type of conduct. The member's party in the last Parliament agreed with us and brought forward that type of legislation. In that respect I do not think there is anything different.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the comment whether there has been judge who has said that it is a pity there is not something less than dangerous driving, street racing, this is more than that. Dangerous driving and criminal negligence causing bodily harm will be included offences in the street racing offence. Therefore, street racing is a higher offence. The dangerous driving and criminal negligence will be a lesser included offence in that scheme, so the situation would not arise.</div>

    </p><a name="Para121502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, would the minister comment on the fact that the bill seems to put judges in a peculiar situation of having to determine whether there has been an offence to define what racing is, but no leeway in determining the penalty that will come?</div>
    </p><a name="Para121503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, has the government given any thought to providing more education and changing the advertising regulations around car sales in Canada? For example, there was a very strong educational program about impaired driving and changes in the advertising of the product had to occur. From all available research, this is the part that seems to have been most effective in addressing the problem of impaired driving.</div>

When I was prosecuting provincially under Manitoba's highway traffic act, I recall there being no definition at that time. The definition was based on common law. Judges often determine definitions on the basis of precedent or common law. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, throughout the Criminal Code there are many situations where a judge will actually have to define what falls within the meaning of a particular term. Even a term like sexual assault is not as clear as it might seem to the member and I. If there is no specific definition, a judge has to determine what a sexual assault is as opposed to another type of assault. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is anything unique here. This is the kind of discretion we allow judges to have on a regular basis and they can rely on past precedents in terms of defining what something means. I gave some suggestions in the course of my speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there was a second half to my colleague's question in respect to the educational issue and not allowing discretion in terms of sentencing for prohibition periods. Quite frankly, there are many sections in the Criminal Code that deal with periods of prohibition that are mandatory upon conviction. I just need to look at the impaired driving sections for example. There is no real definition of what constitutes impaired driving and yet precedent is used liberally to determine actual impaired driving.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The educational issue is a very important point. It is something that we as members might want to consider in another context. It is not in the context of this particular legislation, but I do not see anything stopping members from discussing this particular issue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is certainly a very important component, but I want to stress that even with the area of impaired driving, as important as the educational component was, it was as a result of many provincial initiatives that resulted in automatic administrative licence suspensions roadside for periods of six months. The automatic seizure of motor vehicles led to a real downward spiral in impaired and suspended driving situations in many provinces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To simply attribute it to education would not be accurate. Administrative procedures as opposed to criminal procedures that provinces took in the last decade have had a tremendous positive impact on the rate of impaired driving and suspended driving.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Canadians will remember the work of a former member of Parliament, the late Chuck Cadman, on the subject.

    </p><a name="Para870263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-19, unlike both the prior government's Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1993382,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1993382&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-65</A> and Mr. Cadman's private member's Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1394752,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1394752&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-230</A>, includes new street racing offences.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first half of 2006 in Canada, 10 deaths can be attributed to street racing. More and more we have been alerted to the menace on our streets. Over the past year, street racing, with its deadly consequences, has affected communities across the country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many would realize, education is an important tool to help alert the public, especially younger Canadians, to the dangers of street racing. I do not believe that education of itself will be sufficient to effect the necessary change in this dangerous behaviour. I do believe, however, that education on this matter should continue to be used in schools and other media, such as movie theatre trailers, to counteract the increasing sensationalization of street racing now found in some video games and movies.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all street racing is a spontaneous event, though this is the type of thrill-seeking activity many would immediately think about when the words street racing are used. Some street races are spectator events, with people being alerted in advance and police lookouts. Therefore, I am not talking about the supervised venues where racers test vehicles on closed tracks. I would also say that it is not only young people who are engaged in street racing, although many of them are, unfortunately. </div>

Members may ask how this has been dealt with in the past. Obviously and unfortunately, street racing is not new. Most would understand that the provinces and territories are involved with their own legislation and statutes respecting the operation of motor vehicles and road safety, and some even have some street racing offences.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus we see that two or more motor vehicles must be involved, not a lone vehicle speeding. Since motor vehicle is already defined in the Criminal Code, the definition in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> would capture motorcycles, snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles. If two or more of them were racing in public places, this would include, for instance, public lots, frozen public waterways, as well as streets, roads and highways that we normally would think about. Bill C-19 would create five new street racing offences which would all require the same fundamental elements in law: a criminal mind and a criminal act, <i>mens rea, actus reus</i>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the same elements that are required to obtain convictions for the existing offences of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle and criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle. Both the previous Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1993382,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1993382&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-65</A> and Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1394752,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1394752&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-230</A> were more focused on street racing as an aggravating circumstance to be taken into account in sentencing by the judge after conviction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five new offences created in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> would require the same constituent elements as do dangerous operation and criminal negligence, in addition to the new element of street racing.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235">(1235)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para121531"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the five offences will apply if the offence can first be categorized as criminal negligence or dangerous operation. To clarify for those who still have difficulty with this, the five new sections are new subsection 249.4(1), dangerous operation of motor vehicle while street racing; new subsection 249.4(3), dangerous operation causing bodily harm; new subsection 249.4(4), dangerous operation causing death; new subsection 249.3, causing bodily harm by criminal negligence (street racing); and new subsection 249.2, causing death by criminal negligence (street racing).</div>
    </p><a name="Para870273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, one can easily see that we have a referencing of a new element to existing Criminal Code sections. Is this really a serious attempt to underscore the denouncement of street racing, as the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78758,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78758&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> has just suggested, or is it, as some critics have stated, merely something to show that we are serious, the denunciation just by the statement?</div>
    </p><a name="Para121533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the offences that are needed are already in the Criminal Code. How difficult will it be to prosecute the new element of street racing on top of the two elements already required? Therefore, will it be used more to obtain conviction or be used to plea bargain on the included offences? Will the charges still be laid under the old offences despite the options now provided in this new bill, if passed?</div>
    </p><a name="Para121534"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are important questions and some critics have gone so far as to say that this is a totally unnecessary or window dressing bill. However, I do think that the subject area is one that all Canadians are concerned about and the previous government was also acting in this area. I do not think that anyone believes street racing is a good idea, rather it is dangerous and a menace to public health and public safety. There is an appetite in the land to address the problem and stem the occurrences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also address the other elements that this bill has added to the debate. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> adds, where street racing is proven, the mandatory driving prohibition minimum of one year whether or not bodily harm has been caused and where it was discretionary in all charges before.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121536"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does propose higher maximum terms of imprisonment in three of the five street racing offences. The bill does not make any minimum terms of imprisonment. Currently, we know that conditional sentences have been utilized under section 742.1 of the Criminal Code. Judges are permitted and in fact encouraged to utilize, under the sentencing principles of the Criminal Code, less restrictive punishments than incarceration where other factors are not in play.</div>
    </p><a name="Para870274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Case law has developed across Canada on point, going both ways I might add. I raise this because we are currently having a conditional sentencing bill which is now before the justice committee. If enacted as is, it would impact on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> if it were passed as is. Essentially, there would be a consequential effect if the higher maximum penalties were passed in this Bill C-19, with the exception of dangerous driving not causing bodily harm or death. Unfortunately, mid-process this is speculative, but I do flag the potential now, as has the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78758,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78758&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121538"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not entirely clear the intention or message to the courts of how Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> has been set out. On a scale of seriousness, criminal negligence is considered higher than dangerous operation. The difference between the offences is the degree of carelessness or recklessness in the offence. This is one area that needs to be properly examined if this bill ends up in committee after a vote in this House, which I believe will end up happening. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> puts street racing that constitutes dangerous operation and street racing that constitutes criminal negligence on the same footing. Fine tuning is required here, as has been pointed out by some others. When we try to limit judicial discretion, as would appear to be the pattern of this new Conservative minority government, it creates other, perhaps wholly unintended, consequences. Many authorities, some would say, consider criminal negligence more serious than dangerous driving and we will look at this.</div>

This is a mandatory order for a specific period of time. Also different from previous bills and the current Criminal Code is the introduction of a minimum period of one year in the case of each of the five street racing offences. This is driving prohibition.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>, the maximum and minimum for driving prohibition orders would increase each time a subsequent street racing offence is committed.</div>

Further, new subclause 259(3.4) proposes the creation of a mandatory life prohibition on driving. This would apply when the offender has two or more convictions of street racing where someone was injured or killed and one of the street races resulted in a death.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should note that the driving prohibition order will come after the period of imprisonment. I should also note that the maximum and minimum for driving prohibition orders increase in a very similar fashion as the rules governing driving prohibition orders in cases of drinking and driving.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot to digest in the details of this bill. This is the initial stage of discussion. It is not the place for any of us to come to firm conclusions. There is obviously agreement that street racing needs to be dealt with by Parliament. The fact that there have been two different governments and continued private members' bills, underscores this to all of us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always it is a question of degree. Is one approach better or more practical than another? Can the officers on the ground, the judiciary and the system of justice be given better or more flexible laws for Parliament to utilize? Do some of the clauses in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> go too far? What is most important is will this help with community safety? Those are the questions that need to be answered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also examine whether there are some situations that are captured that were not intended. I have already heard from the Canadian Association of Rallysport with suggested amendments since it is concerned that this will negatively impact on its sport activity held across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about when roads are closed for major professional racing events which normally occur annually in cities like Toronto and Montreal? Would we need to consider specific exemptions or exceptions or do we rely on the charging officer's discretion and judgment, as has been done in the past? Do we really intend to capture racing snowmobiles not close together traversing a frozen lake, for example?</div>
    </p><a name="Para121548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to listen to the comments of other parliamentarians in the House. I believe we come here to do positive work for our electors. We can do the measured work required of us in a respectful manner I would hope. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am personally inclined to send the bill to committee for further discussion but wish to hear from my colleagues. It is a bill that is not perfect and has some issues that need to be addressed. Not all of the provisions will help the situation and may in fact cause some confusion. The stages for amendments in this House and in the other House are available to us to clear up any of these ambiguities, whether they are real or just misunderstood. Also, we will have the benefit of our witnesses and, hopefully, some experts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know from the short briefings I have received from others that there was no wide consultation on the bill. I asked if there were formal studies but was told by officials that none had been done. I am also aware that on January 25, 2005, at the federal, provincial and territorial meetings of all justice ministers, they had agreed to study the matter of Criminal Code amendments affecting the theft of motor vehicles, as well as penalties for those who steal vehicles and drive recklessly. </div>

However, it is important that we all do our job, as I know we will, and I look forward to working on this bill with my colleagues.</div>

        <div><b><A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78559,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78559&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga, BQ)</A>: </b>&nbsp;<span class="nextIntervention"><a class="nav_link" href="#Int-1673781"><img src="/common/images/arrow2_right.gif" border="0" alt="next intervention"></a></span></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>. As we have already heard in this House, this bill addresses a marginal yet important phenomenon, namely, street racing on public roads, streets and highways. This problem is very worrisome. According to statistics provided by the Library of Parliament, since 1999, 35 people in the greater Toronto area have died as a result of this practice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the course of this year, which is drawing to a close, there have already been approximately ten people who have unfortunately lost their lives because of this practice. I do not know what drives people to engage in street racing. Are they seeking thrills? Are betting, material gain or jackpots involved?</div>
    </p><a name="Para121554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government certainly has reason to be concerned. I have been a member in this House since 1993 and I remember very well the work of the hon. member from British Columbia who, sadly, has since passed away. That member introduced a bill in this House on three separate occasions. I understand that he became aware of this issue as the result of a tragedy in his own life, since he lost his own son in an incident involving street racing. I am referring of course to our late colleague, Mr. Cadman.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois therefore supports this bill's referral to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. Of course, it still needs some work, but we agree with the principle that the Criminal Code should be amended to add a distinct offence to punish those who engage in street racing, especially in urban areas. This bill is somewhat different from the bill introduced by the previous government, since the previous bill proposed the use of all provisions in the Criminal Code concerning dangerous driving or criminal negligence to make street racing an aggravating factor. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the principles of sentencing set out in section 718 of the Criminal Code, there are aggravating factors in cases where, for example, someone commits a crime, infraction or assault by intentionally beating someone up because of their sexual orientation. If we interpret section 718 of the Criminal Code correctly, a judge would have to take this principle into account when sentencing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to section 718 of the Criminal Code, the principle of proportionality must apply in all cases. Clearly, a person who commits a horrific, violent crime that causes death cannot receive the same punishment as a 15-year-old who steals something for the first time. Clearly, the principle of proportionality is central to section 718 of the Criminal Code. Mr. Speaker, you practised criminal law, so you must be familiar with these concepts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois agrees that the bill before us should be referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. This bill does not take aggravating factors into account. The bill focuses on five infractions that already exist, redefining them and assigning specific penalties when they are committed in a street racing context. I would like to list these infractions to ensure we all understand. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19 </A>says that dangerous driving that does not cause bodily harm, as set out in section 249.4 of the Criminal Code, when in a street racing context, must be subject to a specific charge. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250">(1250)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para121559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second new offence is created. Dangerous driving causing bodily harm—when someone injures someone or the car hits another car and causes injury—which is covered by subsection 249.4(3) of the Criminal Code, will give rise to a separate charge when street racing is involved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a third offence. The punishment for dangerous driving causing death, which is obviously more serious, will be much more severe and can go up to life in prison. This is the third separate offence created in connection with street racing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth new offence that is created is criminal negligence causing bodily harm, which is covered by section 249.3 of the Criminal Code. When street racing is involved, this offence would give rise to a separate charge. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth offence is criminal negligence causing death. This is not dangerous driving causing death, but criminal negligence causing death. It is the fifth new offence. It is already covered by section 249 of the Criminal Code and will give rise to a separate charge.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aside, hon. members know how prolific this government is when it comes to creating new offences. This government clearly wants to address a number of social problems by creating criminal law. But we must always ask ourselves whether a given problem warrants creating new offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, obviously, we do not agree with this approach. Penalties and sentences already exist. For example, I am very concerned about Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172003,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172003&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-9</A>, which amends section 742 of the Criminal Code. This section was created in 1996, when Canada's current ambassador to the United Nations, Allan Rock, decided that the judiciary would have the option of a new alternate sentence, which was the possibility of serving a sentence in the community, at home. However, very specific conditions that we are all aware of applied to sentences under two years and cases where there were no minimum sentences. Clearly, the judge had to be convinced that the person serving the sentence did not pose a threat to the community.</div>

    </p><a name="Para121566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case before us, the Bloc Québécois is prepared to engage, in committee, in the serious exercise of considering whether it is appropriate to add specific provisions to the Criminal Code to put an end to the practice of using the public roadways for racing, which, marginal though it is, can have tragic consequences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to speak a little about the options that will be available to the courts when they sentence people convicted of street racing. Obviously, the entire question of sentencing is a sensitive issue in criminal law. We must know that there are very entrenched schools of thought: the “retributionists” and the “utilitarians”. Some people say that sentences have exemplary value, that they have deterrent powers, and accordingly that the more severe the sentences, the less people are likely to engage in that type of offence. Obviously, that reasoning is not immune to criticism, because it starts from the premise that individuals, ordinary mortals, are familiar with the Criminal Code and therefore with the type of offence and the type of sentence associated with it. </div>

    </p><a name="Para121569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people say that sentences have very limited deterrent powers. It is not so much the sentence that matters, it is the efficacy of the sanction, because people will be arrested by the police and locked up, put in prison. Regardless of what school of thought one belongs to when it comes to sentencing, Bill<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> proposes the following sentences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking still of street racing, no minimum sentence is provided for dangerous driving that does not cause bodily harm or death—simple dangerous driving—but there is a maximum sentence of five years. When dangerous driving causes bodily harm, the maximum sentence is 14 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is interesting to compare this with the previous bill. This is not a pointless exercise. When the Liberals were in power and Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1993382,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1993382&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-65</A> was introduced in this House, for the same offence, the Liberals proposed that there be a maximum prison term of 10 years. The Conservatives had—let us admit it—a more right-wing vision, one that took a more law and order approach, and they wanted the maximum to be 14 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to dangerous driving causing death—an extremely serious offence—nothing more needs to be said about the maximum sentence, which is life in prison. The judge can decide to impose a lesser sentence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121573"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For criminal negligence causing bodily harm, the bill provides for a term of 14 years in prison, while in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1993382,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1993382&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-65</A> the Liberals provided for a term of 10 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For criminal negligence causing death—also an offence that is of great concern—the proposal is for life imprisonment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two approaches. The current bill proposes that a specific offence with specific penalties be established. The Liberals had proposed that it be treated as an aggravating circumstance, as per section 778, which must serve as a reference when considering the issue of sentencing. It is never easy in a society to know how to handle these cases. In fact, at the end of their mandate, Brian Mulroney's Conservatives—and this will be a pleasant or unpleasant memory depending on the allegiance—had established a commission of inquiry on sentencing, headed by Mr. Justice Archambault, which had dissected the issue of sentencing. The commission recommended that there be no minimum sentences. Since then, minimum sentences have been introduced for all offences pertaining to impaired driving; there are about forty. Minimum sentences have been added to all pornography offences and offences of a sexual nature. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121576"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another clause of the bill deals with a mandatory order prohibiting individuals found guilty of street racing from operating a motor vehicle. At present, drivers' licences can be suspended. In some cases, the judge does not have the option of suspending the driver's licence of the accused before him. I am thinking of all those cases where an individual is found guilty of having the care of a vehicle or driving while impaired.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300">(1300)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para121577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other instances, power was more discretionary. The judge could, according to his or her discretion, order that a driver's licence be revoked for a minimum of one year, for a first offence in particular, for reckless driving causing bodily harm. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bill C-19</A> before us, it would be mandatory to revoke the driver's licence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can appreciate the logic, since having a driver's licence is not a constitutional right; it is a privilege. It is only natural for the legislator to provide that a driver's licence holder must exercise the privilege of using a car on the highway with extreme caution, vigilance and prudence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also be possible to revoke driver's licences when people are fined for street racing and judges will be able to give a ruling.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with every additional crime, the harsher the punishment. I will give you some specific examples. For reckless driving without bodily harm or death the judge can give a ruling at his or her discretion, as I was saying. The government would like to withdraw this discretionary power from the judge. For a first offence, it will be impossible to get a driver's licence for a year; for a second offence the suspension will last at least two years; and a third offence will result in a minimum suspension of three years. Maximums are also added to that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand the logic. I am sure my colleagues understand it. We can agree with this, knowing that it is a matter of context and that judges will have to weigh the evidence accordingly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For reckless driving causing bodily harm, again the judge will no longer have discretionary power. This discretion is being cut back. Let us be frank, the Conservatives have been using every power at their disposal in every bill presented so far to challenge this prerogative.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, for dangerous driving causing bodily harm, the judge would again have no discretion.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logic is clear, and I would like to end with two statements. First, we will work hard in committee because the government has good reason to be concerned about the contemporary phenomenon of street racing, which has claimed lives in large urban centres. However, we will examine whether the sentences are appropriate. We will ask expert witnesses to appear before the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, people claim that public safety, information and awareness campaigns about impaired driving have had a greater impact than punishment.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to say that I come at this with some sense of cynicism as to the real motivation of the government in bringing forth this bill.

    </p><a name="Para121592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not alone in that regard. I was looking at an editorial in the <i>Globe and Mail</i> from back in the spring of this year. It addressed the announcement by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> that this bill was coming forward and the government was going to deal with street racing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the editorial was somewhat negative as to its perspective on the government doing this. As for recognizing the problem, no one in the House is going to take any position of denying it. We have some argument over how severe the problem is, but what is more important is how we deal with it. The attitude in the editorial was that we already have legislation, which we also have heard about today from some other members of the House. The editorial concluded with this comment:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para121599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the editorial and the comments from Mr. Weinstein are dead on, that this is grandstanding, that there is a great deal of smoke and mirrors in the bill and the position of the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government were really serious about dealing with this crime and the conduct that results so often in serious injuries and death, there are other alternatives. To some degree what we are doing here with the bill and assuming it goes to committee is wasting great deal of time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The posturing that is going on here has to be highlighted by this reality. If the bill does get second reading, the bill will be sent to the justice committee. The justice committee already has a heavy workload. The reality is the bill is not going to be dealt with by the justice committee until at least the spring of next year, and given the bills that are already prioritized before that committee, it would probably would not be dealt with until the fall of 2007.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a high likelihood that some time before the spring but certainly by the fall of next year we are going to be into another general election. The government knows that. What we are seeing today with this bill and what we are going to see consistently for the next number of months right into the spring is a series of bills like this one. We are going to see bills on hot button items that attract attention on issues which are of real concern to the Canadian public, but bills that have absolutely no chance of being dealt with by the justice committee and the House in that period of time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government talks about dealing with these issues such as street racing and I think a bill will be coming forward this week regarding three strikes and you are out, and there are any number of others that are being proposed, such as lowering the age of when youth can be sent to penitentiaries and all those speculations we heard from the minister in the spring and summer, in addition to the bills that are already before us. If the Conservatives were really serious about dealing with these issues, there are alternatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have argued strongly in the past and do so again today that our Criminal Code needs serious reform. It is substantially out of date. There are a number of contradictions in the code which need to be taken care of. Yes, there are additional issues and probably additional crimes as well as sentencing issues that have to be dealt with. But it misleads the Canadian public to bring forward a series of hot button bills that are not going to achieve anything, as opposed to being serious about dealing with the Criminal Code and its weaknesses and its loopholes. The government could do that. It could be serious about it by bringing forward an omnibus bill to reform the Criminal Code, to amend it extensively to bring it into the 21st century which it badly needs. The government should stop playing politics with crime and should stop playing politics with the victims of crime.</div>

If it were really serious about dealing specifically with this crime, this conduct, some things could have been done quickly in the budget. The government could have signalled very clearly to police forces across the country that it would provide them with the financial resources to enforce the existing laws regarding such things as dangerous driving and dangerous driving causing death and injury. The government could have signalled that it would provide them with the necessary resources. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I recently read an article about Richmond, B.C. The local police chief was detailing what his force had done to combat street racing in that community. He felt he had done a fairly good job of getting it under control. He bemoaned quite strongly what it cost his police service. He had to take officers off other work and put them on to that. He had to redeploy resources from fighting other crimes to fighting that specific one. He did not have the resources to do both so he had to make that tough decision. What that says, however, is it can be done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was interesting to speak with one of my colleagues from Winnipeg. She said there is a street in Winnipeg where everybody knows street racing goes on, but the police force simply does not have sufficient resources to deploy forces regularly over an extended period of time, six months to a year, to combat the street racing that occurs there. The police just do not have the resources. That was the information she was getting from the police department.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to get serious about stopping street racing, and I say this a lot when I am dealing with this government in particular, let us do it. Let us not say after the fact when somebody has been seriously injured or killed that we are going to send the criminal to jail for an extended period of time. Do the victim's loved ones or family members really care that much at that point? They want the victim to be alive, healthy and a vibrant part of their lives. That is what we should be talking about when we are drafting legislation. Does it do anything to help the victims of crime? Does it do anything to prevent crime?</div>
    </p><a name="Para121609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the minister is obsessively convinced of the deterrent factor in spite of all the evidence that it does not have much effect to pass those kinds of laws.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at the consequences of this particular legislation. I was interested to hear the minister talk about one of the flaws in the legislation. He did not admit it as that but it is there. If the bill eventually becomes law, what we will have done is created a new offence. In that offence we have defined street racing as being racing. I know non-lawyers would say how ridiculous that is. The minister is telling us not to worry about that because the government has received interpretations and it will rely on precedents from other cases. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320">(1320)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para121611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those precedents, in my opinion, do not exist because at the present time and historically, when this street racing type of conduct has been dealt with by our courts, it has never been defined by our courts. Our courts have looked at it as dangerous driving, as criminal negligence. We do not have any way of relying on precedents as to what racing is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of “street racing” in the bill reads:</div>
    </p><a name="Para121613"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>“street racing” means operating a motor vehicle in a race with at least one other motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place;</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para121614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me repeat that street racing means operating a motor vehicle in a race. That definition is absolutely useless to the courts because it does not tell them anything. What it does do is it raises a major problem. We have to appreciate that the penalties under this section are not being altered significantly on the first offence, but on second and third offences we are going to mandatory minimums, which of course the minister is in love with, all evidence to the contrary.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a scenario. Somebody is convicted once of what I am going to call stupidity. Most crimes are stupid and certainly street racing is that. Let us take what I call the jack rabbit start. Two young people are at a stop sign. One starts revving the engine; the other one responds. They take off. They go down half a block. They are stopped by the police. That is racing by this definition. Big deal. What is going to happen? They are going to be charged with street racing. They are going to go to court and they are going to get a relatively minor penalty on the first offence. If they do that a second time, one, two or three years later, they will be going to jail for three years, and if they do it a third time, they will be going to jail for five years or longer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not what the bill is intended to do, but that could very well be a consequence. We could repeat that in a number of other ways because of the lack of a proper definition of what racing would be under this law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could say, “That is all right. I don't mind. If they do it twice even in a minor way like that, lock them up and throw away the key”. I am sure most of the Conservatives on that side of the House would agree with that sentiment. That is not what happens in the courtrooms. In a courtroom the judge faced with that is going to say, “I am not going to convict” and the person is going to walk away. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about, as this government does all the time, accountability and responding to the credibility gap that we have with regard to our courts, if that person walks out of that courtroom absolutely free with no conviction, what does that to do the credibility of our courts? It is that kind of thinking that never is raised by this government when it is dealing with this legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hearing from the backbench on the Conservative side that what we need are new judges, and of course, they are going through that. They are appointing their friends repeatedly, in spite of the position a number of them took in the last Parliament that they would not do that. I am not surprised when I hear that comment from the backbenchers because it is also in the cabinet of the Conservative government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to this section, again if we are really serious, there are other provisions in the code that are going to deal with it and so, we do not really need it. If we are going to go ahead with this bill, and I know there is some sentiment in this House that there may be some advantage in creating a new offence of a very limited nature, and if we are going to be serious about this, the people we want to get at, the criminals, the criminal conduct that we want to get at, are those people who do it on a premeditated basis. We want to get at the people who soup up and alter their cars. We hear of that. Some people adapt the engines so that they can take, I think it is nitrous oxide, to give the engines a boost when they kickstart their cars. Some people alter the engines in a variety of ways. They alter the body of the car, making it lighter so the car will go faster with the same engine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we really are serious about this issue, we should be looking at that. There are none of those provisions in this bill. That is not what the government is trying to do. We could do that and it might address at least one of the problems.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be looking at a number of alternatives. Let us look at the advertising that auto companies do to sell their vehicles. Somewhere in excess of 50%, and in some markets as high as 90%, of all the advertising done by auto companies show vehicles speeding at an illegal level and being driven in a way that could be considered careless driving all the way up to dangerous driving. Why do we not control those kinds of promotions by auto companies? We did it with cigarette advertising and, to some degree, with alcohol. We can do it with the kind of advertising that is offensive and is encouraging young people to drive recklessly. This level of government could do that . </div>
    </p><a name="Para121623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also have more police officers to enforce our laws. As I said earlier, this would require additional resources but those resources could be given right away. We do not need to wait until the next budget or for legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill as proposed has major flaws in it and one questions whether we need it at all. If we are going to run it through at all, we must limit its scope quite dramatically so it does something effectively as opposed to nothing, which is what the bill would accomplish. </div>

    </p><a name="Para121626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government has identified the problem of street racing. Some people engage in street racing but the vast majority do not. We have decided to send a message to those who would engage in street racing that the government takes it seriously and that there will be serious consequences for those who engage in street racing and, for example, cause bodily harm to another person. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member seems to be proposing an approach that would capture everybody. I think that has been the problem in the past with the Liberal approach to crime and punishment. Advertising by auto manufacturers is geared toward everybody and most everyone can handle advertising responsibly. I fail to see how preventing someone from putting some addition on their vehicle would stop people from engaging in street racing. That would be very heavy-handed and its effect would unjustly limit people's rights to customize their automobiles.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the member casting a net so wide that we would capture innocent Canadians from coast to coast and limit their rights when this government bill targets problem offenders and, most severely, repeat offenders. The bill would send a message from the government and from the House that street racing and endangering the lives of innocent people will not be tolerated. Why does the member want to take the approach that would punish everybody when it is just a few who need to get this message?</div>

That is the same kind of thing we have to do with street racing. We have to say to those people who are inclined to even think of doing it that it is not acceptable to society, but we will not do it simply by passing this bill.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other conduct that we want to see society carry forward on is what I think is the way to go.

In a large number of those cases, there are rational, solid reasons why the judge does that. Our judges are not perfect. They certainly make mistakes and there are times when penalties, by normal standards that most people would accept, are too light, but those are the exceptions, not the rule.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to sentencing guidelines, I am not sure we can add much more if we stay with the existing regime because in order for convictions to occur for dangerous driving, driving that effects criminal negligence, all of the evidence of the conduct would already be before the court. They need to show that conduct to obtain the conviction, so the judge would already have heard all of that evidence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121644"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could then ask whether we should include in the sentencing guidelines that if someone is convicted of dangerous driving and the conduct is in the form of street racing, that should be grounds for consideration of additional penalties. It may be worthwhile but I do not think, on a practical level, it would make much difference.</div>

    </p><a name="Para121650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street racing is a serious crime. Its consequences are equally serious. Street racing is killing and seriously injuring innocent people and is placing all road users and citizens at risk. It has been pursued in communities across our country, in Toronto, Vancouver, Regina and Saskatoon, to name only a few. This government will not stand idly by and allow it to continue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the consequences of inaction on this issue are stark. Our streets will become racetracks and our communities will be at risk. This government is committed to ensuring that we have safe streets and this bill will contribute to that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In talking about Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>, I would be remiss if I failed to mention the important work of our late colleague and my friend, Chuck Cadman, work which was driven in large part out of a deeply held sense of justice. He believed that our lawmakers and our laws should work to ensure that our communities are safe and that those who would threaten our safety through criminal acts should be held accountable. With this purpose in mind, Chuck introduced Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',627871,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=627871&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-338</A> and then Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1394752,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1394752&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-230</A>.</div>

It is in this light that I am proud to be able to speak today on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>, for I believe that Bill C-19 is about ensuring that individuals who commit serious crimes should be punished in a manner that reflects that seriousness.</div>

Currently, there is no specific offence of street racing in the Criminal Code. Rather, persons who currently engage in street racing could be charged under existing offences such as dangerous driving or criminal negligence. Bill C-19 proposes to create a new offence of street racing. In my opinion, this is important, because it appropriately signals the disdain that we as Canadians feel toward this reckless and dangerous crime. It demonstrates that we will not tolerate this reckless disregard for the safety of others in our community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121655"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> would define street racing to mean “operating a motor vehicle in a race with at least one other motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place”. The offence of street racing would operate by referencing already existing Criminal Code offences, namely, dangerous driving, dangerous driving causing bodily harm, dangerous driving causing death, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and criminal negligence causing death.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121656"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this means in practical terms is that in street racing situations when a person commits one of the offences I have just listed, the punishments available to them will be tailored to appropriately reflect the unique nature of the crime. The punishment will fit the crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121657"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be tougher penalties than those currently available under our criminal laws. This is consistent with our larger objective of ensuring that the criminal justice system is tough on crime. We will no longer tolerate a justice system that is soft on criminals at the expense of public safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a person convicted of the street racing offence would be subject to a mandatory minimum driving prohibition. Those who choose to treat our city streets and roads as racetracks for their own pleasure, placing the lives of innocent citizens at risk, will have to face the consequences of such careless behaviour.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add a personal note. When I was a much younger woman, I used to drive a stock car. In fact, I actually did quite well. I think I was the only woman ever to pull a tire off on a quarter-mile dirt track, so members will know I was doing pretty well with our super D stockers. I also have a nephew who has a CASCAR and drives the race circuit in western Canada and the northern United States. Members will know, then, that our family loves speed. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340">(1340)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para121660"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do think there is a place for speed. I think that if young people want to race they should be on a racetrack or a community stock car track of some kind, right across the country. The key to this point that I just mentioned is that I did it at a proper facility. This was as much for my own safety as it was for others'. I obviously have nothing against racing. I love it. I am addicted to the sport. I love the sport, but it must be done when and where it is safe for all involved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians do not want to see those who have been convicted of a serious street racing crime back behind the wheel of a motor vehicle. My son-in-law, the police officer, most definitely does not. These penalties send a clear, strong message, one that I support.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, a person who is convicted of dangerous driving can face the maximum penalty on indictment of five years' imprisonment. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> would retain this penalty in relation to street racing. It would, however, impose for the first offence a mandatory minimum driving prohibition of one year. In addition, the sentencing court would retain discretion to impose a driving prohibition of up to three years and the penalties would go up on each subsequent offence. For a second conviction of dangerous driving while street racing, the mandatory minimum driving prohibition would increase to two years. The court retains discretion to prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle for up to five years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond two convictions of dangerous driving while street racing, a sentencing court would be required to impose a mandatory three year driving prohibition but would have discretion to impose a maximum lifetime prohibition. This discretion ensures that the courts are able to deal with each instance appropriately and individually.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating a motor vehicle is a privilege, not a right. Those who would continue to abuse that privilege and place others at risk of serious harm or death should not be entitled to drive. For the more serious street racing offences, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> proposes stringent penalties. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121665"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government made a commitment to make our communities and streets safe and to ensure that the criminal law is strengthened so our laws accurately reflect the significant and lasting impact crime can have on our communities. This government is living up to its commitment. Those who are convicted of dangerous driving causing bodily harm or criminal negligence causing bodily harm in street racing situations will face stiff penalties. </div>

Similarly, it would also impose mandatory minimum driving prohibitions for those who commit the most serious offences. For dangerous driving causing death or criminal negligence causing death in street racing situations, the maximum penalty will be life imprisonment. This is a significant increase from the penalty of 14 years currently available for this conduct in our criminal laws. Indeed, life imprisonment is the most stringent penalty our criminal law provides for. This reflects the severity of the crime, its negative impact on society and the seriousness for which our government views this.</div>

    </p><a name="Para121668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, as it is currently formulated, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172003,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172003&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-9, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (conditional sentence of imprisonment)</A>, would prevent the use of conditional sentences in serious crimes. Serious criminals must be held accountable. These changes to the criminal justice system will ensure that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172003,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172003&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-9</A> are pertinent to street racing as well. In those cases where street racing causes injury or death to another person, a conditional sentence or permitting the offender to serve his or her sentence in the community would not be permitted. This makes sense. A person who commits a serious crime, and let us make no mistake, causing death or injury to someone as a result of street racing is of the utmost seriousness, should not be able to serve his or her sentence in the community.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should pause for a moment to note that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> is not about criminalizing legitimate racing activities nor is it about criminalizing motor enthusiasts.

    </p><a name="Para121671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Code amendments proposed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> to address street racing go beyond tougher penalties for this crime. Rather, they speak more fundamentally to the values we hold so dear in Canadian society and the values we wish to live by. Canadians can rightly stand with pride. Canadians live in and contribute to a society that is envied the world over. Our country is known to be safe, just and law-abiding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want safe communities. They want to feel secure in knowing that when they leave their homes, whether it is to go for a walk, to drive to work or to celebrate important events with friends and family, they and their loved ones will be safe. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want laws that work to ensure safety. They should demand nothing less of their government.We, as their elected representatives, have no greater duty than that of ensuring that our laws reflect these values. We must respond to these demands in a measured and responsible way. We have an immense responsibility to ensure that our laws continue to ensure that our communities will be safe for our citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, as the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79005,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79005&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> has noted, “there is no task more important to any government than the protection of its citizens”.

    </p><a name="Para121675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we know that strong laws will not curb crime on their own. That is why our government continues to pursue a broad range of measures, legislative and otherwise, to ensure that our communities are safe. For example, we have pledged $20 million over two years to focus on crime prevention activities, including strategies to reduce youth crime. This money will enable us to partner across Canada at the local level to work with at risk youth and thereby prevent crime before it happens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we do not have comprehensive statistics on street racing crime, including how often it is occurring and by whom, we do know that it is often caused by young persons.

The proposed provisions will provide a more systematic and comprehensive ability to track street racing offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is also committed to strengthening the ability of law enforcement to respond to crime. Good laws are effective only if we have strong police forces across this country to enforce them. I wish to acknowledge the important work being done by law enforcement agencies across this country in combating crime in all forms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the greater Toronto area, Project ERASE, which stands for “Eliminate Racing Activity on Streets Everywhere”, works to reduce street racing through the collaboration of multiple police forces.

    </p><a name="Para121679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, this government has committed to investing nearly $200 million over the next two years to strengthen the capabilities of the RCMP, who are called upon day in and day out to perform many dangerous tasks with the goal of keeping our communities safe. This commitment to our officers will ensure they have the resources needed to perform their jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong laws are important, but we must not forget the important role that law enforcement plays in ensuring that they are effective.

It is a combination of targeted legislative amendments and broader measures to support crime prevention in our country that this government believes will lead to a safer and more secure Canada.</div>

Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.)</A>: </b><span class="nextIntervention"><a class="nav_link" href="#Int-1673488"><img src="/common/images/arrow2_left.gif" border="0" alt="previous intervention"></a></span>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, last week in the House the government, when it dealt with a $13 billion surplus, made some cuts at the same time. We all know about many of these cuts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the areas that I would like to pursue with that minister of the Crown is the cut that was made to training for police forces and enforcement officers across the country with respect to drug operations and the operation of motor vehicles. I think this cut is very problematic. I think Mothers Against Drunk Driving and others would be very concerned about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand we hear these lovely speeches, which have the rhetoric of saying that this is all about public safety. Yet on my chart of the government's meanspirited cuts is dollars for training law enforcement around driving.</div>
    </p><a name="Para121688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a situation where we have a government that believes it is worthwhile to cut literacy, the law commission and museums. I have a children's museum in my riding that takes a lot of children off the street and puts them into activities. Now the government is cutting funding for children's museums on an urgency basis. I do not understand it and I do not think Canadians understand these cuts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all well and good to talk about safety issues with words. We know the government wants to message to Canadians that it is so concerned. At the end of the day the reality is, and we all know it in this chamber, the included offences will probably still remain the charged offences under this thing. It is important that we discuss this and other sections of the bill at committee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para121690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already stated and shown, as have my other colleagues from all the parties in the House, that this is not to belittle the seriousness of the issue, and it is serious. However, the government stands and talks about this and tries to capture itself as the only party that understands these issues. There are some anomalies here. I think Canadians now see that messaging and delivery are two different things. It is just like we heard in health. It is the same thing. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social enterprises use business methods to achieve social and environmental goals.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations of these programs, including the Community Futures Development Corporations, show that these groups mobilize volunteer time and private donations that match and often exceed the government support they receive.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact is that since 1997 we have been told that more than $6.3 billion was going to be spent to combat climate change. What is the result?

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>At one time, Members were also prohibited from asking a question during Question Period if it was in anticipation of an Order of the Day; this was to prevent the time of the House being taken up with business to be discussed later in the sitting. In 1975, the rule was relaxed in regard to questions asked during Question Period when the Order of Day was either the Budget debate or the debate on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne, as long as questions on these matters did not monopolize the limited time available during Question Period. In 1983, the Speaker ruled that questions relating to an opposition motion on a Supply day could also be put during Question Period. In 1997, the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs recommended, in a report to the House, that questions not be ruled out of order on this basis alone. The Speaker subsequently advised the House that the Chair would follow the advice of the Committee.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a point raised in debate, on which I would like to have the member's comment. It has to do with whether the objectives of the bill, which I think has some general interest and support from the House, and the existing laws with regard to the dangerous or reckless use of an automobile can still apply in this case with the addition of an exacerbating factor such as street racing.</div>

While he and his government might be playing to another audience, an audience in large municipal centres of rich population, dense population and voters who did not support the government, they are playing to the issues that affect people very much. While the purported message in the bill is to prevent crime and keep communities safe, the real objective of the bill, like all other bills the Minister of Justice has led through the House, is political gain.</div>

I submit that this matter be sent to committee for procedural as well as substantive review.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real issue is the saving of lives before lives are put in danger. Instead of investing time and energy into creating new offences that have a catchy title, such as is the case with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>, we as a responsible nation and as responsible parliamentarians need to invest in prevention and education to prevent street racing from happening, rather than dealing just with the victims and deaths once street racing has occurred.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122021"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It occurred to me that this would be an appropriate time to bring forward the fact that, under the public safety and emergency preparedness cuts of last week, the RCMP cut from its budget $4.6 million to do with the elimination of drug impaired driving programs through its training budget. It seems remarkable to me that on the one hand the government is suggesting our streets will be safer. On the other hand, it takes money away from a program that would have made the streets safer. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122022"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud of the fact that Mothers Against Drunk Driving is a Canada-wide organization. It has probably met with every member of Parliament. It is very focused. I am very proud that the president of MADD currently is a resident of New Brunswick. It would not be particularly pleased that the first focus of the government, when it comes to driving offences, is street racing. For some time, it has been lobbying for measures such as those cut in the recent budget. It would like to see the penalties meted out to drunk driving offences, which have a long history in the Criminal Code, as severe as those for street racing violations, and they are not under this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122023"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can all agree that street racing is a dangerous activity and has no place in Canadian communities. I am tired of other parties in the House being castigated with the brush, that we are not for the protection of our citizens. I make a non-partisan statement that every member of the House is for public safety and safety in our streets. We will differ on how to get there. My remarks are about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para870266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to address this problem is the real issue. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78758,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78758&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> believes that by creating a new series of offences that reference the existing Criminal Code offences, we will have a panacea. Because it is called a street racing bill, I am very concerned that members of the public will now think it will eradicate street racing. Nothing can be further from the truth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para870267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is there are in existence a number of harsh and severe offences, which have to be meted out by the justices and for which this very <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78758,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78758&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> has absolutely no respect. The Minister of Justice has showed that he does not even know how judges get appointed. He has to know what colour they are in political allegiance, but he has no idea how they get appointed. He has shown so little respect for judges and their discretion that he has held up a long overdue pay increase to them. He has criticized judges as Liberal judges. Today he might have argued that judges have no political stripes. We are waiting for a lot of answers from the Minister of Justice on his view and his level of respect for the judiciary of our country. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> creates another confusion. There is a lot of confusion in every Conservative bill because the Conservatives are in a hurry to leave a strong impression in Canada. It has been well established in law that objectively the offence of dangerous driving is not as serious as criminal negligence. However, this bill establishes an identical system of imprisonment for both offences. That does not make much sense.</div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para122033"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is respectfully submitted that the proper approach to deal with this dangerous conduct is simply to make street racing a mandatory aggravating factor in sentencing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard talk in the House about whether people need to be lawyers but surely they do not. They need to have good sense. However, it does mean that the lawyers in this House need to have common sense too. It does not excuse the lawyers from the requirement for good common sense. The good common sense from having street racing as a mandatory aggravating factor in sentencing means that while we trust judges, and on this side of the House we do, to make proper decisions, we are saying by way of public statement that they shall consider street racing, when it is present, as an aggravating factor. This would remove the issue of having to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a street race has occurred.</div>
    </p><a name="Para870270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One could imagine, in very serious circumstances, that the lawyers would spend most of their fighting over the definition of street racing because it has not been provided in the bill. The hon. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78758,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78758&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> says that there is a lot of common law on this but common law on racing in Canada would probably be more tuned to horse racing than street racing because Canada has not had a law on street racing, which leaves it as a dog's breakfast. We probably have a whole bunch of Liberal lawyers trying to figure it out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para870271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we would like some Liberal legislators to make it inevitable that we will not need to deal with the definition of street racing. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78758,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78758&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> and his cohorts can still go out on the bandstands and say that they have cured the issue but the technical aspect is that aggravating factor in sentencing would ensure the judge is just dealing with whether he thinks there was a race, whether there was dangerous operation of a motor vehicle or whether there was criminal negligence. Those are the standards that have been used. Those terms have meaning in law. They have been considered in cases. Those are judicial decisions that judges write.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would remove the issue of having to deal with street racing, which has not been defined, just as the Liberal's Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1993382,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1993382&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-65</A> and, as I said before, private member's Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1394752,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1394752&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-230</A>, proposed by the late Chuck Cadman, proposed to deal with this. I think it is the right way to go. Preferably we will deal with it in committee and, if not, by amendment at third reading stage.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is suggested that by providing a mandatory aggravating factor in sentencing, the message to the public will be as serious as the marquee name “street racing” and the message would be heard loud and clear. It would be easier at a sentence hearing to argue that the aggravating factors existed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para870272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note in the material supplied by the Library of Parliament that a number of the cases showed that there were other aggravating factors, not mitigating factors. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78758,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78758&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> likes to speak about mitigating factors, the people who got off because of circumstances. We have had plenty of cases where there are multiple increased aggravating factors, such as the use of alcohol, criminal gang activity and lack of remorse. These are aggravating factors that can be combined with the mandatory aggravating factor in sentencing that was in place in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1993382,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1993382&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-65</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between a dangerous driving offence and a dangerous driving offence involving a race will be a dog's breakfast before the courts. I think we need to be careful that, while we agree on a goal, which is keeping the streets safer, we give, not only the judges but prosecutors, the tools they need to succeed in getting convictions and not give them loopholes with undefined terms, all for the purpose of political gain.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would increase the available maximum prison terms. Once again, it is a well-established legal principle that the maximum sentence is usually reserved for the worst offender in the worst case. This might give people who are very concerned about street racing offences the false impression that every street racing offence will be charged under a maximum or asked for by charging the maximum. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there are summary conviction methods of proceeding here, which give prosecutors discretion in the way they wish to proceed. We also know that maximum terms are not meted out that frequently.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to tell the truth to the Canadian public, that even this bill, in its form, does not guarantee that every street racing offender will get 10 or 14 years. It is time to be real with the Canadian public. The bill would provide for mandatory orders of prohibition from driving.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122044"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time I would like to mention again the spectre of MADD. Mothers Against Drunk Driving might very well be at our doors next week or the week after, should we move this on or pass it relatively quickly, to ask where the tough mandatory orders of prohibitions are for longer periods on continued, excessive and repetitive drunk driving offences. The bill is harsher than those infractions are and those infractions were built up over a long period of time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it should be easy to support this initiative with respect to the mandatory orders of prohibition, the manner in which it is addressed is inadequate, specifically when dealing with repeat offenders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to know the distinction between dangerous driving causing bodily harm and criminal negligence causing bodily harm. Let us take ourselves to a situation in an area not unlike the area that my friend from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78791,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78791&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Fundy Royal</A> represents, a countryside where there is a known repeat offender with respect to racing. This person is dangerous to the public and to himself or herself. The person is convicted the first time of dangerous driving because the prosecutor and the police, in that case the rural RCMP, say that this will show that person and this will be a deterrent. Hopefully that person is meted out the proper sentence and the proper time is served.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122047"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second conviction, the police might very well charge that person, because it is a repeat offence, with criminal negligence causing bodily harm. In both cases there could be bodily harm, the same modus operandi, the same facts, but the police authorities and the prosecutor have said that, for deterrent's sake, they must charge the person with the worse offence because the person will get more time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this bill as drafted, and I hope we can sort this out at committee, I submit that the repeat offence will not be caught by the mandatory prohibitions and the longer sentences. The reason is that the definition of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, if amended, with or without a street race, is not a repeat if it is charged under criminal negligence causing bodily harm.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These definitions and these legal words certainly have to be worked out at the committee level but there is more than that. It is not good enough for the chief law officer of this nation to sign off on a bill for which homework has yet to be done. It is not fair enough to say that we can fix this at committee. It is a trend. It is trend of the government to present ill-conceived, ill-drafted, hasty and sensational bills to this House, known more for their titles than their substance, and expect the hard-working members of the committee to set it all right.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122050"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could send one message to the government members it would be that they read the bills, consider them and consider that the Criminal Code of Canada is holistic, it is organic and it should be taken in this context.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person is charged with criminal negligence and dangerous driving causing bodily harm, it begs the question of whether this is a repeat offender. Is the criminal negligence a second offence? We would not know. The bill fails to answer those questions. I can tell members that every doubt will be cast in favour of the accused in our courtrooms, as they are constituted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many if not all studies have shown that there is no link between more severe, longer and harsher sentences and the diminution of crime rates. While I, as a member of society, might be very willing to go with the government on longer sentences and try the principle of sentence that says deterrence is important, I would need to know and I would need to be able to tell my constituents that it will work, that the thrill-seeking street racer will be deterred by a harsher sentence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes back to our first point. Through education or funding in law enforcement and more cooperation with the provincial law authorities, I think more could be done than just simply getting it out on the five o'clock news that we will cure street racing now because we have a three page bill. That is not good enough.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us work together with these various levels of government, because the cities and municipalities in this country are the third order of government, and let us try to make a better bill that would save the government money, but more important, would save lives.</div>

We have to work with other members of other governments to make sure that we make a better law.</div>

The points are very well taken.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other aspects that comes up in a lot of justice bills is whether the other jurisdictions have the resources to be able to enforce the laws and the tools to do the job and whether the courts in fact have the support they need to deal with these offences. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly street racing is not necessarily something that is all across the country. It is probably in pockets. We should ensure that the enforcing authorities, which may be provincial, regional or RCMP, have the sufficient tools they need to be able to anticipate and work on the preventive side of this piece of legislation.</div>

    </p><a name="Para122072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly at the municipal level there are bylaws and policies that could be enacted, but both of those examples, to answer the hon. member's question, come down to a matter of resources. All police forces will tell us, as the hon. member knows, that problem oriented policing is the wave of the future. This is what police officers now want to do. Rather than deal with a crime that has happened, they want to prevent crimes from happening. They want to get into the schools. In this case, they want to be out on the streets to prevent street racing events from occurring, more by their presence in a deterrent way rather than a “cover the whole area” way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. friend is absolutely right that resources to communities have to be allocated. Municipalities are the third level of government. They were doing extremely well under the Liberal-led infrastructure program. They sought and received mandates for programming of all sorts that made our cities more viable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of just trotting out a bill that has a catchy title and leads the public into a false sense of security, we have to ensure that in the future we back it up, that the government backs it up, perhaps at our urging, with the sufficient resources to enforce it and make the deterrent effects in it real, because if we are only relying on the definitions in a section of the Criminal Code, then these people, given their disrespect for judges generally, would be the first to say that is not a sufficient deterrent factor.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What has to be done is more vigilance in the community. I would think that a new government with any sort of freshness might have said, “Let us continue on the path of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1993382,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1993382&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-65</A>. Let us continue on the infrastructure program. Let us make our communities viable.” I would think it might have said, “Let us not cut funding from public safety and emergency preparedness. Let us not cut $1 billion of funding to the social fabric that keeps this community together”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have thought that would have been one of the first orders of the day, but that is not what has happened here. The money is not flowing. Bills are being presented so that they can shock the public into an awareness of crimes that in certain cases are not as bad in prevalence as is advertised. Then there seem to be the white knight cure-alls by very poor, hollow and shallow legislation, which I believe Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> is.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I of course will be speaking in favour of the government's Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (street racing) and to make a consequential amendment to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard members opposite say there is some magic formula that can be used as a cure-all, but I think Canadians and certainly my constituents in Fundy Royal, contrary to those members, find it extremely refreshing that we finally have a government that is taking criminal justice seriously. We know that for too long there was a Liberal revolving door to the criminal justice system. We saw a lot of fluff come out. We saw programs that did not work. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122080"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, my constituents say to me that they find it refreshing to have a government that takes seriously protecting them, protecting society, protecting their lives and protecting their property. Quite frankly, they were fed up with the talk from the opposite side and are pleased to see some action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122081"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, and as has been said in other speeches, the matter of street racing was one of great importance to the late Chuck Cadman. Chuck was a member of Parliament for Surrey North and had twice brought forward a private member's bill on the issue of street racing, but each time the bill died on the order paper.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122082"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous government, as was mentioned, also brought forward a government bill, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1993382,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1993382&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-65</A>, during the 38th Parliament. That bill, too, died on the order paper. Like Mr. Cadman's bill, Bill C-65 took the approach of making street racing an aggravating factor for the offences of dangerous driving and criminal negligence that involve death or injury. Unlike Mr. Cadman's bill, Bill C-65 did not propose higher minimum driving prohibitions for repeat offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> does follow Mr. Cadman's approach of bringing in mandatory driving prohibitions that escalate with repeat offences. We know that it is the few who are creating the problem. It is the recidivism and the repeat offenders who need to get the message that we are not going to tolerate serious street racing on Canada's streets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122084"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure that police and prosecutors can determine that a person is a repeat offender through the Canadian Police Information Centre, it is necessary to enact a street racing offence rather than simply create an aggravating factor of street racing. This is because CPIC does not record aggravating factors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122085"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some would say that past proposals to enact a requirement for judges to take into account acts of street racing as an aggravating factor in sentencing were very modest, given the fact that judges, and this is an important point, are already required to take into account all aggravating and mitigating circumstances when sentencing an offender. In this sense, enacting an aggravating factor provision would simply codify what judges already do and what they are quite rightly required to do. If a judge does not consider street racing an aggravating factor in sentencing, one would certainly expect the prosecution to appeal the sentence. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New street racing offences carrying mandatory driving prohibitions will send street racers a very clear message. It is a message that has to be sent on behalf of all Canadians. Racing on public streets is not going to be tolerated. I would point out that I am not, of course, speaking here of officially sanctioned road rallies but about those who commit the offence of dangerous driving or criminal negligence coupled with street racing. We did hear some members speaking today about legal racing, racing on racetracks, which is perfectly legitimate and which the bill does not touch on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who do not heed the message sent by these new offences, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> will deliver serious consequences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me speak for a minute about those who engage in street racing. In many cases, they risk not only their own lives but the lives of others and pedestrians, innocent third parties who have in no way consented to any form of speed contest on the streets of our cities and towns.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600">(1600)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para122089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hat is off to police officers and others who work very hard with motorsport shops and organizations such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving to find safe, closed circuit venues for drivers to experience the thrill of racing. Those kinds of efforts, along with strong federal and provincial legislation, are exactly what is needed to eradicate street racing in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, specific federal legislation on street racing is needed now more than ever. The evidence is quite clear on that. The existing dangerous driving and criminal negligence offences that can apply to street racing go some distance to preventing street racing by right thinking drivers, but there are still too many that will risk the lives pedestrians and other motorists in order to engage in street racing on busy city streets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Parliament can do something more than what is already in place to improve the Criminal Code measures directed against street racing or any other serious offence for that matter, it ought to do so. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> gives parliamentarians the opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way to the combined federal, provincial and municipal efforts aimed at street racing.</div>

Three of these relate to the existing offence of dangerous driving. The other two relate to the existing offence of criminal negligence. For all five offences within Bill C-19, the key distinguishing feature will be the commission of the underlying offence plus the act of street racing on a street, road, highway or other place to which the public has access.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another distinguishing feature of the five street racing offences is that they will each carry a mandatory prohibition from driving in Canada. These Criminal Code driving prohibitions will escalate for repeat offenders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask the indulgence of my colleagues in the House while I briefly sketch out the mandatory driving prohibitions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a first offence of dangerous driving with no death or injury accompanied by street racing, the minimum driving prohibition will be one year and the maximum driving prohibition will be three years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a second offence of dangerous driving with no death or injury and street racing, the minimum driving prohibition will be two years and the maximum driving prohibition will be five years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a third offence of dangerous driving, again with no death or injury and street racing, the minimum driving prohibition will be three years and the maximum driving prohibition will be a lifetime driving ban.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a first conviction for dangerous driving with injury and street racing, the minimum driving prohibition will be a minimum of one year and a maximum of 10 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a second conviction for dangerous driving or criminal negligence with injury and street racing, the minimum driving prohibition would be two years and the maximum driving prohibition 10 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a third dangerous driving or criminal negligence with injury and street racing, the minimum driving prohibition would be three years and the maximum again would be a lifetime ban.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a first conviction for criminal negligence with death and street racing, the minimum driving prohibition would be one year and the maximum would be a lifetime ban.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a first conviction for dangerous driving with death and street racing, the minimum driving prohibition would be one year and the maximum driving prohibition would be 10 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a second conviction involving dangerous driving and street racing or criminal negligence street racing involving death or injury, and either the first or the second conviction involved a death, there would be a mandatory lifetime driving ban.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hasten to note that these driving prohibitions are in addition to a driving ban during any period in which drivers are imprisoned. There will be no case where convicted drivers are sitting in jail, not prohibited from driving or having the driving prohibition period running down while they are incarcerated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the provisions in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> for imprisonment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For dangerous driving with street racing where there is no death or injury, the prosecution has the choice to proceed summarily, where the maximum period of incarceration is six months imprisonment, or the prosecution in a more serious case may choose to proceed by way of indictment, in which case the maximum period of imprisonment is five years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For dangerous driving or criminal negligence with injury and street racing, the maximum period of incarceration is 14 years under Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For both dangerous driving and criminal negligence with death and street racing, the maximum period of incarceration is life under Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> is a balanced approach to dealing with the dangers posed by street racing. The ranges of imprisonment and mandatory driving prohibitions that escalate with repeat offences reflect the serious nature of the proposed street racing offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122110"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there may be the very rare case where there are drivers who repeat a street racing offence that involves bodily harm or death, the police information system, CPIC, will track the repeat offence and it will be certain that these persons will receive harsher sanctions. This is an improvement over prior street racing bills given that the police information system does not show that there was an aggravating factor of street racing in a prior conviction, but would show prior street racing offences that are proposed by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122111"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to set the record straight on a couple of issues. Some media articles have suggested there is nothing useful to be found in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> or that it is simply politically motivated. Nothing could be further from the truth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the bill will bring in mandatory driving prohibitions that will escalate with repeat offences. The existing driving prohibition in dangerous driving and criminal negligence cases is discretionary. It is hard to imagine that even some legal commentators do not seem to grasp this very significant proposal for change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the number of street racing offences involving death or injury, there will be an increase in the penalty range from that which exists for the current offences of dangerous driving and of criminal negligence. This is not a cynical political attempt to grab headlines. It is a valid response to a real problem which does what the Criminal Code can logically do in order to contribute to existing combined efforts of provincial governments, police, municipal governments, and other stakeholders to eliminate street racing and its attendant dangers from Canadian roads.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is true that higher maximum penalties under Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>, like all maximum penalties, are reserved for the worst offender and the worst factual circumstances, raising a maximum penalty is Parliament's signal to the courts that Parliament sees the problem as more serious and that a shift to higher sentences is warranted even in those cases that do not involve the worst offender and the worst factual circumstances.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some critics have even suggested that prosecutors would shy away from a dangerous driving street racing charge and prosecute a dangerous driving charge instead. This is nonsensical. The street racing offence will carry a mandatory driving prohibition while a conviction for dangerous driving without street racing carries a discretionary driving prohibition. There is a clear advantage to the street racing charge and with the passage of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> an additional tool for the prosecutor's toolbox.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, some critics charge that the problem is one which is either small or trifling. Try telling that to ordinary Canadians who experience street racers dodging in and out of traffic, putting road users at risk, or to families who are attending funerals and hospital emergency rooms as a result of a street racing accident. We cannot give street racing the ostrich treatment and simply stick our heads in the sand saying it is not a big problem.</div>

Anyone who says otherwise is simply wrong in their assessment of what the bill proposes.</div>

    </p><a name="Para122123"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the member has indicated that CPIC does not track the street racing element under the current four provisions in the Criminal Code dealing with the dangerous use of automobiles. However, that is really only relevant, I would think, if we are preoccupied with how many repeat offences there may have been. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it gets down to coming to the courts, and that is what the charge is for a circumstance where there was a violation under the Criminal Code and street racing was involved, the court is there, and the member also concurred that the courts now already take into account aggravating factors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering why the member is hanging his whole argument on the fact that CPIC does not take all these things into account. The member will well know that when someone is killed in an automobile accident, or a pedestrian struck down by a car, the reports usually show that the cause of death was trauma when in fact it may very well have been something like drunk driving. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122126"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the member could comment on what exactly CPIC should be doing that would help the courts in this particular case.</div>

We feel it should be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to target, as our bill does, the most serious repeat offenders, those who will go out and risk the lives of other Canadians and put them in harm's way, and in fact have already done so, we have to have a way of tracking that. That is what CPIC does. It tracks criminal activities. It tracks arrests. CPIC does not track these aggravating factors. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By having the Criminal Code offence of street racing, CPIC would be able to track that offence, so we will be able to know, the court will be able to know, and the police will be able to know that someone is being arrested for a second, third or fourth time for the same type of offence. There are a great number of offences out there that someone could take part in. However, this bill would specifically target those who would engage in street racing, particularly repeat offenders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of the police and CPIC, I am very pleased that as a government we have put more resources into it. There was a great deal of debate today as to why we do not just put more resources in and why do we need a law. We need a law to send the message that this Parliament takes street racing seriously, but it is a multi-pronged approach. We are also putting money into front line policing, the RCMP and municipal police.</div>

If we are looking at this to deter, and I am assuming that is part of the rationale for this bill, where is the evidence for that? I guess it is important when we are dealing with bills of this scope that we be evidence-based. Where is the deterrence evidence that we can cite and prove because that is obviously important? That is my first question.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question would be, what other areas can we look at in terms of prevention? If we were to look at how street racing is being promoted in Hollywood, on our televisions, and the idea that one can pick up a magazine and have a car overhauled in an afternoon, perhaps while parents are away, et cetera, and we have heard these stories, where is the government on those issues? Many would say that is where we should start. This bill is probably not the first issue that we need to deal with. The first issue is actually the prevention, supply, demand, so to say, of street racing cars, et cetera.</div>

I think it will have a deterrent effect on someone that there is a new Criminal Code offence of street racing. We are also putting into the Criminal Code increased maximum penalties and mandatory minimum driving prohibitions. This government is taking this issue seriously. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a little surprised. I have heard a couple of times from members of the NDP about the image in Hollywood and so on. I do not know if they are proposing that we censor Hollywood movies, but there are images out there and they may be unrealistic images. However, we have to deal with what we can as a House of Commons. We are putting the money into front line policing, 1,000 RCMP officers, and we are working with municipalities and the provinces for 2,500 other police officers. That is on the preventive side, to get the police out there on the street where they need to be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reason we have the Criminal Code. The Criminal Code exists to send a message to would-be offenders that there are certain actions that we will not tolerate as a society. When it comes to street racing, there is no specific mention in the Criminal Code, and until we pass Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> there will not be specific mention in the Criminal Code on the issue of street racing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122136"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By its nature, if there are two cars barreling side by side down what could be a busy street, there is an increased danger that is not currently recognized in the Criminal Code. That is the deterrent effect we want to bring in. We want to specifically sanction in the code that activity as one which society does not tolerate.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to the parliamentary secretary's description of the penalties. He emphasized a moment ago the deterrent aspect of the penalties.

    </p><a name="Para122139"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, more police officers will help, but when an individual has been arrested and charged on a first offence, is there anything from an educational aspect to talk about prevention? I do not see it specifically named in the bill and it may be a regulatory matter, but the best safety aspect of all is to prevent the crime from happening in the first place. I do not think we want to go to the United States' system of three strikes and you are out, and building more jails. The best approach is education through our schools and through public endeavours to do as much as we can on the preventive side on the danger, the injury to others and to the individuals themselves that can happen through street racing.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I must point out that the previous government introduced Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1993382,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1993382&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-65</A>, in September 2005, and that in October 2005 we supported it at second reading.

However, when we pass a bill, will it have an impact on provincial laws, for example? We must always respect jurisdictions. We know that each province and territory has its own motor vehicle and highway safety legislation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Quebec, the maximum fine for a driver who engages in street racing is $600. In Ontario, an offender convicted of engaging in street racing may have his or her driver’s licence suspended for a maximum of two years.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opinion from Dominique Valiquet of the Law and Government Division of the Library of Parliament is clear as to the legal aspect of the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can summarize the bill by saying that it amends the Criminal Code by defining street racing and creating five new offences related to street racing. This is what distinguishes it from Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1993382,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1993382&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-65</A>, for example, which was introduced by the other government. For three of these new offences, Bill C-19 provides for maximum sentences that are stiffer than those currently in effect for dangerous driving or criminal negligence while operating a motor vehicle. It introduces mandatory orders prohibiting offenders from driving for a minimum period, with a gradual increase in the duration of the order for repeat offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge difference between this bill and Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1993382,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1993382&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-65</A>, because Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> goes further.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a closer look at this. For example, under current legislation, the courts must turn to the provisions related to dangerous driving or criminal negligence to punish those who engage in street racing. At present, the Criminal Code specifies four offences that could apply to street racing in case of death or injury: criminal negligence causing death, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under current legislation, the fact that criminal negligence or dangerous driving was committed in the context of street racing has no bearing. That is what we hope to change. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for mandatory driving prohibitions, the Criminal Code currently compels judges to suspend the driver's licence of any individual convicted of impaired driving. For offences of criminal negligence and dangerous driving, such a suspension is currently at the judge's discretion. The difference under the proposed legislation is that it would not be left to the judge's discretion; rather, there would be mandatory minimum sentences. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first look at clause 1 of the bill. The bill defines street racing as:</div>
    </p><a name="Para122170"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

            <td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>—operating a motor vehicle in a race with at least one other motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para122171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression “operating a motor vehicle in a race” does not seem to include a timed race involving only one motor vehicle. That would have to be added and defined at committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122172"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of “motor vehicle” is found in section 2 of the Criminal Code. It includes motorcycles, snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles. This is very important because races often take place among these kinds of vehicles.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122173"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of street racing applies to organized street races as well as those improvised in inappropriate locations not intended for this purpose. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122174"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for offences pertaining to street racing, it is important to talk about the five new offences created by this legislation. In addition to participation in street racing, an element of negligence must be present. What is the difference between criminal negligence and dangerous operation? What defines dangerous operation is that the driver's behaviour must be markedly different in terms of due diligence compared to that of a reasonable person in the same situation. In the case of criminal negligence, the driver must be found to have acted with wanton and careless disregard for the lives or safety of others. There is a distinct difference. Also, it must be shown that there was criminal negligence or dangerous operation in order for the participant to be found guilty of one of the five new street racing offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever assists or encourages a street racer may also be considered to have participated in the offence.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635">(1635)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para122176"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important because there are promoters of these races on the Internet, who will not be charged unless they are included. Those who organize such races, not just the participants, must also be held responsible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122177"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> adds the five following street racing offences to the Criminal Code: dangerous operation of a motor vehicle; dangerous operation causing bodily harm; dangerous operation causing death; causing bodily harm by criminal negligence; and causing death by criminal negligence. This is very clear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For three of these new offences, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> provides maximum sentences that are longer than those currently set for dangerous driving or criminal negligence in operating a motor vehicle. In the case of dangerous operation causing bodily harm, the sentence is 14 years compared to 10. For dangerous operation causing death, the sentence is imprisonment for life compared to 14 years. The difference in sentencing and the new offences being added are significant.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122179"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judges can also order driving prohibitions. The Criminal Code currently requires the judge to suspend the driver's licence in cases where an individual is convicted of having the care or control of a vehicle while impaired.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122180"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For criminal negligence and dangerous driving offences, such an order is currently at the judge's discretion. When an individual is found guilty of criminal negligence causing death, the licence may be suspended for life. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19 </A>removes the judge's discretion by setting out a one-year mandatory minimum driving prohibition the first time an individual is convicted of dangerous driving or criminal negligence causing bodily harm or death while participating in street racing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122181"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill provides that the minimum driving prohibition period will be increased for subsequent offences. It is important to read the driving prohibition provision very carefully. It prohibits the offender from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other public place for a minimum period plus any period to which the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. This is in addition to any other sentence the court may impose. An offender may appeal a driving prohibition order before the National Parole Board to cancel or vary such an order. Driving during the prohibition period is punishable by up to five years imprisonment. This bill would make major changes to the Criminal Code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122182"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>'s proposed system of gradually increasing the length of prohibition for repeat offences would have to be reviewed. For dangerous driving that does not cause bodily harm, the increasing length of the prohibition is identical to the provisions in the Criminal Code for offences involving drinking and driving. This seems reasonable to us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122183"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the minimum lengths seem more problematic for repeat offences of dangerous driving and criminal negligence causing death. For example, if a person has already been found guilty of dangerous driving cause bodily harm and they cause another person's death as a result of dangerous driving, they will automatically be banned from driving for life. In that example, the fact that a judge is forced to ban the offender from driving for life could create adverse effects, effects we have gone over a number of times during discussions on minimum sentences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us review the reasons that have always prompted us to be extremely cautious in using minimum sentences. Minimum sentences restrict the judges, who are in the best position to determine the most appropriate sentence in light of all the facts in each case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122185"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois defends a model of justice based on a personalized process, with a case-by-case approach and with the principle of rehabilitation in mind. Minimum sentences can have adverse effects and lead to plea bargaining by lawyers wanting to have their clients charged with offences that do not have minimum sentences.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640">(1640)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para122186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum sentences could also compel a judge to acquit an individual rather than impose a sentence that he or she feels is too strict, in light of any particular circumstances. For example, a suspension for life, while the appropriate sentence might be a suspended licence for five years. Hence, the amendments and questions proposed by the Bloc Québécois regarding this bill.</div>

I think the comment was made through that quote, and I am taking this as my inference and I do not know if it is correct or not, that Mr. Vaillancourt suggested that there was an expansion of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>, which includes liabilities that may take place on private tracks.

    </p><a name="Para122203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was taken by the member's insights with respect to young people who are looking for a constructive outlet to participate in road sport other than on public streets. Even local police enforcement agencies are working with young people through clubs and so on to try to steer them into a regulated environment where they can participate in a positive way in road sport. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr. Vaillancourt is right, and my inference is that private tracks were included with respect to some liabilities, could the member indicate whether the bill is encompassing some private liabilities? Does he think this would not be constructive and helpful with respect to the approach he has suggested, that we take a more encompassing positive one, not just one that is obviously very intent on punishment?</div>

    </p><a name="Para122206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quoted the member of the Law and Government Division because I was wondering whether this bill might encroach on provincial jurisdiction. I was told it would not. Given that each province and territory has its own legislation on motor vehicles, I was wondering whether tabling this bill might infringe on existing provincial laws, particularly those in Quebec, which has a very good framework. I was told there was no problem because anything to do with criminal law falls under federal jurisdiction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Valiquet said that even if there were provincial regulations, the federal government could intervene in criminal cases if, for example, an assault had taken place. Hockey is heavily regulated in Quebec. However, if someone were seriously injured during a fight and the referee's report indicated assault, the federal government could intervene under the Criminal Code of Canada even though Quebec has regulations governing hockey.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, speedways are also regulated. However, if a driver deliberately hit a stopped car during a race, for example, the Criminal Code authorizes intervention. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quoted Mr. Valiquet to show that there was no encroachment on provincial jurisdiction. This is clearly federal jurisdiction. This bill works alongside provincial jurisdiction and does not contradict it. That is what I meant.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my hometown of Hamilton, particularly in the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78549,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78549&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</A> area, this bill has raised some concerns and questions. In the local Tim Hortons while sitting down with some friends I was asked if street racing meant operating a motor vehicle in a race with at least one other motor vehicle on a road, street, highway or other public place. That was quite straightforward, but they got a little concerned when I went on to explain that anyone who by criminal negligence caused death to another person while street racing would be guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life. The response came back, “Is criminal negligence causing death not already in our Criminal Code?” They also asked why would the government want to do this?</div>
    </p><a name="Para122212"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the persons I was sitting with had a life experience that troubled me greatly when he related it to me. As a young man of 19 years of age in the province of Nova Scotia he was riding in a car one night with some friends. He did not know the driver well. He was offered the opportunity to drive the car, which he did. He ultimately wound up being pulled over by the police. He was the only one who was caught in a stolen vehicle. Part of the common code was that one does not rat one's friends, so he did not. He wound up in penitentiary and the first night he was there, he was assaulted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I raise this in the context of this legislation is a warning that came from those good citizens in the coffee shop about what potential there is for damaging our young people by sending them off to prison for partaking in what they see as innocent fun, but we all know absolutely that it is not innocent fun.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you believe that this legislation will meet the test of actually getting street racing off the street, or is it only an answer to a hot political question?</div>

It is a highly relevant question. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind hon. members that the bill does not specify what would happen if just one person raced for the fun of it. There has to be at least two cars for this bill to apply. That is debatable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the point made by the hon. member is concerned, this goes back to the debate on minimum sentences. I was wondering about that too, as I mentioned earlier in my speech. The judge needs to be given some latitude. I believe strongly in personalized justice with a case-by-case approach. The judge has the necessary knowledge for giving a ruling with a view to protecting the public and the individual's rights. In that sense, the question should be asked, especially when the hon. member gives the example of a young man who was inadvertently involved in an auto theft committed by his neighbour. The neighbour told the young man to drive the car, but failed to tell him the car was stolen. This poses a problem. The judge is in a good position to give a balanced ruling. If there is a minimum sentence, then the judge no longer has any choice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could even decide to acquit the accused because a five-year sentence would seem unreasonable.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member is right to ask these questions. I look forward to discussing this at greater length in committee.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who exploit and abuse their privilege to drive a motor vehicle by engaging in street racing demonstrate contempt for our laws, and more significantly, contempt for their fellow citizens.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets and roads in our cities and provinces are a shared public resource, to be used and enjoyed by all of our citizens. The increasing incidence of street racing is turning the pavement into race tracks, but without all of the necessary elements that are found at all legal racing facilities. As a result, too many innocent bystanders are dying or being seriously injured. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we do not yet have any comprehensive statistics on the prevalence of street racing in Canada, or on the exact number of related deaths or injuries, there is sufficient evidence to confirm the seriousness of the situation. Such incidents causing death or serious injury are happening across the country. Just in the past three months, for example, we have read:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June near Campbell River, British Columbia, two 18-year-old girls were allegedly involved in a street race which ended in the death of one of the drivers and serious injuries to two of her passengers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in June in Merritt, British Columbia, two 24-year-old men died and two innocent motorists were seriously injured in what is a suspected case of street racing.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July in Winnipeg, Manitoba, two drivers were charged with street racing and had their vehicles impounded when they were caught racing at speeds of more than 165 kilometres per hour.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few weeks ago in Mississauga, Ontario, a foreign exchange student was killed when the vehicle he was driving careened into a hydro pole after it was hit from behind, allegedly as a direct result of street racing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are only some of the most recent examples. Innocent victims who have died as a result of street racing in the past several years include a couple strolling on the sidewalk after celebrating their wedding anniversary, an RCMP constable on patrol, a 29-year-old mother out driving, and an immigrant taxi driver just days away from his citizenship ceremony.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one am saddened and outraged by these incidents, the reckless trend that is behind them and the frightening prospect of more to come. These senseless tragic deaths and serious injuries were all preventable and together make clear the call for a tough response. We simply cannot allow such carnage to continue.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para122244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These crimes continue to occur and the current government is determined to give more leverage to those responsible for law enforcement in order that they may respond to this crime effectively. The provinces have sentences in their jurisdictions, including fines, licence suspensions and impounding vehicles, which hit the wallets of the offenders. Nonetheless, when money is not a driving force, such measures do little to deter street racers from adopting this irresponsible and often deadly behaviour.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important to send a strong message about the seriousness of this offence, by criminalizing such behaviour and creating serious consequences for the crime. The consequences in this bill establish a system for determining a fair and appropriate sentence based on the seriousness of these crimes, namely a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison for bodily harm and a maximum of life in prison for causing death.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentencing system is enhanced in an appropriate manner by gradually increased mandatory driving suspensions, starting with a minimum suspension of one year for a first offence up to a life suspension for three convictions for street racing not resulting in death or bodily harm.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that these measures are necessary given the frequency and serious outcome of tragic accidents that could be avoided and too often are the result of street racing.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to the Criminal Code, as well as other government initiatives to tackle crime, will improve the safety of our streets by putting citizens more at ease when exercising their right to use our public spaces without fear of bodily harm or death caused by behaviour completely lacking in common sense.</div>

If not, what are some of the other things that can be done?</div>
    </p><a name="Para122251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the debate today has been around the fact that we have not looked at the full scope of how to attack the problem of street racing. I mentioned my concern about advertising, which is a concern shared by some of my colleagues. What are we doing vis-à-vis advertising? The response I received to that question was that we could not legislate what goes into Hollywood movies. I simply was pointing to the fact that some of the movies glorify street racing and that is something we should probably address. We cannot ban or censor movies but we can acknowledge the fact that they are a factor in street racing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something we can do and something that should be looked at is regulating advertising. We do have standards for advertising and we should look at those standards. As a member who is concerned about this issue, I would like to know what the member's feelings are about prevention. What can we do beyond this bill? I think most people would acknowledge that a law does not change behaviour in and of itself. We know other things can be done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the role of those who change cars from being regular vehicles that take us from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> to being street racing cars? This might be an underground business but we know we can find places that will soup up a car in an afternoon. How do we deal with this kind of thing? Is there something we can do as legislators in that area?</div>

There is education and advertising. We need to send a message to the public that street racing is not acceptable, both from a legal perspective and from society's perspective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill outlines that we want street racing to be a criminal act. I would ask people to picture in their mind what might be going on before a street race actually takes place. People might be milling around. Two cars might be on the street. The drivers themselves are probably thinking they can handle the speeding ticket and the demerits. They certainly do not intend to wound or kill anybody. In their mind they do not see the penalties being that grave. They think they can deal with the penalties should they happen to be caught. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one of the reasons that we want to break street racing out on its own. We want to tell people that it is a criminal activity. We want to let them know by advertising, by education and with the passing of this bill into law that it is a criminal activity. It is our hope that this will pass through their minds and dissuade them from street racing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe the bill would give our police an additional tool with which to act against people who are street racing. I believe our police officers need this sort of law to help them protect public safety. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the bill, our government is committed to hiring more RCMP and police officers and working with communities. We want to ensure there are more police officers on the ground to help enforce a law such as this.</div>

The difficulty is that there is no distinction between street racing and other forms of dangerous driving or criminal negligence. We want to create a separate offence in the Criminal Code that will specifically denounce street racing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street racing is a very defined activity. Reckless driving can occur but then there is street racing. In street racing one decides to participate in a street race. One decides that one will drive one's car as fast as possible in order to win whatever might be on the table. We want to basically separate this out from other dangerous driving type of offences in order to protect the public.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my speech I listed some instances that have occurred recently and in past years where Canadian citizens have either been very gravely wounded or have actually died from street racing or alleged incidents of street racing. One of the reasons we want to protect Canadians from street racing is that it is a definable activity that is actually taking place on Canadian streets today. Having this activity hidden in among dangerous driving charges is not protecting Canadian citizens.</div>

We have seen very tragic results that have come about as a result of this kind of negligent and dangerous behaviour.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is on the preventive side. Throughout time, young people and people of all ages have been interested in tuning vehicles and in altering them in engineering terms. Some of us have gone and seen with great pride what people are capable of doing in terms of their innovative engineering capacities. Those are positive things but the outlet they have to then demonstrate what that capability is, is almost non-existent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Law enforcement agencies are working, for example, around Mosport, and they are providing opportunities now for these young people, in a positive way, to go off the street onto the track to demonstrate their capabilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member see that as a positive way of managing what has become a very serious issue? Is the government looking at any kinds of programs in cooperation with law enforcement agencies, service organizations and others that are now attempting to bridge a very profound social problem with some positive outlets that in fact would be even more than a deterrent? They would take those young people and get them into very positive endeavours around a sport that has been recognized over time.</div>

It is similar but not identical to a previous bill that was adopted in the House, as we all know, at second reading.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122279"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of “street racing” and criminalizing street racing is a legislative attempt to criminalize an area of activity that had fallen below, no pun intended, the radar screen in the Criminal Code. Provincial highway traffic acts quasi-criminalize reckless driving and careless driving, but in the Criminal Code the mischievous conduct, the criminal conduct, usually begins at the low threshold that is called dangerous driving. Some forms of that may actually work their way up into criminal negligence or what used to be called motor manslaughter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122280"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in order to apply the Criminal Code now, we actually have to get some kind of incident, some kind of damage, some kind of bad thing happening as a result of the reckless, careless, dangerous or criminally negligent driving.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speeding, of course, is a crime. One could ask, do our speeding laws not cover road racing? They do, but the problem with simple speeding, if I can put it that way, where there is no injury, damage or death, is that those circumstances usually require a police officer or a radar trap to be there in order to get the evidence to convict for speeding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a road racing scenario, generally speaking, we probably would not need radar. We might need to have a policeman or some other evidence of the race, but we would not have the need to record the actual speed. We would not need to have a police car chasing the racers. A visual observance of a street race would probably be sufficient to get us into an offence territory and into at least the laying of a charge.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will leave the evidentiary stuff, but it is clear that police across the country have been frustrated with this kind of problem. To now push the Criminal Code down into that territory is probably going to help them enforce a bit more order on the streets where racing has been a problem. It is not necessarily a problem across the country, but it seems to pop up in regions. There have been some very serious implications as a result of the racing that does go on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to move into some technical areas, having said very clearly that I support the initiative. I want to direct my attention and remarks to some technical aspects of the bill, because I think most bills, like this one, need a bit of a tweak, a bit of an adjustment, as they go through committee and the House. I am going to suggest a few areas in which the bill may be inadequate or may have a problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one has to do with the definition of “street racing”. As I read it, I note that it is really quite simple. The bill states that “street racing means operating a motor vehicle in a race with at least one other motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is okay as it stands, but as I read it, it seems to include what we would call road-rallying. There are organized sport road rallies around the country. People do this quite legally. They do not usually do this in the city, but sometimes they do. This is usually done in a rural area. These drivers use public roads and highways for the road rally. It is essentially a race. The rally drivers are released once every couple of minutes or five minutes. There is a race. It is clocked.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to me that the definition we are using in the bill may criminalize an area of conduct that we just call road-rallying. There are probably hundreds or thousands of road rally enthusiasts out there across the country who may have a concern about this. The bill as it is written now does not exempt this type of organized sport rally activity and seems to criminalize it.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720">(1720)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para122288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area I will call the Formula One road racing, the very highly organized sport racing that happens with professional drivers. Sometimes it happens on a track, but other times it happens on portions of streets and roads in a city or a location where streets and roads have been blocked off, closed or otherwise. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could argue that if one blocks off the city street that is being used for the Formula One race, it is no longer a public street. It is not really a street any more as it has been blocked off and closed. I suppose I could accept that, but the definition also uses the term “or other public place”. It seems to me that the middle of a city with blocked off streets may still be a “public place”, although there may not be a street. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the House and the committee are going to have to look at that to make sure that very justifiable routine Canadian participation in these motor sport events is protected, be it the professional speed driving that happens on tracks or in Formula One racing or similar type sports or road rallying.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing I want to discuss has already been mentioned. There is probably not a solution to this. The definition does not deal with a solo race against the clock. I do not know how often that happens. A solo race against the clock is certainly speeding, but we are back into the evidentiary issues that I referred to earlier. If there is not a race with another car or with more than two cars, this bill would not criminalize it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thing I want to mention is that the bill quite properly sets out penalties for different levels of damage or harm done as a result of the road racing. It also creates motor vehicle licence suspension periods that escalate upward depending on the seriousness. It seems to me as I read it that it is not clear when a second offence occurs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When someone is convicted a second or third time of this type of offence, there is an escalating penalty, but because the road racing offence is broken down into four or five different parts, it is not clear whether, if someone is convicted of one part and subsequently charged and convicted of a second part of the bill, it constitutes a second road racing offence. It is the way the offences are described in the bill. If it is our intention to have a second or third component of the same Criminal Code prohibition constitute a second offence, then I believe we are going to have to say it much more clearly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing I want to say is again fairly technical. As I mentioned earlier, the bill criminalizes simple road racing. I would describe that as being on the lower end of anti-social conduct. At times it can produce horrendous results. Speeding is simply bad. I am not saying it is ever good, but speeding recklessly, carelessly, dangerously and criminally negligently is a serious problem. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill begins by addressing street racing where it has not reached the threshold of criminal negligence or dangerous driving. It is conceptually not clear to me what our intent is when the road racing activity crosses into this other threshold. It is not clear to me which offence is intended to apply.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725">(1725)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para122296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in fact a clear dangerous driving scenario evolved out of a road racing scenario, then it is not clear to me which statute should apply when the police lay charges. In my head, I think it creates some potential double jeopardy scenarios. It might not, but I would like to be able to canvass that further. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the assumption the bill is adopted at second reading here, I would like to address with more precision the actual legislative intent for road racing which at the same time would constitute criminally negligent driving or dangerous driving under Criminal Code offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are my remarks on the technical side.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will close by reiterating that I do recognize, as I think all colleagues in the House do, that street racing is a very serious and potentially dangerous form of activity from place to place. It is quite appropriate for the Criminal Code to reach out, proscribe it and allow our police to do their job in reducing the instances of this right across the country.</div>

There has been some discussion this afternoon about the bill's definition of street racing. The bill defines street racing as “operating a motor vehicle in a race with at least one other motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member addressed some of the issues he saw coming out of that. I wonder if he might also address the fact that there are different kinds of street racing. I do not have the popular vernacular to describe them all. There is the sort of drag race we are all familiar with and which directly involves two vehicles, but I gather that there is also a trend to timed races, where people race to a certain location and whoever gets there first is declared the winner in this bizarre sport. There are also situations that are just time trials, where whoever gets to the location runs a certain course in a certain period. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122302"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he see that this definition would cover those aspects of street racing? Or is this something that is missing from the current proposal?</div>

I think this is the same definition that was included in the previous bill in the previous Parliament. On the face of this bill, the definition only includes a circumstance where there is at least one more car involved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what if the other car happens to leave the starting point 60 seconds later or five minutes later or starts at a location remote from where the first car is? Let us say that one car starts from the Petro-Canada service station at one end of the road and the other car starts from the beer store on the other side of town. Is that two cars racing? I am going to leave that to the hon. member, in all his wisdom, to figure out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122305"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might come within the ambit of the definition in that it may in fact have two cars, but it is not clear to me that police who would investigate and prosecute would be fully able to present the evidence that there were in fact two cars involved in a race if the police were in only one location. I think that is probably a subject that would warrant further discussion at committee to try to better capture the legislative intent of the bill.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the issues that has come up is that this bill's approach to the problem of street racing is to deal with it through the penal system, as it were, but it really does not add anything to the approach in terms of prevention and providing the tools to the jurisdictional authorities who have to enforce these laws under the Criminal Code.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the member would care to comment on whether or not part of the solution here, and maybe part of any bill dealing with street racing, should in fact address the prevention measures that would be most appropriate to dealing with this as opposed to simply relying solely on deterrence measures.</div>

The bill, on the face of it, does not make an attempt to go out and deal with the deterrents or public education in a direct way. There is hardly a time in my life that I cannot recall a story about one, two, three or more young people in a car, which was involved in some kind of a street race, who were not seriously injured or killed. This seems to happen every few years in a very conspicuous way at some place across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122310"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have enough information to answer the member's question properly. The member has raised the point about whether this new law allow police to intervene in a more robust way in communities across the country. Will the bill encourage cities, towns and councillors to perhaps make some place available for racing automobiles, such as an automobile track? </div>
    </p><a name="Para122311"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am assuming that most of the people driving quickly in these road racing scenarios are people under 30 years of age. There could be some older gents and ladies involved as well. The government is trying to send a message to the people, who would drive in this fashion, to look for ways to cause them to rethink their ways and find safer ways to carry on their driving competitions.</div>

Beyond what the government perceives the bill as being, which is something that will deal with the concerns around street racing, does the member see another way of dealing with it? We have talked about prevention, and that is fine. Are there other mechanisms that he can see available to us as legislators to confront the whole issue of street racing? I am sure he has pondered some ideas, and I am interested in hearing some.</div>

In many areas involving social legislation such as health and welfare, the provinces have a role to play and it interfaces with our education system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Health Canada, from the federal jurisdiction, invests Canadian taxpayer money in dealing with the war against drugs. Anti-smoking campaigns were very visible, and still are, with I believe a fair bit of federal money involved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licensing of driving is very much a provincial matter as is education. Many of the drivers testing the limits of their automobiles seem to be young, but they are not the only offenders, and I understand that. If the bill is passed, and I hope it is, collaboration between the federal government, the National Crime Prevention Council and provincial authorities, which have an interest in educating young people about the real world, the risk of death and injury to themselves and others, I hope might take place and it might produce some salutary benefits.</div>

We see it in a number of places. We certainly see it in advertising. One current campaign features a young boy saying “zoom, zoom, zoom” as his car speeds by. This is one aspect of that kind of advertising.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the advertisers have also seen the concern about the kind of culture they are displaying in their ads. They now put a disclaimer on the screen that these activities are happening on a closed circuit. Clearly, the idea of liability is occurring to them in terms of the kind of speed they are promoting. However, we also see it in movies, in car chases, in the kinds of video games we have and in the whole culture of extreme sports, where risk taking seems to have an extra heavy round of glorification these days.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does he see street racing fitting into that and how do we address those kinds of cultural aspects of street racing, which are not really addressed in this legislation?</div>

That was an automobile manufacturer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122321"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am saying this a little bit tongue-in-cheek, but if we are thinking about putting warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers, maybe we should have warning labels on speedometers of automobiles. There are a lot of perky, fast automobiles out there that are quite capable of killing someone very quickly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member is alluding to, the sooner we get to that issue we will all be better off, and I think the automobile manufacturers may have a role to play in that.</div>

He sat in our caucus when I first came here. He was quite a bolster for issues concerning youth justice and was very passionate about many of those issues. I know he had tried on previous occasions to bring forward bills regarding street racing, but due to concerns of the previous government with some provisions in the bill, it never came to pass in the form of a private member's bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is a great to see the issue of street racing finally being addressed by an amendment to the Criminal Code. It deserves significant attention. Finally, we have the chance for some serious debate. Hopefully, it will receive a speedy passage, especially in the memory of Mr. Cadman as well as us doing something in this place to protect our youth and deter this kind of activity as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have heard some different questions. A Liberal member asked about community initiatives and what our government was doing to support these initiatives. I will share an example of an initiative in Edmonton. It has been an incredibly successful program. However, first I will give an overview, as many of my colleagues have done, of the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> would amend the Criminal Code to create a new offence of street racing, which would be defined to mean “operating a motor vehicle in a race with at least one other motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed offence of street racing would reference the existing offences of dangerous driving and criminal negligence, including cases of dangerous driving and criminal negligence causing bodily harm or death. In practical terms, this means that there will be unique penalties for those convicted of dangerous driving or criminal negligence offences in street racing situations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the creation of a specific street racing offence in this manner is a balanced and measured response, which will serve as a strong deterrent to a senseless and disturbing crime. One of the key things we have to remember, in creating this change to the Criminal Code, is that it sends a clear message, something that has been missing in the Criminal Code with regard to this problem, to street racers that this is not a glamorous game, but a serious crime with serious consequences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> would amend the Criminal Code to include tougher penalties for those convicted of street racing crimes. Currently those convicted of dangerous driving causing bodily harm are subject to a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. Those convicted of dangerous driving causing death face a maximum of 14 years in prison. Bill C-19 proposes key reforms in this area by increasing the penalties available for these offences in street racing situations to 14 years and life imprisonment respectively.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> also proposes important reforms to ensure that those who would abuse the privilege of operating a motor vehicle are prohibited from getting back behind the wheel for a longer period of time. Canadians do not want those convicted of street racing crimes to be able to simply get back behind the wheel and thereby place more innocent people at risk.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory driving prohibitions are an appropriate deterrent to this type of crime. A mandatory minimum driving prohibition of one year would exist for those convicted of a street racing crime and in instances where the person has been previously convicted of a street racing offence, the mandatory minimums would go up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are some of the key reforms and the thrust of the changes to the Criminal Code. I have had nothing but positive correspondence on the change to the Criminal Code from groups across the country that are working with youth and law enforcement officials. Many people have said this is long overdue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will share, in particular, a program that is in place in Edmonton. The constable who is in charge of the program has shared his thoughts and has said that we are basically on the right track in finally dealing with this problem.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745">(1745)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para122335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many communities across Canada, Edmonton has also been affected by this trend. One of the central challenges with this problem is that kids think racing is cool. Who can blame them? It involves fast cars and an interesting lifestyle. They watch races on TV often as a sport. It is an attractive thing to many. The difference is that drag racers also know that racing on the streets is not only illegal, it is dangerous. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the challenge becomes getting young people to listen. How do we get them to change their minds on this? Edmonton has demonstrated impressive leadership in responding to the problem. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reference Constable Mike Wynnyk and his team of other police officers in Edmonton who recognized the danger of this particular problem and started doing something about it almost 10 years ago. They developed an impressive local program through the Edmonton police service to reach out to youth not only to educate and inform them about the dangers of illegal street racing but also to provide them with legal alternatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harnessing his love of racing and his own experience of totalling cars unfortunately in dangerous accidents before joining the police force, Constable Wynnyk assembled Edmonton's street legal project to build and tour police race cars to local schools, trade shows, conventions, shopping malls, community events, and motor sport events to show kids that a love of racing should not mean street racing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the generous support of industry partners who donated parts and vehicles, Constable Wynnyk and the Edmonton street legal team have assembled an impressive police racer that they use for demonstrations across the city. The vehicles and Wynnyk's own passion for racing immediately capture the attention of youth at risk of participating in illegal street racing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By building a credible relationship with young people, he and the rest of the street legal team enhance traffic safety by encouraging responsible motoring among young drivers, which is something crucial in trying to prevent this problem. They motivate youth to stay in school by providing a practical application for math and science education through legal drag racing. He said it was very exciting to watch the students get excited about practical math problems in calculating certain speeds for racing. It has a positive effect on their education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their program, they encourage self-respect and leadership among youth through team work and a positive relationship with police officers. That is something that should be commended. Those type of officers not only do law enforcement as their job but they are getting out in the community and building trust with our youth who often are a little skeptical of law enforcement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By encouraging youth to learn about the dangers of illegal street racing and holding illegal demonstrations at local racetracks, the Edmonton police force has built a credible working relationship with young people interested in racing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result has been a resounding success. Constable Wynnyk and the Edmonton street legal team have a positive relationship with local racing groups like Edmonton's 780 Tuners who openly denounce street racing and encourage their members to work with local police to ensure safe racing at the tracks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the members asked what sort of support the government has received for these sort of programs, or what sort of initiatives exist. Our government has committed $20 million to crime prevention initiatives, so that the causes of crime are addressed, particularly among our youth. Obviously, we need to support initiatives by Constable Wynnyk and his team in Edmonton who have had a profound effect on youth in deterring this sort of activity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly enough, when talking with Constable Wynnyk, he expressed how ecstatic he was that the government was finally doing something to beef up the problem that existed in the Criminal Code and that the government was supporting the work that he and his team are doing on the ground. It is a great relief to him and others who have been working so hard that the government has recognized the need to beef up the Criminal Code to more than dangerous driving that currently exists in the Criminal Code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what we have done in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> with the changes that we have proposed. This bill would beef up those types of provisions in the Criminal Code to deter this sort of activity. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1750"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750">(1750)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para122347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That way we can support the efforts of our law enforcement personnel, those who sacrifice on a daily basis their time, their energy, and their effort not only to enforce the law but to work with those groups who are often unfortunately attracted to this type of behaviour and unfortunately this sort of conduct of street racing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is abundantly clear to those who have been working on these particular issues, and I know many of our colleagues in the House have been working on issues of improving current criminal justice provisions and helping those to do their job on the streets, that this is long overdue. It needs to have speedy passage through the House, so that we all can finally support the work of those in the communities and to put serious teeth, as Constable Wynnyk mentioned, by beefing up the Criminal Code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this manner we can in fact deter the activity of youth who are attracted to this and obviously encourage them to look at the legal means to get involved with racing which would be on tracks rather than on our streets where they pose a threat not only to themselves but to innocent Canadians and many others who unfortunately can get affected by dangerous and reckless driving.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage all members to think about this very seriously, to do the right thing, and support the changes that we are proposing in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I think the parliamentary secretary advised the House earlier, the courts already take into account aggravating circumstances when we look at the current offences under the Criminal Code. They are: dangerous operation causing bodily harm, dangerous operation causing death, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and criminal negligence causing death.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is basically saying that the courts do not take into account the aggravating factor of being not only a violation of the Criminal Code but an aggravating factor of in fact being involved in street racing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does he believe that maybe the bill should have provided for greater resources for the kinds of activities that he relayed in his speech on the preventative side?</div>

    </p><a name="Para122357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raises an important point that I tried to make clear in my presentation. When it comes to the actual issue of prevention and education, it may not in fact be part of this bill. This bill tries to support those in the field, and I tried to clarify that, who are engaged in prevention and education. It would give them the teeth to actually continue on with their work on the legal side. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122358"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member appropriately quoted the current Criminal Code where there are obviously separate offences relating to dangerous driving. The concern was and we felt we had to beef up the provisions to create a separate Criminal Code offence specifically for street racing. The legal community itself has called for the beefing up of this provision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, we are extending the measure to give it more teeth specifically with street racing. As I mentioned, there was the example of Constable Wynnyk and the work that he and others are doing. This in fact helps to extend the education and prevention work that they are doing by giving it more teeth. This is why it was requested.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122360"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member also mentioned the issue of funding. I cited the $20 million in our budget to look at supporting these sorts of initiatives for crime prevention in our community. It will not be in this bill because obviously it is a change to the Criminal Code, but on the fiscal side in the budget we had attributed some extra money for this sort of initiative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked whether we had faith in judges to come up with stiffer sentences resulting from people who are charged with street racing. All this does, in essence, is send a clear message, especially from our legislators, as I said, in support of the law enforcement community. The maximum punishments for dangerous driving causing bodily harm and criminal negligence causing bodily harm would remove the current requirement of 10 to 14 years under that previous dangerous driving causing death provision to 14 years to life. This proposal also provides minimum driving prohibitions, as I mentioned already, that increase on a subsequent offence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All it does is give more teeth to our law enforcement in sending the message that this is not acceptable and makes it clear as well for judges when they are giving out the particular sentences. When reading judgments, it makes it very specific and clear as to what type of punishments should be available for those who street race.</div>

There are five very serious charges that carry very serious penalties, from 10 to 14 years maximum penalties, even a life maximum penalty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122365"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the possibility of driving prohibitions from three to five years to a lifetime driving prohibition. Those provisions are already there. Maybe the member could comment on why the enforcement has not happened? What is it that has prevented law enforcement officials from actually charging people and getting them through the court system on the kinds of serious charges that are already in the Criminal Code? I would appreciate hearing his comment on that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122366"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to ask him a question about why manufacturers continue to build cars that can travel at speeds of 180 to 200 kilometres an hour, probably double the highest speed limit on any Canadian highway? Does he think there should be measures taken to ensure that vehicles are not capable of reaching those speeds and still meeting the needs of Canadians who need to travel by car? I wonder if he could comment on both of those important issues.</div>

    </p><a name="Para122368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will address his first comment relating to charges and why in fact this needs to be changed; if already the provisions exist within the Criminal Code, why would we have to strengthen them? As I mentioned, with regard to the judgments that have been read, it is not just the current government that is calling for the changes, law enforcement officers across the country have said that there seems to be a problem with the actual judgments being handed down for those who are engaging in the activity of street racing. What can we do in essence to respond to that, to make it tougher, to give more teeth within the law to send the message? </div>
    </p><a name="Para122369"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making this change sends a clear message, especially in the cases where people are charged with this particular behaviour, that the judgments need to be severe, that they need to be bumped up and that they need to have a mandatory minimum. That is exactly what we are trying to do by introducing Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>, to strengthen those particular aspects of the mandatory minimums and to have, hopefully, judges enforce them once the change is made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where the law enforcement community especially feels let down. While they go through the trouble of apprehending these offenders, the actual judgments do not reflect the type of penalties that are required in order to deter this sort of behaviour. It is not just us calling for this; it is law enforcement officers, those who are working, Constable Wynnyk, for example. We need to give them the support in the judgments after people are charged with these type of offences. This is why we have recommended that this particular provision be strengthened.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122371"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague raised the issue of vehicles and speed. I am not an engineer by any stretch of the imagination so I cannot get into some of the arguments of why cars are built with certain speed limits and some are not and why that sort of speed is needed. Obviously there is a significant part of the industry that is related to legal street racing and cars that legally race and train. Clearly there is a need for cars to be built with engines that can exceed certain speeds. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. member has issue with the current speed limits on current vehicles on the roads, maybe he would like to make some proposals as to what we could do to address that or perhaps he could take it up with the vehicle manufacturers directly. It might be a particular issue with which he would want to deal.</div>

It is a concern everywhere. It is of particular concern in those communities that have seen a number of deaths as a result of street racing in the last two or three years. Certainly it is a concern in the lower mainland of British Columbia. It is important that we are having this debate today, to raise questions about what is appropriate and how we can end the pain and suffering that we see throughout the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122374"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lower mainland, there are two families that I know well who have family members who have died because of street racing. The family member was not behind the wheel of a car that was street racing, but was killed while crossing the road on foot or was in another car which was hit by another car that was street racing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that I have heard people say about street racing, “Well, there are a lot of hormones in young men and young women and everybody likes speed and the impulse takes over”. If they were speeding maybe, but street racing is planned. In most of the situations in the lower mainland people had actually planned the street race. They called each other and set up a time and a place. It is not simply happenstance. I do worry about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worry also about this as an individual bill. Many people have been saying for quite some time that the Criminal Code in general needs an overhaul. This one aspect on street racing has been singled out and put in a bill. I would suggest that probably many more people are killed as a result of dangerous driving, by one car speeding, not racing, but we have not lifted that item out and said that we would deal with it differently. I would feel more comfortable if this were coming forward in a different context, in a more omnibus approach to changing the Criminal Code and updating a number of aspects that need to be addressed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought about the purpose. I understand the purpose as the bill is written. Some people would suggest it is a deterrent, maybe an educational one. Or is it a singular response to one issue that would be better dealt with in a larger way, say with all actions that have to do with the dangerous operation of a car? Street racing is only one of many.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122378"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of legislation reminds me of when a particular province passed a piece of legislation on stalking either women or men; there were more women being stalked at that time, but it had to do with stalking, period. Stalking could have been dealt with legislation that was already in existence, but because the issue of stalking was very much on people's minds, it was dealt with as a single piece of legislation, knowing there was already in legislation ways to deal with that kind of a crime. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805">(1805)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para122379"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my colleagues asked the question, and it is one which I am asking myself, if there is already legislation in place, why are judges not using it? We asked that about stalking as well. I truly do not understand. Judges have a fairly wide range of choices when someone charged with street racing comes before them. Many of the choices can be very restrictive. If that is the case, then why are we hearing so much about street racers receiving ankle bracelets and house arrest? We hear that they can leave to go to school and then return home, et cetera. I am very puzzled as to why that legislation is not being used. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122380"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some things we need to consider in the debate around this legislation. One of them certainly is the issue of resources. In Richmond, B.C. there are tracts of highway, at least in the Lower Mainland, that are more likely to be used for street racing than others. In Richmond there is a very long straight stretch of highway. We have had a number of street racing tragedies in Richmond.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122381"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also heard the Richmond, B.C. chief of police say that he thinks they are getting at that, but while they are addressing that problem, the police are not answering other calls. They do not have enough resources to place officers along that stretch of road where street racing occurs and to answer the other calls that come in from people who need police attention. The issue of resources is a very critical one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122382"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my community of Surrey the police are already stretched beyond what they are able to do. It always becomes a choice of which crime is more important, which call is the more important one. I would not want to be the person who has to make that decision. I may make the wrong decision and someone's life may be lost. The resource issue is a very important one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122383"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some ways Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> is limited in terms of what it addresses. I am not arguing that street racing is not a very serious crime and has not been treated as a very serious crime. Absolutely, but I would refer to some of the things that people raised earlier. It is important for me to acknowledge that drinking and driving still happens. It happens less, but it still happens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122384"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mothers Against Drunk Driving, except it is mothers, fathers and all kinds of people, but MADD has had an extremely successful impact in its approach to reduce drunk driving and make sure that people are dealt with differently and are more aware of what could happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the issue of driving too quickly and drunk driving, there is a hospital in Cranbrook where high school students visit the hospital morgue. It is scary, but the students are not necessarily there when something is going on. The students are not there to see an autopsy. They are fairly young high school students. Simply being in a morgue after what is seen on television is a pretty scary experience. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810">(1810)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para122386"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know how many people have ever been to a morgue but, as someone who comes from a nursing background, just being in an empty morgue is pretty chilling. Because of this program in Cranbrook, the community has seen a decrease in the number of teenagers who are drinking and driving, as well as speeding they think. It is not the same as street racing, but it does talk about the importance of the educative factor with young teens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122387"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The health community and the education community are working together to solve a problem that is killing or maiming the future of our communities. They did not wait for the police or someone else to solve the problem. They looked for partners and actually found corporate partners to provide written materials and other materials around this to start educating teenagers in the same way we have tried to do around smoking and other things that are negatively affecting young people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education, obviously, needs to include the police force. I think teenagers, in particular, hear things differently from the police than from a doctor or nurse or someone in the school system. By putting those partners together who are willing to do this education means we can pick the right people for the right audience.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess there is the strategy to having young women or young men who have been caught street racing going into high schools and talking to students. I do not know a lot of street racers. I have only met the ones involved in programs. However, the ones whose friends were killed while they were street racing had a very important message and they were sincere in their message. They were not doing it as part of community hours or whatever. They were doing it because they wanted the 13 to 17 year olds to personally know the effect this has had, not just on them but on their friend's mom, dad, aunt, uncle, nana, grandad and a circle of friends. When one person dies in this kind of incident sometimes 20, 30 or 40 people are pretty directly impacted by it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see the time where we do not have to debate a bill like this and I think that will happen with the kind of education that happens in communities. I do not mean that we should not be debating it today but I would like to look at the root cause, not just the crime, so we can reduce and, hopefully, eliminate street racing. I do not want us to be dealing with this again in five years time because we were not able to reach our younger people and stop them from getting into this position in the first place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122391"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to mention my grandson who I usually manage to mention in some speech. He is 11 years old now. Every time he came to stay with me when he was younger, his mom would send along a long list of things he could not watch. She listed 10, 20, whatever it was, things. I understand the effect television, movies and video games have on young people. They see car races as fun. Some video games have car races where the kids get 20 points if they knock the other car into the ditch because they went faster or they were able to cut them off. I cannot believe that does not have an impact on the actions of a six or seven year old when they are older.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard others ask about car manufacturers and advertising. If we look at car advertising, it says that if we buy this car it will go from 0 to 60 in 10 seconds or whatever and that is really cool. It is always a nice silver, sporty looking car and it is played as a positive to get there that quickly. If that is what we continue to see then we need to have an affect on advertisers as well because that is what our children see. Even if they are watching a perfectly acceptable television program, not everybody mutes the advertising or puts their hands over the eyes of their young children while the car manufacturers brag about how fast their cars go.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other important question was whether we need cars to go that fast. Police cars, yes, but does every car we buy need to go 200 kilometres an hour? Given that the speed range in our province is 100 kilometres an hour, and it varies from province to province, I do not know if I need to buy a car that goes 200 kilometres an hour.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important bill to be debating and it is an important time to be doing it. Many people who have had sons or daughters die, either as passengers in the car, as drivers or as someone who has been hit by a car, are watching very carefully. They are suffering pain and they have made their voices heard. If they had not been heard, we would not be here debating it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the best solution? I am sure the solution is multiple but we need to know what the best actions are to take.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested in the debate that is going on currently and will continue to go on. I am glad that my son could only afford a car that was 15 years old and did not go very fast. He did not get the graduation present that others did. A lot of young people who graduate receive fancy new cars that look like they were made to be driven quickly. Maybe parents need to think a little bit when they buy these types of cars.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a real issue in the Lower Mainland in British Columbia. Many people know someone who has been involved in just such an event.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would encourage us to think about whether there are other bills that we should also be looking at to make a more omnibus change to the Criminal Code, which people have been calling for, and to think about the community partners that must be involved in supporting this in order to have a reduction in the community, not only to have legislation but to encourage our community partners to come forward, the health system, the education system, the police system, and work with us as a group, not on individual initiatives, although those are fine too, but in a group to see what we can do so that we are not standing here debating exactly this bill in five years' time, that we will have reached those young people, as we have with alcohol and smoking, and be able to reduce that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was intrigued by her comments about the design of cars. She is absolutely correct. Many of the cars in the market today are especially attractive to youth. They are designed to look fast and go fast.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could she comment on whether there is a role for the federal government to legislate some kinds of controls on cars, which would prevent them from going above a certain speed, to ensure that these kinds of street races do not happen on our streets?</div>

However, I need to look at some of the implications. I have seen what has happened to the car industry. Trying to implement something like that would seem pretty challenging, given what has happened over the last few weeks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122403"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I believe the government has a regulatory role to play. Car manufacturers have put alarm systems, immobilizers, et cetera in cars as a result of pressure and in some places as a result of regulation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She identified an area in her community and talked about prevention? Could she comment on that? She talked about some examples in terms of drunken driving.

With regard to the educative parts of what is happening in the community, I see young people whose friends either have been significantly physically injured or have died in street racing. They are not racers themselves. They are young people who are concerned enough about it to be holding community forums on it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para122408"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several high schools have held community forums on street racing and what should happen. These young people are teenagers, so their views are quite black and white. They are on this side or that side. They are not very blended, but they have very strong opinions about this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kind of debate that engenders is a really important factor in their high schools, because young people have a chance to stand up, give their opinions, think about it and hear from other youth who are not street racing but who are concerned about what it is doing to their friends or the families of their friends.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched the televised funeral of a young man who had been killed in a street race. There must have been at least 150 to 200 people there, for what is a very small high school. It mattered very much to those youths that something tragic had happened. That is in part what motivated them to have high school debates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122411"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no idea what the police requirements are, I have to say. I would suggest there are times when they may need to go faster, and we know that, although we have also seen a lot of debate about when police chases should be cut off, based on the speed the police cars are going. There is a safety factor at which they will call off the chase because the speed is so dangerous to other people who may be near them. I do not know what the specific needs or technical requirements are. I am not for a minute suggesting that they should not have the resources to do their job.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122412"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do think that the whole issue of speeding and the fact that we have paid a lot of attention recently to stopping police chases because there have been significant injuries is enough to say that there is a broad concern out there about speed in a variety of ways, not only the street racing part but speeding for various reasons. The police have been very good about recognizing when it is time to call off a police chase and when they can continue on with safety for the people around them and for the public.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the community I come from, our crime prevention society has worked very closely around this issue with the RCMP. I do not know about other communities. The crime prevention society in the communities in which I live, Surrey North or Surrey, does a lot of work with youth. The connection with youth is probably as great if not greater than it has been with adults. They have been involved in painting murals on walls to show things to the public, funded through the crime prevention society. There is a superb relationship with youth. There is a superb youth outreach person. I think the crime prevention societies across the country probably have a number of educative strategies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be wonderful if there were a database. I do not know if there is or not. I never like to reinvent a wheel that somebody has already worked on. There could be a database of excellence that we could look at to see that Cranbrook takes its students into the hospitals or that somebody else does something that would work in our community but we have not even thought about trying. All of those pieces are going to have to come together in order to really have an impact on street racing.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, now that the question has been asked, I will have to find out what a police car needs as its top speed, because I do not know. Someone on that side probably knows.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say again that it would be superb to actually have a database so one could see what is happening across the country and what might work in one's community, because all communities are different. There is no cookie cutter that says this strategy will work--</div>

    </p><a name="Para122420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the theme, it really had to do with whether it is a matter of do as I say but not as I do.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the current public works minister, who said that he was not interested in running in an election?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about recruiting lobbyists for government positions? There is a list that is growing daily to allow former Conservative staffers to register as lobbyists and to in fact lobby the people for whom they worked just before the election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122424"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about pushing through the softwood deal? The Conservatives said, hey, free trade and the dispute resolution mechanism, we have to make it work. As a matter of fact, the Conservatives said they were not accepting a penny less than $5.4 billion. What did they do? They negotiated a deal that in fact left over a billion dollars on the table.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about partisan appointments? There was Gwyn Morgan, a Conservative bagman, to head the supposedly non-partisan appointments commission. The Conservatives say they do not want partisan appointments, but they turn around and do it for a very important position, a person who is going to scrutinize appointments to government positions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para122426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about handing a $500,000 contract as a federal negotiator to Harvie Andre, a former Conservative cabinet minister with deep ties to the Tories? How about Nova Scotia's former Tory finance minister, Neil LeBlanc? He is consul general to Boston. How about Richard Bell, co-chairman of the Conservative election campaign in New Brunswick, who was appointed to the New Brunswick Court of the Queen's Bench? How about former Conservative MP Jim Gouk going to the board of directors of NAV CANADA?</div>
    </p><a name="Para122427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and time again, the Conservatives say one thing but do another. On accountability, how about the Conservative Party now being investigated by the Chief Electoral Officer, Jean-Pierre Kingsley, for failing to report delegate fees to their 2005 national convention, raising and spending millions of dollars with no transparency, as required under the act? Yet they continue to say they were being accountable.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem right now is that the Liberal Senate does not want to pass this law. The Liberals are purposely slow-walking this legislation in the Senate. Why? Not for due diligence, but to try to thwart our government for bringing in this law prior to the Liberal leadership convention. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is unconscionable. It is shameful that unelected Liberal senators, for their own political benefit, would try to slow-walk the most important piece of anti-corruption legislation this country has ever seen. That is exactly what is happening. It is shameful. It is unconscionable. The member should be ashamed of himself. In fact, on behalf of his Liberal senators, he should apologize.</div>

How about Allan Cutler, who was an Ottawa candidate and was offered compensation for damage to his career by the party? Again, another ethical breach. How about a 33-day--</div>

I would have thought he could stand up in this assembly and speak from the heart, speak from knowledge deep within, but apparently not. Apparently, he has to have some sort of a note or a canned speech perhaps in his possession. It really is quite disappointing. I would have thought he would have the experience by now, after many years sitting in this place, to ask a four minute question without having to refer to an aid, a crutch, like the notes he has clutched in his possession right now.</div>
