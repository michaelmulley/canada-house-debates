	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on Monday the Reform Party presented a motion to 
amend the Official Languages Act. As you know, I did not share 
the views expressed by Reform Party members, individually and 
collectively, as they spoke in this debate. Nor do I agree with the 
proposal of the Reform Party to split our official languages, in 
other words, that French should be the only official language in 
Quebec and English the only official language outside Quebec.
<P>
	You can imagine I felt under attack, and as a member of the 
francophone minority outside Quebec, I found the Reform 
Party's comments insulting. Because of them, I felt as though I 
were becoming less and less a Canadian.
<P>
	I intend to pursue the debate on official languages and stand 
up for the rights of French Canadians throughout Canada and for 
the rights of anglophones throughout Canada, whether we are 
talking about English- speaking minorities in Quebec or 
French-speaking minorities outside Quebec.
<P>
	However, considering the great respect I have for this House, 
if I happened to offend this House-and I do mean this 
House-by my use of rather emotional terms, I withdraw 
anything I said that may have offended. However, with respect 
to minority languages, whether we are talking about French or 
English, I repeat that I will continue my efforts to defend these 
minorities.
<P>
<B>The Speaker:</B> I accept comments of the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester.
<P>
	Yesterday, I told the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster that if he withdrew that would be the 
end of it. So I will consider the hon. member's comments-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-as having concluded this point of order. There was a 
withdrawal of the statement categorically and the Chair accepts 
this withdrawal.
<P>
	We will now go on to a point of order by the member for 
Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder when we might hear an apology from the 
Prime Minister, who last night criticized those on social 
assistance as doing nothing but sitting at home.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure the hon. member realizes fully that 
would not be a point of order. Perhaps he would take another 
avenue to put his views forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, while I accept the heartfelt 
apology on behalf of members on this side of the House offended 
by the hon. member from Carleton-Gloucester, I wish to put on 
record that the Reform Party in no way opposes bilingualism in 
the federal service.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> From time to time in the course of debate we 
are emotional and aggressive. It is to be taken for granted in the 
House of Commons. The matter of the point of order which was 
raised is closed. I would like to leave that where it is.

<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 9-<B>Mr. Simmons:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Has any action been taken by the Department of Environment to address the 
concerns raised by the Auditor General in his 1992 Report to Parliament that ``the 
capability to respond effectively to a marine spill of any significant magnitude 
does not presently exist anywhere in Canada'', even though ``each year, Canada 
can expect at least one major spill, and a catastrophic spill can be expected once 
every 15 years'', and, if so, (a) what was such action (<I>b</I>) are any specific 
environmental protection measures being developed to deal with potential spills 
of hazardous materials in relation to the Hibernia project?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> (a) The activities being undertaken to 
address the concerns raised are primarily the responsibility of 
the Minister of Transport. The Canadian Coast Guard has taken 
a number of steps in co-operation with the Department of 
Environment and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
during the last three years to improve Canada's marine spill 
response capability.
<P>
	Strategy: On June 26, 1991, the federal government 
announced a $100 million green plan marine environmental 
emergencies response strategy to implement the most urgent and 
high priority recommendations put forward by the public review 
panel on tanker safety and marine spills response capabilities.
<P>
	Prevention measures: All foreign flag tankers are now 
inspected on their first visit each year to a Canadian port. 
Inspections of all foreign vessels entering Canada (including 
100 per cent of foreign flag tankers) have increased from 9.2 per 
cent in 1989 to 38 per cent in 1992.
<P>
	Preparedness measures: The Coast Guard has spent over $15 
million since 1990 to acquire additional pollution 
countermeasures equipment.
<P>
	Policy: The amendments to the Canada Shipping Act (Bill 
C-121) received royal assent June 23, 1993 and provide for 
tougher sentences for pollution offences, new shipping safety 
regulations and implementation of international conventions 
including OPRC 90 and salvage convention.
<P>
	(b) The environmental protection measures to deal with 
potential spills from Hibernia are regulated by the federal 
government (lead is the Department of Natural Resources) 
through its participation in the Canada-Newfoundland 
Off-Shore Petroleum Board. The board ensures that appropriate 
contingency plans are in place to respond to any hazardous 
materials spills quickly and effectively.
<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The question as 
enumerated by the parliamentary secretary has been answered.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADA-HUNGARYINCOMETAX<BR>CONVENTIONACT,1994">CANADA-HUNGARY INCOME TAX<BR>
CONVENTION ACT, 1994</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (for Minister of Finance)</B> 
moved that Bill S-2, An Act to implement a convention between 
Canada and the Republic of Hungary, an agreement between 
Canada and the Federal Republic of Nigeria, an agreement 
between Canada and the Republic of Zimbabwe, a convention 
between Canada and the Argentine Republic and a protocol 
between Canada and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the 
avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal 
evasion with respect to income taxes and to make related 
amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade):</B> Madam Speaker, the purpose of Bill S-2 
is to implement reciprocal tax treaties-or 
conventions-between Canada and Hungary, Nigeria, Argentina 
and Zimbabwe that will eliminate double taxation on income 
tax. As well, this bill implements a protocol to revise the current 
tax convention between Canada and the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	I would first like to comment on the desirability and the role 
of tax treaties. A tax treaty between countries is an important 
tool to provide the benefits of certainty and stability regarding 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3313"> 3313 </A></B>
<P>
tax regimes-benefits that concretely promote and facilitate 
international trade and investment.
<P>
	Such certainty and stability is achieved because such treaties 
enshrine the basis, as well as the rate, of applicable taxes. This 
means that a treaty rate of tax cannot be increased unless the 
treaty itself is modified or terminated.
<P>
	In fact, termination is a rare event, while revision of such 
treaties is a lengthy process requiring the concurrence of both 
governments. And in either case, taxpayers will normally 
receive considerable advance notice of the impending changes.
<P>
	Another benefit of such tax treaties is that they also reduce 
annoyance in the operation of the national tax systems involved 
in several ways. First, they eliminate the necessity of paying tax 
on business profits in the source country if there is no permanent 
establishment in that country. As well, they provide a 
mechanism to settle problems encountered by taxpayers.
<P>
	More importantly, tax treaties eliminate or alleviate double 
taxation in instances where international transactions are 
involved that may give rise to the same income being taxed by 
more than one country.
<P>
	Let me expand on how this works. For the purpose of 
eliminating double taxation, the tax treaties establish two 
categories of rules. Firstly, in the case of a number of specified 
items of income, an exclusive right to tax is conferred on only 
one of the contracting states. In this way, the other contracting 
country accepts that it cannot tax this income, and double 
taxation is thus absolutely avoided.
<P>
	Secondly, for other items of income, the right to tax is not an 
exclusive one. These provisions confer on the source country (or 
situs) a full or limited right to tax. In turn, under the treaty, the 
country of residence of the taxpayer must allow relief for the tax 
paid in the other country. Ultimately, this again ensures there is 
no double taxation.
<P>
	I should remind this House that the treaties enacted by this bill 
are the latest within a long-standing process. The major reform 
of Canada's income tax legislation in 1971 required Canada to 
expand its network of double taxation conventions (tax treaties) 
with other countries. Since that time negotiations for the 
conclusion of new treaties or the revision of existing ones have 
been entered into with almost 75 countries.
<P>
	In this bill, the four tax conventions under review follow the 
general pattern of the conventions previously approved by 
Parliament. The number of Canadian tax treaties in force now 
stands at 52. I would now like to briefly highlight if I may, the 
main elements of these new tax treaties covered by this bill. I 
will deal with the Protocol to the Netherlands Convention at the 
end of my remarks.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	These treaties provide generaly that dividends may be taxed 
in the source country at a maximum rate of 15 per cent.
<P>
	However, in the case of company dividends, the rate is often 
reduced if the company receiving the dividends holds an equity 
interest in the company paying the dividends.
<P>
	Such a reduced rate has been set at 10 per cent for the 
countries covered here (execpt for Nigeria, where it will be 12.5 
per cent).
<P>
	Regarding interest paid by a resident of one country to that of 
another country, the rates set out in this bill are 10 per cent in the 
case of Hungary, 12.5 per cent for Argentina and Nigeria; and 15 
per cent in the case of Zimbabwe.
<P>
	There are, however, a number of exceptions. Interest paid on a 
bond or similar obligation of the national government, a 
political subdivision or local authority will be exempt from tax 
in the country in which it arises.
<P>
	Also, these treaties (except that with Zimbabwe) contain a 
provision that will allow interest paid on loans or credits 
extended, guaranteed or insured by certain state entities (in 
Canada, for example, by the Export Development 
Corporation-EDC) to be taxable only in the country where the 
recipient of the interest payment resides.
<P>
	These treaties also address the taxation of royalty payments. 
They provide for a general rate of source taxation of 10 per cent 
in the case of Hungary and Zimbabwe, 12.5 per cent in the case 
of Nigeria, and from 3 to 15 per cent in the case of Argentina, 
depending on the nature of the royalty.
<P>
	Copyright royalties are exempt under the treaty with Hungary.
<P>
	There are also a number of other matters dealt with in these 
tax treaties, such as capital gains. The treaty provisions dealing 
with capital gains reflect the standard Canadian position 
enabling the source country to tax profits from the sale of real 
estate, business assets and shares in real estate companies.
<P>
	Second, non-discrimination. Under the conventions, 
discrimination on the basis of nationality is prohibited. This 
ensures nationals of one country equal treatment with nationals 
of the other country in the same circumstances. However, this 
does not prevent a country from providing fiscal incentives (for 
example, Canada's small business deduction) on the basis of the 
residence of the taxpayer.
<P>
	Third, pensions. Canada has preserved its right to tax 
pensions paid to residents of the countries covered by this bill. 
In the cases of Argentina, Zimbabwe and Hungary, the 
maximum rate of tax applicable in the source country to periodic 
pension and annuity payments is 15 per cent. In the case of 
Nigeria, there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3314"> 3314 </A></B>
<P>
is no stated  maximum rate of tax applicable to periodic pension 
payments.
<P>
	Finally, war veterans pensions are generally exempt from tax 
under the four treaties.
<P>
	Fourth, double taxation relief. The treaties provide that in 
Canada, double taxation of foreign source income of Canadian 
residents is alleviated by way of a foreign tax credit, in 
accordance with the limitations provided for in the Canadian 
legislation.
<P>
	In addition, devidends received by a company resident in 
Canada from the exempt surplus of foreign affiliates resident in 
a treaty country are exempt from tax in Canada. Reciprocally, 
relief from double taxation is granted in the other treaty country 
in accordance with the method recognized by that country.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Let me turn now to a final undertaking enacted by this 
legislation. Bill S-2 will implement a protocol to the tax 
convention signed by Canada and the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands in 1986. This protocal updates this existing treaty 
to take into consideration changes made to the respective laws 
and policies of the two countries.
<P>
	For example, in Canada's 1992 federal budget, the 
government announced it was prepared, in tax treaty 
negotiations, to reciprocally reduce the withholding tax rate on 
direct dividends. This was seen as a valuable incentive to 
encourage direct international investment. And in the 1993 
budget, the governement affirmed its desire to negotiate, on a 
bilateral basis, exemptions from withholding taxes on payments 
made for the use of computer software.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that the Netherlands is the first country 
with which we have signed such an agreement.
<P>
	Under this bill, in cases where a dividend recipient holds 25 
per cent or more of the capital, or 10 per cent or more of the 
voting rights, of the dividend-paying corporation, the 
withholding tax will be reduced to 5 per cent from the current 10 
per cent. This reduction will take place over a five-year period 
starting from 1993. As regards interest payments, the protocol 
reduces the rate to 10 per cent from the current 15 per cent.
<P>
	As well, the agreement eliminates the withholding tax on 
royalties for computer software and on interest paid to pension 
funds.
<P>
	To conclude, on balance, the terms of the four tax conventions 
and the protocol provide some equitable solutions to the various 
problems of double taxation existing between Canada and these 
countries. Each of these countries hopes to implement the 
bilateral convention as soon as possible. Consequently, I 
commend this bill to the House and urge its speedy passage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> I welcome 
this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois in this 
debate on Bill S-2, which, as the hon. member explained, 
proposes to implement income tax conventions between Canada 
and Hungary, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Argentina and the 
Netherlands.
<P>
	The purpose of tax treaties is to avoid double taxation of 
business profits in the case of companies that have branches or 
affiliated companies in the other country. These treaties are 
useful and may, in certain cases, apply to trips by Quebec and 
Canadian performers who go abroad-or even athletes, 
including hockey players.
<P>
	It is clear that tax treaties are not something new. They have 
always existed, and I have the impression they always will, 
especially in a world that is undergoing globalization.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Tax treaties establish what is called reciprocal treatment 
between countries with respect to income tax. However, 
reciprocity is only possible when tax rates for Canadian 
businesses and businesses in the countries with which tax 
treaties are signed are more or less equivalent or at least 
comparable.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the first negative aspect I want to discuss 
today concerning tax treaties is that, because tax rates on 
business profits in Canada differ greatly from those in countries 
that are signatories to such treaties, the system has long been 
considered to be a standing invitation to tax avoidance by 
Canadian corporations with foreign affiliates.
<P>
	In fact, countries considered tax havens, such as Barbados, 
Cyprus, Malta and Singapore, to name only a few, have signed 
tax treaties with Canada. The tax rate applied in these tax havens 
is much lower than in Canada. This means, as was pointed out by 
the Auditor General in his 1992 report, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Income earned in countries that are tax havens-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	-like the ones I just mentioned-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-and that are designated by order in council can enter Canada tax free, even 
if it was not taxed or only taxed at a very low rate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Still according to the Auditor General, the Department of 
National Revenue is aware of a number of taxpayers who have 
used this scheme to be in a position to move $500 million into 
Canada tax free. Quite frankly, this is outrageous. Earlier, I was 
amazed when I heard the presentation on Bill S-2, in which 
everything was sweetness and light, and I sat there wondering 
whether the members opposite were completely oblivious to the 
real world of tax treaties.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, another reason, and this concerns the second 
negative aspect, why the Bloc Quebecois has been asking for a 
review of all our tax treaties is to pinpoint cases where tax rates 
on business profits are comparable to those in Canada and 
preserve only those treaties. The point is that the foreign income 
of a Canadian  corporation, which is tax exempt or taxed at a 
very low rate, when paid in the form of dividends to Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3315"> 3315 </A></B>
<P>
shareholders, is eligible for the same federal tax credit as 
dividends paid by a Canadian company operating in Canada, 
whose income is taxed in Canada.
<P>
	We have often raised the problem of tax inequities between 
individuals, Quebecers and Canadians, but here we are dealing 
with an unfair tax situation affecting corporations based in 
Canada who decide to invest in Canada, to create jobs in Canada, 
to generate profits and to be good corporate citizens. All the 
while, other corporations decide to set up foreign affiliates and, 
through their investments abroad, benefit from tax exemptions 
here in Canada. These exemptions are generous, if not more 
generous in fact, than those enjoyed by corporations striving to 
create and fuel economic growth.
<P>
	These inequities clearly act as a disincentive to economic 
development here at home. There is no question that preferential 
treatment is given to foreign investments by Canadian residents.
<P>
	If this is how we plan to develop the Quebec and Canadian 
economies and employment, then I think we have taken a wrong 
turn. This situation is clearly unacceptable.
<P>
	The third aspect of the tax convention legislation that caught 
my eye is the fact that pursuant to this act, a Canadian-resident 
corporation can deduct interest on funds it borrows for the 
purpose of investing in a foreign affiliate. Here again, 
investments made in Quebec and in Canada are afforded unfair 
treatment, all because of tax conventions signed between 
Canada and various countries considered tax havens.
<P>
	Corporations that invest in tax havens avoid taxation in two 
ways: first, they can deduct some of the interest on funds 
borrowed and second, they can bring their profits, which were 
either not taxed at all or taxed only sparingly abroad, back into 
the country.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Mention is made of taxation rates that vary anywhere from 3 
per cent to 10 per cent in some cases. These corporations are 
taxed little, if at all, abroad and enjoy tax-exempt status in 
Canada. The tax convention system is full of holes and has been 
for some time now.
<P>
	According to the Auditor General, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That deduction of interest reduces Canada's tax revenue and, at the same 
time, the related income.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is precisely this related income which is tax exempt in 
Canada. Speaking of income related to this investment,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It may be received as a tax exempt dividend and may never appear in the 
Canadian tax base.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In times of serious financial crisis such as we are now facing 
in Canada, the government should not be encouraging 
corporations to invest their money abroad. Instead, it should be 
creating incentives to promote investment here at home, to 
develop employment and to fuel economic growth. In almost all 
instances, tax conventions clearly do not help us to achieve this 
objective.
<P>
	Allow me to describe some of the other problems associated 
with tax havens. Some Canadian companies use stratagems to 
avoid paying their fair share of tax in Canada such as upstream 
loans or revenue stripping, as these methods are called in 
business jargon. Let me explain.
<P>
	For one thing, these schemes enable Canadian companies to 
avoid tax by transferring the losses of foreign subsidiaries to the 
Canadian parent. In other words, if a Canadian company has a 
foreign subsidiary, the losses incurred abroad are brought home 
to Canada and included in calculating the Canadian company's 
tax.
<P>
	Secondly, they allow Canadian companies to avoid tax by 
sending the income of Canadian corporations abroad, which 
works the other way. Some Canadian companies make profits in 
Canada, export these profits to countries where they have a 
subsidiary and with which a tax convention has been signed, 
thus avoiding paying tax in Canada.
<P>
	Thirdly, these stratagems enable Canadian companies to 
avoid Canadian tax by making the income of Canadian 
corporations exempt.
<P>
	The history of tax conventions between Canada and the 
signatory countries is full of horror stories which we are unused 
to reading about in the Auditor General's reports and which 
enrage us. Let me tell you a few of them, taken from the Auditor 
General's report for 1992.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Netherlands Antilles subsidiary of a Canadian company had assets of $865 
million and income of $92 million not subject to the foreign income rules. 
Although the income of the foreign subsidiary has not been taxed at a rate that 
approximates Canadian rates, it can be transferred to the Canadian parent as 
tax-free dividends. The offshore income is not taxed on entering Canada, but it 
carries with it federal tax credits on dividends paid out to Canadian 
shareholders. The Canadian parent incurred the financing costs for its 
investment-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-it was still on Dutch territory-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-in the subsidiary and reported a tax loss of $29 million.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	With the huge financial problems we have, it is as if we 
suddenly decided to send $29 million abroad, as if we 
deliberately drove capital away, as if with all the loopholes in 
the tax conventions, we deliberately caused a revenue shortfall 
for the federal government, when the situation could be 
corrected quite quickly and easily.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3316"> 3316 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me give you another of these horror stories, again taken 
from the Auditor General's report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Canadian company transferred $318 million in investments to its Barbados 
subsidiary. In six months this $318 million brought in revenues of $37 million 
exempt from foreign income regulations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Even if the subsidiary's revenues were not taxed at a rate 
similar to the Canadian rate, namely 3 per cent, they can be 
transferred to the Canadian parent company as exempted 
dividends. Foreign income would then be tax-exempt on 
entering Canada, even if no, or practically no, taxes on this 
income were paid in Barbados. This net income is not subject to 
any taxes on entering Canada.
<P>
	The Canadian parent company of this subsidiary also incurred 
financing charges for investing in its Barbadian subsidiary and 
reported-without generating any economic activity in 
Canada-fiscal losses in Canada. Again, we are losing millions 
of dollars in tax revenues when we do not need these tax losses. 
Everyone will agree that we really do not need them. With a 
$507 billion debt and a deficit that will exceed $40 billion, I 
think we should not hurt ourselves intentionally. Only 
masochists can present such tax convention proposals in a 
sentimental manner. As they say in my riding, no wonder things 
are not going well at the shop.
<P>
	No exhaustive studies have been done on the 52 or 53 tax 
conventions now in effect between Canada and certain 
countries, but the Auditor General gave us a general idea of the 
tax losses they can result in. According to him, Canadian 
businesses that, in 1990, invested close to $92 billion in 
non-resident companies with which they have a non-arm's 
length relationship may have benefited a great deal-he does 
not give the proportion as there are no exhaustive studies on 
this-but it probably led to tax losses such as I mentioned 
earlier.
<P>
	As the Auditor General pointed out, some investments are 
probably quite legitimate and totally above suspicion, but others 
are not. They may be legal but they are not legitimate given the 
federal government's financial position. In 1990, for instance, 
$5.2 billion was invested in businesses located in Barbados, a 
well-known tax haven. These investments in Barbados 
generated $400 million in tax-free dividends.
<P>
	Here is another example: $10.9 billion was invested in 
businesses in Cyprus, Ireland, Liberia, the Netherlands and 
Switzerland, which are also considered tax havens. These 
investments brought in over $200 million in tax-free dividends, 
so that Canadian shareholders could benefit from the tax 
exemption on dividends paid to Canadian residents.
<P>
	We must realize that much if not most of these so-called 
investments in these tax havens are made so that Canadian 
parent companies can avoid Canadian taxes and contribute to the 
deterioration of public finances already damaged by several 
years of budget carelessness on the part of successive 
governments here in Ottawa.
<P>
	We can reasonably conclude that, as the Auditor General 
pointed out, the Canadian government-again, they are proving 
us right by presenting Bill S-2, which renews and introduces 
similar tax conventions-intentionally deprives itself of 
hundreds of millions of dollars in annual tax revenues.
<P>
	The problems related to tax conventions have been known for 
a long time, mostly by the people opposite. And I would like to 
point out how long this kind of inconsistency, how long the 
problem of tax avoidance under tax conventions has been 
known. You should not laugh because public finance 
management is far from rosy, as is the way you treat Canadians 
by maintaining such a shameless system and by cutting social 
programs by $7.5 billion over the next three years.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The problem of tax avoidance under conventions has been 
well-known for a long time. For example, in 1987, the 
Department of Finance announced that it would review the 
taxation of affiliated foreign corporations. These studies were 
never carried out.
<P>
	In 1989, the public accounts committee stated that the 
Department of Finance should ensure that tax avoidance under 
tax agreements be closely monitored and that solutions be 
proposed. Again, that was in 1989 and we are still waiting.
<P>
	In 1992, in his comments on the Auditor General's report, the 
Minister of Finance clearly indicated that he had no intention of 
tackling the problem, even though he was aware of it.
<P>
	In December of the same year-and the hon. members 
opposite should listen carefully to this-Jean-Robert Gauthier, 
a veteran Liberal member of Parliament, who was then chairman 
of the public accounts committee, said that what really 
concerned the committee was that the Department of Finance 
had taken no steps to eliminate, where possible, the tax 
avoidance schemes used by foreign subsidiaries. Mr. Gauthier, 
who is still a member of the Liberal Party of Canada, added that, 
in his opinion, the problem was not a new one; it had simply 
resurfaced.
<P>
	Not only does Bill S-2 renew such conventions without an 
appropriate review of the opportunities for tax avoidance in 
countries considered to be tax havens but, on top of that, nothing 
was done by the government since it came to office to try 
somehow to save even a part of the hundreds of millions of 
dollars which are lost because of tax avoidance schemes linked 
to these agreements.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance was quite pleased with himself when 
he tabled his first budget-a budget which has since been 
disavowed by the Prime Minister of Canada. The finance 
minister then said that his budget included amendments which 
would enable the government to alleviate the problem related to 
tax conventions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3317"> 3317 </A></B>
<P>
	However, this was just another performance put on by the 
stand-up comic that the Minister of Finance is when it comes to 
our economic policy.
<P>
	Sure, some changes were made, but not to avoid the loss of 
hundreds of millions annually, and not to avoid problems which 
exist and which we have been aware of since 1982.
<P>
	The measures taken will definitely not solve the problem and I 
urge the government to review all of the 52 or 53 tax conventions 
signed with other countries. These countries are not all tax 
havens, but many are and they deliberately deprive us of tax 
revenues.
<P>
	It is a thorough disgrace to maintain such a system without an 
adequate review, especially when you consider that the system 
has been criticized for a long time by the Auditor General, by the 
Liberals when they were in office, and even by the various 
finance ministers, who pledged to do something but never did. It 
is unacceptable and it is even a disgrace to tolerate such a flawed 
system, especially when you consider that the recent budget puts 
a heavier burden on people who should not have to bear that 
burden. Indeed, the unemployed will contribute $5.5 billion 
through reduced benefits and fewer insurable weeks.
<P>
	The government puts the burden on those who should not have 
to pay, since these people are already living in poverty because 
their government is unable to give them jobs to support their 
families and get their dignity back.
<P>
	Neither was it necessary to take this other shameful measure, 
which consists in reducing by $2.5 billion, over the next few 
years, established programs financing. Again, this is not where 
the government should have looked to find the money it needs.
<P>
	Nor should it reduce, cut and even eliminate the tax credit for 
seniors. These people do not deserve such treatment. They 
should not have to pay for the financial problems of the 
Canadian government, considering that they have already 
contribution so much throughout their lives and that the 
government persists in tolerating tax avoidance through these 
tax conventions.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	The government also did not have the right to shift the burden 
of the deficit or to demonstrate such a lack of control and 
imagination in getting a handle on public finances. There was no 
need to make the provinces pay for the deficit by capping or 
freezing equalization payments, for instance. Canadian 
provinces have already lost $ 1.5 billion.
<P>
	Bill S-2 has nothing to do with the tax agreement reform we 
have been calling for since the beginning of the election 
campaign which saw us become the Official Opposition in this 
House.
<P>
	Before endorsing any new tax agreements or renewing any 
existing ones, I call on my colleagues and on the government to 
embark on a complete, total, in-depth  review of such 
agreements and of the countries which are party to them.
<P>
	My colleagues and I have nothing against Hungary, Nigeria, 
Zimbabwe, Argentina or the Netherlands, but in view of the 
financial burden Canadians and Quebecers must shoulder, one 
should not waste money on purpose or create a situation where 
we lose several hundred million dollars a year in tax revenue. 
What we need is to develop a sense of responsibility which has 
been totally lacking since this government came into power on 
October 25.
<P>
	These people do not act responsibly. Not only do they shift the 
burden of the debt onto the shoulders of those who should not 
have to carry any more but, due to their incompetence, they 
cause Quebecers and Canadians to lose billions of dollars 
because of the uncertainty they create on financial markets. As 
we saw recently, not only did they take money away from people 
who did not deserve it, they did not even manage to please 
financial community, which found nothing in this government's 
first budget that would allow it to put its financial house in order 
and give some credibility to a government that is completely out 
of it.
<P>
	As one of my colleagues said, not only has it failed to close 
the tax loopholes provided by these agreements, even though it 
is doing an about-face, having itself condemned this form of tax 
avoidance in the past, but it is doing nothing to get rid of 
shameful schemes such as family trusts.
<P>
	As we said before, it is becoming increasingly clear that this 
government is starting to behave like the previous one, 
favouring its friends, and the businesses which pour thousands 
of dollars every year into the Liberal coffers. As long as the 
issues of party financing by the public and lobbying are not 
settled, in a true democratic manner, that is, we will keep on 
having this kind of inconsistency and tomfoolery which causes 
us to lose money when we are in no position to do so.
<P>
	Therefore, Madam Speaker, we will vote against Bill S-2 not, 
as I said earlier, because we have something against these 
countries, but because we want the government to review tax 
agreements as a whole.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the Reform Party to address Bill S-2 which in 
essence establishes conventions between Canada and a number 
of other countries so as to prevent income tax evasion and 
double taxation of workers from Canada, Hungary, Nigeria, 
Zimbabwe, Argentina and the Netherlands while working 
abroad in these countries.
<P>
	After listening to the hon. member for the Bloc Quebecois 
who just delivered his comments, perhaps a lot of us will be 
looking at how to enter into an arrangement with the Barbados 
and making a deal there since its taxation system is so 
favourable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3318"> 3318 </A></B>
<P>
	My party supports Bill S-2 but would like to point out to 
members in both Houses, this House and the other place, that 
there are millions of Canadians who do not work abroad who 
could surely use a break from the high taxes they are forced to 
pay at the federal, provincial and municipal levels. 
Implementing tax conventions between Canada and countries 
like Hungary is noble, but what about implementing similar 
conventions between federal, provincial and municipal levels of 
government within our own borders, ensuring that the Canadian 
taxpayer is not overburdened with double taxation?
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	For instance, the agreement between Hungary and Canada is 
20 pages thick. I read it because my parents are Hungarian, I 
speak Hungarian, and I have a bit of a vested interest in Hungary 
and what happens there. If the principles in this agreement 
between Canada and Hungary were looked at and reviewed by 
this Liberal government, and it tried to negotiate and apply some 
of these principles with the provincial governments, what it 
would gain from that are the principles that would lead to 
removal of some of the interprovincial barriers to trade. That 
could save the country, our country, our economy and our 
taxpayers. The cost of doing business could be reduced by $4 
billion to $5 billion.
<P>
	One of the most common complaints about the goods and 
services tax that has been raised in finance meetings is the fact 
that when people purchase goods they are hit with a provincial 
sales tax of between 8 and 12 per cent and a GST of 7 per cent. In 
the eyes of most Canadians, this is seen as a double hit on their 
pocketbooks and has encouraged them to take billions of dollars 
in taxable revenue underground.
<P>
	At a meeting in Vancouver either yesterday or today there is a 
presentation on the underground economy and the value of it. 
Why does one exist? It exists because this House and this 
government is continuing the practices of tax and spend and has 
not addressed the real issue of reduced spending, spending cuts, 
putting the money back into the taxpayers' hands so people 
would be willing to pay taxes on an equitable and fair basis and 
not go into the underground economy. It is becoming too 
expensive to be honest in this country. Even the finance minister 
has acknowledged that fact.
<P>
	In the eyes of most Canadians the double taxation system with 
sales taxes, hidden taxes and income taxes is more than a double 
hit on their pocketbooks. It is a triple, quadruple whammy and it 
has encouraged them, as I said earlier, to deal in ways that they 
can save money.
<P>
	According to <I>Canadian Business</I> magazine: ``Canada now 
enjoys the dubious distinction of imposing one of the highest 
taxation rates among the group of seven industrialized 
countries''.
<P>
	I hope the government does not follow the practices of the 
previous Conservative government of always quoting the group 
of seven nations and how the United Nations said that this 
country is number one. We are no longer number one in anything 
except high spending on a per capita basis.
<P>
	When will the government wake up and realize that the 
present system of tax and spend will no longer be tolerated by 
investors, lenders and consumers?
<P>
	One of my constituents wrote in reply to a questionnaire that I 
sent out: ``Only the federal government could find ways to make 
people pay for the privilege of living more simply and 
moderately''.
<P>
	For too long governments have forced people to live within 
their means and exercise fiscal restraint while politicians have 
lived in the world of guaranteed pensions and expensive junkets. 
While many Canadians are sitting around the kitchen table 
planning a budget, deciding what they need versus what they 
want, members of Parliament have travelled the globe, costing 
taxpayers millions of dollars. Parliamentary committees travel 
the country, justified on the basis that they are consulting with 
the people.
<P>
	The cost of all these committee travels, combined with the 
junkets, is not in the millions of dollars, it is over a billion 
dollars. Yet the government will not look at ways and means of 
saving the taxpayers' money and getting input from taxpayers 
through householders or through visiting their constituencies 
every once in a while and finding out what they want.
<P>
	It takes the Clerk of the House to look at ways and means of 
saving money for committees. It is a noble effort on the Clerk's 
part and the government should be looking and encouraging 
more effort on that basis.
<P>
	How many trips have there been by members of Parliament, 
their spouses and their aides to Hungary, Nigeria, the 
Netherlands, Argentina, or Zimbabwe to hammer out the 
particulars of S-2?
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	I was invited to go to Hungary as a parliamentarian. I speak 
Hungarian. It would have been a wonderful opportunity to visit 
the country where I was born, but I turned it down. I turned it 
down because there was nothing to be gained there. There is 
more to be gained here. If they want to do a deal with us they can 
come here.
<P>
	By doing that I hope I have sent the message that we will 
co-operate with other countries but we have problems to solve 
at home without trying to solve other people's problems for 
them. They have a responsibility to work on that themselves, 
including Hungarians.
<P>
	Bill S-2 is largely a housekeeping bill. The federal 
government should consider housekeeping measures in our 
income tax system. It should stop dusting around the edges. I 
encourage 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3319"> 3319 </A></B>
<P>
government members to take their  gloves off and start throwing 
things out, such as unnecessary programs.
<P>
	The Liberals should start by throwing out the Income Tax Act 
with its over 2,500 pages. They should develop a new 
proportional simple tax based on equity and understanding. It 
should be geared to family size, the amount of income and the 
family's ability to pay taxes on that income.
<P>
	It is our high taxation level that is responsible for people 
fleeing to countries like those mentioned in Bill S-2. That is 
why the government is forced to draw up these conventions.
<P>
	We have a system of overseas tax credits. People who work 
outside Canada for extended periods it is believed ought not to 
pay full taxes since they do not consume their full share of 
government services. That virtually eliminates tax on 80 per 
cent of their total income if they have been out of the country for 
six months.
<P>
	On that basis an engineer making $70,000 would barely pay 
$7,000 whereas that engineer working at home would pay 
$23,000. When I questioned a certified accountant in my riding 
of Calgary Centre he told me about this and that it is a huge 
incentive. It makes it worthwhile for people to leave their 
families and work in Russia or Hungary for half the year to make 
this extra income.
<P>
	The nature of this bill is technical and serves to provide a 
better understanding between Canada and foreign countries. Let 
me leave the government with some constructive questions that 
arise out of reviewing this bill, which I hope will lead to some 
improvements for Canada.
<P>
	Bill S-2 is a good first step. But why are we only signing on 
with the countries mentioned in the bill and not some of the 
emerging markets we will be trading with in the future?
<P>
	The reason for these conventions is that tax evasion exists in 
Canada due to our comparatively high level of taxation. Is the 
government willing to prevent this problem from occurring by 
bringing our tax level in line with other countries?
<P>
	Is it realistic to expect these conventions to be workable when 
Canada's tax system is considerably more complicated than the 
countries we are signing conventions with?
<P>
	Is our high taxation level responsible for people fleeing to 
these countries and is that why we need these conventions? My 
answer to that is yes.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is Canada's high tax burden which must be 
addressed in order to attract investment in Canada and have a 
positive net cash flow of foreign investments to add to our gross 
national product.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-8 be amended in Clause 1 in the English version by replacing line 
30, on page 2, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``grounds that the inmate or any other inmate of the''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Madam Speaker, the amendment I am proposing this 
morning is very simple not only because it is short and 
self-explanatory, it is simple in every way. It proposes a 
simplification of the wording of the bill. In other words, I am 
suggesting we express what is clear in clear terms and that we 
state the two possibilities separately in both official languages. I 
am trying to give the legislative purpose of the bill a 
comparable, equivalent and similar form in the two official 
versions, French and English.
<P>
	I am not questioning the content of the bill because I agree 
with it. I do not feel that these amendments to the Criminal Code 
will modify the state of the law. They simply give a structure to 
parameters the courts have already established around section 
25 concerning the use of deadly force by policemen.
<P>
	I am not convinced that all policemen will submit themselves 
to the five-step test imposed by the bill when faced with a life 
and death situation; on the other hand, I do not think this new 
legislation is changing anything much. Our consultations with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3320"> 3320 </A></B>
<P>
the judiciary and police forces have shown us that the spirit of 
the bill is accepted almost unanimously. It is not the content 
which is questionable but the form.
<P>
	This bill gives us the opportunity to discuss a very serious 
legislative problem, a problem in the drafting of legislation. For 
a few years now, federal bills have taken on a very specific style 
in each of the two official languages and I am not talking about 
their literary aspect. I invite members to read at random parts of 
federal legislation.
<P>
	Earlier this week, during the debate on Bill C-7, I commented 
on this obscure new drafting technique. I will certainly come 
back to it some other time. Let me just say for now that any piece 
of legislation, particularly in the case of criminal law, must be 
easy for ordinary people to understand.
<P>
	What concerns me in the case of Bill C-8 for which I am 
proposing an amendment, as for all federal legislation, is the 
fact that the French and English versions generally do not 
match. My amendment is very simple and proposes to make both 
texts identical, not only similar or comparable but absolutely 
identical.
<P>
	The statutes of Canada are enforced all over the country and 
both versions are equally official. They are enacted, printed, and 
published in both official languages. According to the Official 
Languages Act, both versions are ``equally authoritative''.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	It must then be concluded that, where the English and French 
versions are diametrically opposed, two different laws must 
apply. Besides, the Official Languages Act itself illustrates that 
point perfectly as it includes its own contradictory clauses. 
Members of the House will understand what I mean merely by 
skimming through that act.
<P>
	In Canada, we really have two official languages acts, just as 
we usually end up with two laws whenever we adopt a particular 
piece of legislation. No doubt, this situation is unique in the 
world, and we must make do with it, for better or for worse.
<P>
	As I just said, even the Official Languages Act has two 
different official versions. Section 13 of the Act, which declares 
both versions equally authoritative, does not say it with the same 
meaning and effect in French and in English.
<P>
	As one might expect, since the Official Languages Act has 
two official contradictory versions, so do all federal enactments.
<P>
	For example, in the English version of Bill C-8, section 25(5) 
authorizing the use of deadly force against an inmate who is 
escaping reads as follows: ``any of the inmates- poses a threat 
of death- to the peace officer or any other person-''
<P>
	In the English version, the threat of death comes from all 
inmates and is directed against the peace officer concerned and 
any other person. In the French version, the peace officer can use 
deadly force against that inmate and any other inmate.
<P>
	We understand that ``all inmates'' includes the inmate who is 
escaping. We also understand that, in spite of a different 
wording, the peace officer is justified in using deadly force 
whenever he is threatened by an inmate who is trying to escape.
<P>
	But why must we say it differently in English and French? 
Why must we always complicate things and risk creating 
confusion? ``Any of the inmates'' does not mean ``<I>ce détenu et 
tout autre détenu</I>''. We must say clearly ``<I>un détenu</I>'' to 
translate ``any of the inmates'', or ``this inmate and any other 
inmate'' to really translate ``<I>ce détenu ou tout autre détenu</I>''. 
Let us stop complicating simple things.
<P>
	That is the purpose of my amendment. As I said, it is simple 
and it is aimed at ensuring simplicity, and, if I may say so, at 
ensuring clarity and agreement between both official versions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the member for Saint Hubert is proposing to 
amend the English version of Bill C-8 to bring the wording 
closer to the French version.
<P>
	Legislative drafting takes place parallel in English and 
French. Each official version conforms to and reflects the 
genius, spirit and rules of each language. Neither version is the 
literal translation of the other nor is it meant to be. Therefore, 
formal discrepancies are inevitable.
<P>
	The language in clause 1 as in other clauses is meant to be in 
plain language to the extent possible. The language in the 
French and English versions is used to express the intent of the 
legislation with the utmost clarity and precision, respecting 
grammatical rules and seeking to avoid undue repetitions and 
the use of more words than are necessary.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	The use of the words ``any of the inmates'' in line 30 is short 
and clear and easy to understand. To add the extra words in 
English, as proposed by the hon. member, just in order to 
achieve a literal English translation of the French, adds nothing 
of substance and serves only to detract from the current English 
plain language version and therefore cannot be supported.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a great pleasure to speak on behalf of Bill 
C-8 at third reading. I hope this bill will receive support from all 
sides of the House.
<P>
	Bill C-8 marks a significant advance forward from the 
anachronistic fleeing felon rule. In addition, it preserves the 
ability of the police to protect themselves and the public from 
serious harm or death. As well, this bill balances the ability of 
police officers to maintain the safety and security of the public 
while respecting the rights of Canadians.
<P>
	Hon. members should know that Bill C-8 has the support of 
the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and the Canadian 
Police Association. The Canadian Association of Chiefs of 
Police believes that Bill C-8 responds to the need for change in a 
way that provides police officers with the necessary tools to do 
their jobs in dangerous situations, while at the same time places 
on police officers the responsibility when using deadly force 
against fleeing suspects to do so in the circumstances which 
would be permitted by the proposed new subsection 25(4) of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association expressed the view that the 
legislation is balanced and accords with commonly accepted 
police practice. It deals with the uncertainty caused by a 
decision of a court in Ontario that concluded that the present 
subsection is unconstitutional.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Both the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and the 
Canadian Police Association are comfortable with the wording 
in the proposed new subsection 25(4).
<P>
	Bill C-8 also addresses the types of situations that arise when 
peace officers in federal penitentiaries use force to prevent 
potentially dangerous inmates from escaping custody.
<P>
	With the proposed new subsection 25(5) of the Criminal 
Code, Bill C-8 strikes a sensible balance between individual 
rights and community needs and guarantees that peace officers 
in our penitentiaries will continue to enjoy the authority they 
need to carry out their responsibility for the protection of 
society.
<P>
	Finally, the bill would also amend the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act to provide express statutory authority for a 
protection officer to use disabling force against a fleeing foreign 
fishing vessel in order to arrest the master of the vessel. This 
amendment will ensure that the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans is able to maintain this deterrent to foreign vessels' 
fishing illegally inside Canada's fishing zones.
<P>
	The amendment includes the authority to create regulations 
establishing the procedures governing the use of disabling 
force.
<P>
	The government intends to develop these regulations so that 
they will be consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms and with recognized and reasonable international 
practice in the use of disabling force at sea.
<P>
	This will include a guaranteed use of force to ensure that only 
the minimum level of force necessary to carry out an arrest is 
used.
<P>
	I hope that hon. members will provide this bill with their 
support.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> I would like to state the 
position of the Official Opposition on Bill C-8, an Act to amend 
the Criminal Code and the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act.
<P>
	First of all, this bill would amend section 25(4) of the 
Criminal Code, which specifies the degree of force peace 
officers can use to apprehend a fleeing suspect or an inmate 
trying to escape from a penitentiary.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3322"> 3322 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, Bill C-8 would amend the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act to provide express authority for an officer to use 
force to disable a foreign fishing vessel whose captain is trying 
to escape.
<P>
	As members undoubtedly know, this far-reaching piece of 
legislation has been a very controversial issue in Canada for a 
number of years now.
<P>
	I will start by addressing the first part of the bill. The use of 
force by police officers to arrest fleeing suspects involves a 
number of social issues.
<P>
	Obviously, law enforcement is at stake. For the public's sake, 
criminal law must be enforced and offenders must be arrested 
and prosecuted.
<P>
	I recognize that we need to provide police officers with the 
tools they need to do their work, to protect themselves and to 
protect the citizens. However, law enforcement goes beyond 
ordinary police work. According to a very basic principle, it is 
up to the legal system to try the accused and to sentence the 
guilty.
<P>
	When police intervention causes death, as it does from time to 
time, that principle is encroached upon at the expense of society.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Sometimes, it also goes against the will of the people who are 
asking for an overall reduction in the force used by police 
officers.
<P>
	When less violent and objectionable police techniques can be 
efficiently used, it is in the interest of society to do so. There is 
always the possibility that an innocent individual, mistaken for 
a fleeing suspect, can be killed or harmed.
<P>
	The population must also think about its own security. Two 
possible scenarios come to mind. On the one hand, dangerous 
criminals trying to avoid being arrested can put people at risk.
<P>
	In such a case, there may be good reasons to risk causing 
grievous bodily harm to the offender, given the likelihood that 
he would inflict a lot of pain on people if he escapes.
<P>
	On the other hand, when you are dealing with an offender who 
is not a public threat, or at least not a very serious one, public 
security would be more at stake if police officers were to use 
force to arrest the suspect, either by firing in the air or aiming at 
a fleeing car, instead of using less violent measures, at the risk 
of losing their suspect.
<P>
	In the last few years, we have had to face another public 
policy issue following allegations that police forces are 
mistreating visible minorities.
<P>
	When people are under the impression that the police are 
treating visible minority suspects differently, it can often create 
tense situations.
<P>
	It is in the best interest of our society to reduce the use of force 
so as to avoid provoking anger among minorities and touching 
off a crisis.
<P>
	So, we agree with the bill, which clarifies the criteria set for 
the use of force by peace officers against fleeing suspects, thus 
confirming the practice applied in the last few years.
<P>
	Nonetheless, the use of the terms ``imminent or future'' in 
section 25(4) leads to abuse.
<P>
	We would have liked the government to clarify these terms, 
which appear rather ambiguous to us.
<P>
	The second part of my speech concerns changes to the Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act. Indeed, according to the Criminal 
Code, peace officers are allowed to use force in arresting an 
escapee.
<P>
	We support this principle in the context of the Criminal Code, 
but we consider this approach not to be convenient for the 
fisheries.
<P>
	We feel there is a huge disproportion between the various 
aspects of Bill C-8 and the scope of these measures.
<P>
	The situation is tense in the fishing industry and the use of 
force to disable a foreign fishing vessel could result in an 
escalation of violence.
<P>
	Moreover, the bill does not provide for the use of necessary 
force to disable a Canadian vessel, on grounds that other 
measures exist to track down offenders in Canada. This is an 
outright negation of the very purpose of this bill.
<P>
	The use of force to disable a vessel is not the most efficient 
means to put an end to foreign overfishing. In the past, the use of 
warning shots has not permitted officers to board delinquent 
foreign vessels to inspect them.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Consequently, protection officers could be tempted to use 
more force, which could in turn lead to an escalation of violence.
<P>
	Trying to show the international community how determined 
Canada is to put an end to illicit practices is a commendable 
objective. However, there are risks attached to it when the 
problem of unlawful fishing is not solved at the root.
<P>
	Illegal fishing cannot be stopped without the help of foreign 
countries. Negotiations with the international community 
should continue since, as we all know, Canada cannot legislate 
in an international zone. Therefore, negotiations are the only 
recourse.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, it is possible, through bilateral and 
multilateral agreements, to obtain the support of foreign 
governments in order to penalize shipowners who would chance 
to fish illegally in Canadian waters. Sanctions would have to be 
severe enough to deter offenders.
<P>
	Although such cases are rare, we can put an end to this without 
jeopardizing the life of crew members. Disabling a vessel at sea 
is not as simple as it seems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3323"> 3323 </A></B>
<P>
	Even though we have all the necessary means to identify 
offenders, the government should rely on the cooperation of 
foreign governments instead. The amendment to the Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act does not give the Canadian government 
the power to intervene in an international zone where 
agreements are not respected. The only way of settling the 
matter is to put in place, with other countries, a system of 
sanctions.
<P>
	The addition of clause 8(1) could prompt the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans to better equip its vessels so that they have 
enough striking power to intimidate foreign vessels. These 
investments are not a priority at this time considering the crying 
needs of the fishing industry.
<P>
	Since I do not want to dwell on this, I will conclude by saying 
that the term ``to disable'' a vessel must be better defined and 
that the regulations must put some restrictions on the use of 
force in order to prevent abuse.
<P>
	I hope the government will take these remarks into 
consideration. The use of force involves risks that cannot be 
taken lightly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> 
Madam Speaker, Reformers will support Bill C-8. We admit we 
had reservations as the bill seemed at first to be limiting the 
discretion of the police to do a difficult job. The bill was seen as 
circumscribing the law around the use of force for fleeing 
criminals. On hearing the various witnesses and delegations at 
the committee stage, we are satisfied that the bill responds in a 
reasonable manner to unfinished business of the charter 
argument and the ruling of the Lines case.
<P>
	The bill also clarifies the use of deadly force against escaping 
prisoners from medium and maximum penitentiaries. 
Additionally it provides authority to disable foreign vessels 
fleeing from Canadian authorities.
<P>
	The bill is a culmination of a process that started in 1979 in 
the Ouimet committee. In 1989 Ontario race relations and police 
task forces made observations on the topic. Over the years there 
has been concern from the Law Reform Commission and the 
subject was brought to a head by the Ontario Lines case in April 
1993 wherein existing sections of the Criminal Code were 
declared unconstitutional.
<P>
	The bill catches up to the court and to the manuals of practice 
and training of current police operations. We had concerns that 
there was not sufficient consultation at the front line level of 
peace officers. We still hold that to be true. The bill, although 
appearing inherently sound, still is a ``top down, we know best'' 
piece of work.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the civil libertarians and the 
prisoners rights representatives we heard at committee stage 
opposed the bill. They want peace officer powers much more 
strictly circumscribed, as is presented here. Most interestingly it 
seems that Bloc members were very worried about the fleeing 
foreign vessel section as they may envision themselves in the 
future as being categorized as foreign vessels fleeing from 
Canadian authorities as they challenge sovereignty in disputed 
waters. The separatist agenda was coming through.
<P>
	The basic premise of the bill relating to peace officer use of 
force in the three areas of fleeing criminals, escaping inmates 
and runaway foreign vessels is proportionality. We hope the bill 
will bring the right balance. On the one hand peace officers must 
have the capacity to do their job with authority and on the other 
the rights of individuals must be protected.
<P>
	In closing I want to make a strong point to wake up the 
government. Reformers will vote for the bill as a housekeeping 
measure. However we hope the justice minister will soon bring 
forward more than just promises to tighten up the criminal 
justice system, for in so many other areas all proportionality has 
evaporated.
<P>
	The public demands action in view of what it sees as the 
bleeding heart justice agenda of the government.

important environmental education initiative.
<P>
	The schoolground naturalization program is a national 
program of the Evergreen Foundation designed to transform 
schoolgrounds into natural outdoor classrooms. Many schools 
across Canada are presently landscaped with asphalt and 
concrete playing fields and are surrounded by institutional 
fencing. They look more like parking lots or prisons than 
schools.
<P>
	These areas provide little educational value, few community 
advantages and no environmental or health benefits. 
Schoolgrounds need to be changed. They must become learning 
grounds by adding natural areas.
<P>
	We must better understand the importance of creating better 
learning environments for our children and work to change our 
schoolgrounds from bleak expanses of concrete to areas of 
environmental significance and educational value.
<P>
	This program of the Evergreen Foundation is doing that. I 
urge other members to support this initiative in their areas.

Translated into a 1990 dollar equivalent, the collective value of

	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was shocked 
and angered last night to hear United States Senator Kent 
Conrad suggest before a United States hearing that the United 
States should retarget its Minuteman missiles against Canada to 
deter us from our trade initiatives.
<P>
	This attitude and threatening rhetoric by the Senator and some 
of his American colleagues is both out of line and 
unsubstantiated. The facts are that Canada has been proven four 
times to have been a fair trader, once by the U.S. General 
Accounting Office, once by the U.S. International Trade 
Commission, once by COSTA and most recently by an 
international audit.
<P>
	Senator Conrad should look in the mirror and see where the 
real problem lies and that is with the use of the export 
enhancement program in which they subsidize prices in the 
international market, drain their supply short, and naturally 
when they are short stocked we are going to as fair traders move 
stock into that market.
<P>
	Senator Conrad should be wise and refocus his policy.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, tomorrow, April 22, is Earth Day and although polling 
experts say that eight out of ten Canadians are deeply concerned 
about ecological issues the present public policy agenda has 
been completely taken over by economic concerns, the debt and 
the deficit, social programs and unemployment.
<P>
	Although these issues are important their significance pales 
next to the long term significance of a healthy and sustainable 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1415 ) </B>
<P>
	It is time we acknowledged it is not only the federal deficit 
that threatens future generations of Canadians. If we destroy the 
earth's ability to support our way of life there definitely will be 
fewer jobs and social programs. The economic issues that 
preoccupy public policy makers now will be completely 
irrelevant.
<P>
	Therefore, on Earth Day I urge all Canadians who are 
concerned about the environment to continue to try to keep it at 
the top of the public agenda. It is only through constant attention 
that the environment will be placed high on the government's 
list of priorities.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DIRECTDEMOCRACY">DIRECT DEMOCRACY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
city of Rossland, British Columbia has regularized direct 
democracy through the use of citizens initiatives.
<P>
	Rossland has adopted a constitution that gives taxpayers the 
right to challenge council's decisions. It has energized 
community participation, protected the public process from 
interest groups, saved taxpayers money and surprise, it has not 
resulted in irresponsible decisions.
<P>
	One hundred and fifty years ago politicians wondered aloud if 
lay people could be trusted to vote. A century ago they 
questioned whether women could handle the power of suffrage.
<P>
	Today some politicians ask the question: Can the average 
citizen be trusted to make decisions between elections? Well 
history reveals and the experience in Rossland confirms that the 
answer is a resounding yes.
<P>
	Let us put aside our private political agendas and get on with 
the agenda of the people by giving citizens a way to challenge 
and even initiate federal legislation.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOCIALPROGRAMREFORM">SOCIAL PROGRAM REFORM</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last night in Toronto, the Prime Minister told his 
audience what he thought of the unemployed and people on 
welfare. To him, these are unproductive people who, and I quote, 
``sit around at home drinking beer''. That is how the leader of 
this government referred to people who feel rejected and 
insecure because they have lost their jobs and have very little 
hope of finding new jobs in spite of all their efforts. Coming 
from anyone else, such comments would be unacceptable, and 
they are even more so, coming from the Prime Minister.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister, who has discredited those 
who are suffering the most in Canada and Quebec, to withdraw 
his insulting remarks and specifically apologize in this House 
today to those he so offended.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the Leader of the Opposition would read the whole speech, I also 
said that people on welfare and unemployment insurance have 
only one desire, and that is to have the dignity of work, and that 
they do not want to sit around doing nothing. Perhaps the term I 
used was unfortunate, but I did mention, and that was the theme 
of our election campaign, ``the dignity of work''. I said there 
were people who were at home doing nothing, and I could have 
said it differently. If this was offensive, I apologize. What I 
meant and what I said repeatedly during the election campaign 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3328"> 3328 </A></B>
<P>
and what I say when I travel across the country today, is that 
people want all governments and all members of this House to 
work together to create jobs. They are sick and tired of partisan  
squabbling. Instead of concentrating on the real issues which are 
about giving everyone dignity and jobs, they talk about 
independence, separation and constitutional problems, at a time 
when people want jobs. These people want to work. If I offended 
anyone, I apologize. The hon. member should have read the 
whole speech. It is a reflection of our election platform-dignity 
and work.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it was not a slip of the tongue, because the Prime 
Minister also said that he wanted to break the current attitude of 
the unemployed.
<P>
	I think the Prime Minister would have gained in stature if he 
had simply apologized today. The case would have been closed, 
and we would have gone on to other matters.
<P>
	How can he stand there and refuse to apologize and withdraw 
what he said, when in his election campaign, he promised the 
needy and the unemployed he would give them renewed hope 
and dignity? His reference to people sitting around drinking 
beer reflects prejudice and contempt.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	Should we be surprised that this government is so insensitive 
and so intent on attacking social programs-the Prime 
Minister's strategy to break the attitude of the unemployed?
<P>
	What kind of message is being sent to potential employers 
who may want to hire these unemployed workers, when they are 
told they are lazy and good for nothing?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the Leader of the Opposition had read the text or had been there, 
he would have known that I said Canada's workers are the best. I 
said that Canadians spend the most on training and giving 
people the advantage of a university education, and that we 
spend more than any other Western country on education in this 
country. I was very positive in what I said. I said I was an 
optimist who was confident in the skills of Canadian workers 
and in Canada's future.
<P>
	However, these are difficult circumstances, because at a time 
when we want to take specific action to improve the situation in 
this country, we have an opposition that is intent on destroying a 
country that could provide long-term guarantees for all workers 
in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I may remind the Prime Minister that we were not the 
ones who said that the unemployed were people who sat around 
at home drinking beer, and that separation is not the issue here. 
What is the issue is respect for people, and beyond our social 
programs, we must still respect the dignity of people who are 
suffering.
<P>
	Instead of trying to enlist newspaper editors in his crusade 
against the needy, the Prime Minister should have, I 
believe-and today, I want to ask: Does he agree that he should 
have offered them a real job recovery program to restore the 
hope and dignity of the unemployed and the needy?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is exactly what we are trying to do. We are proposing 
changes in Canada which are absolutely needed at this time to 
find jobs and give the people the dignity of work.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition is always talking about 
jurisdiction and the Constitution, not caring at all about the real 
problems of people getting jobs.
<P>
	I repeat what I said in a speech that the best workers in the 
world are the Canadian workers. They do not want to stay home. 
They are not happy when they do not work. They are not happy 
not being productive. They want all of us to work to make sure 
they get jobs and have the dignity of work. They do not want us 
to talk about the Constitution or jurisdiction. They want us to 
create jobs and this government will do that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can the 
Prime Minister of Canada be surprised at the criticism directed 
at a system that only results in unemployment and misery? How 
can he be surprised at this?
<P>
	For two weeks now, the federal government has been in total 
disarray over the issue of social program reform. As a result, 
war has been declared between the provinces and the federal 
government.
<P>
	To top it off, we learned today that the Minister of Human 
Resources put on quite a show, even though he did not write the 
script. He said: ``We did not have a document to table because, 
quite frankly, I still do not have one in hand. I have not presented 
any proposals to Cabinet or to my caucus. I am not ready to do so 
yet.''
<P>
	That is what the Minister of Human Resources said. Can the 
Prime Minister confirm whether the moratorium his Minister of 
Finance referred to yesterday and that was agreed to by his 
ministers and the Quebec Minister of Finance is due to the 
improvisation to which the Minister of Human Resources 
Development admittedly resorted?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> I do not 
understand what the hon. member is saying. He is always saying 
that we must consult.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3329"> 3329 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	When the minister rises and, in all honesty, says to the people: 
``I cannot put any proposals on the table right now because I 
want to sit down with all my counterparts and explore different 
options in order to get the results that we all want'', this is an 
approach that will benefit employment in the country and help 
people acquire the dignity that comes through employment. 
Now the member is getting all upset because the minister is 
holding consultations.
<P>
	Would the member prefer it if the minister showed up with a 
clear, final plan and used the majority in this House to push it 
through in one week? We could do it, but that is not our style. 
Our style is to convince all provinces and all stakeholders that 
we must work together in the interest of creating jobs and giving 
workers some dignity.
<P>
	I cannot understand why the member does not want us to hold 
consultations. We will have to make a note of that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we to 
understand from the Prime Minister's wishy-washy answer that 
a moratorium has now been declared and negotiated, as his 
Minister of Finance indicated yesterday, between his ministers 
and the Quebec Minister of Finance? Has a moratorium been 
declared, yes or no, and is it due to the lack of preparedness on 
the part of his Minister of Human Resources Development who 
is doing a poor job?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development had called a 
meeting for Monday. Several governments said they were not 
ready yet and would like a few more weeks. The government 
agreed to a moratorium-if you want to call it that-to give 
them time to prepare. The Minister of Finance has done the same 
thing. There have been more consultations between the Minister 
of Finance and his provincial counterparts in the last six months 
than ever before in Canada.
<P>
	Since they have asked us for more time, we will give them 
more time, because we want everyone to work together to find a 
good solution. However, the system will have to change one day 
because if it does not, unemployment will continue to increase, 
people will grow discouraged and they will lose even more of 
their dignity.
<P>
	All parliamentarians, whether federal or provincial, have a 
duty to work toward a common goal, that is creating jobs, 
enhancing productivity, increasing the country's wealth and 
building a better society than the one we have now.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BOSNIA">BOSNIA</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	The recent kidnapping of Canadian soldiers, the detention of 
other UN personnel and increased offensive action in and around 
Gorazde make it rather obvious that Serbian leaders have little 
appreciation or respect for the UN forces deployed in Bosnia or 
the will of the UN to take effective action.
<P>
	The situation in Gorazde is at or even past the critical stage. 
Many people are dead, many more wounded and many are in 
imminent danger.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has spoken with President Clinton and I 
understand cabinet met this morning. Has the government come 
to a decision as to whether to support the UN in its request for air 
strikes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I agree with the description of the situation illustrated 
by the hon. member's question. Clearly the situation has 
evolved in a totally unacceptable way.
<P>
	Efforts have been made to bring all the parties to the table to 
agree on a peace plan. Unfortunately, while the Croatians and 
the Muslims have agreed and have signed an agreement in 
Washington, the Bosnian Serbs have not been willing to 
co-operate and participate in peace operations.
<P>
	Requests have been made by the Secretary-General of the 
United Nations to apply a solution similar to that applicable to 
Sarajevo and the other free areas in Bosnia.
<P>
	Cabinet met this morning. It was decided that as we have done 
in the past on an undertaking by the Prime Minister, when there 
is an important decision of this nature to make, we will consult 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	This is why the House leader has been instructed to consult 
with his counterparts to agree to an emergency debate tonight on 
this very question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplemental is for the Minister of National Defence. However I 
want to acknowledge the co-operation of the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs in agreeing to our request for this debate this 
evening.
<P>
	The minister will be aware that the Canadian forces 
commander in Bosnia has now refused to deploy his forces into 
Serb controlled territory out of concern for the safety of his 
troops.
<P>
	If air strikes are initiated, what further action will the 
government take to protect Canadian forces from possible 
retaliation?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3330"> 3330 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would rather not deal with this hypothetical situation in today's 
very emotionally charged context.
<P>
	I think we have to acknowledge the fact that 
Lieutenant-Colonel Moore has taken the right decision to 
minimize the danger to his people in and around Visoko. 
However any further steps and any further anticipation of 
difficult action will have to be measured by him as the hours and 
the days go by. I do not think that we should prejudge anything 
he may do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
Canada agrees to NATO carrying out the air strikes, has the 
minister discussed with the United Nations the commitment of 
more UN troops, and is the government considering sending 
more Canadian troops to Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a request was made some time ago by the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations to have much larger 
contingents of troops in the area than the one that is currently 
there. Unfortunately so far very few countries have responded 
positively.
<P>
	Although Canada at some point was wondering whether we 
were pursuing peacekeeping missions, we have agreed to 
commit the same level of troops, close to 2,000 soldiers, serving 
under the UN for another six months.
<P>
	Clearly we believe that our own effort is taxing our troops 
substantially. Canada would like to see other countries respond 
more quickly to the UN secretary's request. Unfortunately this 
has not taken place.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> Mr. Speaker, like 
my colleague from the Reform Party, I would like to put my 
question to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. We know that the 
final decision of the 16 NATO countries regarding air strikes is 
to be made tomorrow. I would like to know where negotiations 
stand, particularly with respect to Russia's position.
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, it is very difficult for me to state the position of the 
Russian authorities. We read, as the hon. member probably did, 
the dispatches saying that the Russian authorities are 
ambivalent about the proposals that were made. On the one 
hand, the Russian authorities deplore the Serbs' lack of 
co-operation and think that the Bosnian Serbs should have 
responded to the invitation and joined the Croats and the 
Moslems in signing a peace agreement. On the other hand, they 
expressed certain reservations about the use of air strikes.
<P>
	At this time, I can only say that discussions are going on 
between the various authorities who want this conflict to end as 
quickly as possible, and I think that we will have to wait for 
these discussions to be completed before we know the exact 
position of every power involved in this conflict.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I 
would have liked to know is when NATO members decide 
whether or not to step up the air strikes, will the Russian 
representatives be consulted first, unlike what was done before? 
Could the minister tell us whether contacts were made between 
NATO and Russian leaders?
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> When I had a 
chance to speak with President Clinton yesterday, I raised this 
point with him. I asked him what was happening with Russia. He 
told me he would communicate with the Russians as he had 
placed a call at about the same time, and I will speak with him 
again tonight. He assured me that Mr. Yeltsin would be 
contacted before NATO makes a decision tomorrow morning.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The government is about to undertake a thorough review of all 
social programs including the unemployment insurance system. 
At a time when the Prime Minister ought to be demonstrating 
compassion and understanding to unfortunate Canadians, he 
insults them with insensitive remarks.
<P>
	I am reminded of last fall when he chastised Kim Campbell 
for her arrogant intellectualism in using the same beer drinking 
analogy.
<P>
	A successful overhaul of the social safety system will require 
skilful and understanding leadership. On the basis of his 
remarks last evening, could the Prime Minister explain why 
Canadians should have any confidence that he is able to meet 
this challenge?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the member would take the time to read my speech she would see 
what I said.
<P>
	In my speech I said that Canadian workers are the best in the 
world and are the best prepared. I also said that Canadian people 
do not want to stay home doing nothing; they want to work.
<P>
	Perhaps I used one word there that I should not have used. I 
could have said something else. Sometimes in a speech one uses 
a word that perhaps in context is misplaced, but I clearly said 
that they want to work. I know this, since I have served in 
Parliament for a long time. Canadian people desire to work. A 
lot of people  say: ``Don't do anything''. On the contrary we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3331"> 3331 </A></B>
<P>
want to do something. Nobody likes to be on welfare. Nobody 
likes to be on employment insurance. They want jobs.
<P>
	This is why we have created some programs and are trying to 
apply the resources of government to programs where the people 
who are unemployed will be productive. This is what we want to 
do. It is the program of the government.
<P>
	Some people are arguing that we want to do it too fast. That is 
one of the problems, that we were too keen to solve the problem. 
Some of the provincial governments were afraid that we were 
moving too fast. Yesterday the premier of Ontario made a speech 
in which he said he wanted to work with us and find some 
solutions.
<P>
	We will take the time that we need because we believe in the 
dignity of the people. Rather than refusing to do something, we 
are working on it. We hope the hon. member will support us in 
our endeavours.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no 
dignity in being unemployed in the country and being accused 
by the Prime Minister of sitting home drinking beer. My 
supplementary question is for the Prime Minister as well.
<P>
	Several provinces have expressed hesitation about the 
government's intentions concerning total wide open social 
reform. Is the Prime Minister's recklessness with words going to 
help or hinder this extremely sensitive process?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
something that pleases me today is that this is the first time a 
question has been asked by a member of the Reform Party about 
the unemployed people of Canada.
<P>
	When they get up in the House they are always telling us: 
``Cut, cut, cut. Don't help them. Let them starve''. It is not our 
way. Our way is to earn their respect and we are working hard on 
it. I am very pleased to see the Reform Party is now waking up to 
the reality the unemployed people want the government to help 
them.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health. As part of the action plan 
on smuggling announced in February, the government included 
a $3 million or so anti-smoking media campaign to inform and 
educate the public, particularly young people. Now, the word 
came out that after meeting with groups of young people, the 
minister has decided to terminate the ad campaign.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	Can the minister confirm in this House what she has already 
recognized publicly, namely that this anti-smoking campaign 
was cancelled because, by her own admission, it had no impact 
whatsoever on young people?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for her question. I must first say that I 
have indeed inherited the ad campaign you may have seen 
recently. This campaign was launched by the previous 
government, and as I travelled across the country, I was 
confirmed in my personal opinion. When I first saw this ad 
campaign, I was not convinced that it suited the present 
situation, as it had been devised three or four years ago. Young 
people have confirmed that I was right all along.
<P>
	I have asked my department to review all the ads-and that is 
what we are doing right now-to ensure that every dollar spent 
on publicity is spent as wisely as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
minister not realize that this prevention campaign was the very 
last thread of credibility she had in the eyes of the anti-tobacco 
lobby following the reduction by her government of consumer 
taxes on tobacco and that now she has none left whatsoever?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me advise members opposite that while I am reviewing all 
public relations and publicity I have many tools at my disposal.
<P>
	I have said that we would look at new ads. Yes, we are going to 
continue doing some publicity, but it will have to be very tough, 
very targeted and very effective because we do not have a lot of 
dollars to spend foolishly. Any dollars that I spend I will spend 
very wisely.
<P>
	As a result we are developing a new campaign which I am 
going to share with members of the anti-smoking lobby as well 
as provincial governments. We are working together on the 
campaign to make it as effective as possible.

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	For the first time in its 28-year history the Canada pension 
plan has been forced to dip into its contingency fund. Many 
Canadians believe that unless it is reformed it is only a matter of 
time before the Canada pension plan runs out of money.
<P>
	What plans does the government have to preserve the Canada 
pension plan for the long term?

<HR>
<B><A NAME="3332"> 3332 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is worrying unnecessarily. The plan is 
operating very much as expected. The CPP fund was established 
to meet the contingencies as outlined by the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, in spite 
of the hon. member's reassuring words, many analysts suggest 
the aging of our population means that the Canada pension plan 
cannot survive as currently structured. The situation is so bad 
that many Canadians do not expect to collect CPP when they 
retire and think of CPP premiums as a tax on youth.
<P>
	The CPP has now turned a corner. Premiums are no longer 
keeping up with payouts. Does the government have specific 
proposals for CPP reform?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps I should present some facts to the hon. member.
<P>
	In the long term the fund intended to operate as ``a pay as you 
go'' with contributions and benefits more or less in balance. It 
was intended to hold two years of benefits as a buffer against 
fluctuations in the economy. The fund now has about three years

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Public Works. In response to the 
questions I asked him yesterday, the Minister of Public Works 
said that BioVac offered to sell its flu vaccine for $1.85 a dose 
compared to $1.69 for Connaught. By dividing the contract 
equally between Connaught and BioVac, the minister claims 
that the government will pay $1.77 a dose.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Public Works admit that the figures he 
advanced yesterday are inaccurate since, in the tendering 
process, BioVac bid $1.70 a dose compared to $1.46 for 
Connaught, and that by dividing the contract in two, the 
government will pay not $1.77 a dose as the minister said 
yesterday, but $1.85 a dose? Could he admit that his figures are 
inaccurate?
<P>

	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to confirm to the 
hon. member that the facts I have are quite different from the 
ones she has.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
minister admit that by awarding 100 per cent of the contract to 
BioVac, the only Canadian maker of flu vaccine, at $1.70 a dose, 
he would have saved Canadian taxpayers more than $600,000 
and preserved high-tech jobs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's concern with regard to the fiscal responsibility and 
capacity of the Government of Canada, but I find it passing 
strange that when it comes to human resources we are accused of 
not consulting with the provinces.
<P>
	When two companies, BioVac and Connaught Laboratories 
get together, consult with provincial governments, territorial 
governments and the Government of Canada and agree to a 
blended price thereby providing jobs and economic 
opportunities in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, somehow 
the hon. member finds that to be despicable.
<P>
	The hon. member should know that BioVac was charging 
$1.85 a dose, Connaught, $1.69 a dose. The blended price is 
$1.77.

	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	According to recent news reports as many as 24,000 former 
refugee claimants whose claims were rejected after a hearing 
have not yet been removed from Canada. Since most of them are 
not allowed to work this will place an additional burden on the 
taxpayer.
<P>
	Can the government advise the House how many people are in 
this category, when the removals will proceed, and can we be 
assured that these circumstances will not impair the integrity of 
Canada's refugee program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. friend and 
colleague for Scarborough-Rouge River.
<P>
	I can say to the hon. member and to the House that the number 
is lower than the 24,000 being thrown around by the media. 
Approximately 10,000 of those individuals, would be claimants 
have been refused but because of previous policy directives 
have not been removed. For instance the individuals from the 
People's Republic of China as well as other countries fall into 
that category. As you know, Mr. Speaker, the government is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3333"> 3333 </A></B>
<P>
actively pursuing a strategy of how to clarify that status in 
fairness to them and to the system.
<P>
	An anticipated one-third of those individuals are no longer in 
this country and therefore are not a financial drain. There are 
also individuals in detention and in our prisons and there are 
some cases where the processing of a particular case has fallen 
between the cracks as sometimes happens with governments.
<P>
	I ask the member to recognize that the government has moved 
on allowing work permits for refugee claimants while they wait 
for their cases. We have had approximately a 70 per cent take-up 
of claimants asking for work permits. As the Prime Minister 
said moments ago, not only could we give them the dignity of 
work but also lessen the load on our social service programs.

Mr. Speaker, we did not agree with the United States position in

	The hon. member should realize we have already begun the

	At the same time I remind the hon. member we are continuing

further $3.1 billion in 1995-96. The Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business has recommended there be no grants to 
businesses.

	When the red book promised substantial savings can be

not want these grants, why is this government planning to spend 
billions of dollars this way in the next two years?

estimates book for the Department of Industry he will see there 
have been tremendous cutbacks in the department.

	He will also notice from an analysis of the industry estimates 
we are very carefully targeting the taxpayers' money relating to 
industry. We are targeting it to the proven winners in our

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-6, an act 
to amend the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act, the Canada 
Petroleum Resources Act and the National Energy Board Act 
and to make consequential amendments to other acts, as 
reported (without amendment) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources)</B> 
moved that the bill be concurred in.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> When shall the bill be 
read the third time? By leave, now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan</B> moved that the bill be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	She said: Madam Speaker, hon. members, I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to speak before this House today during 
third reading of Bill C-6, an act to amend the Canada Oil and 
Gas Operations Act, the Canada Petroleum Resources Act, and 
the National Energy Board Act.
<P>
	The main purpose of Bill C-6 is to give the National Energy 
Board the authority to regulate frontier oil and gas activity. It 
will not however affect offshore Newfoundland and Nova Scotia 
where petroleum management is shared under 
federal-provincial accords. Bill C-6 will ensure that the frontier 
regulatory process is more transparent as decisions will be taken 
by an experienced independent organization.
<P>
	Essentially the National Energy Board's main responsibilities 
will be: protection of worker safety; maximizing resource 
conservation by ensuring good oil field practices; and protection 
of the environment.
<P>
	I am very sensitive to concerns regarding protection of the 
fragile environment of the north and other frontier areas. 
Consistent with efforts to better integrate environmental 
considerations in policy decisions, a review of the proposed 
legislative changes was conducted co-operatively by Natural 
Resources Canada and the National Energy Board. It concluded 
there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3337"> 3337 </A></B>
<P>
would be no adverse environmental impacts as a result of the 
proposed amendments.
<P>
	The government is also committed to real and meaningful 
consultations with all key stakeholders and views this as a 
critical feature of the legislative process. Wide-ranging 
consultations with interested parties have been held at all stages 
of the development of this proposed legislation. These included 
both provincial and territorial governments, native groups, 
industry, and environmental organizations.
<P>
	Let me turn to some of the issues that were raised during 
second reading and committee consideration of Bill C-6.
<P>
	Concern was expressed by some members of this House 
regarding the impact Bill C-6 may have on provincial 
jurisdiction over frontier resources.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This bill will have no impact on jurisdiction over offshore 
regions of Quebec and other frontier areas. It merely transfers to 
the National Energy Board regulatory powers which already 
belong to the federal government, and it does not affect any 
offshore frontier areas.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Further, there is nothing in the bill which would prejudice the 
outcome of any discussions with the territorial governments on 
the delegation of onshore responsibilities, or impact on 
discussions with other coastal provinces regarding future shared 
management arrangements.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	Some members also felt that in the exceptional circumstances 
of a future appeal the National Energy Board would somehow 
not be expert or independent enough to give industry a fair 
hearing. NEB decisions are not currently subject to outside 
review except by the courts and then only on questions of law or 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	The oil and gas committee appeal process is being abolished 
under this legislation because the integrity of the NEB process, 
and therefore its independence and effectiveness, depends 
heavily on maintaining this principle.
<P>
	The proposed amendments reflect our view that in the few 
instances this appeal function may be exercised it will be 
competently and objectively performed by the NEB.
<P>
	The National Energy Board already has diverse regulatory 
responsibilities. These include the licensing of the export of oil, 
gas and electricity; the issuance of certificates for international 
pipelines; and the setting of just and reasonable tolls. The 
National Energy Board is well placed to take on the authority to 
regulate frontier oil and gas as proposed in the amendments.
<P>
	I am fully confident that for all its responsibilities the board 
will continue its mandate to regulate in the Canadian public 
interest fairly and effectively, taking into consideration the 
views of all interested parties.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, what the government of Canada wants to do 
with this bill is to give clear and specific operating rules to the 
industry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Without these amendments the NEB will not be able to 
operate effectively and industry will continue to be faced with a 
time consuming approval process.
<P>
	The National Energy Board was given additional staff and 
responsibilities for frontier oil and gas in 1991. Bill C-6 would 
finally give the board the legal authority to do its job.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-6. 
However, since this legislation will now give the National 
Energy Board the official power to hear appeals and to give 
advice to ministers, we truly hope that the National Energy 
Board will hear our own appeal today and make sure that it does 
indeed give advice to government ministers, because they badly 
need it.
<P>
	In recent years, the federal government has agreed to provide 
financial support to major energy projects, or energy 
megaprojects, as they are called. Together, these agreements 
represent an initial commitment of over $3 billion. I must point 
out here, for the benefit of those who are listening to us, that one 
billion is a thousand millions. In the case of Hibernia, we are 
talking of 2,700 million dollars.
<P>
	These projects require considerable public funds which the 
government, of course, gets from already overtaxed Canadians. 
As we know, the middle class is already on its knees because it is 
overtaxed. In fact, the Auditor General of Canada himself said 
that taxpayers have the right to expect public expenditures to be 
managed with caution.
<P>
	Yet, what do we see? Again, the Auditor General had this to 
say: ``We examined the energy megaprojects assisted and 
funded by the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources. Our 
observations on the Hibernia, Lloydminster Bi-Provincial 
Upgrader and Regina NewGrade Upgrader projects point to 
some fundamental weaknesses.''
<P>
	Let me mention five weaknesses noted by the Auditor 
General. First, the lack of a comprehensive set of clear and 
measurable objectives. Second, an inadequate co-ordination of 
benefit monitoring. Third, deficiencies in monitoring 
environmental 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3338"> 3338 </A></B>
<P>
assessment recommendations and commitments. Fourth, 
continuing gaps in effectiveness measurement. That brings me 
to the fifth and final point, although we could have listed many 
others, but we will stop at five. The fifth point is limited  and 
poor reporting to Parliament and the public in Part III of the 
Main Estimates.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	The Auditor General adds:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Another key problem we noted in the Hibernia and Bi-Provincial Upgrader 
agreements was the lack of a connection between performance and payment. 
Federal payments are based on project expenditures, and not on construction 
milestones or achievement of certain intended economic benefits that have been 
specifically identified with these projects. Even if the Department determined 
through its monitoring efforts that certain intended benefits were not being 
achieved, it would have no legal basis to stop payments to the projects.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Then, the Auditor General stresses that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Without a direct connection between performance and payment, the payment 
is in the nature of a grant.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are talking about billions of dollars that were given to 
companies involved in the Hibernia project and which are in fact 
grants. In other words, the Auditor General is telling us that the 
thousands of millions of dollars, all taxpayers' money, which 
were invested in these projects, supposedly to create jobs and 
create all kinds of industrial benefits, are meaningless since the 
government has no legal basis to guarantee the intended 
benefits.
<P>
	Of course, following this statement by the Auditor General, 
the department took the following commitment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Department is devoting additional resources to the monitoring function, 
particularly with respect to industrial and employment benefits.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Jobs, jobs, jobs. This government was elected on the promise 
to create jobs. Therefore the least we should expect is that the 
taxpayers' hard-earned money which is invested in big projects 
helps create jobs at home. But such is not the case. In spite of all 
the promises made by the department I just mentioned, an Act to 
repeal the requirements concerning Canadian participation was 
enacted only a few months ago.
<P>
	According to a document coming directly from the Minister 
of Natural Resources, this is what this bill does essentially:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The highlights of this bill are the elimination of the minimum 50 per cent 
Canadian participation as a condition to grant a licence for oil and gas 
production in frontier areas; the elimination of the need to obtain the minister's 
approval to transfer, in whole or in part, ownership rights under a licence 
contract to produce oil and gas in frontier areas; and the repeal of the present 
regulation under which certain individuals may hold production licences and of 
related requirements regarding the place of residence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In short, not only is the federal government unable to legally 
guarantee definite spin-offs for the billions of dollars of 
taxpayers' money it invests in such ventures, it deliberately lifts 
the minimum requirements imposed on companies to which it 
gives money so that they can create jobs in Canada.
<P>
	We recognize that, in the last few months, some 
improvements have been made regarding the management of 
this project, but they have not been as far-reaching as we would 
have liked. An in-depth assessment of the project should have 
taken place before work began, not after.
<P>
	Where is all this leading us? The government goes and takes 
billions of dollars from already overtaxed Canadians and 
Quebecers. It gives money to big companies over which, as the 
Auditor General said, it has hardly any control. It allows them to 
create jobs elsewhere. Jobs, jobs, jobs for Korea, not for us. In 
the meantime, we can be sure that, no matter what we do, our 
horrendous $500 billion debt will grow to $600 billion in three 
years, if everything goes well, because otherwise it could be a 
lot worse. The truth is, as things stand today, we are on the verge 
on bankruptcy.
<P>
	We can also be sure that unemployment rates will remain 
exactly the same and that young people will have no jobs. The 
only solution this government could find was to cut 
unemployment benefits and old age pensions; such was its 
choice.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Of course, the unemployed, the people of modest means, 
those without voice or clout, would not accept this situation if 
they were not, first of all, made to feel guilty, to feel that they are 
the real problem in Canada.
<P>
	The statements by the Prime Minister, last night on television 
and this morning in the newspapers, show that this policy is 
actively pursued.
<P>
	I would like to quote today's <I>Le Droit</I> which carries a headline 
that reads: ``Loafers cost $500 billion: their attitude must be 
broken'', which I hasten to say were perhaps not the words used 
by the Prime Minister. He said, according to the article: 
``Canadians have to break that mentality, because the country is 
$500 billion in the hole. We cannot keep people sitting at home 
drinking beer''.
<P>
	I object to what the Prime Minister said today. I consider that 
a frightful statement. I remind the Prime Minister that the 
former Hyundai employees who lost their jobs are not 
beer-drinking loafers. They are out looking for work.
<P>
	The fishers of Gaspé who can no longer go out and fish are not 
beer-drinking loafers, they are looking for work. The former 
employees of the CNR, the CPR or MIL Davie in Lauzon, that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3339"> 3339 </A></B>
<P>
cannot get government contracts to build ferries, are not sitting 
at home drinking beer and watching TV. They are looking for 
work.
<P>
	Young people, among whom unemployment is sky high, who 
come out of school with two university degrees and go bankrupt 
even before they start their productive life are not beer drinkers 
and television addicts, they are looking for work.
<P>
	I urge the prime minister to come and visit my riding of 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies on Monday morning and meet the 
people who come to me, hoping I can find them some work. I do 
not know what he would tell them, but if he were to tell them that 
they are beer-drinking loafers, I am sure they would have 
something to say to him.
<P>
	It is known that Quebec provides almost 25 per cent of federal 
tax revenues in Canada and that, in most Canadian job creating 
reinvestments, benefits that Quebec is getting are not equal to 
the revenues that it provides, whether it is in research and 
development, in federal acquisitions, in army spending or in 
funds for agriculture and megaprojects.
<P>
	In the case of Hibernia, although Quebecers will pay 
approximately $800 million in federal taxes for that project, 
over and above the grants that will have to be given for each 
barrel of oil coming out of Hibernia if the international price is 
not high enough, the future of the MIL shipyards in Lauzon 
remains bleak and lay-offs are predicted for 1994.
<P>
	Although Lauzon's shipyards are in fact the only one to have 
built drilling platforms in Canada, including 13 for Texas in the 
early 1980's, the federal government has stuffed the province of 
Newfoundland with contracts awarded without any bidding: the 
building of concrete bases, the building of the five 
super-modules. The other contracts were awarded to foreign 
firms, after the federal government had abolished the 25 per cent 
tariff on the importation of oil platforms that had been in place 
since 1983. And that is one of the fundamental reasons why 
things are going badly in this country, because billion of dollars 
are invested in the creation of jobs somewhere else, and the 
unemployed of this country, that have been created by the 
government, are being called beer drinkers and lazy bums who 
just watch television.
<P>
	There was also the building of a large-capacity shipyard in 
Bull's Arm, which was paid for with a regional development 
fund of $300 million. They agreed to go ahead with the 
modernization of the Marystown shipyard and a vast manpower 
training program for Newfoundland.
<P>
	Therefore, if the Bloc Quebecois approves the passage of Bill 
C-6 at third reading, it becomes the duty of all members of this 
House to make sure that megaprojects like Hibernia really 
generate the spin-off benefits promised both by this government 
and its predecessor, because taxpayers of Quebec and Canada 
are entitled to expect such benefits.
<P>
	As for the outrageous statements of Canada's Prime Minister, 
he may be sure that Quebecers will remember them during the 
next provincial election and the referendum which will surely be 
held in the months to come.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be the only 
speaker for the Reform Party on this matter and I shall be brief.
<P>
	Bill C-6 is mostly housekeeping. As we stated earlier in the 
House, we will endorse its basic thrust which is to transfer 
regulatory authority over frontier oil and gas development from 
the political arena to an independent body, the National Energy 
Board. We believe that this action is also endorsed by most of 
the industry stakeholders.
<P>
	This bill does have one glaring weakness which we were 
unable to remedy in committee. It gives the National Energy 
Board unlimited power to determine what is or is not a 
significant discovery or a commercial discovery and to make 
unilateral decisions affecting certain technical operations.
<P>
	Aggrieved parties will be able to appeal a board decision only 
to the board itself so that a single quasi-judicial body becomes 
in effect judge, jury and executioner. Questions of law of course 
could be further appealed to the courts by any party willing to 
accept the cost and long delay of such actions. But questions of 
fact, technical decisions, could not be challenged.
<P>
	Industry representatives have indicated to us that the National 
Energy Board as presently constituted functions well, has 
knowledgeable personnel and has a good track record.
<P>
	Our concern is that we are looking at the board in a snapshot in 
time. We do not know what it will be like 10 or 15 years from 
now. Bill C-6 nevertheless gives it an extraordinary amount of 
power with no checks or balances.
<P>
	Laws are like contracts. They should be written to deal with 
worst case scenarios, not under the assumption that all 
concerned parties will be forever noble, rational and fair.
<P>
	In committee we attempted to rectify this problem with 
amendments to allow final appeals of board decisions to a 
second independent body, the oil and gas committee as defined 
in the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act. Having failed to win 
this safeguard in committee, the Reform Party will not 
vexatiously continue to pursue a cause which is already lost.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCEACT">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert)</B> moved that Bill 
C-218, An Act to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act 
(excepted employment), be read the second time and referred to 
committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank all the hon. members 
who have expressed support for this bill. Unfortunately, they 
could not all be listed in the Order Paper because there are too 
many of them. As we know, pursuant to our Standing Orders, no 
more than 20 names may appear on the list of seconders 
published in the Order Paper. Allow me then to extend my 
thanks in this House to those members whose names are on the 
list as well as to all the others who, without being listed, support 
me nonetheless.
<P>
	Bill C-218 is a bill to repeal paragraph 3(2)(c) of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act. It may sound technical but in 
fact, I am simply asking this House to repair a serious injustice 
done to nearly one million Canadians, of whom 650,000 are 
women.	
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	We all remember the omnibus reform of the unemployment 
insurance system. We are now starting to appreciate the extent 
of its social effects, some of which are plainly discriminatory.
<P>
	The former Unemployment Insurance Act clearly excluded 
from entitlement to benefits any person working for his or her 
spouse or a company controlled by his or her spouse. The 
legislation was clear and simple, and openly discriminatory. No 
one would ever want of such a system today. In those days, a 
woman working for her husband was automatically excluded 
from contributing to the plan and receiving benefits. It was 
clearly stated in the act and regulations.
<P>
	This act was challenged before the courts and tested under the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Predictably enough, the courts 
moved to restore the entitlement. Because the Act applied only 
to spouses, and not to all people operating at arm's length, 
former paragraphs 3(2)(c) and 4(3)(d) of the Act were ruled 
invalid and ill-founded by the Human Rights Tribunal of the 
Federal Court-Appeal Division, the Tax Court of Canada and 
the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	The present Act was enacted on October 23, 1990, and 
paragraph 3(2)(c) was amended to reflect the judicial decisions 
regarding its unconstitutionality. The Conservatives found a 
way to get round the problem in their legislation. From then on, 
women working for their husband were no longer the only ones 
excluded from benefits under the Act.
<P>
	From now on, everyone not dealing at arm's length with their 
employer is excluded from benefits. In this way, legally, the law 
no longer seems discriminatory. Any employees not dealing at 
arm's length with their employer are no longer automatically 
entitled to benefits. Apparently, the employer's son, brother or 
junior partner, as well as the woman working for her husband, 
are now on an equal footing. They must all show a Revenue 
Canada official that they are ``clean'' because it is up to that 
official to determine if the employee is cheating or not.
<P>
	The law is clear: if someone worked for an employer with 
whom he was not dealing at arm's length, he will have to prove 
that the job would have been given to an outsider under the same 
conditions.
<P>
	Just read paragraph 3(2)(c) to convince yourself at first 
glance of the different way the Conservatives treated employees 
who were ``guilty'' of working for a relative or a spouse.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3341"> 3341 </A></B>
<P>
	No other category of unemployed person has to prove to the 
satisfaction of the Minister of National Revenue that he is not 
trying to defraud unemployment insurance, but the law requires 
relatives and spouses to prove it.
<P>
	At first, it may seem normal to pay particular attention to the 
cases of people whose job might give rise to obvious collusion 
by the employer.
<P>
	In some quarters, people might think that fathers and sons, 
husbands and wives, brothers and sisters are potential cheaters. 
For many people, it is not a real job if the employer is a spouse or 
a relative. It is only a step from this view of the labour market to 
the conviction that people not dealing at arm's length are out to 
cheat the government, a step which the Conservatives gladly 
took by passing the new Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
	Before, the law applied only to spouses. But no matter, since it 
was discriminatory, they had to go one better. By submerging 
the category of spouses in the whole category of those not 
dealing at arm's length with an employer, they thought that they 
had really solved the problem.
<P>
	Since spouses were no longer the only ones excluded, the law 
was no longer discriminatory. It was not discriminatory because 
it automatically excluded from benefits anyone whom the 
Income Tax Act considered not to be dealing at arm's length, not 
just spouses.
<P>
	The presumption of honesty in all these cases is now replaced 
with a presumption of fraud. It is now up to the employee to 
prove to the discretionary satisfaction of the income tax official 
that the labour contract has all the features of a job that the 
employer would have given to someone completely unrelated to 
him.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	In reviewing the claim, the official can conduct every 
investigation he deems appropriate at the employer's place of 
business. He can, in particular, check financial records, 
approach clients and suppliers, look at bank statements, 
examine work flow in the plant or office, and interview third 
parties. In short, the official can pursue his investigation as far 
as he considers necessary to form an opinion. In fact, that is 
exactly the way things are done.
<P>
	These thugs' only goal is to demean recipients. The smallest 
doubt can lead to exclusion. They do not try to determine 
eligibility but to prove that a fraud has been committed.
<P>
	I stress that investigations are conducted by the Source 
Deductions Division of Revenue Canada, Taxation. After the 
investigation is completed, Revenue Canada gives its opinion to 
the unemployment insurance people who then decide whether to 
pay or withhold benefits.
<P>
	Withholding benefits triggers off a series of administrative 
and judicial appeals. First, a review application is filed with the 
Appeals Division of Revenue Canada. If the decision is upheld, 
a final appeal can be made to the Tax Court of Canada. Then, if 
the unemployed person still has strength, resources and a good 
deal of optimism, he or she may go to the Federal Court of 
Appeal as a last resort. The minister or the taxpayer can still 
appeal to the Supreme Court against the Federal Court's 
decision.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the unemployed person-usually a 
woman-lives off her hopes while trying to understand why she 
is being singled out by the system.
<P>
	Why is the employer's spouse or relative being penalized? 
How do we justify such actions? Why do we assume that a 
certain class of employees are cheaters? Why are we more 
distrustful of relatives than of strangers? Is it easier to cheat 
between relatives than between residents of a small village 
where they all know each other so well that they feel like 
family?
<P>
	It is unacceptable for legislators to use distrust to enforce the 
law. That is exactly the effect of the current paragraph 3(2)(c).
<P>
	Under the act, spouses and relatives are considered as 
suspects. The government tells them they are not like other 
citizens because they worked for a spouse or a relative. It then 
asks them to prove their honesty.
<P>
	What democratically minded Canadian citizen can accept 
such an attack on fundamental values? Mr. Speaker, it may be 
that employees and employers who are married or related to 
each other cheat the UI system, just as perfect strangers may and 
do commit fraud, perhaps with even greater ease than within a 
family. But the criminal provisions of the act are explicit and 
punitive enough to cover all fraudulent claims.
<P>
	What is objectionable in this case is that it is up to the 
unemployed to prove as soon as they file the claim that they did 
not commit fraud. No other class of beneficiaries must bear such 
a burden of proof. Not only could this person be liable to 
prosecution, to criminal prosecution, for breaking the law, but it 
would be assumed that from the outset of the application 
process, the person intended to commit fraud.
<P>
	I would be just as stunned, but perhaps less motivated to ask 
for the repeal of paragraph 3(2)(<I>c)</I>, if it applied to a wide range 
of wage earners. But, in point of fact, the legislation targets a 
clearly identifiable group. In my view, the primary effect of the 
legislation, whether intended or whether the result of social 
circumstances, is the systematic exclusion of women who work 
for their spouse.
<P>
	There are 650,000 women in this situation, Mr. Speaker. If 
they were to lose their job, these wage earners who work in a 
business managed by their spouses, who work ``in partnership'' 
with them, so to speak, would currently be excluded because of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3342"> 3342 </A></B>
<P>
their status from  receiving unconditional unemployment 
insurance benefits.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Women who fall into this particular category of wage earner 
account for the vast majority of excepted employment cases 
provided for in paragraph 3(2)(<I>c)</I>. Furthermore, when we look at 
the persons designated by the cumulative provisions of the 
Income Tax Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act, we see 
that the group that is excluded the most is women who work with 
their spouses. There is no point denying this fact. The current 
law denies women the right to equality in the area of 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Some will say to me that if the law is so discriminatory, then 
the courts will tear it to shreds as soon as the opportunity arises. 
Let the courts do their jobs then, they will tell me. My answer to 
them would be that it is incumbent upon legislators to amend 
their laws. The courts intervene only as a last resort to correct 
any injustices that may flow from the legislation. And, until 
such time as a final court of appeal rules on a fundamental issue, 
how many cases will have been abandoned for lack of resources 
or hope? To leave it up to the courts to make the law is to 
abdicate our own political and social responsibilities.
<P>
	I would also say to these people that even if the courts did not 
find the legislation to be discriminatory from a legal standpoint, 
we should still intervene to point out the unfair aspects of the 
law from a human and political standpoint. And finally, 
unfortunately, even though the legislation institutionalizes this 
injustice, I do not think that the Canadian courts, using 
modern-day criteria, would find it discriminatory. Technically 
speaking, it is not discriminatory. However, given our social and 
demographic reality, the ramifications of the legislation would 
indeed be discriminatory. It is the main reason why we must act 
now and act fast. The courts will not do it.
<P>
	In its 1990 reform, the now defunct Conservative government 
had managed to get around the gains made before the courts by 
women who work in partnership with their spouse. Indeed, 
several decisions had sent very clear messages to law-makers. 
The old act was invalid because it discriminated against spouses 
engaged in a working relationship. As a result of these 
decisions, women working for their spouse were entitled, albeit 
for a very short period of time, to premiums and benefits. But 
that was before the Tories' social conscience got the upper hand.
<P>
	The break was short-lived. Through its 1990 amendments, the 
Mulroney government caught up with these women and sent 
them back to square one. It was done under the cover of an 
extremely confusing piece of legislation in which the 
amendment went nearly unnoticed. By putting spouses in a 
seemingly larger group, those in a non-arm's length situation, 
the new legislation is probably true to the Charter of Rights and  
Freedoms. I believe that, as in a recent case the Supreme Court 
ruled on, the courts would be very reluctant to find paragraph 
3(2)(c) invalid. I am referring to the Symes case on which the 
Supreme Court rendered its decision in December 1993.
<P>
	It involved a lawyer who wanted to claim her child care 
expenses as operating expenses. We know that under the Income 
Tax Act, the maximum allowed for child care expenses is 
$1,000. She wanted to claim the whole amount of her child care 
expenses, just as it can be done for entertainment expenses. 
After all, if golfing expenses are deductible, why should people 
not be allowed to claim child care expenses incurred as a result 
of their work?
<P>
	Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dubé of the Supreme Court found 
that the legislation had to be analyzed according to its concrete 
results in today's context. Finding that it had been proved that 
child care expenses were nearly always borne by women, she 
concluded that in today's social context, the Income Tax Act 
must be interpreted and enforced in the light of the Charter. She 
ruled in favour of the lawyer because, in her case, the law would 
have discriminatory effects.
<P>
	I share this opinion based on a progressive and 
context-sensitive approach to the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I agree with Justice L'Heureux-Dubé, who said that when 
issues are examined in context, it becomes clear that certain 
so-called objective truths may apply only to the circumstances 
of a particular group in society, while the process may be 
entirely inadequate in the case of other groups.
<P>
	Unfortunately, that was not the majority opinion in the Symes 
case. The courts are not likely to introduce contextual analysis 
of the law very soon. They will continue to abide strictly by the 
letter of the law, as they did in this case.
<P>
	The Supreme Court therefore refused to examine the 
constitutional aspects of the appeal, after concluding briefly 
that the Income Tax Act contained its own system of reference. 
For tax purposes, the law treats all taxpayers the same.
<P>
	In fact, any individual may deduct child care expenses, 
although in most cases today, these expenses are paid by women. 
I am convinced that the courts would react similarly when asked 
to rule on paragraph 3(2)(<I>c</I>) of the Unemployment Insurance 
Act.
<P>
	I think it is useless to wait for a final decision from the 
Supreme Court and that we should act immediately to provide 
for fair treatment of women employed by their spouses and, in 
fact, for all Canadians employed by a family member.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3343"> 3343 </A></B>
<P>
	Women who work in partnership with their spouses, and who 
often contribute to our GDP while giving up a substantial share 
of their remuneration, should be treated with the respect they 
deserve as active members of the labour force.
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I do not need the additional 
minute.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to speak against this bill.
<P>
	As I understand the bill presented by the hon. member the 
changes proposed to the Unemployment Insurance Act would 
revoke the arm's length provision that is used by unemployment 
insurance adjudicators to determine if spouses employed by 
their spouses are in fact in a true employer-employee 
relationship and therefore insurable and eligible to collect UI 
benefits should they be laid off. This is the intent of this bill.
<P>
	Therefore, the net effect of the bill would be to allow all 
spouses employed by their spouses to become eligible to collect 
UI benefits without giving the government any means of 
determining if it is an employer-employee relationship and 
whether that relationship is in fact legitimate.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance officials predict that this change 
would result in at least 2,000 illegitimate claims for 
unemployment insurance each year. Considering that the 
average benefit paid to each claimant in 1992 was $6,613, we are 
talking about a minimum annual increase in UI payouts of about 
$13 million.
<P>
	If we used the figures from the hon. member's own office the 
payout could exceed $26 million a year. If we consider the 
increase in UI claims from spouses when everyone finds out that 
the government has no means to investigate and control the 
possible abuse in the system, the number of claims will increase 
and the number of dollars paid out to illegitimate claimants will 
also increase.
<P>
	That is the main point I am trying to make. If we approve this 
the number of claimants will dramatically increase because 
spouses will be able to put their own husband or wife on UI and 
we find this totally unacceptable. Not only will the costs be $13 
million or $26 million, they will go way beyond that.
<P>
	We oppose this bill because it opens up the Unemployment 
Insurance Act to more abuse and the wasting of more taxpayers' 
dollars when we should be tightening up the loopholes and 
saving employer and employee UI premiums for legitimate UI 
claims.
<P>
	It would be helpful for everyone to have a bit of a history 
lesson on how this issue has developed.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	Prior to August 1988 all those employed by their spouses were 
not insurable under the UI act. In August 1988 the Federal Court 
of Appeal confirmed a decision by the Canadian Human Rights 
Tribunal that this section of the UI act was discriminatory on the 
grounds of family status.
<P>
	In order to provide a test to ensure the validity of the 
employer-employee relationship the government included in 
Bill C-21 an arm's length relationship clause. Pursuant to 
section 3(2)(c) the employment of a person that is not at arm's 
length is not insurable employment unless the terms and 
conditions of employment are substantially similar to a 
non-arm's length employment contract. We feel that is 
sufficient. The possibility is there that if the claimant wishes to 
insure his or her spouse, they have the availability to do so.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance relies on Revenue Canada to make 
the determination of the arm's length relationships between 
employers and their employee spouses. Between 80 per cent and 
90 per cent of Revenue Canada's decisions rule that an arm's 
length relationship does exist.
<P>
	This favours the husband, wife, or spouse relationship and the 
spouse is therefore insurable in most cases. It would seem to be a 
very reasonable approach to handling these cases. Senior 
officials at the unemployment insurance office agree with this.
<P>
	It is clear to all of us if this bill is approved it would result in 
the federal government having no control over UI claims filed 
by spouses. That control would virtually disappear. It would 
open up a loophole so wide that thousands of people could walk 
through it.
<P>
	The likelihood is that when the general public realized the last 
element of benefit control had been removed from the UI act in 
regard to spousal employment, the number of illegitimate UI 
claims would increase. That is the point I am trying to make. 
Probably they would increase dramatically.
<P>
	The potential for abuse is a greater concern for Canadian 
taxpayers than any other consideration. We are constantly 
receiving complaints about the raid on the public purse by UI 
abusers and fraud artists.
<P>
	We believe the unemployment insurance program should be 
returned to a true insurance program based on sound financial 
principles. This private member's bill does nothing to move in 
this direction.
<P>
	A broader concern we would like to raise is whether there can 
ever be a true arm's length working relationship between 
husbands and wives.
<P>
	An employer who employs their spouse already has an added 
tax benefit because the income of the business is split by two 
wage earners living in the same household. Should an employer 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3344"> 3344 </A></B>
<P>
also be allowed to lay off their spouse whenever they want and 
then have that spouse collect unemployment insurance? We 
think not. I think it is obvious as to why that would not work.
<P>
	We believe we should be looking for ways of tightening up the 
system rather than opening it up for more abuse.
<P>
	The hon. member makes the point that this is discriminatory 
against women. I would like to remind the House that a spouse 
can be either a man or a woman.
<P>
	Canadians want the UI system to be fair. The current system 
of having Revenue Canada determine if employers and their 
employee spouses are legitimate employer-employee 
relationships is fair. This section of the UI act is more than fair 
and for this reason we oppose it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on this bill introduced by my 
hon. colleague.
<P>
	The proposal invites us to consider a topic most important to 
this House and indeed to the whole country: the financial 
integrity of the unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	Every member of this House knows the vital importance of 
small business. Every member personally knows of families in 
their ridings who work long hours to be independent, to achieve 
family goals, to contribute to their community. Every one of us 
is very much aware how difficult, demanding and rewarding a 
family business can be.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	The unemployment insurance program has been extremely 
important to thousands of family businesses across this country. 
In thousands of offices, stores and plants when the business has 
run into a temporary slow period, revenue cannot support the 
employment of a family member and the person has been laid 
off, unemployment insurance has been there.
<P>
	The family employee who has contributed along with the 
other employees of the company to the unemployment insurance 
account and qualifies for a claim has received temporary income 
from the unemployment insurance program. Many family 
business members have been able to receive help for training, 
help in searching for a job with another firm, help in seeking 
work elsewhere.
<P>
	Along with millions of other Canadians, people who have 
been employed in a family firm have obtained their rightful 
benefits. Thousands of Canadians have also worked for small 
business corporations with which they have had close 
relationships. These men and women have also benefited from 
the unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	Throughout Canada these two groups have received regularly 
their rightful benefits which they have earned as legitimate 
employees of legitimate enterprises. They confirm that they are 
genuine participants in our unemployment insurance program 
and they obtain the temporary income while they seek new 
employment.
<P>
	For hundreds of thousands of these Canadians the present 
Unemployment Insurance Act has been there in their time of 
need. That is the intent of the act.
<P>
	My hon. friend who has introduced Bill C-218 is rightly 
concerned about the unemployment needs of family small 
businesses. Every member in this House I am sure shares her 
concern.
<P>
	Every one of us knows family enterprises in our ridings which 
have experienced difficulties in recent years. A father, mother, 
sister, brother has faced unemployment when business has 
turned down. Regrettably there are too many families who have 
served the community for 10, 25 and even 50 years and suddenly 
are no longer in business.
<P>
	The record shows that these families have been well served by 
the unemployment insurance program. For example, in the 
fiscal year 1992-93 family businesses filed tens of thousands of 
claims for unemployment insurance benefits. Of those, 15,000 
cases were reviewed and 75 per cent were confirmed as 
qualifying for benefits.
<P>
	This position of the vast majority of claims by employees of 
family businesses has been most satisfactory, from the 
viewpoint of the employer and employee who finance the 
program, and from the viewpoint of the administrators who have 
the fiduciary responsibility to collect and to disperse the funds.
<P>
	All members of the House who are familiar with the purpose 
of the unemployment insurance fund understand that a balanced 
and fair approach must be maintained. They know that funds are 
to be dispersed to respond to lack of income because of 
temporary and involuntary unemployment and to expedite 
return to employment by claimants. This is the mandate of 
Human Resources Development Canada.
<P>
	These are funds collected from employers and employees to 
alleviate temporary lack of employment by those who have 
contributed. Any other treatment of these premiums collected 
for specific purposes does not come within the scope of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	The government has a responsibility to manage these funds 
with prudence and fairness, ensuring that to the greatest possible 
extent for those who have contributed, the misfortune of 
unemployment is alleviated. To act otherwise is to risk the 
integrity of the entire unemployment insurance program, to go 
beyond the bounds of responsibility, competence and the 
financial stability of the fund.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3345"> 3345 </A></B>
<P>
	This is not to say the Unemployment Insurance Act does not 
require examination, review and revision by the House. As the 
Minister of Human Resources Development has clearly pointed 
out, all our social programs do indeed require reform. This view 
has the support of Canadians. They require a comprehensive, 
forward looking, perhaps sweeping reform to ensure they all 
meet the needs of Canadians as they enter the 21st century.
<P>
	Therefore, I feel it would be premature to look into the 
application of unemployment insurance to the isolated 
situations where the employer and the employee are not dealing 
with each other at arm's length.
<P>
	We all share the concern of the member who has introduced 
this bill. Each one of us has in our own riding family businesses 
that have been in difficulty. We know employees of family 
businesses who have needed and obtained the benefits for which 
they have paid.
<P>
	I suggest that this bill for all its intent of responding to the 
difficulties of family businesses is not quite what this House 
would consider an appropriate contribution to our legislation at 
this time.
<P>
	I suggest that this question would be better considered as part 
of our general review and reform of our social programs which 
is now under way. I can assure the hon. member it will be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again 
today I appreciate the opportunity of commenting, this time on 
unemployment insurance in support of Bill C-218, introduced 
by the hon. member for Saint-Hubert.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to exclude from the definition of 
excepted employment, employment where the employer and 
employee are not dealing with each other at arm's length. That 
this bill was tabled shows that we on this side of the House are 
very much aware of what is happening in our ridings.
<P>
	Every day, unemployment insurance claimants knock on the 
doors of our riding offices and ask for our help because they feel 
they are not being treated fairly by federal unemployment 
insurance authorities. In fact, these people are fed up with the 
way they are being treated.
<P>
	They often feel powerless before the legislation and the 
almighty bureaucracy. The problems with unemployment 
insurance are many and complex. Unreasonable delays, 
erroneous decisions and unwarranted investigations often haunt 
the lives of claimants and make a mockery of their rights.
<P>
	I am sure members opposite also see many people in their 
offices with problems concerning unemployment insurance. If 
they really want to stand up for the interests of these people, 
they certainly should support this bill.
<P>
	Since this government came to power, however, the Liberals 
have chosen to forget the people at the bottom of the ladder. The 
break with the grass roots has been very quick and very obvious. 
The government's decisions and actions are a clear indication of 
this development.
<P>
	We should realize that the purpose of the unemployment 
insurance system is to provide support, during a specific period, 
for claimants who are out of work. The objective is quite clear 
but unfortunately, the legislation, the way it is administered and 
the whole bureaucracy around it often obscure the actual 
purpose of this program. It is the applicants who suffer the 
consequences.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Of course, the main problem of all these people is the lack of 
work. If our economy produced enough long-term jobs, all these 
problems with unemployment insurance would be less or go 
away, but such is not the case. In my riding, Laurentides, the 
unemployment rate is 18 per cent. If we add to this large 
percentage all those who are no longer looking because they are 
discouraged by the non-existent job market and all those who 
must rely on welfare, we come up with a frightful jobless rate of 
30 per cent. I am very worried about this.
<P>
	All these people are also very worried. The unemployed face 
great tension and uncertainty. Imagine that you are the head of a 
household with children and suddenly you lose your job. You 
now receive only 57 per cent of your former income, soon a mere 
55 per cent, as the callous Liberals decided, to support your 
family. It is a great worry and concern for people who 
unwillingly become unemployed.
<P>
	Unfortunately, some say that one gets used to unemployment 
and others will even say that for some it is a way of life. Far be it 
from me to make such tendentious allegations. No one in our 
society wants to collect unemployment insurance. No one gets 
up some fine morning and says, ``Well, this morning I want to 
lose my job and become a paid unemployed person.'' No one 
sincerely or voluntarily desires such a situation. On the 
contrary, people do want to work. They want lasting, well-paid 
jobs. I do not think that receiving a reduced cheque every week, 
looking for work day after day and finding none is paradise for 
the unemployed people in my riding.
<P>
	The people opposite do not understand what is going on out 
there and they stupidly bury their heads in the sand, unable to 
deliver the goods they promised so much during the election 
campaign. Their promises are turning into crumbs. Crumbs 
from the infrastructure program that will only create or maintain 
some 45,000 jobs to meet the needs of 1.5 million unemployed. 
A real joke, a real farce from the clowns opposite who 
increasingly arouse laughter and scepticism from everyone.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3346"> 3346 </A></B>
<P>
	In my riding, this miraculous Liberal program will solve 
nothing. It is a drop in the bucket, providing only insecure 
short-term jobs. That is what we get from the conjurers 
opposite.
<P>
	What are you waiting for to come up with a real employment 
policy? What are you waiting for to create and establish new, 
intelligent, promising programs? What are you waiting for to 
give technical and financial aid and support to companies and to 
individuals who want to create new businesses? What are you 
waiting for to invest massively in research and development? 
Nothing, you are waiting, you are in neutral and, I even believe, 
in reverse in many respects.
<P>
	But what is even more disappointing and heartbreaking from 
the Liberals is that not only have they forgotten about jobs, they 
are cutting unemployment insurance. They are taking from 
people whom they offer nothing, whom they are not giving a 
chance. The conjurers opposite reason backwards.
<P>
	This whole everyday reality of the unemployed creates 
definite problems for them. One of these problems is related to 
the Unemployment Insurance Act and Bill C-218 would 
eliminate it by recognizing a 1989 Supreme Court decision that 
excluding spouses from unemployment insurance is 
discriminatory. Unfortunately, the insensitive Conservative 
government in 1990 made life more difficult for spouses. I can 
tell you that in my riding, where many people hire their spouses 
to meet the needs of the tourist season, we have hundreds of 
these problem cases due to paragraph 3(2)(c) of the Act. These 
spouses, mostly women, go through a real nightmare when they 
apply for benefits. To collect benefits, employees related by 
blood, marriage or adoption must convince the officer that their 
job is justified and that they are not cheating.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	So this employee carries the burden of proof, with all the 
inquiries that this provision implies. These inquiries have 
become almost systematic and impose unacceptable delays for 
people who often badly need these unemployment benefits.
<P>
	Furthermore, since the burden of proof is theirs, we generally 
consider these people abusers of the system. Such an attitude is 
unacceptable in a democracy, a free world where everyone is 
presumed innocent until proven otherwise. Once again the main 
victims of that provision are women. We women can take a lot. 
Approximately 650,000 women would be in that category.
<P>
	I therefore ask the members from the other side to approve 
this bill, I ask the women of this House to bring these facts to the 
attention of their male colleagues in order that we may redress 
this injustice done against women by repealing this provision of 
the legislation.
<P>
	We must trust in ourselves, trust in others if we want them to 
trust us and the system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to rise on such an important occasion to speak 
about unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I recently spent two weeks in my riding. People are concerned 
about the high cost of unemployment insurance to Canada, not 
only to employees and employers but to the taxpayer. They are 
concerned about abuse of the system. I have seen some of that 
abuse firsthand.
<P>
	Abuse of the UI system results in higher costs for employees, 
employers and our entire tax system. It results in higher costs of 
goods and services. Removing the safeguard that is in place 
regarding spouses paying each other has the potential for a 
tremendous abuse problem in the future. I see it rising very 
greatly if we remove this safeguard.
<P>
	I recognize that if spouses are not allowed to collect benefits 
on an arm's length transaction they should not be expected to 
pay premiums either. We do have a problem here that needs to be 
addressed but let us address it directly and not try to do an end 
run on the problem. There are other people who have to pay 
premiums. Although I am a farmer I worked off the farm for 
some time. I had to pay premiums and never could collect. That 
needs to be addressed.
<P>
	If spouses are not allowed to collect because they do not 
qualify under the arm's length test, let us introduce a bill to deal 
directly with the problem. This discriminatory practice should 
not be continued.
<P>
	The government has promised to bring in a review of the 
entire unemployment insurance program. It is a welcome 
review, one for which the people of Canada have been waiting 
for a long time. Let us listen to what Canadians have to say in 
these hearings on this issue as well as others. I believe they are 
going to be telling us that they want to stop abuse of the system.
<P>
	We have young people in Canada who have never seen either 
parent bring home a pay cheque or hold a real job other than one 
through unemployment insurance. I say that is a tragedy. A 
program that was started with very good intentions, to provide 
help for people in time of temporary crisis, has become a way of 
life for a lot of people. We see it continuing from generation to 
generation.
<P>
	This practice has to be stopped not just for the taxpayers but 
for those very young people who are going to fall into that same 
cycle. It is not conducive to good self-worth and the sooner we 
end that practice, the better. I am concerned that by removing 
the safeguard that has been put in place to stop abuse in the case 
of spouses employing each other will just add to that further 
abuse. Therefore, I cannot support this bill. I encourage 
members in this House to vote it down. A new bill should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3347"> 3347 </A></B>
<P>
introduced to deal with the problem where spouses have to pay 
premiums when they are not allowed to collect.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	I believe there is good intent here but it is misdirected. I 
certainly do not want to encourage any more abuse of our 
unemployment insurance system than we have now. Let us have 
a good thorough airing of this problem and the hearings that are 
going to be conducted throughout the country through the 
unemployment insurance review. I suggest we wait for that to 
happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill before us 
today addresses a concern of every person who knows, 
understands and values the family business today.
<P>
	The Unemployment Insurance Act stipulates that workers 
who are related to their employer are covered by unemployment 
insurance if they qualify as do other workers. They work under 
the same sort of employment contract as other workers who are 
not related to the employer. Their employment is insured and 
they pay premiums.
<P>
	This means that if they become unemployed they will also be 
able to claim any benefits for which they are qualified. Factors 
such as rate of pay, conditions of employment, length, type and 
importance of their work will determine whether or not their 
employment is insurable. Clearly the basic question of 
providing equal coverage to family businesses has been dealt 
with in the existing legislation and the guidelines for 
administration of unemployment insurance provisions are set 
out.
<P>
	In the last four years how have family businesses fared in 
participating in the benefits provided to alleviate involuntary 
temporary unemployment?
<P>
	I am confident that a brief survey of the situation in the typical 
riding will reveal this scenario. Family businesses which have 
paid into the unemployment insurance account found they 
needed the benefits. They filed their claims for the husband, 
daughter, mother or son who had to be laid off. They 
demonstrated the legitimacy of the claims and they received the 
benefits to which they were entitled. The benefits for which they 
may qualify include a broad range of services designed to help 
them end their temporary involuntary unemployment.
<P>
	Special benefits particularly relevant to a family business 
include the following: 15 weeks of maternity benefits in the 
period surrounding the birth of a child; 10 weeks of parental 
benefits available to natural or adoptive parents, either mother 
or father, or shared between them as they deem appropriate; and 
a flexible combination of regular, sickness, maternity, and 
parental benefits. More than one type of special benefit can be 
claimed within the same benefit period up to 30 weeks. In 
addition claimants may receive special benefits in combination 
with regular benefits.
<P>
	We can well imagine the situation where a mother and father 
are operating a business together. One of them becomes ill. This 
immediately threatens the entire future of that business. Under 
unemployment insurance provisions today the person who is ill 
may claim benefits which can help maintain the income of that 
person and help to keep the family business alive.
<P>
	Tens of thousands of legitimate businesses with legitimate 
claims for benefits for which the employer and the employee 
have paid are receiving those benefits. The responsible 
competent management of the unemployment insurance fund 
has produced billions of dollars in benefits. These benefits have 
helped to ensure the financial survival of countless numbers of 
families who are operating their own businesses.
<P>
	Then there is the case of a family business experiencing a 
slowdown and which must let go perhaps a daughter or son who 
is an employee. For many of those persons unemployment 
insurance has provided benefits while starting a new business to 
meet a new need in the marketplace.
<P>
	This is just one example of how flexible and versatile the 
Unemployment Insurance Act can be to provide real solutions to 
real problems.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	I suggest that each of us inquire among families we know that 
have benefited from the present act and learn their opinion. I 
believe that people who know the breadth and depth of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act will tell us that this act does serve 
well legitimate family business with a legitimate claim.
<P>
	The anomalies which can eventually appear in any act are best 
dealt with in a comprehensive way in the context of all the social 
programs which the federal government provides.
<P>
	I believe that in spite of the intentions of the hon. member 
who introduced this bill this proposal is not in the best interest of 
family businesses, of any people who participate in our 
unemployment insurance program or of all Canadians.
<P>
	During the Easter recess I had the opportunity of holding three 
meetings in my riding in connection with the social security 
review. I had good attendance at these meetings and I had people 
from across the county and people who were involved in 
providing support services to our citizens. I can say that the 
recommendations I received were wide ranging and will add to 
the national debate that is occurring on this matter in Canada 
now.
<P>
	I believe all of us as members of Parliament should consult 
our ridings to pass on their concerns to the minister. I and my 
staff have prepared a report of my meetings to pass on to the hon. 
Minister of Human Resources Development for his 
consideration in this process. After I have given the report to the 
minister I would be happy to share it with any interested 
members  who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3348"> 3348 </A></B>
<P>
would like to conduct such meetings on this very important 
review.
<P>
	I believe the bill before us should also be considered within 
the social policy review. It is best for us to consult the people of 
Canada on this crucial issue, for it is their money we are working 
with.
<P>
	There was discussion on unemployment insurance and how it 
might be improved. The general feeling is since it is an 
insurance plan perhaps those who are most likely to become 
uninsured should pay a higher premium than those who are 
employed in a more secure occupation, a sort of pay as much as 
you are likely to need plan.
<P>
	There is also a great deal of concern, as the hon. member 
across the House pointed out, for abuses within the system. 
There are people who spend most of their time collecting 
unemployment benefits and not contributing to the plan. I do not 
suggest that family businesses are necessarily one of those.
<P>
	Another thing that I have learned in my brief five months as an 
MP is that to a lot of our constituents we can fix anything. We are 
supposed to know everything and we are supposed to be able to 
fix anything that goes wrong. As you would know from your 
experience, Mr. Speaker, they do not always distinguish 
between federal plans, provincial plans, municipal plans or even 
private plans.

<BLOCKQUOTE>``That this House, taking note of the tragic events which have taken place in and 
around Gorazde, and NATO's agreement in February to a UN request for the use of 
air support to protect a safe area around Sarajevo, consider the request contained in 
the UN Secretary General's April 18 letter to the Secretary General of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization to extend arrangements similar to those in place to 
protect Sarajevo to the five other UN safe areas in Bosnia'';</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, the government promised at the 
beginning of its mandate to consult Parliament and Canadians 
on major foreign policy issues. As I said during the debate on the 
review of our foreign policy, Canadians care about their 
country's foreign policy. That is easy to understand when we 
look at all our peacekeepers overseas.
<P>
	Bosnia-Hercegovina is probably the most dangerous theatre 
in which our troops currently operate.
<P>
	The February slaughter in the Sarajevo marketplace prompted 
the international community to act with more strength and 
determination than before. Once again, the international 
community must take a firm and definite position on Bosnia 
after the totally unacceptable events that are taking place in 
Gorazde.
<P>
	Our goal, I repeat, is still to achieve a lasting peace in Bosnia. 
All our efforts in Bosnia have always been aimed at promoting 
the negotiating process. We must never cause the conflict to 
escalate. Only a diplomatic solution can bring lasting peace to 
Bosnia. All the parties involved in the conflict, especially the 
Bosnian Serbs, must realize that there can be no military 
solutions. We must find a way to get the peace process moving 
again, because the continuation of hostilities in Bosnia threatens 
the stability of the entire region.
<P>
	I must say that, despite all the efforts made by the UN, NATO 
and the European Union, as well as the specific initiatives of the 
Americans and the Russians, the situation is deteriorating 
rapidly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3349"> 3349 </A></B>
<P>
	After the Serbs attacked the city of Gorazde and violated the 
various ceasefires negotiated in the last few days, the UN 
Secretary General formally called on NATO to take all 
necessary measures to protect the five safe areas in Bosnia, 
Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde, Bihac, Srebrenica and Sarajevo, by 
launching air strikes mostly against Serb forces, unfortunately.
<P>
	The NATO Council discussed the issue yesterday and asked 
its military authorities to prepare various scenarios in response 
to the request of the UN Secretary General. Tomorrow the 
council will reach its decision on the UN Secretary General's 
request.
<P>
	We will have to take position at this meeting of the NATO 
Council. Before making that decision, we feel it is important to 
hear what parliamentarians have to say about this request from 
the Secretary General.
<P>
	We are giving an opportunity to government and opposition 
members to make suggestions. My colleague the Minister of 
Defence and myself will be listening to the speeches and, at 10 
p.m. tonight, there will be a special Cabinet meeting so that our 
instructions can be given to those who will be representing us at 
NATO tomorrow.
<P>
	I must say however that, in February, Canada did express 
reservations about using air power to protect Sarajevo. But in 
the end, we came to the conclusion that it was the only way to 
deal with a situation which was becoming critical. Canada's 
concerns were taken into consideration in making a decision at 
NATO in February. We also indicated very clearly that, in the 
event of a drastic change in the nature of UN operations in 
Bosnia, whereby our troops would no longer be involved in 
strictly peacekeeping activities, we might reconsider our 
military presence in Bosnia.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	I would like to point out that our representative to the NATO 
Council reiterated yesterday Canada's reservations about using 
air strikes. Air power alone cannot resolve the situation in 
Bosnia. We must make our decisions on the basis of our strategic 
objectives, which remain above all peace and negotiations.
<P>
	However, in view of the daily flood of horrifying images from 
Bosnia, we must not overlook the fact that significant progress 
was nonetheless achieved, as evidenced for instance by the 
support of a Muslim Croat federation. NATO and the UN had 
advocated, in February, stepping up operations to protect 
Sarajevo and relieve the city from the hellish conditions under 
which it has been living for far too long. We did manage to quiet 
guns and mortars without resorting to NATO air strikes.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the war mentality got the better in other 
regions of Bosnia. So, Gorazde was declared UN safe area. We 
have the duty to protect the populations which have taken refuge 
over there. However, last week's events in Gorazde show that for 
the international  community to step up operations entails risks. 
We must be fully aware of that.
<P>
	If we take a firmer approach, as requested by the Secretary 
General of NATO and proposed to NATO, we must do it with our 
eyes wide open and accept the consequences of our decision.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are also aware and must be aware that the conflict has 
evolved. The progress made in Bosnia is compromised by a 
totally uncontrollable Bosnian Serb army. We must recognize 
the very positive role that the Russians have played in seeking a 
negotiated solution to this bloody conflict. We must therefore 
attach more weight to the observations of the Russians in recent 
days about the intransigence of the Bosnian Serbs as a primary 
contribution to the current impasse.
<P>
	In this context it will be wise to take into consideration the 
Russian position in any eventual action taken by NATO. This is 
certainly something that we will be speaking about with our 
friends and allies in NATO tomorrow. If we want to end this 
conflict, certainly we have to tell the Bosnian Serbs 
unequivocally that what they are doing is unacceptable and 
cannot be tolerated.
<P>
	As we said in regard to Sarajevo, if they do not respect the 
ceasefire, if they do not respect the safe areas, they will risk the 
consequence of air strikes. As we also said in Sarajevo, we were 
ready to do it. Fortunately common sense prevailed and it was 
not necessary to use air strikes.
<P>
	We are going to be ready if need be to follow the same logic, 
the same strategy, in regard to the other areas where there are 
populations that are hostage to belligerents who resist the 
request of everyone to come to the table to sign a peace 
agreement.
<P>
	We obviously have to realize that the original mandate of the 
Canadian troops sent there to serve as peacekeepers and to help 
in the delivery of humanitarian aid is singularly compromised at 
the moment.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	The mandate in Bosnia of peacekeeping missions does not 
work and cannot work unless all parties agree to a peaceful 
solution to the conflicts. The only ones resisting so far are the 
Bosnian Serbs and we are determined to make sure that they 
understand they cannot perpetrate a war that all the other parties 
want to stop.
<P>
	Therefore, I believe that we have to make tough decisions in 
the name of peace and security. We will have to consult with our 
allies and design the appropriate recourse necessary to assist 
those who have the responsibility to implement peace in this 
area of the world.
<P>
	Canada has served brilliantly in the past on many UN 
peacekeeping missions. It has been a proud participant in NATO 
and has been ready to serve whenever asked in any type of 
capacity. If we can no longer serve under the UN on 
peacekeeping 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3350"> 3350 </A></B>
<P>
missions we might be asked to serve, and we will have to give a 
response in this regard,  under NATO to carry on very vigorous 
actions to clearly establish good sense in the minds of the 
Bosnian Serbs.
<P>
	Hopefully air strikes will not be necessary but we have to say 
tonight that if necessary there will be air strikes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first I would like to say that the government is to be 
commended for agreeing that this was an appropriate time to 
have a debate that will give all parliamentarians who wish to do 
so an opportunity to speak and, above all, to express the views of 
the opposition for the benefit of the government.
<P>
	After listening to the speech by the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, which I felt was a very responsible and very balanced 
presentation, I think we can reasonably expect that the House 
will unanimously approve this very serious decision the 
government must make. I believe it is very important to be able 
to proceed on the basis of a consensus of all political affiliations 
in this House.
<P>
	It is clear that the peacekeeping mission, as it has been 
defined thus far, has failed. First, because there is no peace. 
There is a war and even a regular slaughter of civilians. On 
television we see children killed and dismembered by shells. We 
see women dying, women who have been raped. We see a 
country that is a bloody battlefield, where 200,000 people have 
been killed in the past two years.
<P>
	Today, 28 people were killed in Gorazde. They did not die in 
battle but in the hospital, because the Serbs opted for the 
unthinkable strategy of attacking hospitals. Yesterday, a rocket 
launcher fired on the hospital, people in the emergency ward 
were killed and operating rooms were destroyed. Today, there 
was another attack on the hospital. It was not an accident but a 
deliberate decision to attack the hospitals. It is impossible to go 
out and help the wounded because they fire at the medical teams.
<P>
	There is no peace, and there is no will to make peace. There 
has been a lot of talk about negotiations. However, so far all 
negotiations have been marred by the bad faith of the Serbs. The 
violation of the cease-fire around Gorazde is a case in point. The 
cease-fires that were agreed on have been systematically 
violated. They were never even enforced. They were violated 
before the ink was dry.
<P>
	Speaking of violations, I am told that in the past three months, 
the Serbs violated at least 57 agreements on Gorazde and 
Sarajevo.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the peace talks are going nowhere. In fact, they 
are yielding no positive results because the Serbs refuse to join 
the Croats and the Muslims of Bosnia in their will for peace. We 
know that Croats and Muslims have signed an agreement but the 
Serbs refused to be part of it. In fact, we should be talking about 
Serb duplicity. They see the negotiations as an opportunity to 
lull the West while intensifying their efforts. Their  strategy is 
obvious. The Serbs pretend they are negotiating but in reality 
they are using that time to occupy more land and get into a 
strategic position for the events to come.
<P>
	This acknowledgement of failure leads us to believe that, 
given the current situation, the presence of the peacekeepers in 
Bosnia could even be prolonging the conflict. Instructions are 
not clear. The military do not know what to do. They cannot 
defend themselves. They could very well become helpless 
hostages if the Serbs get a notion to act along those lines. We 
absolutely must make a decision.
<P>
	We talk about our soldiers' safety in case of air attacks, but we 
must also talk about their safety as things stand right now. Our 
troops are in danger. The safety of Canadian soldiers is being 
threatened at this very moment. These soldiers cannot defend 
themselves; they must watch helplessly as hostilities take place 
with extreme speed and intensity.
<P>
	To conclude on the diplomatic aspect of the question, I think 
most of all that the credibility of western democracies and of the 
United Nations is at stake here. What is left of Canada's 
credibility as a peacekeeping country, as a country that is 
consistent in its policies and able to act in a coherent fashion? 
What will be left of the credibility of the British, the French, the 
Americans and the United Nations if we do nothing? It is 
because they knew how to play on our wish for peace and our 
pacifism that the Serbs have succeeded in occupying most of 
Bosnia and that they might be right now taking actions that look 
an awful lot like ethnic cleansing.
<P>
	In other words, the situation has reached a critical level. We 
must redefine Canada's mission. We must do so either by 
redirecting our peacekeepers' mission in that country or by 
withdrawing our troops altogether. But is that possible? The fact 
is that we have no choice, since the alternative is not an option, 
in practice or in principle.
<P>
	If we were to withdraw, what would it mean? It would mean, 
first of all, the end of humanitarian aid. Let us not forget that 
together with peacekeeping, even if we have failed at that, we 
are engaged in other operations such as protecting food convoys 
and supplying a minimum of water and sanitation, as well as 
drugs to save a few lives, where possible. In that respect, a lot 
has been achieved. It must go on.
<P>
	Second, the credibility of peacekeeping missions and the UN 
would be definitely jeopardized if we were to withdraw today. 
What would the world think of a total abdication by the UN and 
by NATO countries, if we were to withdraw now? Moreover, we 
would be abandoning the Bosnians. Try to imagine what would 
happen to them if we were to withdraw. All the more so as we 
have disarmed them. It is not well known that the embargo we 
declared against Bosnians has been so effective that they have 
no arms and are finding it increasingly difficult to  counter Serb 
attacks. And finally, we would open the country to possible 
territorial expansion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3351"> 3351 </A></B>
<P>
	We are dealing with a powder keg, with the Balkans, where 
several of the great wars started. We can already see the 
emergence of a threat from Iran. The Muslims' religious 
solidarity could come into play, as recent statements from Iran 
lead us to believe. To leave would allow the conflict to 
degenerate.
<P>
	Therefore, we must redefine the UN's mission. I think that we 
will all agree to answer the Secretary General's call and endorse 
President Clinton's proposal to apply the approach followed in 
Sarajevo to the six safe areas remaining in Bosnia. That means 
the use of air strikes, this time offensive ones preceded by an 
ultimatum. Let us not mince words. We are talking about a real 
ultimatum. The Serbs must know that if they do not comply with 
the specific request to free the six safe areas and surrender all 
their heavy armament, they will in effect decide to become the 
targets of air strikes.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	These air strikes, if unfortunately it came to this, must have a 
significant effect. The time for half-measures has passed. 
Strikes must target strategic positions. This would at least 
ensure the safety of our troops, in the event retaliatory strikes 
were subsequently launched against them. Heavy Serb 
weaponry must be destroyed if the Serbs do not respond to the 
ultimatums.
<P>
	Of course, we must protect ourselves. We must have the 
support of the Russians. I do not know if this will be possible, as 
the wire reports do not give us a clear picture of the situation in 
Russia. We do know that the United Nations Security Council 
will be meeting this evening in New York and that the Russians 
will be in attendance. They have the power to veto the Council's 
decisions. We have to get beyond the Security Council and hope 
that Russia will allow itself to be convinced by Western 
diplomacy to set aside its sympathy for the Serbs, considering 
how harshly it has been treated by the Serbs. Russian honour is 
at stake because the Russians vouched for the fact that the Serbs 
would respect the treaties and ceasefires, when in fact the Serbs 
violated them anyway. One must hope that the Russians will join 
the ranks of those who want peace to be restored to that area of 
the world.
<P>
	Furthermore, we are deeply concerned about the safety of our 
troops. We realize that this situation is extremely difficult for 
them. Our soldiers have already been taken hostage. 
Fortunately, they were freed. This time, we must ensure that the 
military backup is in place so that our soldiers cannot be taken 
hostage as easily as before.
<P>
	There is also the matter of additional troops that could be 
required. A number of military experts, including General 
MacKenzie, have indicated that ground support is needed to 
ensure the effectiveness of air strikes. Should additional troops 
be needed, and I do not know if they  will as this will be for the 
military to decide, I do not think that Canada ought to be asked 
to supply them.
<P>
	Canada's effort has already been substantial. Its troops 
account for 8 per cent of the forces in place, whereas it accounts 
for only 3 per cent of NATO's budget. Some countries still have 
not sent any troops yet to this area of the world. Some have not 
sent the numbers they should have. I think we should urge our 
allies and friends in NATO to match Canada's effort. I have no 
doubt that we would then have enough troops on the ground to 
sustain the attacks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc will support the implementation of the 
plan proposed by the American president and strongly advises 
the government to answer favourably to the call of the Secretary 
General of the United Nations.
<P>
	This is a case where we have to be united. This is a case where 
we have to fulfil a duty of international solidarity because 
humanitarianism calls for it and it is the kind of responsibility 
we have to show when the rights and democracy of people are 
directly threatened.
<P>
	I can assure the government that we will support any initiative 
which will be taken in the direction of my comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I want to again acknowledge and thank the government for 
agreeing to this debate this evening. Also, I want to register our 
great satisfaction that the cabinet will not meet to decide on this 
issue until after this debate has been concluded. This is a 
situation which Canadians should be involved in and it is a 
situation which should not result from partisan politics.
<P>
	The situation in Bosnia has become very serious and a 
decision soon to be taken will have great impact on the Canadian 
forces committed to the United Nations efforts in Bosnia. It will 
also have tremendous impact on Bosnian citizens who are in 
grave danger.
<P>
	Once again I would remind all that none of the antagonists in 
Bosnia can claim clean hands in this terrible confrontation. All 
have been involved in actions for which they could only expect 
world condemnation. However, it would seem that at this time it 
is the Bosnian Serbs who are responsible for the escalation and 
the continuation of the war in Bosnia.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you may remember that in my previous 
submission on Bosnia during the debates here on January 25, I 
suggested that Canada should take a lead role, and I quote: ``by 
hosting a conference here in Ottawa in early February before 
that Geneva meeting to include all countries with forces in the 
former Yugoslavia.  At this conference Canada should urge that 
the UN issue a clear and unequivocal ultimatum to the bellige--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3352"> 3352 </A></B>
<P>
rents: either accept moves to achieve an enforceable, peaceful 
solution or accept the withdrawal of UN forces''.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	That advice was overlooked or ignored. Now some three 
months later we find ourselves in an even more critical 
situation. We have had Canadian forces held hostage, detained 
and interfered with along with other UN personnel. We have had 
intense bombardment of a UN declared safe zone at Gorazde 
resulting in many casualties killed and wounded.
<P>
	It has become obvious that at least one of the protagonists in 
Bosnia has little appreciation for our purpose in being there or 
respect for the will of the United Nations to effect a peaceful 
resolution of the conflict.
<P>
	At the end of March Canada agreed to extend the commitment 
of Canadian forces in Bosnia for a further six months, taking us 
through to the end of September. But when that commitment was 
made there appeared to be light at the end of the tunnel and very 
good prospects of a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
<P>
	That has now changed and in light of that Canada should 
reassess the situation and reconsider our options. A withdrawal 
of Canadian forces is one option. Canadians are not ones to cut 
and run when the going gets tough and we have proven that to 
everyone's satisfaction. But in Bosnia right now we are 
relegated to being mere observers of atrocities, bloodshed and 
cruelty. If the Bosnian Serbs cannot somehow be convinced that 
they have to change their ways, is there any point in Canadians 
remaining involved, particularly when there seems to be every 
prospect that some will be placed in great danger and perhaps 
killed or wounded?
<P>
	Even President Yeltsin has agreed that the Serbs have violated 
their agreement. President Clinton said in a news conference 
that consultations are still going on and that while he cannot 
commit President Yeltsin to a course until he sees the U.S. 
proposal in writing, he can say that in general President Yeltsin 
agreed that the present understanding for air power was 
ineffective and that the Serbs plainly violated their agreement 
and overreached in Gorazde. But he feels, as everyone does, that 
over the long run NATO air power alone will not settle this 
conflict. It will have to be settled by negotiations.
<P>
	Without in any way suggesting that my council is as informed 
as either president, I agree with these assessments. Air power 
alone will not resolve the war in Bosnia. But the judicious use 
and firm application of air power may convince the Bosnian 
Serbs that their best interests lie in coming to the conference 
table to negotiate in good faith.
<P>
	As a result I would advocate that Canada should agree to the 
UN request for NATO air strikes on the condition that such 
strikes are called for by the commanders on the ground. It is 
important that when the air strikes are put in that they are put in 
with the knowledge and consent of the people who will be 
directly affected by any retaliation that may take place.
<P>
	Obviously air strikes are a weapon that can be used to great 
effect. The present proposal is for these air strikes to be applied 
directly in support of the enclaves or the one enclave at Gorazde. 
However, they could also be applied to the logistics chain, to the 
supply despots, to the ammunition dumps, to the roads and rail 
bridges that are providing the transport link for the Serbs to be 
resupplied. That I do not think is what we are considering at this 
moment, but it is another aspect that air power could bring to the 
situation if it is necessary.
<P>
	I think we should also consider the UN embargo on the 
provision of weapons to the Bosnian Muslims. When 
Vice-President Ganic was here two days ago in conversation he 
said that he thought that the UN was to a large extent responsible 
for the situation in Bosnia as a result of that embargo. He felt 
very strongly and spoke very eloquently that because of the 
disparity in the weapons capability between the Bosnian Serbs 
and the Bosnian Muslims that there was no way a reconciliation 
could be reached. He advocated very strongly that we drop this 
embargo and allow the Muslims to be armed adequately.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	In response to my question would this involve an increase in 
hostilities, he admitted that at the outset this could very well be 
the case but he was convinced that for a long term resolution of 
the conflict in Bosnia this was the only option that would give a 
real hope of that happening.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to commend the government for their 
position. I want to say that the Reform Party will be supporting 
them again. I think this is a decision that should be not taken 
along political lines but in the interests of Canadians. I think it 
would be unwelcome in the broad Canadian public right now for 
Canadians to withdraw their forces. I think we should stay there 
and attempt to see that a peaceful resolution is reached.
<P>
	However, I do think that it should be made plain that if we are 
there only to observe atrocities and further bloodshed that we 
will have to reconsider that option when the time comes.
<P>

	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs): </B>Madam Speaker, 
in September 1992, the UN Security Council broadened the 
mandate and increased the size of UNPROFOR to provide 
protection to humanitarian assistance convoys in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina, under the supervision of the United 
Nations High Commission for Refugees. Canada agreed to send 
about 1,200 more  troops and, by November 5, 1992, the second 
battalion group had been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3353"> 3353 </A></B>
<P>
deployed. In December 1992, the UN Security Council 
established a deterrent presence in the former Yugoslavian 
Republic of Macedonia. A company of the Second Canadian 
Battalion carried out this operation from January until March of 
last year.
<P>
	When these troops were relieved last autumn, the 
participation of Canadian forces in UNPROFOR was reviewed 
and increased to about 2,000 soldiers divided in two smaller 
battalion groups. Currently, almost 2,000 Canadians troops are 
supporting UNPROFOR efforts in Croatia and Bosnia- 
Hercegovina.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have taken a number of steps in the last couple of years. I 
believe the ones I have just mentioned outlined Canada's 
commitment to peace and stability in the former republic of 
Bosnia-Hercegovina of the former republic of Yugoslavia. It 
has been a great challenge to thousands of Canadians, friends 
and families of those who have been affected and those who 
have served in this particular theatre.
<P>
	We believe that the contributions that we have made in the 
past two years in the former republic of Yugoslavia, both in 
Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, have been significant. The 
Canadian forces have made a difference. They have saved lives. 
They have helped foster what peace there is in that region and 
have contributed effectively to the humanitarian effort.
<P>
	We are talking this evening about the massive deterioration of 
the situation in Bosnia. Bosnian Serb forces have been 
unrelenting in their attacks on Gorazde which is a designated 
United Nations safe area. On numerous occasions UNPROFOR 
officials have attempted to persuade Bosnian Serbs to halt their 
aggressive activities. So far these attempts have been 
unsuccessful and Bosnian Serbs remain. They have detained UN 
officials and impeded the delivery of humanitarian assistance.
<P>
	In this environment it is becoming increasingly difficult for 
UNPROFOR to fulfil its objectives. The international 
community and in particular NATO countries, the European 
union and Russia were faced with a fundamental dilemma of 
how to encourage co-operation without either escalating or 
widening the conflict.
<P>
	Taking into consideration all of the factors before him the UN 
Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has concluded 
that stronger military action is required.
<P>
	The House will recall that in February of this year NATO 
agreed to provide air support to protect the UN safe area of 
Sarajevo. Three days ago Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali wrote to 
Manfred Woerner, the Secretary General of NATO, requesting 
that the arrangement be made to protect the Sarajevo safe area 
and be extended to the five other UN safe areas in and around 
Gorazde, Srebrenica, Zepa, Tuzla and the Bihac pocket area.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday the NATO Council discussed this request and asked 
NATO military authorities to develop an operational plan. The 
operational plan that is being developed will cover such areas as 
command and control arrangements, selection of targets and the 
safety of UN personnel.
<P>
	In any agreement that Canada would have to the UN 
Secretary-General's proposal we would have to be assured that 
the command and control of such air strikes meet Canadian 
expectations and normal NATO requirements for effectiveness 
and safety. My military officials have been in touch with those 
of other NATO countries to ensure that if such strikes were 
permitted our concerns will indeed be addressed.
<P>
	The plan of the Secretary-General will define the size of the 
exclusion zones in and around each safe area and will specify 
how and under which condition air strikes will be used. Some 
members of the House will say that the government has in the 
past been opposed to air strikes and will wonder why we have 
not flatly opposed the UN Secretary-General's latest request.
<P>
	I would just like to better explain our position. My colleague, 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, has enlightened us this evening 
on his position.
<P>
	We have supported the use of air strikes for the protection of 
UN troops. We said that we would consider other requests as 
long as they took into consideration a number of factors, these 
factors being that air strikes contributed to the overall peace 
process, would not clearly associate the UN with one side, 
would not make it impossible for UN forces to assist in the 
delivery of humanitarian aid and would not expose UN 
personnel to unacceptable risks.
<P>
	There has been much discussion of the American plan posed 
by President Clinton yesterday. It was a much more 
comprehensive plan which goes beyond Mr. Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali's request and this plan not only includes the 
extension of air support projecting Sarajevo to other safe areas 
but also calls for tighter sanctions aimed at limiting the ability 
of Serbia and Bosnia to wage war and for a high level meeting 
between the United States, Europe, Russia and the United 
Nations.
<P>
	Tomorrow morning, as my colleague, the secretary of state for 
foreign affairs has said, the NATO Council will meet to consider 
the operational plan that is being developed by military 
authorities and to discuss President Clinton's proposal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3354"> 3354 </A></B>
<P>
	Of course, any decision NATO takes will have an impact on 
UNPROFOR and more specifically we will have to look closely 
at whether all of these proposals will change the nature of the 
UNPROFOR mission. In addition, we will have to look at the 
operational plan to determine its military viability and its 
impact on the safety of UN personnel.
<P>
	We have known from the start that deploying forces in the 
former Yugoslavia meant exposing our personnel to some risk. 
This concern has been with us since the beginning of the mission 
and the situation in Srebrenica as well as the incident last week 
involving 16 members of the Canadian forces when they were 
detained by Bosnian Serbs reminded us that the risks were very 
real.
<P>
	I would like to pay particular tribute at this point to those 16 
individuals and to the other United Nations observer, a 
Canadian, being detained.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> A member of our force is in Gorazde today as 
it is being shelled to pieces. A Canadian is there and we pray for 
his return.
<P>
	The decision tomorrow will not be taken lightly but as my 
colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, has said, too often in 
the past nations have turned a blind eye to wanton aggression. 
Too often we have accepted unconscionable atrocities being 
committed. They are being committed in other places around the 
world and that should give us equal cause for condemnation.
<P>
	When we see this kind of situation happening in Europe in 
1994, in the heart of western civilization, if you will, when we 
see people who are ethnoculturally the same but who are 
essentially divided along religious lines doing unspeakable 
things to each other, when we see one faction wantonly 
thumbing its nose at the international community, the time has 
come to act.
<P>
	We cannot stand by as we did not stand by-others did not 
stand by-earlier in this century because if we do, we will only 
encourage the aggressor more. We will allow more and more 
atrocities to occur, more and more rights to be abused.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	More and more we will see the end of civility in a part of the 
world where civility has been very much the norm for the past 50 
years, in a relatively peaceful situation, notwithstanding the 
enmities in the history of the past.
<P>
	As we go forward this evening in cabinet and make a final 
decision, we will weigh the remarks of hon. members opposite 
and those on the government side of the House.
<P>
	We certainly appreciate the valuable contributions made by 
the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member from 
Saanich-Gulf Islands, the critic for the Reform Party. When we 
stand here tonight discussing this issue we stand here not as 
Liberals or as Reformers or as members of the Bloc Quebecois 
or other political parties. We stand here as Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians are serving with resolve and determination. They 
have our total support. They will be pleased to know members of 
the House of Commons are thinking about them and are trying to 
ensure the world community brings about some course of action 
that will help them return safely home when this mandate is 
completed but equally important, brings lasting peace to the 
former republic of Yugoslavia.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> Madam Speaker, 
this is the second time in this 35th Parliament that I rise to speak 
on the issue of Bosnia and peacekeeping missions. When the 
first debate took place, the parties in this House were 
unanimously in favour of letting Canadian troops participate in 
a peacekeeping mission which was nevertheless very different 
from previous exercises to which Canadians had taken part in.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the situation has changed. Reform Party 
members, as well as the Minister of National Defence and the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, have spoken at length on the 
evolution of the conflict and the diplomatic means used. We can 
now see what the situation is. You all sadly remember how the 
horrors of Sarajevo shocked the world. At that time, NATO had 
decided, following an ultimatum, to use air strikes in order to 
free the area surrounding Sarajevo.
<P>
	Later, every diplomatic effort was made by western nations, 
and even by Russia which, through negotiation, managed to 
convince Bosnian Serbs to agree to a ceasefire and to 
agreements signed by Croatians and Bosnian Muslims. At that 
point, it looked like a solution was in sight, but Bosnian Serbs 
once again failed to live up to their word. In so doing, they 
ridiculed UN members and betrayed the trust of Russia, which 
had negotiated with them.
<P>
	In my opinion, this is no longer a situation where nations try 
to arrive at a negotiated solution but, rather, an attack on the 
very existence of humanity, its values and its evolution. How 
can we tolerate any longer a situation which the whole world 
condemns? Clearly, diplomacy has failed somewhere when 
belligerents decide to bomb hospitals, as they did in Gorazde 
and in Sarajevo before. Nothing will bring back to life those who 
were killed in this conflict, and nothing justifies such barbaric 
acts.
<P>
	My preamble gives you an idea of the position suggested by 
the Bloc Quebecois. Indeed, we believe that Canada must 
support the proposal put forward by the U.S. President, Mr. 
Clinton, and that support must be unequivocal. The idea is to 
define six safe areas, as NATO did, and to pattern this exercise 
on the Sarajevo experience. In other words, an ultimatum must 
be given, but it should have a very short deadline. If this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3355"> 3355 </A></B>
<P>
ultimatum is not observed, then we should resort to strategic and 
intensive air strikes.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	Clearly, some people will say that there is an escalation and 
that this form of intervention is radically different from those 
formerly endorsed by Canada.
<P>
	However, the massacre must cease. All the people in the field 
said and keep saying that inaction cannot be tolerated any longer 
considering the horror of the situation. UN troops are sick of 
helplessly watching the slaughter of often unarmed civilians.
<P>
	They have performed brilliantly, despite the paucity of their 
resources and the often confusing directions they received. They 
saved thousands of lives and I can say, because I heard it from 
people who were there, that they are even willing to put their 
lives in danger to stop this bloody massacre.
<P>
	I met with a few Bosnian Muslims now residing in Canada, 
who may have been in touch with the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
or the Minister of National Defence. They were describing the 
situation in Sarajevo, and now in Gorazde, as something that 
should be unacceptable to countries which consider themselves 
civilized, and they were shocked that Canada, where they live 
and wish to remain, could watch this without reacting more 
strongly.
<P>
	All the parties involved, that is western countries, the 
European Community, Russia and the United States, should 
decide as one to intervene in the most forceful way. Since they 
have gone back on their word so many times, the Bosnian Serbs 
can no longer make other countries believe that they are willing 
to carry out diplomatic negotiations in good faith.
<P>
	Obviously, this decision will not be taken lightly. However, 
under the circumstances, I think that it is the only humanitarian 
solution possible. We have also said that the safety of Canadian 
and other peacekeepers is of primary importance to us, but given 
the slaughter that is taking place, this action can only be 
beneficial and worthwhile.
<P>
	There is no question that procrastination, coupled with a lack 
of clear decisions and strategies, has prolonged this barbaric 
conflict and at times further endangered the lives of 
peacekeepers. You cannot put a price on a human life, as all of 
our brave soldiers have so clearly shown us. They want to put an 
end to this conflict, even if it means risking their lives. They 
realize that their profession and training places them in 
situations which can at times be dangerous. However, they are 
trained for combat and they are prepared to face the 
consequences.
<P>
	In my view, the safety of our peacekeepers must be our top 
priority. This issue is of even greater concern to me since the 
majority of our peacekeeping troops hail from my riding. I have 
met with several of them who have returned from Bosnia and, 
without necessarily speaking on their behalf, I would like to 
pass along this message from our courageous soldiers: Let us act 
in a clear-sighted and circumspect manner, but let us act now to 
end the slaughter.
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe there is no other solution but to 
designate these enclaves as safe areas. If the Bosnian Serbs 
violate these designations, a firm, unwavering ultimatum should 
be issued to them, so that we can finally put an end to this 
shameful episode in the history of humanity. When we reach the 
point where hospitals are being bombed and civilians and 
children are being murdered, I think we must make some 
decisions which may at times seem difficult.
<P>
	Having become involved in this unfortunate conflict in the 
former Yugoslavia, the UN can no longer act as a mere observer. 
It must make some decisions which ultimately may give rise to 
debate. Peacekeepers have already saved many lives, but I 
believe that if we support this course of action, they will 
ultimately be able to save even more human beings.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this is a very serious debate this evening.
<P>
	I have listened to five speakers, all of whom have spoken 
without regard for their affiliation to any party. As a Canadian I 
am very proud to stand tonight and say they have all spoken as 
Canadians in the best interests of this country. I am very 
honoured to join that nature of the debate this evening on such a 
serious subject.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	I want to approach this debate from a slightly different 
perspective. I want to look at what is in our national interest. 
After all, this is what we are talking about as Canadians.
<P>
	What is in our national interest in the debate this evening is 
peace and security in the world and a total abhorrence of the 
genocide we see in front of us. But for every national aim and 
every national wish, there has to be a risk.
<P>
	What is at risk? It is not our reputation as peacekeepers that is 
at risk. We demonstrated in the Arab-Israeli war in 1967 that we 
can peacekeep, but we can also leave when people really want to 
fight. We have created the precedent for doing both in the same 
operation.
<P>
	However we do have a risk. It is the close to 2,000 Canadians 
who are involved in this operation. It has to be very clear to 
Canadians that in this goal and national aim of peace and 
security and the abhorrence of genocide, our peacekeepers are at 
risk.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3356"> 3356 </A></B>
<P>
	Having said that I want to look at this operation as one which I 
suppose could be described as typically escalatory. The question 
I ask in an operation that takes that trend is: Where does it stop?
<P>
	We started with a handful of officers and non-commissioned 
members in September 1991 to support the European 
Community monitoring mission to cease fire on the borders and 
to provide humanitarian assistance.
<P>
	In February 1992 we sent a 1,200 member battalion group. In 
June 1992 we dispatched part of that battalion group to open the 
Sarajevo airport. Canadians will remember that; it was a very 
tense time in this operation. In September 1992 we sent another 
1,200 troops.
<P>
	Well, the history of the 57 ceasefires and the use that the 
Bosnian Serbs have made of these sham ceasefires add to the 
escalation we see in front of us. In every escalation there is a 
quagmire. That is where we are now. We are at a quagmire.
<P>
	What options are open to us? There are three basic options. In 
one way or another they have been described here this evening.
<P>
	The first option is to declare we have lost the battle, that there 
is no further use for us to remain in the present position doing 
the present things we are doing. We would get out. The 
consequence is that it would give a certain signal to the Bosnian 
Serbs. It would put at risk thousands of civilian lives, most of 
them Muslims. It would put at risk other Muslim populations in 
the eastern part of Bosnia that we would be concerned about.
<P>
	It would also give a signal to other aggressors that may want 
to do the same thing. The history of genocide and our view as 
Canadians on this kind of atrocity is very clear. Our actions have 
always been the same.
<P>
	The second option is to stay the course of what is happening. I 
am not sure what good that would do us. We are providing 
humanitarian aid and suggesting air strikes. Unless something 
changes from what is happening now, I believe any chance of a 
peace will be totally bogged down. The government which is 
Muslim Bosnian, as I see it, will perhaps get the wrong signal 
and expect that sooner or later we may want to come down on its 
side. I do not have to tell anybody in the House that our troops 
were not sent there for that reason. Neither are they equipped to 
do so.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	It would also give the wrong signal to the Serbs that we are 
going to stay there. They will continue to have their little games 
of ceasefires, and every time there is a ceasefire they will 
strengthen their position. This has been the history. Why would 
we expect anything different?
<P>
	The third option relates to the option that is now being 
proposed by this motion and the option that seems to be getting 
total support in the House this evening, that is to  have our troops 
that are vulnerable put in a safe area and to consider more 
seriously the use of air strikes.
<P>
	In considering that option we have to remember that the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations under UN resolutions 
824 and 836 authorized NATO to execute air strikes last Sunday. 
It has been four days since we have looked at that.
<P>
	What message are we sending to the Serbs? What are they 
saying? To balance that, again history will show that air strikes 
without follow-on action with ground troops sometimes have 
the effect of strengthening the resolve of those people who are 
being struck with the air power.
<P>
	The history of air power in the mountainous country in which 
we are involved in this operation has not been terribly 
successful. There are some difficulties with air strikes. They 
have been successful, but there are difficulties and we have to 
consider them.
<P>
	There is another area that has not been discussed in any detail 
this evening. I want to bring it to the attention of the House. I 
request that the Minister of Foreign Affairs take into 
consideration that we have a three-organization naval blockade 
in the Adriatic Sea: the Western European Union Task Force, the 
Standing Naval Force Atlantic of which a Canadian commodore 
just relinquished command on April 14, and the Standing Naval 
Forces Mediterranean, all under the command of 
COMNAVSOUTH. We need to look at that to see how it relates 
to the action that will stem from the discussions that will take 
place tomorrow.
<P>
	It is with a certain amount of hesitation, I would have to 
admit, that I would be in favour of air strikes. It would be on the 
condition that there would be a summit involving the Russians, 
all NATO forces and all United Nations forces. Whatever we do 
in our negotiations tomorrow I know I do not have to remind the 
House in my presentation this evening that the peacekeepers we 
have there now are at risk. Any further involvement we may 
undertake as a result of the action that will be contemplated in 
the next few days will have to be seen as escalatory. We have to 
bear that in consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise in the House tonight to speak on this very 
important issue. Certainly most of us in the House tonight would 
be doing more pleasant duties; I had no idea when I was elected 
some six short months ago that we would be here tonight as 
members of Parliament in the House making such a serious 
decision on such a serious issue.
<P>
	Back in January I made my maiden speech on the topic of our 
role in Bosnia for two reasons. The first one was my personal 
history which goes back to that part of the world. My heritage is 
from that area and certainly I have concern for what is going on 
there.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3357"> 3357 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, the important thing that we have not talked about 
very much in these debates is the history of the area. The history 
of this area will tell us that for the past 500 years we have had 
these types of flare-ups. We have had wars. We have had people 
murdering or massacring each other. There have been no good 
guys and there have been no bad guys in this particular area. It 
has been a fact of life that this has been a very volatile area of the 
world.
<P>
	I had hoped when I gave that maiden speech back in January 
that there would not be a need for the type of debate that we hold 
tonight. Unfortunately that has not been the fact.
<P>
	My concern tonight really is twofold. First and foremost I am 
very concerned for the safety of our Canadian people there. We 
as Canadians have a priority and we must protect. We must not 
allow some of the things that have gone on in that area to happen 
to our Canadian troops. Safety has to be a top priority.
<P>
	Second, my concern is for the innocent victims, the innocent 
people. We have seen thousands of people who have been 
victims of this war.
<P>
	I do not believe that we can ask the United Nations to keep 
peace in a part of the world where there simply is no peace to 
keep. I am not a supporter of violence. In fact I hate violence and 
I hate what it does to innocent people. We have drawn lines in 
the sand in this part of the world for some two years now. We 
keep backing up and keep drawing new lines in the sand. I 
believe we are at a point where we can no longer draw lines in 
the sand.
<P>
	Threats and ultimatums simply have not worked. I believe 
that we must take a firmer stand, but I say this with mixed 
emotions. As I mentioned before I have relatives in this part of 
the world and I am obviously very concerned for their safety.
<P>
	I do not believe we have any other option at this point in time. 
As a world community I believe that we have the obligation to 
protect innocent people wherever they are. Thousands of lives 
have been lost already and tens of thousands more are in 
immediate direct jeopardy.
<P>
	About 20 minutes ago I received a letter from one of my 
constituents that I would like to quote at this time. She states: 
``As a wife of a peacekeeper who served in Croatia, I know what 
it is like to worry that my husband may not make it back to me. 
My husband served as a peacekeeper proudly for both his 
country and the United Nations. Every patrol he went out on he 
never knew if it would be his last one. I believe that the Serbians 
must be forced by whatever means to respect the safe zones 
established by the United Nations. However, for the sake of our 
soldiers let us be very clear in what we are doing. This is no 
longer peacekeeping. The soldiers who now operate under the 
United Nations umbrella must be given a new, clear enforceable 
mandate or alternatively, they should be pulled out altogether 
and NATO should step in.
<P>
	Dennis just told me a few minutes ago that he would be glad 
and have no problems throwing his combats on and going back. 
As his wife, and mother of his child, all I ask is that if you send 
him or his colleagues over, make his mandate clear and give him 
the resources and backing to make it back again''.
<P>
	As I mentioned before it is with mixed emotions that I stand in 
the House tonight. I support the idea of air strikes, not because I 
want to see punishment inflicted on anyone but because I want to 
see this horrific war stopped and stopped now.
<P>
	I believe that the only option we have and the one we must 
choose is to pull back all Canadians to safe areas and then 
proceed with any and all efforts required to stop this bloodshed. 
Then and only then can we talk about peacekeeping and then and 
only then can our peacekeepers do the job for which we have 
become known throughout the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Madam Speaker, I first want to 
thank the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of National 
Defence and the government for providing all members of 
Parliament with this opportunity of sharing our views to assist 
the government in making this difficult decision later tonight. I 
also want to thank the government for holding off on its cabinet 
decision until after it has heard input from members of 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	On behalf of the New Democratic Party, we support this 
initiative. Our effort is to make the support unanimous on this 
very critical issue.
<P>
	I wish to pay tribute to the extraordinary and outstanding 
effort of our peacekeeping troops who have been serving in the 
area. Their contribution to the safety and security of innocent 
people has been nothing short of extraordinary. All of our hearts, 
our thoughts, our prayers go out to not only them but of course to 
their families back home as well.
<P>
	It is fair to say that none of the parties involved are totally free 
of criticism, some by a long shot. The time has come in terms of 
the Serbian issue that we simply cannot allow a war to 
perpetuate that literally all now want stopped. This is now 
calling upon extraordinary measures to stop the brutality, the 
savagery, the horror, the unbelievable level of suffering 
particularly for the innocent civilians in the region.
<P>
	There have been tens of thousands killed in this conflict. Tens 
of thousands have fled the area as refugees. Thousands of 
women have been systematically raped as an instrument of war. 
We hear of ethnic cleansing, the concentration camps, the 
massacres, the destruction of holy buildings.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3358"> 3358 </A></B>
<P>
	It has come to a point where we as Canadians can no longer 
stand passively by and say that this can continue. We have to 
stand up and be counted. With the United Nations now calling 
for support for air strikes, it is only right and proper we lend our 
support as a country to this initiative.
<P>
	We must take whatever measures are necessary to ensure the 
safety of our troops in these areas. If the mandate changes and 
ground support is required to back up the air strikes in order to 
bring peace and a negotiated settlement eventually, then 
obviously the mandate for our troops has to be changed. It will 
be up to us to give them the equipment and support to allow them 
to do the job that must be done.
<P>
	What turned the situation for us in the last few days was when 
we witnessed the television reports of the bombardment and 
shelling of homes, hospitals and churches which symbolized the 
ultimate in the savagery which has occurred in this region. For 
us now to stand passively by and allow this to continue is 
something none of us are prepared to tolerate any longer.
<P>
	I applaud the government for its initiative. I appreciate that 
the government has solicited our views prior to cabinet making 
this very difficult decision. Let us only hope and pray we do not 
have to revisit this again in a few weeks when the situation may 
have even escalated beyond these unimaginable levels.
<P>
	I am now going to allow my colleague from Regina to 
complete this time sequence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for the opportunity of 
participating in this debate. I also thank the government, the 
Official Opposition and the Reform Party for allowing us to 
participate in this most important debate.
<P>
	Earlier today I spoke to a constituent, a mother whose son had 
just returned from serving in the former Yugoslavia. Her major 
point to me as her son related his experience to her was that we 
are no longer capable of playing a peacekeeper role. When the 
major parties are not in acceptance of our position and do not 
abide by ceasefires then we cannot play the role of the 
peacekeeper.
<P>
	Our forces are not equipped to play the role of the 
peacemaker. Yet what has been requested of NATO is to change 
the UN role from one of peacekeeping to one of peacemaking. It 
seems the Serb forces have forced the United Nations and the 
world community into that position.
<P>
	What has been going on has been a farce. We have now 
reached the point where a serious decision will have to be made. 
I appreciate that the cabinet will be meeting after this debate and 
I am certain that the cabinet will take into very serious 
consideration all the implications that are involved.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	Some suggest that this might be the opening to a new Vietnam 
type war. I have been in Bosnia as I have been in Croatia and I 
followed the events very closely over the years. I know the 
terrain in Bosnia is not conducive to the type of warfare that we 
think of. Certainly it is not like the deserts in the war in the 
Middle East. We remember as well the few handfuls of partisans 
who were able to hold down many German divisions during the 
second world war.
<P>
	We cannot allow the rape and the killing to continue. I have 
been to the front and I have seen hospitals that have been 
attacked by scatter bombs. I have seen attacks on churches, I 
have seen attacks on civilians and the total disregard for 
innocent people, the total immorality.
<P>
	As someone suggested to me, it is the devil's banquet that is 
going on there. We cannot tolerate it. We cannot just sit in front 
of our television sets and do nothing. I think air strikes have to 
be used.
<P>
	Now the question is what happens to our Canadian forces? 
They are not equipped. They are out there almost as hostages. I 
believe what has to be done immediately is before the air strikes, 
the UN troops who are out there and ill-equipped to protect 
themselves have to be removed and moved into secure areas.
<P>
	The other suggestion I would make is that under article 51 of 
the United Nations the state has the right to protect itself. We 
have a state here. We have the federation between the Croatians 
and the Muslim Bosnians. We have as well a co-confederation 
between this new state of Bosnia and Croatia. Why not lift the 
arms embargo and allow the Muslims and the Croatians to 
protect their own homes and their own cities? Surely that would 
make a lot of sense.
<P>
	The blood of Canadian boys need not necessarily be spilled on 
the fields in Bosnia. Allow the Bosnian Muslims and Croats to 
protect their homes, to protect their villages. Use them as the 
ground troops, the ground forces necessary to protect the safe 
havens. Back them up with air power. That combination will 
create a level playing field.
<P>
	I believe the Serbs will negotiate in good faith if there is a 
level playing field. They inherited the third largest or the fourth 
largest and most powerful army in Europe at the end of the cold 
war, the army of Yugoslavia. They inherited all that fire power. 
They are using that fire power against the Muslims and the 
Croats. It is not a level playing field.
<P>
	The embargo on arms has helped the Serbs and has put the 
Croats and the Muslims at a disadvantage. Take away that 
disadvantage, allow a level playing field, allow the Muslim and 
the Croatian armies to protect their cities. Back them up with air 
power. In that way I believe we can be effective and we can see 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3359"> 3359 </A></B>
<P>
an end to this conflict because it will force the Serb forces to 
negotiate in good faith.
<P>
	I believe there are some possibilities that should be explored 
which might prevent a full scale blood bath. In fact it is already 
there. We cannot prevent it, it is already occurring. However, 
perhaps we can bring it to a more speedy end if we lift the 
embargo and back up Muslim and Croat forces with air power. I 
believe some good will come out of that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on 
a very serious issue, the Canadian position on Bosnia.
<P>
	Our policy has been consistent. In our foreign policy 
handbook issued in May of 1993 we warned: ``The Yugoslav 
question will take years to resolve. Canada must be prepared to 
commit resources and time to help rebuild new states and 
societies in this region''.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	Before we can help rebuild we must first help to resolve this 
terrible tragic situation in Bosnia.
<P>
	The issue before us tonight is the use of air support to protect 
safe areas in the former republic of Yugoslavia, a very delicate 
question and an issue that is fundamentally different for Canada 
than it is for that of the United States; as already mentioned, 
different since we are the ones with peacekeeping troops on the 
ground. If the United States administration had followed 
through on the Vance-Owen plan and committed U.S. ground 
troops as part of the UN force we may not be facing the question 
we are facing tonight.
<P>
	On May 2, 1993 the U.S. pledged 25,000 troops. To this day 
the U.S. has no troops in the former republic of Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Our troops have undertaken tremendously difficult UN 
assignments. In June 1992 they were deployed to Sarajevo to 
reopen and secure the airport so that the airlift of relief supplies 
could begin. In January and February of 1993 more Canadian 
troops were deployed temporarily to the former Yugoslav 
republic of Macedonia to monitor developments in the border 
areas with Serbia. In April 1993 more Canadian troops were sent 
to Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia to ensure the presence of UN 
protection force in the besieged city.
<P>
	We must insist that if they go forward with air strikes the same 
country that is so eager to do so will also bring ground troops to 
help. We must ensure that our strategy is sound to protect our 
Canadian peacekeepers in a very volatile situation.
<P>
	It will be very difficult to suggest the removal of our troops 
with the knowledge of the brutality being suffered and the great 
need for humanitarian assistance.
<P>
	We went to the former Yugoslavia to promote a peaceful 
settlement to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia and to 
provide relief to its victims, innocent victims we know have 
endured unbelievable brutality and senseless death. We know 
that women have been raped, innocent children killed and both 
men and women  senselessly tortured. In this day and age it is 
not tolerable to have this situation continuing.
<P>
	We then face the question of how to resolve it. What is the 
next step? We must formulate a strategic plan, a plan that goes 
beyond one day, a plan that goes into the future, a plan that 
includes a settlement that can bring lasting peace to the region. 
The settlement must include the NATO forces, the Russians, the 
Serbs, the Bosnians, the Muslims and all other involved parties 
so we can end the history of hate that began over 1,000 years 
ago.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Madam Speaker, the people 
of Quebec and Canada have agreed to send troops to the former 
Yugoslavia to keep the peace. Our troops are part of a 23,000 
member UN force which has been making commendable efforts 
for months to restore peace to that European country. With 
dignity, courage and efficiency, our soldiers have carried out 
their mandate, a narrow and demanding mandate that they have 
managed to carry out effectively.
<P>
	Our troops have saved lives. They have provided medical 
treatment. They have helped people escape the combat zone.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	After many months of hard work, an agreement was finally 
reached just recently, under which Bosnian Serbs accepted that 
six safe areas be defined. Sarajevo and Gorazde were among 
these areas.
<P>
	We are forced to recognize that the Bosnian Serbs did not live 
up to their word, as this has been the case all too often over the 
past few months, and hostilities resumed. The city of Gorazde is 
currently under Bosnian Serb fire, its unarmed and defenceless 
population subjected to mortar shelling day in and day out. 
Blind fire is killing civilians, women and children. Just today, 
28 people were killed in the shelling of a hospital.
<P>
	We are facing a difficult situation. Will we look on helplessly, 
as brutal force, ill intent and duplicity triumph? Will we keep on 
worrying about what happens to our troops in the field? On the 
other hand, should we not help those who are proposing 
concerted, effective actions to force Bosnian Serbs to abide by 
the agreements concluded, to stop shelling and remove their 
guns from around guaranteed safe areas? I think we should. I 
think that the nations involved in the operations must send a 
clear message, an ultimatum, to the people who are shelling 
defenceless people, shelling civilians and children, shelling 
hospitals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3360"> 3360 </A></B>
<P>
	The ultimatum must be clear and have a short deadline. It 
seems that is the only language which the soldiers operating 
under the colours of the Bosnian Serbs understand.
<P>
	We must issue this ultimatum and if they do not comply, we 
must, as suggested, strike effectively and rapidly so that the 
weapons shooting civilians and defenceless people are 
destroyed and that the troops in the field are no longer subject to 
the bad faith of the Bosnian Serbs, who as we have seen believe 
that they do not have to keep their word.
<P>
	We must issue this ultimatum and use the necessary force if 
the Bosnian Serbs do not comply, because it is a humanitarian 
duty. We are witnessing barbaric acts. We are witnessing 
frightful things. For a long time, we had not seen people in 
Europe being subjected to mortar fire, random shooting and 
bombing.
<P>
	Canadians do not accept violence in their own country. 
Increasingly, they call for action, and I believe that they have the 
same attitude to situations of violence abroad directed against 
defenceless people.
<P>
	Therefore it is a humanitarian duty to intervene. It also takes 
the lessons of history into account.
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	If the League of Nations, a few years prior to 1939, had taken 
the necessary steps to stop Hitlerian madness in Germany, many 
millions of people might not have died in World War II.
<P>
	History teaches us that if we do not do anything to stop 
massacres, injustice and unspeakable violence against civilians, 
against defenceless populations-if we witness all these 
horrible scenes without reacting-we will pay dearly for our 
inaction several years later. That is also what the news teaches 
us.
<P>
	Staggering events are now occurring in Rwanda, Africa. We 
see people being slaughtered and ask ourselves whether we 
could have done something in the first hours of the crisis. I think 
the answer is yes. So I think we should intervene. We have a duty 
to intervene in the face of growing violence, of the return to 
Europe of barbarities it had not seen in 50 years.
<P>
	It is with regret but also with a sense of duty that I think 
Canada should agree to implement the program proposed by the 
UN to NATO and, if the ultimatum is rejected by the Bosnian 
Serbs, to launch the air strikes required to make them live up to 
their word. In all honesty, I think it is our duty to show solidarity 
with our fellow human beings.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
in this House proud to be a Canadian, a Canadian with family 
residing in Croatia.
<P>
	In resolving the issue before the House, the decision that we 
must make as a government is to determine what is in the best 
interests of our country Canada. When so doing we must 
consider what is in the interest of peace and security of the 
world.
<P>
	On January 26 on debate in this honourable House I stated it is 
my position that Canada should withdraw its peacekeeping 
military forces from both Croatia and Bosnia. Bring the soldiers 
home. At that time my conclusion to withdraw the Canadian 
troops from the former Yugoslavia was predicated on the fact 
that there is no need for peacekeeping since there is no peace to 
keep.
<P>
	However, due to the constantly changing circumstances on the 
ground it becomes extremely difficult and possibly meaningless 
to hold a fixed position among aspects of the wars in former 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Today the original Canadian mandate to serve as 
peacekeepers and to deliver aid continues to be seriously 
compromised. The resistance of Bosnian Serbs to make peace 
has dictated the need for an urgent and a new direction for the 
role of Canada in defence and foreign affairs.
<P>
	There is still no peace to keep and the war continues. As a 
nation of conscience we cannot tolerate the slaughter of 
innocent victims of genocide. We cannot trust the Serbs to 
negotiate peace. We cannot compromise our credibility as a 
nation.
<P>
	This is the most difficult foreign policy question of our time. 
Since the end of World War II Canada has proudly stood as a 
leader in world affairs, stepping forward whenever international 
peace and security were threatened. However, the cold war has 
passed and the world we face today is much more complex.
<P>
	The anticipated peace has given way to a resurgence and deep 
rooted and often brutal ethnic conflict. The situation in the 
former Yugoslavia is the most striking example of this problem.
<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
	The position the Canadian government will take on this very 
important issue will undoubtedly have profound implications 
on, first, the safety of Canada's armed forces; second, the 
practice of future peacekeeping; third, the evolution of the 
United Nations and its future mandate; fourth, the role of NATO; 
and, fifth and most important, the future of democracy in the 
western world and peace and security in our world.
<P>
	It is my position that Canada has no alternative but to support 
NATO's demand for air strikes. It is in the best interest of 
Canadians. It is in the best interest of the people of the former 
Yugoslavia. However in the negotiations with NATO I ask our 
government to consider carefully the role of Russia.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3361"> 3361 </A></B>
<P>
	NATO must take into consideration the position of Russia and 
consider carefully the consequences of Russia's position and the 
impact it will have on the resolution of the conflict. Russia at 
this time is the key to peace in this conflict. I trust that every 
effort will be made to ensure that Russia supports NATO's 
position regarding air strikes.
<P>
	I wish to take this opportunity to commend the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and Minister of National Defence for their 
immediate attention to this urgent matter. I pray the decisions 
made by our government will bring lasting peace to former 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> 
Madam Speaker, one of the greatest tragedies of our time has 
been the destruction of the dream of world peace by surging 
ethnic and national conflicts.
<P>
	Naive as the vision may have been, when the iron curtain 
collapsed people around the world believed that in a history 
plagued with war and atrocities mankind would finally be on the 
path to a peaceful coexistence. Of course that has not proven to 
be the case.
<P>
	Eighty years ago the world was plunged into World War I by 
events which took place in the same unfortunate lands that we 
are discussing tonight. The firestorm that resulted produced one 
of the saddest chapters in human history. We must ensure that we 
do not become entangled in that same web.
<P>
	The difference today is that this civil war is being played out 
in real time for millions of television viewers. Almost every day 
grisly images of mangled children and slaughtered civilians are 
brought to our screens and in the newspapers. I picked up a copy 
of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> in which the mayor of Gorazde was 
reported as saying that Gorazde looked like a slaughterhouse. 
There were reports of scores of injured and dead lying as they 
fell amid the debris. An amateur radio operator yesterday was 
heard saying: ``Wounded people are lying everywhere. The 
situation is desperate''. Stories of atrocities abound and the term 
ethnic cleansing, despised by all civilized people since the days 
of Hitler, has re-entered our vocabulary.
<P>
	The root cause of this age old conflict is ethnic intolerance 
and greed. This conflict reaches back into time across the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Turkish Empire and beyond. 
These are old quarrels being reignited; new battles over old 
grievances and old hatreds. The fighting has been bitter and 
indiscriminate.
<P>
	Two years ago the United Nations dispatched a peacekeeping 
force into this savage war zone when the Red Cross and other 
humanitarian agencies were prevented from bringing relief to 
civilians. For the first time UN forces were deployed during a 
conflict to ease the plight of innocents. This too was 
accompanied with television images and the terrible price being 
paid by the non-combatants: children maimed, orphans 
abandoned by their care givers, women brutally and 
systematically raped, marketplaces shelled, and old people 
lying in  twisted heaps. Civilized people could not stand by and 
let this misery and indiscriminate slaughter continue.
<P>
	Another article in the paper quoted the Bosnian prime 
minister in an interview saying: ``NATO must take immediate 
and decisive action to prevent a mass slaughter in Gorazde''.
<P>
<B>(1940 ) </B>
<P>
	UN peacekeepers have done their best to bring food and 
medical supplies to these people, to provide some of the very 
basic things that human beings need to survive. They have done 
their jobs valiantly and in the face of great adversity. They have 
been blockaded and besieged. They have been threatened with 
deadly force, captured and held hostage, terrorized, shot at and 
shelled. They have performed with exceptional dedication, 
bringing hope to the victims of this war.
<P>
	At every turn attempts to find a peaceful settlement have been 
thwarted by the Serbs. The lies, the deceit and the irresponsible 
actions of these people are an affront to civilized humanity. 
Truces have been declared, only to be broken within hours if not 
minutes. Ceasefires have been agreed to, only to be kept until 
the military manoeuvres were completed and then violated.
<P>
	For peacekeeping to function there must be a wish for peace. 
For peace to be possible there must be some recognition by the 
combatants that war is a last resort, that the inhuman acts 
occasioned by war are repugnant, and that all other means must 
be exhausted before the final option of war is exercised. That 
does not exist in Bosnia.
<P>
	We have at least one combatant in the struggle, Serbia, which 
sees that war as a means to achieve its national objectives. While 
no one has clean hands in this conflict, perhaps finally the other 
two protagonists, the Croats and the Muslims, have come to 
realize that continued arms struggle only brings disaster to their 
own people and that in the end nothing is really gained. The 
Serbs on the other hand are prosecuting a war of aggression that 
aims to subjugate and eliminate the other ethnic groups.
<P>
	It is understandable in the face of all the horrible facts of this 
conflict and its capacity to seemingly go on forever that 
civilized nations are considering more drastic measures to put 
an end to it and that urgent calls are heard to bring more military 
force to bear.
<P>
	The arrogant manner in which the Serbian leadership has 
conducted themselves, almost as if they hold themselves beyond 
accountability for their actions, and the utter disdain they 
obviously have for the United Nations demonstrate clearly their 
rather primeval attitude, like a bully with a chip on his shoulder. 
Serbian leaders have dared the UN to take action to stop them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3362"> 3362 </A></B>
<P>
	No matter what our feelings, we must exercise wisdom and 
restraint. We must consider very carefully where we cross the 
line between humanitarian relief for the innocent civilians and 
becoming combatants ourselves. We must not justify the bully's 
actions by adopting his methods.
<P>
	The use of air strikes around Sarajevo succeeded because it 
demonstrated the resolve of the UN to protect safe havens it had 
created. It was great for the people of that city, but it took the UN 
down a path of intervention in a civil war that could be 
dangerous. This was demonstrated when a British Harrier was 
shot down over Gorazde. The spiral of action and reaction can be 
very dangerous.
<P>
	The request before NATO now is to expand the use of air 
strikes to cover other safe havens. This draws the UN and NATO 
even further into the web. When did we cross the line, becoming 
participants in this conflict rather than neutrals? We must ask 
ourselves whether we are inviting reprisals against our 
peacekeepers on the ground. At the very least there must be 
co-ordination between the Canadian forces and NATO to ensure 
that our troops, Canadian troops, are as safe as possible from 
reprisals.
<P>
	Will these actions improve the ability of our troops to deliver 
aid or impair them? What will our response be if Canadian 
peacekeepers are attacked and suffer casualties? Is this the right 
action to take?
<P>
<B>(1945 ) </B>
<P>
	Already the Canadian military is facing difficulties in 
sustaining operations at existing levels. If we agree to these air 
strikes we will be by extension committing ourselves to 
expanded troop commitments if the call goes out for them.
<P>
	Indeed many questions are before the House. Can we, on the 
other hand, ignore the suffering brought on by the Serbian 
aggressors against the enclaves and the safe havens? The 
shelling of the hospitals, the careless endangering of innocent 
civilians is unacceptable.
<P>
	The Serbs have shown a blatant disregard for international 
protest and concerns. They have repeatedly rebuffed the 
attempts of peace envoys, international delegations and truce 
negotiators to try to resolve this conflict. Almost at every step 
United Nations protection forces are hampered in their efforts to 
provide aid.
<P>
	Even Russia, which has shown great reluctance to join the 
international chorus of protest, has angrily condemned recent 
actions by the Serbs.
<P>
	I support the actions that we would take in support of these air 
strikes and I would ask every Canadian tonight at home as they 
are going to bed thinking of how safe we are in our country to 
spend a few moments and think about our Canadian 
peacekeepers who are doing a tremendous job for the entire 
world and say a few words for them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough):</B> Madam Speaker, I want 
to congratulate the government, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
the minister of defence and veterans affairs for bringing this 
resolution forward tonight to be debated and to say to Canadians 
that we again in this House are seeing democracy working.
<P>
	We also see the laying aside of partisan politics as we debate 
the very important issue that hopefully will resolve some 
terrible situations that abound in the world. I want to 
congratulate our colleagues who have spoken earlier on this 
matter.
<P>
	Originally today I was going to go to my riding. The finance 
committee is meeting there tomorrow morning. I was going to 
appear before that but when I saw that this situation was coming 
here tonight, the resolution and the emergency debate, I felt that 
having served some time involved with matters of defence with 
a lot of great people on all sides of this House, I should be here to 
take part in this very important issue that we are dealing with.
<P>
	We watch with horror the situation that has developed in 
Bosnia over the past number of years and this is now truly a 
global village because every night the true extent of what is 
happening around the world is brought into our homes. It shows 
us just how thin the veneer of civilization is. The basic humanity 
in civilization which we all take for granted has been stripped 
away and we are left with the barbarous acts perpetrated on 
people by their fellow human beings.
<P>
	Unfortunately the horror of these events in what was once 
known as the cockpit of Europe, an area of conflict through the 
centuries, shows that we must always be vigilant to ensure that 
we remain at the level that we think we have attained. Reality 
dictates that our society must always remain on guard to see that 
the things we hold as basic rights of humanity and citizenship 
remain in tact.
<P>
	When communism died we felt that a better world would take 
its place. I and others were told the other day by the 
vice-president of Bosnia that when that happened there was a 
vacuum left, that perhaps something else could have happened. 
Perhaps democracy and those who know democracy could have 
been in these places to fill that vacuum by teaching people the 
ways of democracy. That did not happen. Ancient hatreds and 
ethnic conflicts have come to the forefront and have led us to 
these situations.
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	Canada has for many years enjoyed an enviable reputation as 
a peacekeeper. Of course we all are concerned for the safety of 
our troops wherever they may be. What we always have to 
remember also is that Canada, which has gained this reputation 
as a peacekeeper, has the capabilities and has been involved in 
other types of military actions. We stood second to no one in this 
in two world wars and in the Korean war. We never backed away 
from anything. We are not a military  country. That is not what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3363"> 3363 </A></B>
<P>
we were built on. When we were asked to go, no one ever 
reneged on that.
<P>
	Canadians do not go around bragging very much about their 
military prowess. Any time Canadians were asked to be part of a 
conflict that was in the interests of the world, we were there. 
Now we are saying should we in other nations change our role 
from peacekeeping to that other mode. This would entail a new 
set of priorities and actions.
<P>
	We surely cannot tolerate scenes any more like those we saw a 
few days ago when Canadians were held hostage, which has 
been mentioned here tonight. We have a saying on the east coast 
and it is time to use that saying. We either have to fish or cut bait. 
We have come to that situation in the country we are talking 
about here tonight. As unpalatable as it may be, if we are going 
to be involved we may have to become involved in a differ 
manner, one which may see young men and women from Canada 
involved in these military operations which I speak about. That 
may be the choice facing this House.
<P>
	The request for more air strikes according to military experts 
should be supported by more people on the ground. According to 
people who have long military careers this is the way these 
things are most effective.
<P>
	Are members of the United Nations, members of NATO 
prepared to do this? The topic has been debated here this 
evening on what happened after the bombings, after the air 
strikes at Sarajevo. We did not really go into it because they 
were successful. It is hoped that if this has to take place, if we 
have to go to the line, to the limit, cooler heads will prevail and 
those people involved once again will know that the United 
Nations and NATO mean business and we are not going to see 
these atrocities go any further.
<P>
	I say to all members of the House right here tonight that we 
stand on the threshold at a pivotal time in our history, the history 
of the world. What the United Nations and we the 
representatives of the people here in Canada decide over the 
next few days, indeed probably over the next few hours, will set 
a tone for world affairs for years and decades to come.
<P>
	I fully agree with the proposal put forward by the ministers 
and from what I hear in the House tonight everyone else does 
also. I believe we have to show these people, as someone said 
earlier, who are thumbing their noses at the rest of the world that 
the allied countries in the United Nations and in NATO mean 
business, that we are there to stop these atrocities.
<P>
	If air strikes have to be used, then we must be prepared to go 
along with that. I am sure that tomorrow morning at the NATO 
meetings a lot of negotiating, a lot of thought will go into the 
final decision.
<P>
<B>(1955 ) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker and members of the House, I speak to those 
involved in the negotiations and those on the ground, in the air 
and on the sea in that country. I hope that by our decision here 
tonight we will help to bring this terrible conflict to an end.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> I rise 
this evening as member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, 
which is represented in Bosnia by militiamen of the Fusiliers du 
Saint-Laurent, and I also speak on behalf of one of the 15 
Canadians who were held as hostages last week.
<P>
	These developments influence our action somewhat because 
this conflict is not a black and white issue. It is a grey area and 
the decision to be made is complex and difficult. However, we 
must take our responsibilities and do what is necessary.
<P>
	I would like to quote a comment I made in my speech on the 
same issue, on January 25, 1994. I said: ``It is important for our 
operations to contribute directly to resolving the crisis and 
above all to avoid perpetuating the current imbroglio.''
<P>
	In fact, one wonders whether the intervention in Sarajevo was 
strong enough. We targeted only one of the safe areas and since 
then the problem has spread to another of those areas, and this 
could go on and on.
<P>
	We realize that a more comprehensive solution is necessary. 
Also, we must not lose sight of the objective of the intervention, 
which is to ensure peace in Bosnia.
<P>
	Names such as Bihac, Gorazde, Sarajevo, Srebrenica, Tuzla, 
and Zepa are not part of our daily vocabulary. Yet, these names 
have become synonymous with dying children, and adults 
running in the streets to stay alive. All these images trigger a 
common reaction.
<P>
	It is important to adopt a position which will lead to a 
complete and permanent solution. To that end, certain essential 
elements must be taken into account. The first one is the need of 
a consensus among nations. I think that if we act without first 
enlisting Russia's support regarding a possible intervention, we 
will repeat the mistake made in World War One, something 
which would be very costly.
<P>
	So it is very important to make representations within the 
Security Council and at the UN and ensure that the Russians will 
be at the table and will take part in the process. I think they have 
realized that the behaviour of the Bosnian Serbs is unacceptable. 
I think they see a certain betrayal of their commitments as a 
result of this situation, and we can only hope that they will join 
in the consensus that seems to be developing here.
<P>
	It seems that another important point is that we should send a 
clear message to the Bosnian Serbs because so far, commitments 
and promises have meant absolutely nothing to them, since there 
was not always a concerted effort to enforce these agreements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3364"> 3364 </A></B>
<P>
	We have seen a kind of behaviour that in some cases does not 
even observe the normal rules of war. When we see pictures of 
people shooting at hospitals, and when we see shells going 
through hospital walls, I think we have reached the point that 
something has to be done to deal with the situation once and for 
all.
<P>
	In the circumstances, I was referring to a consensus in public 
opinion, a clear message to the Bosnians-but I think it is also 
important to have diplomatic initiatives by the major powers to 
have a clear indication of where we are going and of the main 
participants in this process. The point is that if we merely resort 
to air strikes without providing for the next phase, we will only 
move the problem somewhere else, and we must avoid 
escalating the conflict.

<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	These are all very important considerations. I think we must 
act responsibly on this conflict, but I am also concerned about 
the security of our troops. I think it is important to minimize the 
risk to the safety of our troops, although as the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs said on April 14, and I quote: ``It is inherent in 
their responsibilities and their duty as soldiers to risk their 
lives''. We agree with this statement, that to take risks in a war 
situation is part and parcel of a soldier's job, role and 
commitment; on the other hand, we must do our utmost to avoid 
casualties.
<P>
	In my view, if we are to put the odds on our side, we must take 
part in strategic planning, avoid a situation where Canadian and 
Quebec soldiers would become the pawns of unacceptable 
decisions, the victims of errors that could have been avoided. To 
this aim, the choice of strategic targets must contain certain 
minimum guarantees so that we do not pick targets which should 
not be attacked and would not help solve the crisis, in any case.
<P>
	When dealing with a problem such as this one, we know that it 
is dangerous to intervene, and that some soldiers' lives will be 
on the line. On the other hand, I think that there is a lesson to be 
learned from last week's hostage-taking, which ended well, but 
could have gone terribly wrong. Admittedly, this incident was to 
some extent the result of the UN's procrastination. If we let 
things drag on, we will face other similar situations, other times 
when our soldiers' lives will really be threatened. It would be 
unexcusable if it were to happen by pure negligence, for the 
simple reason that we did not act responsibly.
<P>
	I think that it is important that the consensus reached by the 
Parliament be taken into consideration by the Cabinet and that, 
with the same caution we feel in this House, it makes sure that 
any action taken will be decisive and will protect the lives of our 
troops as much as possible.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to thank the Canadian peacekeepers, 
especially those from my riding who volunteered for these 
peacekeeping missions all over the world. I think that we can 
never thank them enough. They are aware of the inherent 
dangers of their job, but I believe that they have the right to 
expect sound policy direction that gives due regard to the 
importance of human lives, and to the importance of solving this 
crisis, which is the result of many years of ethnic hatred. It is 
important to find a political solution which will put an end, once 
and for all, to this devastating conflict.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke):</B> 
Madam Speaker, as we stand in the House tonight we have a lot 
to be thankful for. We have freedom of speech, a free country. 
We have food in Canada. We have running water. We have 
toilets. We have hospitals with good medical people. Tonight we 
are going to talk about people who have very few if any of those 
things.
<P>
	I want to compliment the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the 
Minister of National Defence and the government for bringing 
this business before the House tonight. I also want to 
compliment the other parties for agreeing with it and for 
participating the way they have.  Foreign affairs of this nature 
should not be partisan. We as Canadians should be pulling 
together on issues like this where great humanitarian values are 
involved.
<P>
<B>(2005) </B>
<P>
	The situation in the former Yugoslavia is something we never 
thought we would see in the 20th century, certainly not in the 
middle of Europe. But it is there and we have to face up to it.
<P>
	We are dealing with a Serbian group who cannot keep 
agreements. They are people who hold Canadian peacekeepers 
hostage. That is something this country cannot stand for under 
any conditions. The world cannot stand by and allow this to 
continue.
<P>
	Over the years foreign affairs have been very much a contest 
among parties in this House but this one certainly should not. 
We have to ask ourselves: What price do we pay for freedom? 
What price do we pay to promote decency in the world? What 
price do we pay for respect? The answer of course is that no 
amount of money will buy them. They have to be earned and 
Canadians have been earning these qualities over the years.
<P>
	We must look at history from where we stand tonight. Henry 
Ford once said that history is a lot of bunk. That is one of the 
most horrible contributions that could possibly be given to the 
record of the human race.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3365"> 3365 </A></B>
<P>
	Tonight we must take into consideration why during the 
thirties the League of Nations failed. It failed because nobody 
would support it. Nobody would stand up for the causes of 
freedom and for the rights of people in other countries. There 
was no unity within the world to promote those qualities.
<P>
	World War II did not just happen; we drifted into it because we 
did not do anything. We know what happened in World War I. It 
was a Serb who shot a prince and from there we went into 
international conflict in very short order.
<P>
	Today there are over 60 hotspots in the world. More than 20 of 
them are active conflicts today. This is a time to learn from 
history, not to call it a lot of bunk, not to fall into the same old rut 
we have fallen into before as a society.
<P>
	Canadians have participated all around the world. The 
Canadian forces have made their mark and made their name and 
they have taken the qualities of Canadian nationhood with them. 
We thank them for that.
<P>
	Tonight the Muslims, the Croatians and the Serbs are in 
turmoil. Let us ask why. They are in turmoil because of that 
old-fashioned, centuries old term hatred. We talk about all the 
diseases. No other disease creates so many problems for 
humanity as hatred. No aggressor can be allowed to get away 
with what is going on in Bosnia tonight, or tomorrow, or 
yesterday.
<P>
	Human rights and the decency of mankind is important to 
Canada and to every free civilized nation. We cannot stand by 
and allow slaughter to go on. We cannot stand by and allow rape 
to occur in that country.
<P>
	Peacekeeping versus peacemaking. If we are going to ask our 
Canadian forces to go abroad into these difficult situations, then 
I say with all sincerity it is up to this Parliament of Canada to 
provide them with the right equipment to do so and the good 
training which they have had over the years.
<P>
<B>(2010 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us get out there and support them in real terms and not just 
with rhetoric from time to time. Our military community in 
Canada has led the way on many great days for this nation over 
the years of Canadian history and it will continue to do so in the 
future. We in this Parliament and Canadians from every part of 
this nation must give them our utmost support.
<P>
	As we stand here tonight we can look upon this as a test case. 
Do we allow the UN to become weakened? Do we allow the 
western world to become divided? Do we not stand up and be 
counted? Do we drift and send a message out there to the despots 
and dictators of this world that there is not enough cohesiveness 
in today's world among the nations of the free world to put a stop 
to some of these atrocities?
<P>
	If we allow that message to go out there we will not have more 
than 20 hot spots around this world, we will have many, many 
more because they will feel they will get away with it.
<P>
	We have to stand up and be counted as a nation and Europe 
itself must stand up and be counted as a group of nations. I think 
it is a fair criticism tonight that many Europeans did not come 
forward soon enough and that Canada has played a role in every 
UN operation since day one. We need not be ashamed of our 
record in any way whatsoever. We must be proud of it, but if we 
are going there we want every nation pulling their weight.
<P>
	Yes, NATO in this case is a UN support and it should not be 
looked upon by any nations as anything else but a support to the 
UN today. Yes, Russia should come on board with the rest of the 
free world on this one because this too can affect it. You cannot 
close your eyes and hope that it is going to go away. We cannot 
send our troops lightly armed into a peacekeeping operation that 
virtually becomes the middle of a war zone.
<P>
	We have to make certain to take every measure for their 
safety. NATO will do its part.
<P>
	Hatred is older than the hills but it is creating and will 
continue to create problems for mankind. It is the way we handle 
these that counts. We have to handle the bullies and the cowards 
of this world in the only way that they understand.
<P>
	Canada is respected around the world. We cannot lose that 
respect because many have paid a big price to earn it. They have 
paid a big price to pave the way for nationhood in this country 
and it is that price that I guess we are going to have to continue to 
pay. Let us never fail to support those soldiers out there in the 
field and those who are in training. This Parliament must resolve 
to support them. Our Canadian soldiers will do their jobs but we 
as the Canadian representatives in the Parliament of Canada 
must do ours by supporting them in real terms.
<P>
	Canada has been a nation that has played a major part in the 
founding of the United Nations. Canada has played a major role 
in the founding of NATO.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you are giving me my signal. I will give you 
my closing remarks. Today, these two institutions are serving 
mankind well. Let us remain as a team. Let us, as a responsible 
nation in the free world, pull the other countries together and 
work with them to bring peace to those troubled spots and to 
bring decency and respect and decent living again to those poor 
people in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Thank you, Madam Speaker, for your patience.
<P>
<B>(2015 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome the 
opportunity to participate in this debate tonight although I must 
say I do so with minimal enthusiasm. This is the end of a rather 
long personal road for me. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3366"> 3366 </A></B>
<P>
I have always  opposed the intervention by Canada or Canada's 
allies in other people's wars but as of this time I have had to 
change my outlook. Enough is enough.
<P>
	Time after time in my lifetime the western world has stood by 
compromised, temporized and allowed large numbers of people 
to be butchered. We have the situation now in Gorazde in which 
thousands of people are in imminent danger of death unless 
somebody moves in from outside and helps them.
<P>
	At this stage there is only one way that can be done and that is 
with air strikes. There is no possibility on earth of getting 
ground troops from anywhere into that area in time to help those 
people.
<P>
	I am not talking geopolitics here. I am talking humanitarian 
efforts because those people will die en masse. There is no 
question about it if the world does not do something. It has been 
said many times here tonight that air strikes alone cannot solve 
the problems in Bosnia. That is true but if they are executed 
immediately they can save the people of Gorazde and that is 
what counts.
<P>
	There is no time for an ultimatum. There is no time for further 
discussions. The necessary mechanics are already in place. 
Warnings are not an option. Warnings have been given again and 
again and they are no longer taken seriously. Air strikes have to 
be not only immediate but unrelenting. Anything that moves, 
tanks, field artillery, has to be taken out. Bridges have to be 
taken down. Any kind of ammunition or field depot, anything 
that helps the Serbian war effort, should be fair game in the 
Gorazde area.
<P>
	If that is done, if you punish them hard enough and fast 
enough they, being normal human beings in some ways, will 
have a self-protective instinct. They will move back. The 
problem with this scenario is that there is also no time to pull out 
our troops. If we are going to save Gorazde it has to be done now. 
Our people cannot be taken to safe haven before the air strikes 
are made.
<P>
	Our field commanders on the ground must have the freedom 
to do whatever they deem necessary to get our people out of 
harm's way. If air strikes are executed we have to face as a 
country and as a Parliament the fact there probably will be 
Canadian casualties. It is inevitable and this is a responsibility 
that the government with the support of apparently almost 
everyone on the opposition side has to face up to.
<P>
	We have all been briefed at great length on the inhospitable 
terrain in that country for movement of troops, for normal 
military manoeuvring. Even if we had large numbers of troops in 
there we would still need the air strikes.
<P>
	A lot of people I have spoken to who are military people 
would agree that it does not necessarily follow that if we 
escalate the war we must have hundreds of thousands of foreign 
troops in Bosnia.
<P>
	The Bosnian Muslims are there already. They have been 
effectively disarmed by the embargo that we have imposed 
supposedly against all of Yugoslavia. This has really had a 
serious effect only on the people of Bosnia. They are the victims 
of this. The Serbs one way or another have continued to get 
arms. I presume they are able to make them because they have a 
certain amount of industry intact. They have not had the war 
rolling back and forth across their part of the country for two 
years. They are getting them from elsewhere, they have to be.
<P>
<B>(2020) </B>
<P>
	Let us lift the embargo. I think this is what the Bosnia 
Muslims want. It would mean that we could help these people 
without committing large numbers of western troops. Give them 
a chance to die with dignity. They are dying anyway and they 
will continue to die by the tens, perhaps the hundreds of 
thousands if we do not give them the chance to help themselves.
<P>
	I would urge, I would beg the government to take this to the 
UN, take off the embargo. Give these poor devils a chance.
<P>
	I notice that on this I am in complete agreement with the hon. 
member for Regina-Qu'Appelle. I doubt if there is anyone in 
North America with whom I have larger degrees of political 
differences and I heartily concur with this. Let the Bosnian 
Muslims have a chance to defend themselves.
<P>
	First and foremost save the people of Gorazde. Stop making 
idle threats. Stop giving ultimatums. Make the air strikes and 
make them before it is too late.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Madam Speaker, 
tonight members of Parliament have been asked to comment on 
a very important and sensitive matter affecting the entire world.
<P>
	The aggressions in Bosnia-Hercegovina continue to escalate 
and now the Secretary-General of the UN, Mr. Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, has asked Canada and others to consider, and the 
operative word according to the minister is consider, the 
advisability of further air strikes.
<P>
	I think all members are very grateful that the government has 
reserved this decision until it consulted with the House. 
Tomorrow decisions will be made.
<P>
	Why are we doing this? An Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> headline reads: 
``Make Serbs Pay Price Says U.S.''. We have read these 
headlines for months and months and the issues here are issues 
of credibility in terms of making our decision, credibility of the 
UN and whether it has taken appropriate action on a timely 
basis; credibility of NATO and our NATO allies and whether 
peacekeeping versus peacemaking has been properly addressed 
here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3367"> 3367 </A></B>
<P>
	Many members have said often in this House that we have no 
peace in Bosnia and therefore how can we be peacekeepers. Our 
Canadian troops are trained and equipped as peacekeepers, not 
peacemakers.
<P>
	As the minister mentioned earlier in the House, on April 18 
the UN Secretary-General wrote to Manfred Woerner, the 
Secretary General of NATO, requesting that the arrangement to 
protect Sarajevo, a safe area, be extended to five additional 
areas, being Gorazde, Srebrenica, Zepa, Tuzla and Bihac.
<P>
	Gorazde, which is the area in which this aggression is now 
taking place, is very close to the Serbian border, only a matter of 
15 or 20 kilometres. Where are the Canadian troops? I want to 
raise this because the previous speaker possibly raised some 
concerns beyond the level which they should be at this time.
<P>
<B>(2025) </B>
<P>
	Canadian troops are near the Croatian town of Gradacac. The 
Princess Patricia Calgary Light Infantry is there. We also have 
troops in the Bosnian town of Visoko, some 30 kilometres 
northwest of Sarajevo. Right now our Canadian troops are not in 
grave danger as a result of the present aggressions in and around 
Gorazde. We do however have one officer, Major Stogran, in the 
Gorazde area. His movements at this time are restricted.
<P>
	Canadians have serious fears. Those fears have been growing 
over the weeks and months. We all remember when some of our 
Canadian peacekeepers were lined up in a mock firing squad 
fashion. We also know the Serbs took some of our brave 
Canadian peacekeepers hostage.
<P>
	The Bosnian Serbs have not shown any signs of good faith at 
any point during this period of aggression, despite the 
international efforts to stop these atrocities against innocent 
people. The Serbs have in fact demonstrated solely a thirst to 
kill.
<P>
	Before I came into the House this evening I asked for the 
latest reports and they indicate that the Serbs have taken 
Gorazde. Gorazde has fallen. There is house to house combat. I 
am sorry to say that tomorrow we will likely read more statistics 
about the carnage, atrocities and death of innocent people in that 
Bosnian city.
<P>
	Our fears as Canadians are also prompted by the fact that we 
know what air strikes can do. There were air strikes in Sarajevo, 
but the difference there was that there were ground troops to 
support the air strikes. The situation in Gorazde is not as secure. 
There is not the same kind of protection of ground troops, of 
those people.
<P>
	There have been many estimates of how many people have 
died in this conflict. Now I am told that the number is 
somewhere over 100,000 people who have lost their lives.
<P>
	Tonight I asked defence officials how many people were in 
Gorazde, how many Muslims were there in this so-called safe 
area? We do not know how many people are there. All we know 
is people have been going to safe  areas in droves and no one can 
possibly keep track. Estimates have been that in the range of 
45,000 Muslims may be in Gorazde, but nobody knows.
<P>
	What now? The UN, the Americans and most other partners in 
the UN coalition have basically said that we need the right to go 
forward with these strikes. How would they happen? They have 
the ability. There are over 100 fighter aircraft ready to take part 
in these strikes. They are in Italy. They are on aircraft carriers, et 
cetera.
<P>
	I have taken the time to consult with as many of my colleagues 
as I could to find out what the sense was. There was unanimity 
among all members and all parties, a serious concern for the 
safety of our courageous troops in Bosnia.
<P>
	I asked the minister's staff if I could have a copy of his 
speech. I want to repeat the minister's concern about Canadian 
troops because it is very important. Earlier today when he 
commenced his speech he said: ``We have known from the start 
that deploying forces in the former Yugoslavia meant exposing 
our personnel to some risk. This concern has been with us since 
the beginning of the mission. The situation in Srebrenica, as 
well as the incident last week when 16 members of the Canadian 
forces were detained by Bosnian Serbs, reminded us that the 
risks were real''. He also said: ``As the UN and NATO 
contemplate more vigorous action the safety of our troops will 
continue to be a key consideration for the Canadian 
government''.
<P>
	It is critically important for Canadians to understand that the 
government, the Official Opposition and the Reform Party have 
all stated a sincere interest in protecting the interests of our 
Canadian troops.
<P>
<B>(2030 ) </B>
<P>
	It is time to stop the senseless slaughter and the atrocities. We 
do not need another Vietnam in our world. We need peace and 
stability. We need international co-operation. We need Canada 
to stand together with pride and with resolve with its UN 
partners. We need to support our allies and accept the resolution 
of the Secretary-General to consider air strikes against the 
Bosnian Serbs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise this evening to take part in the special debate on 
the situation in Bosnia not only as the member for 
Brome-Missisquoi, but also and most of all, as a human being. 
It is impossible not to be outraged when one sees atrocities like 
those that have been perpetrated in the former Yugoslavia during 
the last few months. We all agree that the situation cannot go on 
and that we must take steps to put an end to those horrors.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3368"> 3368 </A></B>
<P>
	How then can we explain why Canada and the international 
community have let that conflict deteriorate to the point where 
Bosnia is now the scene of such savage and barbaric acts? The 
present situation did not appear overnight in Bosnia. It has 
evolved steadily since the beginning of the conflict while the 
international community merely observed from a distance.
<P>
	In the beginning, we were puzzled by the situation in the 
former Yugoslavia, but there was no cause to send in troops yet. 
Later on, rumours of ethnic cleansing made the conflict much 
more disturbing. But there again, we preferred diplomatic 
disincentives and negotiations. Afterwards, the bombing of 
Sarajevo raised the confrontation to an unacceptable level of 
unwarranted violence but still the UN forces refrained from 
launching a massive intervention.
<P>
	The international community's hesitation and procrastination 
are the reason why we have reached a situation which is totally 
unacceptable in a so-called civilized world. In fact, I find the 
recent actions of the Serbian forces particularly revolting. How 
can we let these people bomb residential areas and hospitals? 
How can we still claim to try to solve this conflict by sending in 
peacekeeping forces and advocating negotiations? After all, 
Serbs showed long ago what little respect they have for the 
agreements they sign. In fact, as the leader of the opposition said 
earlier, they failed to keep their word 57 times in less than a 
month. I cannot see how we would still want to negotiate with 
such hypocrites.
<P>
	Peacekeeping troops in Bosnia are no longer safe. The UN 
Security Council must order air strikes on Serbian strongholds. 
It must also send ground troops to help our peacekeepers in their 
efforts to establish peace in that country. We can no longer be 
content with observing from a distance without reacting. Serbs 
have had every possible opportunity to prove their good faith, 
and each time they turned around to attack civilian populations 
even more viciously. The lives of hundreds of young children 
and old people have been needlessly sacrificed.
<P>
	Canada's position must be very clear. We must let the whole 
world know that our country is prepared to take the necessary 
measures to put an end to that conflict. So far, peacekeeping 
forces may have managed to save lives, but their current 
mandate is too restrictive to allow them to continue to do so 
effectively. Indeed, the attitude displayed by Serbian forces 
compels us to consider large-scale operations. We can no longer 
give Serbs the benefit of the doubt, for too many human lives 
have already been sacrificed because of our excessive tolerance.
<P>
<B>(2035) </B>
<P>
	The destruction of Sarajevo was not enough to convince us of 
the need for a strong military intervention. Today, it is the city of 
Gorazde that is paying the price.
<P>
	The American and Russian presidents have agreed to hold a 
summit on this issue in the next month. How many schools and 
hospitals will Serbian troops destroy during that period? 
Yesterday again, 28 people died after the hospital in Gorazde 
was bombed. We must therefore immediately put pressure on 
those countries, because it is urgent for the innocent victims of 
this conflict.
<P>
	We just learned from a press report that one of the 10 speakers 
invited to address the opening of a Security Council session 
confirmed that the Bosnian Serb offensive in Gorazde is now 
going from house to house. That is horrible.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to remind the government that, 
beyond our political differences, we as parliamentarians of a 
peaceful country must show a powerful solidarity in this House 
when the time comes to save human lives.
<P>
	I am convinced that the people of Quebec and Canada will 
support us without reservation in our effort. It is no longer time 
for discussion; we must now act by hammering the Serbian 
positions and forcing them if necessary to honestly negotiate an 
agreement that will end this conflict which has already gone on 
too long.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise with 
some sadness this evening after hearing the news as members of 
the caucus and of the House of Commons. Events have taken 
place in a part of the world where people for the first time know 
the inhuman deeds of the belligerents.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I must confess to the House that I was not one of those who 
spoke in the previous debate with respect to the question of our 
troops in Bosnia but I feel compelled for a variety of reasons to 
put forward the best I can, as eloquently as I can, in as very quick 
a time as I can, since many of the members in the House of 
Commons will know that very few of us had a chance really to 
prepare for lofty speeches. Madam Speaker, what you see is 
what you get. It is the heart feeling, the mind feeling and the 
reaction to what has taken place in a part of the world which 
none of us in contemporary times will forget.
<P>
	At the age of 16 I had the privilege of visiting Yugoslavia with 
my godparents. I do not think it is important to suggest what 
their background or their ethnic background may have been. The 
reality is that those are villages and places that I once saw. I see 
the people in those places living in such insufferable conditions 
of inhumanity. This would not be the case if it were not for 
Serbian aggression.
<P>
	It seems to me that the arguments that have been put forward 
suggest that we may not want to attack the Serbs because there is 
some historical reticence on our behalf,  that the Balkans has 
always been a hot place on this planet, that every time there has 
been a war it has always been very difficult and thousands if not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3369"> 3369 </A></B>
<P>
millions of people have suffered. That historical excuse this 
evening is simply not acceptable.
<P>
	It has been suggested that the Wehrmacht army of the second 
world war, the Nazis, as they invaded Yugoslavia or what was 
then considered Serbia was not able to completely rid itself of 
the opposition, that is the Serbian army. I must confess the Nazis 
were the aggressors and not the Serbs.
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
	In April 1994 the Serbian army in Bosnia is indeed the 
aggressor. They are indeed the belligerents. There may be other 
options. I believe there is only one option at our disposal as a 
country. That is to provide some kind of sanity to the very 
difficult and senseless thing which is happening right now in 
Gorazde.
<P>
	Several weeks ago I had the opportunity along with many 
members of the House of Commons of seeing the very moving 
film ``Schindler's List''. That movie depicted an atrocity which 
took place because good people stood by and did nothing, all 
those except Oscar Schindler. Perhaps there are several Oscar 
Schindlers in Canada this evening. Perhaps there are Oscar 
Schindlers around the world. Ultimately however the difficulty 
this issue presents us cannot be ignored and cannot be taken in 
isolation of what has happened historically.
<P>
	In 1941 we knew full well what was happening in Warsaw. We 
saw the ghettoization of the Jewish people. We saw them 
confined to an area where they would not be harmed, but at least 
they were in a place where they would not affect anyone else. It 
is interesting how history has so many parallels.
<P>
	We have an obligation not to posterity, not to history but to 
humanity in our time. Evil does prevail when good people stand 
by and do nothing.
<P>
	We may be on the cusp of a very difficult if not explosive 
situation if we do not take into context that it is the Muslim 
people, particularly the Bosnian Muslim people who are the 
victims of this outrage.
<P>
	We can talk about the UN not performing up to scratch. We 
can talk about the United Nations not having done its homework 
in terms of protecting these people, removing arms as so many 
colleagues have talked of and leaving these people defenceless 
in the promise they would be given a safe haven. That is fine and 
I accept those. That is there for the record, but we now have a 
chance to act.
<P>
	We realize the Canadian troops may be in some difficulty. But 
let us think about the Muslim blood which has been shed in that 
part of the world. Those people have shown such patience in the 
face of such outrageous angst and hatred. They find themselves 
in the position of seeing more of the people who share their fate 
decimated.
<P>
	We can make the parallels with Kuwait and say: ``We 
shouldn't do in Sarajevo, we shouldn't do in Bosnia, we 
shouldn't do in Gorazde what we did in Iraq''. There is no such 
thing as bad publicity in this case. We know the situation and the 
suffering is very real. We have an obligation to address that 
suffering and put aside the platitudes and the rhetoric.
<P>
	I am a peaceful person but on this situation as a peaceful 
member of this government I am so moved as to ensure that 
dignity and respect for people's lives is well represented by this 
country, Canada. We have an obligation. It is my hope we live up 
to it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must not forget the lessons of history. We must act for 
some fundamental reasons and these are to save lives when 
possible. We have already invested time and weapons; we have 
supported the United Nations. More must be done to protect 
these people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If I were standing here this evening with the many friends of 
the Muslim community they would say to me: ``God be with 
you, inch'allah''. I say to the ministers this evening, your 
decision is is going to be a difficult one. Whatever decision you 
make, I as a member of Parliament representing thousands of 
people, support you in the test you now have to confront.
<P>
<B>(2045 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to concur with colleagues on both sides 
of the House that this is not an occasion one looks forward to. 
We know that events have transpired not only over the past few 
hours but, as we have been made aware tonight, over many 
weeks. In fact if we look back far enough, it has been over years 
and decades. We are dealing with an area of the world that has 
been the stage for much suffering, much violence and much 
international tension.
<P>
	I want to thank members of the other two parties, the Liberal 
Party and the Bloc, for co-operating and allowing all members 
to speak in this debate before serious decisions are made in the 
upcoming hours. It brings credibility and strength to Parliament 
to know that representatives of the people can take part in a 
debate on a situation that affects all nations of the world. Several 
hundreds of Canadian peacekeepers are directly affected by the 
violence in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	I also want to thank the Minister of National Defence and the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs whom I respect for being patient. 
They have been sitting here and listening to our concerns. I am 
pleased they have expressed to us that they will take these 
thoughts and expressions into consideration as they deliberate in 
cabinet and make decisions regarding air strikes that may be 
under way in the very near future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3370"> 3370 </A></B>
<P>
	I was wondering as I sat here what Canadians were thinking 
about tonight as they sense there are difficult decisions to be 
made by our government and by other members of the United 
Nations with regard to the former Yugoslavia. I am sure they 
have watched the television newscasts at night and have been 
angered, shocked and hurt as they saw the violence, the 
ruthlessness and the needless bloodshed of innocent people in 
the former Yugoslavia. They have seen the unfairness of one 
side in a dispute that seems to have no lack of arms and another 
side that seems to be unable to defend itself and no mercy being 
shown.
<P>
	I am sure Canadians tonight are very concerned about 
Canadian troops currently serving in a peacekeeping role, what 
may seem like an impossible role in the former Yugoslavia. We 
certainly join with other members tonight in expressing concern 
for our Canadian peacekeepers in this troubled area. We also 
want to see wise decisions made that have their best interests at 
heart.
<P>
	With regard to the NATO air strikes, we have to consider what 
options are available. We could probably consider three options. 
As Canadians we could say: ``Let us go with NATO air strikes, 
withdraw our troops, get them out of the country and see what 
happens''. This would likely mean a greater chance of 
preventing the injury or killing of Canadian peacekeepers. It 
may add to the cost in human lives and suffering in the Bosnian 
Muslim community.
<P>
	We could say that we disagree with NATO air strikes on the 
whole. Then we would have the problem of seeing ongoing 
violence and the ongoing slaying of innocent people. We also 
would have to realize that we have not solved the problem of 
what we are going to do with our peacekeepers in the former 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Another option would be to support NATO air strikes but 
perhaps initiate a circling of the wagons. In other words we 
could support air strikes but do all we could to protect our own 
peacekeepers serving in the dangerous area around Gorazde and 
in other areas where there is potential violence and danger to 
Canadians. We want to prevent, if we can, the chances of further 
kidnappings of Canadian peacekeepers in the area.
<P>
	I sensed from other members in the House, and I share the 
opinion, that the third alternative is perhaps the best alternative. 
Yes, if it is the decision of our fellow United Nation members 
and if we have full input into the decision making process, we 
should support air strikes as a means to bring an end to foolish 
and senseless bloodshed.
<P>
<B>(2050 ) </B>
<P>
	Also, we need to take whatever steps we can to make sure that 
our own peacekeepers have the most available and complete 
means of protection possible to them. We have to facilitate their 
protection. We have to facilitate a plan and a program for peace 
in this war-torn area. I do not believe that we should abandon 
our Canadian peacekeepers at any price because the United 
Nations  and NATO make the decision that we must initiate air 
strikes in this war zone.
<P>
	It is important that we consult with our United Nations 
partners and our NATO partners to make sure that if we escalate 
the military action in this region, we do not bear an unfair brunt 
of the load. As members know, Canada has an excellent 
peacekeeping reputation. We have put many of our peacekeepers 
into several hot spots over the past few decades. We are proud of 
the reputation that Canadian peacekeepers have built for 
themselves and the tradition they have earned.
<P>
	It is important that if we are going to continue to be involved 
in this war-torn area, other nations that may also support air 
strikes but that do not have the possibility of paying a human 
price for support of that action be prepared to get involved in the 
conflict and be prepared to be an instrument for peace and an end 
to the foolish and senseless slaying of human lives.
<P>
	We have to be realistic and realize that there is a danger that 
some Canadian peacekeepers will be hurt or killed regardless of 
what steps we take. There is no guarantee whether we commit to 
air strikes or not that we will not see the potential danger for 
some of our troops in this area.
<P>
	We also have to be concerned about the long term situation in 
that region and realize that we are seeing mass murder of 
innocent people who are unable to protect themselves. It is 
incumbent upon us as citizens of the world to be part of the 
solution and propose steps we can take to ensure that the 
defenceless Bosnians have some capacity to defend themselves 
and that we impose some pressure on the aggressing Serbs to 
convince them to come to their senses and cease to continue this 
needless slaughter.
<P>
	With our international status and a good conscience, we must 
not totally abandon innocent Bosnian citizens. We could look 
back and probably see a lot of mistakes that all parties including 
Canada perhaps may have made. We can second guess ourselves 
but we have come to the point where second guessing is not 
going to provide solutions. We have come to a point of reality 
where we must make hard decisions.
<P>
	While we possibly have not put forward guidelines and, as 
someone mentioned previously, drawn lines not just in the sand 
but lines written in stone, if we made more direct moves as a 
result of bad decisions made by the aggressors in that area, we 
would not have reached the point that we have reached tonight. 
It has happened and therefore we have to press on to try to 
improve the world situation.
<P>
	Boutros Boutros-Ghali originally called for a controlled 
strike solely on artillery posts, tanks and mortar positions. We 
understand that President Clinton has indicated that the strike 
could incorporate elements of retaliation against Serb aggres-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3371"> 3371 </A></B>
<P>
sion and we understand that NATO officials perhaps have even 
suggested a stronger agenda.
<P>
	If we are going to act we need to be decisive and we need to 
make these actions make a difference. The last thing we want to 
do is just scratch a festering wound and aggravate it rather than 
perhaps do some deeper cutting in the situation, make a 
difference, provide a clean cut that is possible to heal and bring 
peace to a very hurting part of the world.
<P>
	These are the thoughts that are going through Canadians' 
minds tonight as they have been hearing the newscasts and 
contemplating what the situation is in this area and what our 
response should be. I believe they do want us to protect our 
troops. I believe they do want us to help the innocent Bosnians. I 
do believe they want to promote peace through proactive strikes 
with the least bloodshed possible.
<P>
<B>(2055) </B>
<P>
	While bombing may be our only remaining option, let us only 
agree to the NATO strikes if we can establish the resolve and 
dedication to a real and defined plan. We must also consider a 
contingency plan in case no heed is taken of our action and the 
violence continues.
<P>
	When we step into the water we have to be prepared to get wet. 
We have to be prepared to ford through some fairly deep waters 
if we are going to accomplish the goal we intend to achieve.
<P>
	Again I thank government members for this opportunity to 
speak. I thank them for their respect for Parliament in allowing 
Parliament to have a part in the decision making process. I wish 
them wisdom and Godspeed in the difficult decisions that lie 
before them.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak this evening on 
this important debate. I thank the last speaker, my friend 
opposite, for his comments as well. It is significant that our 
leadership has allowed us this opportunity.
<P>
	Only this afternoon I participated in a panel discussion with 
three other members of Parliament. The discussion was on 
reforms to Parliament and the nature of Parliament itself. There 
is much criticism of the quality of debate and the usefulness of 
this kind of debate. I came back here to find that members of 
Parliament from all parties were co-operating and participating 
in assisting the leadership of our government in making what is 
a difficult and in many ways terrible decision.
<P>
	Like many Canadians I am not very knowledgeable in this 
area. My interests primarily are at home, as you often hear me 
say, right there in Windsor. Quite frankly this question, while it 
is not one I am particularly well versed on, is one I felt prompted 
to speak to tonight because of calls and reactions from my 
constituents and because of my strong personal reaction to some 
of these calls.
<P>
	Like many Canadians I find the ethnic fighting in Bosnia and 
the massacre of innocents who cared nothing for power or 
politics or the stakes of the game to be abhorrent. Like many 
Canadians I want it to stop. We have an obligation to be part of 
the solution. I truly trust our leadership to take the right steps to 
accomplish this.
<P>
	However I also worry about our troops there. Only two weeks 
ago Ryan Hendy, a grade 13 student at St. Anne's High School in 
Tecumseh, Ontario in my riding, an 18 year old lad who is a 
friend of mine and whose parents are friends of mine, came to 
me. He is a member of the Essex-Kent Scottish Reserves. He 
told me he had been asked to go to the former Yugoslavia. His 
youth and his patriotism moved me to think a little more about 
our troops there.
<P>
	Canadians in Windsor-St. Clair and everywhere in this 
country have taken pride in their armed forces, pride in those 
young people stationed in Bosnia and elsewhere in the Balkans 
during this conflict. Canadians watched in fear as our young 
military men were held as hostages last week and breathed a sigh 
of relief when they were released.
<P>
	These anxieties are not distant. All of us in this House know 
we have constituents who are somehow connected with people 
in Bosnia. Many of us have friends or even family who are 
connected there. We have constituents whose children are 
serving there with the Canadian forces. We have constituents 
who are members of the forces serving there. We have 
constituents of Bosnian, Serb, Croatian and Muslim descent 
who have relatives still living in that country.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, one of your own constituents sent us a letter 
today. Marina Gavanski Zissis is her name. She is a Canadian of 
Serbian descent. She warns us of the danger of these air strikes. 
Her greatest concern is for the Canadians on the ground. I quote 
from her letter: ``But much more important is the safety of the 
Canadians already in Bosnia''.
<P>
	To my mind Mrs. Zissis makes a great point. We cannot ever 
forget the safety of these people and the situation in which they 
might be placed by remaining on the ground during an air strike. 
The American forces will be undertaking this air strike. In my 
opinion, for what it is worth, they do not have a good record 
when it comes to casualties by friendly fire.
<P>
<B>(2100) </B>
<P>
	We must consider these figures: 15 to 20 per cent of U.S. 
casualties in the Vietnam war fell from friendly fire and 16 per 
cent of U.S. casualties in the recent gulf war fell from friendly 
fire. On April 14, 1994, two U.S. helicopters were shot down by 
American jets, killing 26 military and civilian personnel.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3372"> 3372 </A></B>
<P>
	This time it will be our troops and innocent Bosnian civilians 
on the ground. It is not a textbook battleground. It is not a desert 
where we can see the good guys on one side and the bad guys on 
the other. The fighting is taking place in and around urban 
enclaves containing thousands of civilians and our Canadian 
troops.
<P>
	I am not a military expert. I am not even very knowledgeable 
about these matters, but I am a very concerned citizen and 
member of the House. I know we must stand with our allies. I 
know if we and our allies walk away we leave thousands of 
innocent people to a slaughter.
<P>
	I have faith in our leadership. I have faith in the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, the Minister of National Defence and the Prime 
Minister. I am satisfied that they will guide us well and ably in 
this decision, but I remind them to remember that it is our people 
on the ground and to take care of them too.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to begin by stressing how important it is 
for us to have this debate this evening. It is an opportunity for 
members of all parties to express their indignation about the 
intolerable situation that exists today in Bosnia, and it is also an 
opportunity for parliamentarians to show the minister and the 
government that we are all united in a cause that goes beyond 
partisan interests and our differences on other issues, because I 
believe that all parliamentarians here today share a desire to see 
all parts of the world at peace and to put an end to the slaughter 
in Bosnia.
<P>
	There are certain facts we should remember. There have been 
many ceasefires in that region. Ceasefires that were never 
observed by the Bosnian Serbs who, today, continue to attack 
civilian targets. Ceasefires which in some ways have allowed 
the Bosnian Serbs to continue their offensive before the ink was 
dry on the documents they had signed, in a hypocritical fashion.
<P>
	Today, we must do better than ceasefires where one party is 
acting in bad faith and the other has been disarmed. We must 
send a clear message. In this respect, the Sarajevo strategy 
which apparently will be proposed by President Clinton is the 
only strategy we feel is realistic as a means to put an end to this 
conflict. The strategy is to send a clear ultimatum to the Bosnian 
Serbs, with the shortest possible grace period, after which we, 
that is NATO and the UN must intervene and target the heavy 
artillery of the Serbs, an ultimatum, as we were saying, that 
would mean all cities and enclaves recognized as safe areas 
would have to be respected as such.
<P>
	We would also have to demand guarantees for the 
peacekeepers. It is true that so far, Canada has intervened more 
frequently than other countries. I think we must remind other 
countries that although air strikes are necessary-in fact, we 
will support them-the fact remains that Canadian and Quebec 
soldiers are in  position at the present time. If these air strikes 
are to be accompanied by additional ground troops, the other 
countries will have to participate, because Canada has already 
done more than its share in this respect.
<P>
	It is also true that air strikes may put our soldiers at risk, 
which is a real possibility, although the present situation is not 
any better, since our soldiers are in danger at the present time. 
Last week's hostage taking is a case in point. Besides, we cannot 
remain silent and powerless in the face of this situation.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	We have even more reason to be concerned about the tragic 
events in Bosnia given that this region of the world has 
historically been the site of war. Ethnic conflicts between 
different countries have today moved into another realm, 
namely that of religious wars. We must not lose sight of the rise 
of Islamic extremism, not only in Bosnia, of course, but also in 
the former Soviet republics of Tadzhikistan, Uzbekistan and 
Azerbaijan. The zone in question extends to China, stretching 
from Europe all the way to Asia and including the Middle East.
<P>
	When I refer to the rise of extremism, I am not talking only 
about Islamic extremism. Right-wing extremists are also 
making their presence felt in France, Germany, Italy and Russia. 
I mention Russia because we all realize that Russia has a unique 
role to play in this conflict, since the Serbs and the Russians 
share Slavic roots and throughout history, alliances have been 
forged and in turn broken in this region. The situation is all the 
more serious given that right-wing fascist forces in Russia are 
now challenging President Yeltsin.
<P>
	Nor should we forget that World War I began in this region, 
only to spread to the entire world. We should also remember the 
mistakes that were made by western democracies in the 1930s, 
mistakes which led to the rise of nazism and fascism. These 
democracies remained silent, at times motivated by pacifism, 
albeit blind pacifism. We made the mistake of letting Hitler 
invade parts of the world, triggering off a world war. We cannot 
afford to let the Serbs start a world war today.
<P>
	While the cold war may be over, there are regional conflicts in 
some parts of the world that have the potential to start a 
worldwide conflict and this conflict in particular appears to be 
more serious and dangerous than any other around the world 
right now. That is why the UN and NATO must define their roles 
further. Of course, they must be discussion forums to instill a 
spirit of peace worldwide. But they could go further, especially 
when it is obvious that negotiations are going nowhere, that 
some of the parties are talking for the sake of talking and 
hypocritically failing to act on their promises and commitments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3373"> 3373 </A></B>
<P>
	It must also be noted that Russia has a major role to play in 
this conflict. Of course NATO can send out a unit, but this unit 
will be made stronger by the support of Russia, and vice versa. If 
Russia does not take a clear stand, get involved and play its role 
with the Bosnian Serbs, it is obvious that NATO's position and 
that of the UN will not be as strong as they could be.
<P>
	We must-and it may sound paradoxical-impose peace. But 
we must also plan ahead and look toward the reconstruction 
effort that will be needed in that part of the world. For me, 
imposing peace means ensuring it of course, but more 
importantly, once that is done, democracy will have to be 
brought to that part of the world because these people have not 
known democracy, never have or at least not for a very long 
time. They used to live in dictatorial regimes, particularly in the 
U.S.S.R. and in Yugoslavia as well.
<P>
	We must also be aware that peace can only be maintained 
through coherent economic development and, to that end, our 
international organizations will have to become more than mere 
discussion and diplomacy forums in the future, their role will 
have to expand beyond that of policing the world, to include 
making sure we do not have to maintain forces wherever 
military intervention is requested.
<P>
	We have not reached that point yet, but any military 
intervention, even short-lived or immediate, cannot be carried 
out without thinking of its long term effects.
<P>
<B>(2110) </B>
<P>
	The fact remains that for the time being, no plan can be made 
for the future if a country such as Canada, as a western 
democracy, does not impose peace. Such is the situation, peace 
cannot be achieved without us imposing it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I speak to this issue deeply troubled because I have 
listened to the debate this evening and the one thing that is very 
clear is there is no easy solution. Whatever way we go in this 
situation there will continue to be killing. There will continue to 
be strife in Yugoslavia and we will continue to be at risk with not 
only our soldiers but soldiers from other countries of the world.
<P>
	I would like to look at a couple of points and express in my 
way how I feel about this dilemma. I am actually opposed to an 
air strike, certainly an air strike that is not tied to a strong show 
of ground forces. An air strike in Bosnia at this time might 
knock out some hardware but it will not knock out the Serbian 
troops gathered around the enclave.
<P>
	I think the example of history tells us that the more an 
invading force is injured, the more likely it is to resort to 
atrocities when it finally does conquer. If the Bosnian Serbs 
suffer casualties from our air strikes there will be no doubt they 
will take their anger out on the Muslim civilians as soon as they 
occupy the city.
<P>
	The other side of that equation is if we do not have an air strike 
what is the consequence of that? What we face then is sending a 
message to the Bosnian Serbs and any other peoples around the 
world who would like to resort, shall we say, to a military 
venture that we are helpless and they are able to do whatever 
they wish. We could expect to see this type of action spread 
around the world and certainly our chances of preserving the 
other five enclaves in the former Yugoslavia would be just about 
impossible.
<P>
	Therefore, I do not envy the decision that is facing our 
ministers this night, nor the decision facing the other members 
of NATO as they wrestle with this very difficult decision.
<P>
	Where do we go from here? Regardless of whether we have air 
strikes in Bosnia we are facing civil war. Again as an example of 
history, wherever you look in history, the absolute lesson is that 
you cannot intervene successfully in a civil war. The combatants 
in a civil war will fight it out.
<P>
	I give the example of Afghanistan where the Soviet Union at 
the height of its power tried to intervene and it was a complete 
failure. It had to pull out. The classic example is Vietnam which 
really was a civil war all along. Again, one of the most powerful 
nations in the world failed to really effect any kind of outcome 
there.
<P>
	There are many examples, Sri Lanka for one. What would we 
do in Sri Lanka? We cannot change the course of history in Sri 
Lanka. These are ethnic hatreds which we fought over. Rwanda 
is another one. What can we do there? What we are looking at 
here is a situation that is increasingly going to face the 
democracies of this world as the countries of the world resort to 
more and more tribalism and more and more ethnic fighting.
<P>
	I would like to say something with respect to our 2,000 
soldiers in the former Yugoslavia. I remind the government of 
Hong Kong and what happened there when we sent troops just 
before the Japanese declaration of war in 1941. Our Canadian 
troops fought bravely. When we look back on that incident we 
realize that they not only did not affect the outcome of the war, 
they did not affect the outcome of Japanese intentions. If 
anything, it cost more casualties. If there had not been a fight for 
Hong Kong there would have been fewer deaths in that area. We 
have to ask ourselves about that.
<P>
<B>(2115 ) </B>
<P>
	I strongly believe that the tradition of the Canadian troops is 
to be brave, to help the disadvantaged and to intervene but 
always as peacekeepers. I do not see us as a nation of 
combatants. I really do caution our government if it feels it is 
drawn into a situation where our troops may have to join with 
other NATO troops in a role that goes far beyond peacekeeping.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3374"> 3374 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, I would like to direct a comment toward the question 
of ethnic hatred. One thing that we should be very clear about is 
what is happening in Yugoslavia and we can take this to 
Afghanistan, Vietnam and many, many other countries is that we 
are not dealing with something that has anything to do with race, 
colour or visible minorities and we are not dealing with anything 
that necessarily has anything to do with religion. Muslims and 
Christians world-wide in many countries coexist most happily 
and indeed there is much in their religions that teaches them that 
they ought to cohabit.
<P>
	What is happening in Yugoslavia is a return to the wrongs of 
the past. I think if you look at most ethnic fighting you will find 
it is because the people in the present are looking to the past and 
they are deriving the hatreds of the past. Instead of looking to 
the future or looking to the present and seeing what can unite 
them today, they look to the wrongs of long ago, sometimes even 
centuries ago.
<P>
	What I would like to say in this debate is that I hope all of us 
worldwide, but most especially this country, take heed of that 
fact and remember not to look to the past for what went wrong 
and the wrongs we did to one another in the past, but to look to 
the future and what can unite us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am struck tonight by the relative brevity and great 
relevance of the remarks to this issue and what appears to be a 
growing concern in this House on both sides as to where our 
government should take us over the next few hours in dealing 
with this very difficult issue of the request for the possible use of 
air strikes in and around Gorazde and other places in Bosnia.
<P>
	The views expressed here tonight I am very sure will provide 
great strength to the members of the cabinet, our government, 
when they make their decision, a very difficult decision but one 
that they are charged with and one which will bind inevitably all 
of us as Canadians, those who pay taxes, those who wear 
military uniforms, those who have relatives abroad and 
Canadians in all walks of life.
<P>
	What we see here tonight is a Parliament at work expressing 
the views of Canadians for the benefit of a government which 
shortly must act. As I understand it there are a number of other 
countries in this world which are waiting for Canada to make up 
its mind. We are on the verge of that now as we speak.
<P>
	I think most of the issues that one would have wanted to deal 
with here tonight have been dealt with extremely well by my 
colleagues. There are only two that I will refer to. It is the often 
heard statement that we should not get involved in this kind of a 
war because we cannot win it. We would prefer to be involved in 
a peace. Let us not turn this into another Vietnam.
<P>
	In this particular case I do not think the intention is to get 
involved in a war. No one intends to invade Bosnia. What we are 
dealing with is not even the whole country of Bosnia. What we 
are dealing with is five safe havens, five places where the world, 
through the United Nations, told Bosnians, principally Bosnian 
Muslims, that they had safe haven. At the time we were 
developing that thesis we also, maybe for good reason, imposed 
an arms embargo. We said they may not have the arms to protect 
themselves, we will stop arms from getting to them but we will 
also put some blue helmets on the ground and have some safe 
havens. In the end I think we had five safe havens.
<P>
<B>(2120) </B>
<P>
	We created them. We set up the arms embargo and now the 
people there numbering in the tens of thousands-in this 
particular case tonight as we speak it is Gorazde-of men, 
women and children without weapons to defend themselves. We 
are watching and some of us are saying we should not be there. I 
say we are there and we must stay there to finish our 
commitment.
<P>
	We cannot walk away and leave those men, women and 
children to the guns that are advancing. References have been 
made in this House tonight to other incidents in history in which 
maybe we should have been there but we were not. Suffice it to 
say that we are there because, although we might rather not be, 
we wanted to be there and we have a job to do. I say we must 
finish and deliver on our commitment.
<P>
	The second thing I want to say is that there are millions of 
people all over the world watching what is happening in Bosnia 
with a slightly different perspective than that of most 
Canadians. One cannot help but notice that the majority of the 
people in Gorazde and in the safe havens are Muslims, people of 
the Muslim faith. They have lots of brothers and sisters here in 
Canada and they are also looking at the world. They are looking 
to see if other countries of the world, those that have the money, 
the guns, the resources, the morality, the guts, the principles, are 
willing to stand by and protect the lives of those tens of 
thousands of people.
<P>
	The fact that they are of the Muslim faith is very relevant to 
the whole world. There are millions of people all over the world 
who will be watching to see how we Canadians stand up for the 
principles, the morality which we have espoused since the 
beginning of this country.
<P>
	I want to close and mention the bad words air strike. This is a 
mechanism, this is a method by which we are informed by the 
experts, by the people who know about these things, that we may 
be able to fulfil our commitment. It will not achieve it by itself. 
It may enable us to accomplish those very limited goals of 
protecting the safe havens.
<P>

<P>
	We do not want to micro-manage what happens there on a 
minute by minute basis or even on a day by day basis. We are 
asked to say yes to the use of that instrument and I am prepared 
to say yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North):</B> Madam Speaker, 
as I rise to support the motion before us that air support to 
protect the five safe areas in Bosnia be endorsed by Canada, I 
recall a lesson I learned as a boy which strikes to the heart of my 
feelings about the issue before us.
<P>
	My mother used to tell me and my brothers and sisters you do 
not achieve through war that which you can achieve through 
peace. She added there are also times when you must wage war 
to achieve that peace. That is a lesson that I have continued to 
pass on to my four sons.
<P>
<B>(2125 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada has never been an aggressive nation. We certainly 
would prefer to see the conflict in the former nation of 
Yugoslavia resolved by peaceful means, but the aggressors have 
continued their crimes against humanity.
<P>
	Canada is a nation marked by unyielding compassion and a 
deeply ingrained commitment to human rights, to peace and to 
the promotion of freedom and democracy worldwide. I realize 
the House encompasses a remarkably broad range of ideologies 
and personal convictions, but tonight I am witnessing the unity 
of hearts and minds. The palpable unanimity of views we have 
seen emerging tonight speaks volumes about the need for 
Canada to endorse the use of air support in defined safe areas in 
Bosnia.
<P>
	At this juncture I would like to commend and to pay tribute to 
the brave Canadian troops who are there to continue to serve the 
cause of peace. Throughout its history Canada has made the 
right decision at the most difficult times.
<P>
	For the Croatians and Muslims in Gorazde and in the former 
Yugoslavia these are the most difficult of times. Indeed these are 
also the most difficult of times for all peace loving people in the 
world.
<P>
	It is always agonizing to support a military manoeuvre which 
may fan the flames of a war we have sought to extinguish, but we 
cannot long endure the blatant disregard of human life, of 
human dignity, practised daily by the Bosnian Serbs.
<P>
	At a time when barriers to freedom have been torn down, at a 
time when the Berlin wall has been levelled and the iron curtain 
folded, it pains us to see the savagery of war perpetrated by the 
Serbs in that part of the world.
<P>
	The eyes of the world cannot be blind to the atrocities taking 
place in that area. Our unequivocal support tonight for the 
United Nation's request to extend air support in safe areas in 
Bosnia would send a clear signal to the aggressors.
<P>
	Many of history's great minds have shared their thoughts with 
mankind on the subjects of war and peace. Two weeks ago I was 
at the United Nations in New York participating in a forum of 
human development. At a nearby book store a volume titled 
<I>Peace in 100 Languages</I> caught my eye and I bought one. The 
book reminds me that peace is a universal sentiment. It can be 
expressed in different languages, but the sentiment is 
nevertheless the same: human understanding.
<P>
	I am reminded tonight of the words of the great U.S. President 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt who once said: ``When peace has 
been broken anywhere, the peace of all countries is in danger''.
<P>
	I am reminded tonight of the words of Aristotle: ``Peace is 
more difficult than war''.
<P>
	I am reminded tonight of the words of Albert Einstein: ``Peace 
cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by 
understanding''.
<P>
	Lastly I am reminded tonight of Mahatma Gandhi who once 
said: ``It is possible to live in peace''.
<P>
	It is our hope. We do not want to wage war to achieve peace, 
but there are difficult times when we have to wage war to 
achieve peace.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I think all Canadians, and certainly all those 
participating in this debate, share a feeling of revulsion towards 
this horrible slaughter occurring almost in front of us, since we 
see the same scenario every night on TV: massacres, a total lack 
of respect for human life, inexplicable violence.
<P>
	Looking at all this, we wonder what makes people resort to 
such cruelty. As a man, I noticed that it is mostly the doing of 
men. In fact, almost all the people waging war in Bosnia, 
Somalia and Rwanda are men. When we look back, we see that 
all wars have been fought by men.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In Bosnia not only are the Bosnians hostages to the violence, 
but so too are the Canadian soldiers, soldiers from other nations 
and indeed the whole world at large. All of us cannot be innocent 
of this conflict. No matter where we live, we cannot help but be 
impacted by the tremendous tragedy taking place.
<P>
	Canadians should be proud that Canada in its time-honoured 
tradition has continued to do its part. In fact it has done much 
more than its share in Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Tonight our thoughts must go to the Canadian soldiers on the 
ground in Bosnia, to their families here at home, including their 
children who must be living very anxious hours.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3376"> 3376 </A></B>
<P>
	I think I translate the feelings of most Canadians. We have a 
great friendship and a tremendous regard and respect for our 
neighbours to the south, the Americans. At the same time I sense 
from many Canadians that they do not think the Americans have 
played their part in Bosnia. They think that somehow the 
Americans have played a cosy game, that resorting to air strikes 
mostly by American pressure and with American war planes will 
be part of the American agenda because it is partly a political 
agenda: Let us not send ground troops there, so let us carry out 
bombing raids.
<P>
	I wonder if it is normal that the smaller of the two North 
American partners has had troops on the ground for many, many 
months whereas the far more powerful and important partner has 
managed to escape the responsibility of sending ground troops 
for so many months. Is it also normal that many countries have 
managed to cosily stand aside finding excuses not to take part in 
the United Nations peacekeeping effort?
<P>
	The great majority of us, perhaps all of us simply dread an 
escalation of the war. We dread another bombing raid. We 
wonder about the possible failure of bombing raids. Would 
failure leave not only the Bosnians and their families but all our 
troops even more vulnerable than they are today?
<P>
<B>(2135 ) </B>
<P>
	It is with a sense of a tremendous tearing apart of our minds 
and hearts that we face this terrible decision. What do we do? I 
think certainly it is essential for us to make sure that no decision 
is taken without the Russians having their say and being 
involved. Even if I happen to be completely opposed to the idea 
of an air strike, seeing this I realize that decisions like this 
cannot be black and white.
<P>
	I listened very carefully to our two leading ministers on this 
issue, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of 
Defence, this afternoon in caucus and I was struck by their sense 
of caution, of wisdom, of realizing that there is no easy solution.
<P>
	I know that tonight the Prime Minister and our two ministers 
must be thinking through this terrible dilemma that faces all of 
us. In their case they are the people who have the decision to 
make. Who am I to say that it should be one way or another 
without the proper facts at my command, without the 
responsibility to answer for whatever I say?
<P>
	I trust our leadership. I think it has been wise. It has been 
cautious so far. It has been extremely human in its approach. 
Whatever the decision may be, and if it has to be bombing raids 
after much thought, sad as I would be, I would understand that it 
was made with a feeling that it may be the last resort to try and 
stop the Serbians.
<P>
	If this is what our leaders decide, I hope at the same time they 
will add some caveats to the Canadian position asking others, 
especially the United States, to do their share; asking President 
Clinton for more than bombing raids and sending troops there. If 
we can send 2,000  troops surely he can send 3,000 or 4,000 or 
5,000 or 10,000.
<P>
	I hope that our leaders convince the rest of the nations that are 
not participating in the issue on Bosnia to do their fair share.
<P>
	Finally, we must draw lessons from all of this. What of the 
United Nations strategy? What happens in the future? What are 
the lessons to be drawn from Somalia, from Rwanda and today 
from Bosnia and tomorrow maybe from many other places? Can 
we police the world? Can we keep the peace all over the world? 
What should be our strategy for the future?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Tonight I must say, as a man, that I feel very sad thinking that 
it is men like me who have carried out practically endless 
slaughters in many parts of the world, be it in Africa, in 
Northern Ireland or today in Yugoslavia.
<P>
	I notice that the innocent victims of these acts of violence are 
invariably women and children. So tonight we should look 
mostly at the innocent people and pray that our leaders will 
make wise decisions, as they did in the past, to keep our troops 
safe and save the lives of innocent people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Robert Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this debate is a difficult one for many of us and I would 
like to briefly in the few minutes I have remind Canadians that 
the House has been asked to consider a request contained in the 
UN Secretary General's April 18 letter to the Secretary General 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to extend 
arrangements similar to those in place to protect Sarajevo and 
five other UN safe areas in Bosnia.
<P>
<B>(2140 ) </B>
<P>
	NATO had previously agreed to provide air-ground support 
only for self defence of our forces, NATO forces and the United 
Nations protection force, in order to facilitate certain things 
such as rotation of UNPROFOR troops and to protect Sarajevo 
which as we know was designated as an exclusion zone as of last 
February.
<P>
	An exclusion zone differs from a safe haven because in the 
latter case, safe haven, the Bosnian-Serb forces in an exclusion 
zone are required to withdraw their heavy weapons beyond 30 
kilometres or to hand them over to UNPROFOR, UN forces.
<P>
	I understand from what I hear and know of the situation today 
that President Clinton has apparently suggested that all the safe 
havens become exclusion zones, that sanctions be reinforced 
and that a summit meeting be called.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3377"> 3377 </A></B>
<P>
	NATO is to meet tomorrow to consider what to do. If we agree 
with the proposal, it would demonstrate to the Bosnian Serbs 
and others who have questioned the UN's credibility that the 
international community is serious about backing its words with 
actions. It could possibly, as it did in Sarajevo, deter attacks on 
other safe havens.
<P>
	If we do not agree, we could be accused of doing nothing to 
prevent ethnic cleansing, aggression. We could even be accused 
of genocide. If we do not agree, the action may be too little, too 
late and it would not prevent the Bosnian Serbs from continuing 
with their inhumane actions against other human beings.
<P>
	If we did not agree, it would put our forces at risk. It would 
possibly create a situation that would be untenable for many 
people in the former Yugoslavia. I find it very difficult 
nevertheless to support air attacks because as we know in any 
type of initiative of that nature, it has two consequences.
<P>
	First, any air attack that is not supported by good ground 
support in my view is not very effective. Second, it would 
change our role in the UN forces from a peacekeeping to a 
peacemaking role and I am not sure that Canadians today would 
endorse that kind of initiative.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Keep in mind some of the reasons for which we sent our troops 
to Bosnia under the United Nations flag. First, to support 
peacekeeping in that region of the world and, second, for 
humanitarian reasons. Everyone will recall the difficulties we 
had in bringing humanitarian support to Sarajevo. I do not need 
to remind Canadians of the difficulties UN forces had to 
overcome in this conflict.
<P>
	We must remember that Canada has in the past expressed 
serious reservations about the use of air strikes. In our opinion, 
the problem cannot be solved by air strikes; we look instead to a 
negotiated solution. Let us not forget that the international 
community must consider the effect this decision will have on 
the peace process. In the end, a lasting peace can only be a 
negotiated peace, unless the international community is ready to 
impose peace by force.
<P>
	At this time, UN forces in the field are neither equipped nor in 
a position to enforce peace. Whatever decision the international 
community will reach tomorrow must be credible in my eyes 
and in those of the Canadian and international communities. We 
should not make statements that cannot be backed up. Whatever 
the decision, air strikes do not, in my opinion, meet these two 
criteria for making peace unless we go all the way.
<P>
	I do not think the Americans, who do not have any military 
troops in the field at this time, can tell us once again to go there 
while they stay home. So the Americans' contribution to the 
land forces is an important consideration. I think that Russia 
should be ready to participate and that it should have an 
important role to play in this conflict. If I understood Mr. Yeltsin  
correctly, he is ready to accept a summit meeting and that is very 
positive.
<P>
	I for one think that Canada must support Mr. Clinton's and Mr. 
Yeltsin's proposal for a summit meeting where we will be 
certainly present. I am among those who approve a negotiated 
position. I can honestly say I am against violence and air strikes.
<P>
	I don't think we would accomplish much with such measures. 
I agree with those who are totally convinced that negotiation is 
the way to go and that we must draw these people to the 
negotiating table because otherwise we are heading straight for 
a disaster; history will repeat itself. I say so with great sorrow 
and hesitation since I know my opinion is contrary to that of 
many colleagues in this House. Air strikes are not the solution to 
this problem; we will have to negotiate and not use force.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> As there are no more 
speakers, pursuant to the order adopted earlier this day, the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 9.48 p.m.)
