</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC)</B>, seconded 
by the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre, moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-351, an act to assist in the prevention of 
wrongdoing in the public service by establishing a framework for 
education on ethical practices in the workplace, for dealing with 
allegations of wrongdoing and for protecting whistleblowers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the whistleblowers bill is very much in 
the same flavour, somewhat identical to Bill C-206 submitted to 
the House by the member next to me.  Basically it is the same 
bill, another whistleblowers bill which is identical to the bill 
introduced in the other place by Senator Kinsella. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an example of how parliament could and should work 
together to get things done.  It is a bill that should have been 
brought in by the government of the day because obviously it was 
a red book promise in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a series of bills submitted to the House over the 
past few parliaments, recognizing that the public servants of 
Canada need protection so that they can bring breaches of ethics 
and ethical practices to the forefront without punishment from 
their employers.  The bill would also establish a framework of 
education on ethical practices within the public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping the bill will be drawn for debate and will become a 
votable bill.  Certainly we have support from both sides of the 
House, and I hope the government will see fit to bring a bill 
forward if we cannot do it as private members.

Code (dangerous offender). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this private member's bill is entitled an 
act to amend the criminal code respecting dangerous offenders. It 
provides an application under section 753 of the criminal code to 
deem people dangerous offenders before they are released from 
prison for an offence on parole or mandatory supervision or on 
the date when the sentence expires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many times frontline police officers and parole officials 
have been warned that individuals should not be put back into 
society since they are in danger of reoffending.  The bill would 
prevent that from happening.

Code (arrest without warrant). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, my second private member's bill is 
entitled an act to amend the criminal code respecting arrest 
without warrant.  It is based on a number of meetings I have had 
with police officers across Canada in which they have repeatedly 
stated that they need more power to enforce the law in order to 
make society safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill helps them achieve that by giving peace officers the 
power to arrest without a warrant a person who is in breach of a 
probation order binding the person or a condition of the person's 
parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently they can only notify parole officers and sometimes it 
takes so long that a crime is committed.  This would prevent that 
from happening.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce Bill C-354, an 
act to amend the criminal code by taking samples of bodily 
substances.  The idea for the bill came from Bev and Lloyd 
Bergeson of Cremona, Alberta, who lost their daughter Janiece to 
a dangerous driver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would allow a peace officer, who has reasonable or 
probable grounds to believe that a person is operating a motor 
vehicle in a dangerous manner and has caused the death of another 
person, to demand that the person provide a urine, breath or 
blood sample to determine the concentration of any alcohol in the 
person's blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would ensure that those who are suspected of driving 
drunk would be tested immediately by a police officer.  There 
would no longer be any reason to delay the testing of a person as 
a result of the bill.

Speaker, I am very pleased to table a petition signed by 
residents in my constituency of Winnipeg North Centre and other 
citizens of Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are concerned that cellular telephone towers and 
antennae and the radio frequency electromagnetic radiation that 
they emit have not been proven to be unsafe.  They are concerned 
about possible biological changes as a result of RF emissions. 
They are also concerned that the introduction of cellular towers 
into residential areas could be problematic in terms of the 
health and well-being of those neighbourhoods and the residents 
in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They call upon parliament to impose a moratorium on the erection 
of cellular telephone antennae and towers in residential areas 
and to create federal standards for cellular telephone and 
antennae locations that apply to principles of prudent avoidance.

<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (for the Minister of Justice)</B> 
moved that Bill C-7, an act in respect of criminal justice for 
young persons and to amend and repeal other acts, be read the 
third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak today to Bill C-7, the youth criminal justice 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act is a balanced, fair and effective 
approach to youth justice that is supported by a majority of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there are many views on how to address a topic as 
complex as youth crime and the youth justice system. Some argue 
that the youth criminal justice act is too harsh. Others argue it 
is too weak and not tough enough. The federal government, which 
is responsible for criminal law, has heard these views and 
considered them in the development of the youth criminal justice 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act is not about what is tough or 
easy, but about what is fair and appropriate.  I would like to 
focus my comments today on recent get tough recommendations made 
by the attorney general of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before addressing some of Ontario's specific recommendations, I 
will first comment on Ontario's claim that it has not been 
allowed to voice its concerns about the youth criminal justice 
act.  This claim is simply baseless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice met with provincial and territorial 
ministers of justice on this issue on a number of occasions and 
she has heard Ontario's views.  Furthermore, Ontario, like all 
other provinces, was invited to have its officials participate in 
the parliamentary committee hearings on the bill.  It was 
Ontario's choice to decline to participate in this forum. 
Instead, it held its own hearings after three years of 
consultation and debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us turn to some of Ontario's recommendations in its get 
tough approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario recommends that 16 and 17 year olds be automatically 
tried and sentenced as adults when charged with a serious 
offence, such as murder, attempted murder and manslaughter.  This 
recommendation is part of Ontario's call for adult time for adult 
crime.  This may be a catchy sound bite but it is a terribly 
flawed youth justice policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 makes it clear that 16 and 17 year olds who commit 
serious offences can receive an adult sentence.  The bill 
provides a presumption that a young person 14 years of age or 
older found guilty of the most serious offences should receive an 
adult sentence.  These offences include murder, attempted murder, 
manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault and repeated other 
serious violent offences.  The presumption means that it is up to 
the young person to persuade the judge that he or she should 
receive a youth sentence rather than an adult sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 also permits provincial prosecutors to apply for an 
adult sentence for any offence for which an adult would liable to 
more than two years in prison.  This allows provincial 
prosecutors to request an adult sentence for a wide range of 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike Ontario's proposal, the youth criminal justice act does 
not make adult sentences automatic.  The youth criminal justice 
act reflects a belief that judges can be trusted to consider the 
specific circumstances of a case and to determine whether a 
particular offence and offender requires an adult sentence.  It 
also assumes that provincial prosecutors can be trusted to seek 
an adult sentence in appropriate cases.  If the judge finds that 
a youth sentence would not be adequate to hold the young person 
accountable, the judge is required to impose an adult sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario's proposal neglects to take into account that judges, 
after having heard all the elements of the case before them and 
after consideration of the facts, are best placed to determine 
whether a youth sentence would be adequate to hold the young 
person accountable or if an adult sentence is appropriate. 
Ontario apparently does not trust its own prosecutors to use 
their judgment, consider the circumstances of a particular 
offence and apply for an adult sentence in appropriate cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to address another area of Ontario's concerns.  Ontario 
recommends applying adult parole provisions to young people who 
have received an adult sentence for murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-7, if a young person receives an adult sentence for 
first degree murder a life sentence would be imposed.  What is 
fundamental to a youth justice system is the underlying principle 
that a youth has a better chance of rehabilitation and a 
re-integration into the community.  This is precisely the reason 
for which we have allowed for intensive rehabilitation programs 
to be initiated where appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember that no one serving an adult murder 
sentence would be released unless the parole board is satisfied 
that the public would not be at risk if the person were to serve 
a portion of the sentence in the community, under supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario also recommends that the maximum youth sentence be 
increased.  Ontario fails to specify what the maximum youth 
sentence should be and it fails to provide any rationale for 
increasing the maximum sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act does not increase the maximum 
youth sentences for a good reason.  There is no evidence that 
judges have found the existing maximum sentences to be not long 
enough.  Longer maximum sentences are not required to impose 
meaningful consequences that are fair and proportionate to the 
seriousness of the offence.  Longer maximum sentences would not 
increase the likelihood that the young person will be 
rehabilitated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario may not be aware that young persons often receive 
sentences that are more severe than the sentences adults receive 
for the same offence.  For example, for eight of the nine most 
common offences in youth court, youth currently receive longer 
periods of custody than adults who receive custody for the same 
offence.  In addition, youths spend more time in custody than 
adults with similar sentences due to the adult conditional 
release provisions.  These are interesting statistics indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario further recommends mandatory non-discretional sentences 
for 12 to 15 year olds who receive a youth sentence for murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the youth criminal justice act, the judge must impose a 
custodial sentence for murder.  The maximum youth sentence for a 
first degree murder is 10 years and the maximum youth sentence 
for a second degree murder is 7 years.  The judge determines what 
proportion of the sentence will be served in custody and what 
portion of the sentence will be served in the community, under 
conditional supervision.  If the young person breaches a 
condition of the conditional supervision, he or she can be 
returned to custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very unusual for 12 to 15 year olds to commit murder.  If 
such an event occurs, it requires a careful consideration of all 
the circumstances of the offence and flexibility for the judge to 
design a sentence that will hold the young person accountable for 
the offence by imposing meaningful consequences while promoting 
the rehabilitation of the young person. 
This is the approach taken in the youth criminal justice act. It 
is based on the assumption that judges are quite capable of 
exercising their discretion appropriately.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario recommends that co-accused adults and a young person be 
tried together.  Bill C-7 is based on the fundamental principle 
that young persons aged 12 to 17 are not adults and they are 
entitled to separate rules and procedures to take into account 
their reduced level of maturity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For nearly 100 years in Canada, young persons charged with 
offences have been tried separately from adults.  A separate 
trial for young persons and youth courts are a cornerstone of the 
youth justice system in Canada and throughout the western world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although joint trials are possible under the Young Offenders 
Act, if a young person is transferred to an adult court they are 
rarely used, and the current transfer process has many problems, 
including complexity, long delays and unfairness.  These problems 
are addressed in Bill C-7 through the new adult sentencing 
provisions.  All youths would be tried in youth court and only if 
and when the youth has been found guilty does a court turn its 
mind to the appropriate sentence.  This is fairer and more 
efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario further recommends that the focus on alternatives to 
custody be removed.  The youth criminal justice act emphasizes 
the importance of alternatives to custody because a major problem 
under the Young Offenders Act is the very high use of custody, 
particularly for the less serious and non-violent offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth incarceration rate is higher in Canada than in other 
western countries, including the United States.  The youth 
incarceration rate is higher than the adult incarceration rate in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 80% of custodial youth sentences are for non-violent 
offences.  Alternatives to custody, such as requiring the young 
person to repair the harm caused to the victim, can be more 
meaningful and more effective than custody in terms of 
rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario locks up more than 12,000 young persons a year.  Ontario 
has one of the highest rates in the country of incarcerating 
first offenders found guilty of minor theft.  Ontario has been 
criticized by its own provincial auditor for wasting taxpayer 
dollars by failing to use more alternatives to custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 emphasizes the importance of alternatives to custody 
while retaining considerable discretion for judges to decide on a 
fair sentence that holds the young person accountable based on 
principles of proportionality and promoting the rehabilitation of 
the young person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario also recommends that the youth criminal justice act 
permit publication of the identity of any young offender who is 
14 years or older and is charged with a serious offence for which 
an adult sentence is being sought for the duration of the trial. 
This recommendation would mean that whenever a provincial 
prosecutor decides to seek an adult sentence the identity of the 
young person would be made public before a judge even determines 
whether the young person was guilty of the offence.  This would 
place enormous power in the hands of prosecutors.  It would be 
fundamentally unfair to young persons who are entitled to be 
presumed innocent and would largely destroy the longstanding 
protection of privacy of young persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act would provide a much fairer 
approach. It would permit the publication of a young person's 
identity after a young person has been found guilty of the 
offence and a judge has determined that an adult sentence is 
necessary to hold the young person accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Ontario's recommendations cannot be supported. 
Ontario's approach is overly punitive and fails to recognize that 
young people are not adults.  It is not supported by research and 
it is not reflective of the approach that most Canadians support. 
It also reflects a fundamental lack of competence in judges and 
prosecutors being able to exercise discretion to achieve fair, 
proportionate results.  It also lacks faith that youth can be 
rehabilitated and reintegrated into communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 is a much more balanced, fair and effective approach to 
youth justice.  It would require meaningful consequences to be 
imposed yet recognizes that such consequences do not necessarily 
require incarceration or sending a young person to an adult 
system.  It emphasizes the importance of prevention, 
rehabilitation and reintegration.  It recognizes that young 
persons are still maturing and should be treated differently from 
adults.  It recognizes that the circumstances of an offence can 
be complicated and that judges should be able to consider these 
circumstances in determining a fair, proportionate sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act is legislation that most 
Canadians support because, unlike Ontario's approach, it is based 
on fundamental principles of fairness.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to this place in 1997, I remember the minister 
commenting on how youth justice was on her list of priorities and 
had been since the previous spring.  It is now the spring of 
2001, four years later.  Four years for this piece of legislation 
is just a little much, especially when we look at the lack of the 
quality of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians soon became disenchanted with the Young Offenders Act 
when it replaced the Juvenile Delinquents Act, but just wait 
until this youth criminal justice act begins its journey through 
our courts and through our justice system.  It is an abysmal 
attempt to relegislate our youth justice law.  It is complicated 
and will be extremely costly, as legal argument after legal 
argument is made over what parliament's intention was when it is 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will unduly delay justice for young offenders, for 
victims of youth crime and for communities.  Anyone listening to 
this speech will quite naturally ask why.  Because this 
government was never interested in listening to sound arguments 
and suggestions for improvement.  Why?  Because the government 
had a preconceived strategy to merely go through the motions over 
a number of years and appear to hear from interested parties from 
one end of this country to the other, while having no intention 
of deviating from its own determination of what was right for its 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will spend just a few moments to outline the progress of this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the justice committee completed a cross country review 
of the Young Offenders Act and made a number of recommendations. 
One of the most significant recommendations of that committee was 
to include 10 and 11 year olds under the youth justice 
legislation.  Remember that Liberals controlled the committee as 
they made up the majority of the body.  The committee heard of a 
number of tragic cases whereby 10 and 11 year olds were 
committing serious and violent crimes, and thumbing their noses 
at police and the justice system.  These young law breakers knew 
that the present law would not touch them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also heard case after case whereby social welfare 
or children aid facilities lacked the expertise and the resources 
to properly assist these delinquents to get back on to the 
straight and narrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice committee recognized the necessity to bring 10 and 
11 year olds into the more formal youth justice process for the 
safety and security of communities, but especially for the 
interest, guidance and protection of the offenders themselves. 
There should be a definite desire to address misbehaviour before 
it develops into more serious criminal activity and before it 
becomes too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 fails to include 10 and 11 year old offenders.  Those 
who are in so much need for assistance and redirection will not 
get it.  The government does not seem to be interested in helping 
those who desperately need it.  The minister's answer seems to be 
that we should just leave it to present social welfare 
organizations even though it has been acknowledged that they are 
failing and have failed in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island 
and Ontario came to an agreement on youth justice at what was 
known as the Prince Edward Island conference.  One of the 
proposed amendments to the Young Offenders Act was to reduce the 
age of criminal accountability.  As I already mentioned, this 
aspect was completely ignored by the government's youth 
legislation even though those provinces represented a significant 
portion of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those provinces also agreed on a number of issues, such as: 
first, providing for easier transfer to adult court and automatic 
identification of repeat and serious offenders; second, 
application of their victim surcharge to young offenders; third, 
restriction of legal aid to circumstances where youth or the 
guardians cannot afford to pay for legal services; and fourth, 
mandatory custody for offences involving the use of weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say the government did not listen to these 
provinces.  Their proposals were ignored and disregarded.  This 
was in spite of the fact that it was the provinces that were on 
the ground floor, so to speak, on the whole aspect of youth 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada the provinces have constitutional responsibility to 
administer our youth criminal law.  The federal government merely 
makes the law and leaves it to the provinces to try to administer 
whatever mess the legislation creates.  No wonder we often 
question why the provinces and the federal government seem to be 
at odds with each other over so many areas of mutual involvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our constitution could not have been drafted any better for the 
federal government.  It writes the law and then when the law 
causes difficulty, impossibilities, criticism and outrage, it 
merely points an accusing finger at the provinces and their 
administration of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, the government refused to listen to its own 
justice committee and it refused to listen to the provinces, its 
partners in the youth justice process.  I do not know how much 
influence the minister even had over her own legislation.  We all 
hear how the Prime Minister's Office seems to dictate and direct 
almost everything that happens in parliament.  I do know that she 
is ultimately responsible as this legislation has her name on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, so far I have only spoken about the situation back in 
1997.  She still had a lot of time to rectify legislation that 
was so far off track.  After all, she still had debate in this 
place to consider. 
The justice committee would also have had the opportunity to 
review the legislation and propose changes, and the House would 
have had the opportunity at report stage to consider further 
proposals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very well the fall of 1997 and spring of 1998 because 
it was when I first came here.  For a number of months the 
minister kept answering questions about legislation to replace 
the Young Offenders Act.  Upon her appointment as Minister of 
Justice in the early summer of 1997, she stressed that a new 
youth justice program was among her priorities.  She also 
characterized the Young Offenders Act as “easily the most 
unpopular piece of federal legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the rest of 1997, all 1998 and into the spring of 1999, the 
official opposition pressured the minister to introduce her long 
promised legislation.  We all should remember her continual 
claims that it would be coming to the House in a timely manner or 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1999 it finally arrived as Bill C-68.  It was little 
more than a revision of the Young Offenders Act.  A significant 
number of experts and persons involved with the youth justice 
process criticized the legislation as being as bad as or worse 
than the Young Offenders Act.  Others characterized it as being 
essentially the Young Offenders Act with a new name, the youth 
criminal justice act.  In any case, the government merely brought 
in the legislation to put off the pressure that had been coming 
from all directions over just where the youth justice legislation 
was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not much was done with Bill C-68 when the House recessed for the 
summer of 1999.  Over the summer the Prime Minister prorogued 
parliament and the bill died on the order paper.  It should have 
stayed dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of the second session of the 36th parliament, 
the justice minister again talked about youth justice legislation 
appearing in a timely manner.  She then reintroduced her 
legislation as Bill C-3.  It was nothing more than Bill C-68 with 
a new number.  From its introduction in October 1999 until 
parliament was dissolved in October 2000, the government had 
clearly indicated that it was not open to suggestions.  After 
almost a year before the justice committee, and after a 
significant amount of witness testimony, the Liberal dominated 
justice committee referred the bill to the House of Commons 
unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee did not deal with any of the submitted amendments. 
It received approximately 250 proposed amendments, including 
roughly 150 from the government itself which were primarily 
technical in nature.  The Bloc submitted two amendments.  In 
summary, its amendments were to keep the Young Offenders Act or 
exempt Quebec from the youth criminal justice act, allowing the 
province to continue operating under the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservatives had some very practical 
suggestions that would likely have received support from many 
members of the official opposition.  The NDP proposals were not 
generally in accordance with our views and we likely would not 
have supported them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proposed approximately 50 substantial amendments which 
followed much of what had been heard through the justice 
committee process, as well as a number of changes to simplify 
what many experts deemed to be a complex piece of legislation 
that would become a haven for legal arguments throughout the 
various court levels.  Youthful offenders would be subject to 
inordinate delays, legal aid costs would sore, as would costs for 
court administration, crown attorneys and police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At report stage of Bill C-3, the opposition parties and the 
government resubmitted their committee amendments.  In addition, 
the Bloc decided to filibuster the process and presented more 
than 3,000 proposals to send a message of its dissatisfaction 
with the bill.  Consequently, Bill C-3 died on the order paper 
with the election call in October 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation was essentially reintroduced as Bill C-7 in this 
parliament.  It was almost in the same format as it was when it 
was known as Bill C-68 in 1999.  In over two years the government 
merely reaffirmed its intention of refusing to accept any 
significant change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently the minister, in response to one of my questions 
in the House, attempted to confuse Canadians when she suggested 
that she had made some 182 amendments to her youth criminal 
justice legislation.  Yes, she made about that number of changes, 
but at least 90% of them were as a result of poor drafting in the 
first place.  The government, after almost two years as a 
priority and after months of promises to bring forth legislation 
in a timely fashion, ended up rushing the law into parliament 
with a significant number of French translation problems and a 
number of inconsistencies between various clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other amendments included in Bill C-7 were as a result of the 
government finally recognizing some of the problems created by 
its legislation.  Some things would just not work as set out in 
Bill C-68 and Bill C-3.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other changes came about as a result of lobbying by special 
interest groups because they came from left field and had never 
been discussed or argued before the justice committee.  However 
not one word changed as a result of the work of the justice 
committee or the amendments proposed by the opposition.  As I 
said before, the government was obviously not ever in a position 
to consider amendments through the parliamentary review process. 
It was a done deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole process of parliamentary review has been in fact a 
sham.  The opposition, the government backbenchers, the committee 
process are merely window dressing to assist the government in 
selling its program for youth justice.  There has never really 
been an open review toward improving proposed legislation.  It 
has already been decided that only the powers within this 
government know what is best for Canadians.  Some might say that 
is indeed a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say it is essentially a fraud on the Canadian people.  We are 
all sent here to do a job as best we can and to have our input 
into having legislation take into account the interests and 
concerns of all the various parts of the country.  When we are 
essentially placed in a position of merely going through the 
motions for appearances sake, the something is drastically wrong 
with the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some listeners may suggest I am being unduly harsh and critical 
of this legislation.  I do so because of my concern for a proper 
and effective response to the universally accepted failure of the 
Young Offenders Act.  When the country fails to properly address 
youth crime, we fail those young persons who get themselves on 
the wrong side of the law.  When the process becomes so time 
consuming and complicated that many offenders are able to beat 
the system, we lead them and their peers into believing that they 
can get away with breaking our laws.  When we fail to properly 
rehabilitate those young offenders, we do them no favour as it 
often becomes too late to subsequently bring them back on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the offender.  What about the family of the 
offender who sit on the sidelines to witness that young person 
repeat and perhaps move on to more serious and violent crime? 
What about the victims of those initial and repeat crimes?  It is 
a common fact that the most common victim of youth crime is 
another youth.  Young people assault other young people.  Young 
people sexually assault other young persons.  The list goes on. 
What about the communities?  When a young offender does not 
receive proper guidance and reformation, that person will likely 
reoffend against the same community against which he committed 
his original crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder citizens and communities do not feel safe and secure 
these days.  We have all heard the horror stories of the failure 
of the Young Offenders Act.  I am afraid we will hear the same 
stories when this youth criminal justice act works its way 
through the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has had almost four years to bring in an 
efficient and effective bill to address the youth justice 
problem.  It has had the opportunity to hear from experts and 
professionals from right across the country.  It has had the 
opportunity to hear from the provinces to address their concerns. 
It could have done a much better job than Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully appreciate that many members and Canadians have not had 
the opportunity to spend the time on this legislation as I have. 
I have been the official opposition justice critic responsible to 
watchdog this particular piece of legislation.  As well, I have 
been a member of the justice committee since the bill first saw 
the light of day back in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to cover a few aspects of my concerns.  The 
minister likes to play lawyer games and provide half truths and 
worse about this bill.  It is her job to sell the legislation 
after all.  She needs the support and she is forced to sing the 
song to get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the bill formerly recognizes a process of what has been 
described as diversion or alternative programming.  The process 
has been around for a number of years, and I have worked with it 
myself for over five years now.  It is essentially an informal 
process of dealing with the young person who becomes sidetracked 
and breaks our criminal law.  Specified members of the community, 
the offender and perhaps the victim get together and decide how 
to best recognize the damage done and how best to have that 
offender address the misconduct and the misbehaviour.  The 
offender accepts blame, faced agreed upon consequences and moves 
on with his or her live hopefully having learned the error of his 
or her ways.  The program has a good success rate, when limited 
in scope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with Bill C-7 is that this procedure is not 
restrictive.  It is open for repeat offenders and is available 
for violent offenders.  Being an informal system, there will be 
little, if any, accounting to ensure that the offender has 
learned the error of his or her ways if the system permits 
offence after offence without a more formal and serious reaction 
by society to the criminal behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that it would be up to the provinces to police 
or administer.  We proposed to limit this scheme to no-violent 
first time offenders, essentially a one time opportunity to avoid 
a criminal record and get back on track.  The minister refused to 
consider this proposal and has merely dumped the problem on to 
the provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of extrajudicial measures is very similar to the 
government's introduction of conditional sentencing a few years 
back.  Conditional sentencing was brought in for adults to permit 
less serious offenders to serve their sentences at home. However, 
in that case as well, the government did not limit the use of 
that form of more lenient sentencing.  We have seen our courts 
provide home sentencing to violent, serious and repeat offenders. 
Victims and communities are outraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has finally recognized that there is a problem and 
that it should now be studied.  Are we to end up with the same 
problem with youth extrajudicial measures when it is allowed for 
violent and repeat youth offenders?  I thoroughly support 
diversion and alternative measures but their use must be 
restricted, otherwise its whole use will come into disrepute. 
Once again, however, the government will not listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also major concern over the legislation and its 
presumptive offence scheme.  For some reason the government has 
severely restricted the list of offences for which a young person 
is liable for automatic adult sentencing and identification.  The 
minister has been saying that there is provision for naming those 
who receive adult sentences.  What she has not said is that there 
is also provision for those young persons to apply to have their 
identity protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also major concern over the lack of sufficient 
resources for our youth justice process.  For years now the 
federal government has been delinquent in paying its share of the 
50/50 cost of youth justice with the provinces.  The minister has 
been trumpeting the fact that the government has allotted $206 
million over three years toward the initiation costs of the new 
youth criminal justice act.  Nowhere has she acknowledged the 
already significant shortfall on the shared financial obligation 
toward youth justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two hundred and six million dollars sounds like a lot of money, 
and it is, but it is over three years and it is for all the 
provinces.  The provinces are already raising the red flag that 
there has been no real cost analysis of the increased demands of 
the changes proposed by the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously in the past this government has not been too concerned 
about ensuring that young offenders receive sufficient and proper 
supervision and rehabilitation.  The government's cheating on the 
50/50 formula is evidence of that.  It is no wonder there is so 
much skepticism about whether the $206 million will be adequate 
to address the additional demands of this law.  We are going into 
the new initiative with no idea of its cost.  Only the Liberal 
government operates in this fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the opting out clause, clause 61, whereby the 
provinces can create a different criminal law from province to 
province.  Under this clause, an offence as serious as murder 
would be treated differently depending on the province in which 
it is committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not too keen to hear criticism of the 
legislation.  It is bringing in closure on debate of the bill. 
Whenever it gets into trouble it does that.  How many Canadians 
realize that the legislation would reduce sentences for the most 
serious offenders?  The bill would mandate a supervisory or 
probationary period after custody.  That period would be half the 
custody period.  Therefore, instead of serving a maximum sentence 
of three years in custody, as was done under the Young Offenders 
Act, the most serious offenders would only need to serve two 
years in custody and would be able to serve another year at home 
under some form of supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister often relies on the fact that the Bloc criticizes 
the legislation as too harsh and the Canadian Alliance criticizes 
it as too soft.  She says that she has a balanced approach that 
is between the two alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, if the bill is hopelessly flawed—and I 
would use stronger terms but that might be unparliamentary—then 
it is expected that the opposition parties will disagree with it 
from different angles.  The minister's response is a copout.  She 
has failed in her duty to develop proper and effective 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know you are aware that about eight and a half 
years ago my son Jesse was murdered as he walked home with two 
friends from a party on a Saturday night.  He was murdered in 
what was determined to be a random, unprovoked attack on the 
street by six total strangers.  He was knocked to the ground 
unconscious, beaten, pummelled with a shopping cart and stabbed 
once in the back as he lay on the road.  A 16 year old was 
charged and eventually convicted.  I can therefore say that I 
have experienced the youth justice system from an entirely 
different perspective than most members in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My family and I spent 20 months in the courts.  We experienced 
the youth justice process.  We heard the excuses.  We went 
through a transfer hearing.  We heard counsellors come in and say 
that the offender did not need to be transferred to adult court 
because all he needed was to finish high school and receive 
alcohol counselling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the ensuing years I have come to know many families of 
victims of young offenders.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less than a week after my son was murdered there was a case in 
Courtenay, British Columbia, where a young girl, six years old, 
was murdered by her neighbour.  He was 15 at the time and was on 
probation for sexually assaulting three young children a year 
earlier.  The reason that happened was that under his probation 
conditions no one was monitoring him and he was allowed to play 
with young children.  The police did not even know about him and 
his neighbours certainly did not know about him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That opened my eyes to the whole issue of anonymity for young 
offenders.  I have been a firm believer ever since that people 
must be aware when they have sex offenders in the community, even 
if they are young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the case of Mr. Graham Niven, a 31 year old man 
murdered on the street by a 15 and an 18 year old.  The last 
thing Mr. Niven did in his life was help out a 14 year old by 
giving him the last of the change in his pocket to take a taxi 
home.  A few minutes later he was dead at the hands of a 15 year 
old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to court with that family and had to sit through the 
snickering, laughing and high fives that went on continuously 
between the accused and his friends.  That is the attitude some 
of these young people have with our court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a sideline, that offence occurred in Coquitlam.  The mayor at 
the time was Mr. Lou Sekora, a former member of this place.  I 
recall like yesterday the hoopla that Mr. Sekora raised.  He said 
he would come to Ottawa and change the Young Offenders Act. 
However after a photo op with the former justice minister and a 
bit of press for about a week we never again heard from Mr. 
Sekora on the issue, even when he came to this place as a member. 
It was more Liberal lip service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another case is that of Mrs. Jeanne Richter, a 79 year old widow 
beaten to death by a 15 and a 19 year old.  Young girls in the 
courtroom who were friends of the accused were partying, winking, 
smiling and laughing as if it were something that happens every 
day.  Again, that is the attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not suggest for one minute that this is a reflection of all 
young people.  It is a very small minority.  Unfortunately the 
government, through this legislation and philosophy, chooses to 
treat these young people the same way it would treat a 12 year 
old shoplifter.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday during report stage debate I heard some of my 
colleagues in the Bloc speak of an actor who spent time in a 
youth facility studying for a part in a particular project and 
decrying the treatment of young offenders in prisons.  Things 
could be done to improve the lot of young offenders who are 
incarcerated.  I certainly do not argue with that.  However I 
think the actor might like to spend time with me and my family, 
even eight and a half years later.  Within the last month two of 
my son's best friends have seen the birth of their first 
children.  He should see how we deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a family in Alberta mourning the loss of a 16 year old 
son just last week.  Maybe the actor would like to spend a week 
with them and see it from their perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After my son's murder I made a commitment to try to effect 
change.  I have spoken at schools for the past eight years.  I 
have spoken with young people, parent groups and legislators. I 
appeared before the justice committee a couple of times before I 
came to this place.  I have done so to increase awareness and to 
make young people understand what they are doing, what they are 
getting into.  I think it gets through to most of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, I work with a diversion program because I 
believe it is more important to prevent crime in the first place. 
However that does not mean that those who choose to persist in 
criminal behaviour or commit serious or multiple repeat offences 
should be treated with leniency.  As long as the philosophy 
persists that killers and rapists should be treated in the same 
manner as shoplifters, Canadians will never accept the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close my comments by saying that this is definitely not 
the last we will hear of the youth criminal justice act.  We will 
be back time and time again to debate its failures and propose 
changes.  Instead of trying to get it right the first time the 
government seems more intent on getting it passed as is and 
leaving it to others to rectify.  Unfortunately the bill is such 
a mess that it will not and cannot be remedied piecemeal after it 
passes this place.  The bill is doomed to failure and as 
parliamentarians we are failing Canadians by allowing it to 
become law.

on the wrong track with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also going to try to convince the House that we in Quebec 
did not just decide overnight to set off on a crusade against 
the federal government on this young offenders bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that those who have studied the young offender 
issue, and I know certain members on the other side have looked at 
it very seriously, know deep down that they are off on the wrong 
track by wishing to pass this bill at any price, come what may, 
despite all that has been said in Quebec, and even in the other 
Canadian provinces, about its complexity, about the fact that 
the bill is going to be impossible to apply and above all will 
not give the anticipated results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well before passage of the Young Offenders Act in 1984, Quebec 
already had its approach to young offenders.  It had the Loi sur 
le bien-être social, which addressed young offenders and took a 
very particular approach to them, before the federal government 
enacted its young offender legislation in 1984.  The Quebec 
statute applied to young people aged 14, 15, 16 and 17, 
particularly the 16 and 17 year olds who had committed serious 
crimes. 
The Quebec system took charge of these young people and 
processed them through a system parallel to the one for adult 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, we already had an infrastructure for handling 
young people in trouble with the law.  In 1984, with the great 
wisdom of the House, prompted particularly by the paternalism of 
the federal MPs—

the government members, especially those from Quebec, that they 
are making a mistake with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the call for quorum, I was trying to provide a brief 
backgrounder on the issue of young offenders in Quebec.  Even 
before the federal government became involved in the matter with 
the passage in 1984 of the Young Offenders Act in Quebec, we 
already had an infrastructure for young people in difficulty 
with the law, especially those aged 16 and 17 involved in 
serious crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One fine day, with a view to having some sort of uniformity 
across Canada, the federal government passed the Young Offenders 
Act.  There is good reason the law covers those aged up to 18 
years.  At the time, all the other provinces wanted the law to 
apply to young people aged 12 to 16 only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was the age limit increased to 18?  It was because the Prime 
Minister at the time was from Quebec and, regardless of what we 
think of him, he held up his end on social issues. 
The Prime Minister in question was Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
Quite honestly, he was not my idol, not at all, in his view of 
Canada, and of Quebec in particular, but on social issues he 
was on the mark, unlike the present Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He stood up before English Canada and made the maximum age in 
the Young Offenders Act 18 years.  From that point on, we 
applied the Young Offenders Act in Quebec.

unanimous consent of the House to return to Routine Proceedings 
in order to table a document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Is there unanimous consent of 
the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

right now.

wondering whether the House really wanted to hear what I had to 
say.  I will continue with my speech as though nothing had 
happened, although it is rather difficult to concentrate when 
one is constantly interrupted.  I hope that you will deduct the 
time I lost because I do indeed intend to use the 40 minutes to 
which I am entitled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has long looked after its young offenders and views the 
problem as a very important one.  As I said, even before the 
federal government passed the Young Offenders Act in 1984, we 
were already addressing the problem of youths, particularly 16 
and 17 year olds, who had committed serious offences through the 
agency of various departments in Quebec, including the social 
welfare department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also had young offenders legislation. 
This was a matter that concerned us.  From the outset, we 
invested time and money putting together what we now call the 
Quebec approach.  This was not something we did overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984 the federal government decided to intervene and 
introduce the Young Offenders Act for young people between the 
ages of 12 and 18 in conflict with the law. This was based on 
Quebec's approach at the time, because our young offenders 
legislation was aimed at adolescents up to the age of 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1984, the federal government has amended its legislation a 
number of times, each time taking a harder line with respect to 
the approach, the sentences or the treatment of young people in 
conflict with the law, but never moving closer to what we were 
doing in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The act has been amended several times since 1993 and on each 
occasion Quebec told the House of Commons and the committees “Be 
careful; you are going much too far to the right. You are 
getting much too close to the adult justice system”. Since 1993, 
this House and the Liberal government have always turned a deaf 
ear to Quebec's claims, particularly as regards this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's representations were based on a very serious study. I 
am taking this opportunity to salute youth court justice Michel 
Jasmin, who is Quebec's co-ordinating judge and who does a 
remarkable job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1990 to 1992, I am mentioning these dates from memory, 
because I have nothing in front of me regarding them, a number of 
other experts, including Normand Bastien, members of the Bar and 
Cécile Toutant, who also sat on that committee, reviewed the 
whole issue of young offenders in Quebec, from the time of their 
arrest until they left the youth centre or were done with their 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These experts found that the Young Offenders Act, which was 
implemented properly at the time, could be applied even better 
by getting all the stakeholders involved, including the police 
officers making the arrest, before the 
court appearance, the experts and psychologists at trial and all 
the experts involved when the young offender was in custody, 
should this be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Jasmin report is now the authoritative reference with 
respect to youth justice. Already back then, it warned the 
federal government, which wanted to toughen its approach with 
young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conclusion of that important report is very simple. The 
problem is not the Young Offenders Act, but its implementation. 
Although the results were good at the time, these people 
wondered about our own—

recently tried to move a motion to table a document.  He claimed 
that he did not need unanimous consent of the House of Commons to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am raising a question with regard to the actions taken by the 
government House leader and to what he claims.  I am reading from 
<I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I> with regard to the 
daily program, chapter 10, page 371, where it reads:

Minister may table documents in the House during Routine 
Proceedings when the rubric “Tabling of Documents” is called.

tabling. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my understanding of the rules, since the government House 
leader did not present his motion and his document during routine

the document without unanimous consent of the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was giving a historical overview and saying that, in the 
history of the application of the Young Offenders Act, we in 
Quebec have examined the legislation on a number of occasions in 
order to see whether it could be better enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early 1990s we had the Jasmin report, which indicated 
that the fault was not with the law but with its application. 
That is the conclusion we in Quebec reached with respect to the 
system, Quebec's approach, although we were enforcing the law 
properly.  This conclusion applies to 100% of the western 
provinces.  If the Canadian Alliance can grasp this, it is not 
the law that is faulty, but its application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces calling for changes are those not properly 
applying the Young Offenders Act.  Throughout the whole history 
of the Young Offenders Act, in Quebec, we were not inactive; if 
we reached these conclusions, it is because we were aware of 
what was going on elsewhere.  We concluded that we had to be 
careful, because the young offenders system was not fail-safe since 
it was a statute, not to upset the 
balance we had struck in Quebec in the application of the Young 
Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the start of my mandate in 1993-94 with the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights, we toured the main 
provinces to look at the issue of young offenders. 
It was very distressing to see how some provinces treated young 
offenders, especially those who had committed serious crimes. 
They were simply sent to a separate wing in an adult prison 
untreated.  The young person lying in bed spent the day reading. 
When asked what he was doing, he told us he was doing time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec young persons do not do time, they work on who they 
are.  They do not spend the entire day reading.  Young people 
incarcerated for a long time, even for a short time, are under 
the care of psychoeducators, specialists, academics and 
criminologists in an effort to discover why they do certain 
things.  The aim is to find the right treatment for the 
individual young person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's objective, which should be everyone's objective in 
properly applying the Young Offenders Act, is to try to find the 
appropriate measure to ensure that the young person becomes an 
ordinary citizen as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want pity for the young people who have committed a 
murder or done something else that is repulsive. In a civilized 
society like ours there should be no such crime. We should not 
even have 14 and 15 year olds thinking about killing someone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children aged 10 and 11 have committed suicide. Society is 
changing. We have become a consumer society. All sorts of 
actions result in some people needing help. The way the Young 
Offenders Act has been applied since the beginning shows that we 
can intervene adequately and that we can find the right measure at 
the right time. 
I sincerely believe the provinces, or rather the Minister 
of Justice, did not understand this approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset, we can deal with the young person, whether he 
is guilty or not of the offence or crime with which he has been 
charged. Under the existing Young Offenders Act, we can take 
action, deal with that young person and follow him at every 
stage of the process, including his trial. This is something 
that be difficult to do under the proposed bill. I will get 
back to this when I talk about the major differences 
between the two pieces of legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>During those years, Quebec developed what is now known as the 
Quebec approach. I realize we cannot ask western Canada to 
adopt an approach similar to that of Quebec overnight. 
If these provinces do not have the infrastructures to look 
after these young people, if they do not have the experts and 
the financial means to suddenly apply Quebec's approach, which 
is based on 20 years of experience, I can understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However what I do not understand is why they are asking for an act 
to prevent Quebec from continuing to use an approach that gives 
good results. I find it hard to understand that way of thinking, 
both on the part of western Canada and of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I listened carefully to the Canadian Alliance member, 
who has followed the bill's progress closely, and I would not 
wish what he has been through on anyone.  However, should we 
build an entire system on one case?  Should we rebuild an 
unproven system, whose results are cause for concern in the 
opinion of all the specialists, on the strength of the worst 
case scenario? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to western Canadians, crown attorneys and 
provincial representatives, who told us that the 
end results were far from guaranteed, that the bill was much too 
complex and that implementing it would cost far too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may therefore well wonder whether these provinces, which are 
calling for amendments, will implement the new legislation they 
have obtained back home in a manner consistent with what the 
Minister of Justice has in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's entire system is 
being jeopardized for people who will not deal adequately with 
young people in conflict with the law anyway, because it is not 
part of their tradition or their longstanding treatment of young 
people in conflict with the law.  That is a big concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset, I noticed that Quebecers agreed with 
Quebec's approach and that there was consensus.  Since 1996-97, 
the federal government has tried on more than one occasion to 
amend the Young Offenders Act. 
I am sure that Bloc Quebecois members who were here in 1993 
remember the government's first attempt to amend the act with 
Bill C-68.  Because of the Bloc Quebecois' opposition, the issues 
raised by this bill and the work we did, we pushed the 
government to the limit and, finally—

Canadian Alliance members, I see they have a great future in 
this parliament.  I am sure they are very pleased with 
themselves.  I understand their attitude toward a bill that is 
terribly harmful to Quebec.  I understand their desire to fool 
around as they are doing in this House.

approach that is very typical of them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To continue, this examination showed us that there was consensus 
in Quebec.  Having toured Canada and certain parts of Quebec, 
the committee readily realized that there were two ways of 
applying the Young Offenders Act, one in Quebec and one in 
English Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good legislators and responsible people that we are, I 
believe we need to look at outcomes.  The results indicate that 
the province which applies the Young Offenders Act properly that 
being Quebec, has a lower crime rate than the rest of Canada and 
a recidivism rate for serious crime that is virtually 
non-existent or at least the lowest in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the judiciarization of cases, Quebec is the province 
that puts the fewest young offenders through the court system. 
We have the lowest incarceration rate for this age group in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the other provinces, we see that, although the crime 
rate has also been decreasing in other provinces, youth crime 
has not followed suit.  We see that these provinces make heavy 
use of the court system and of incarceration.  We see that youth 
are not receiving treatment.  Consequently, these provinces get 
the results they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to me and all the Bloc Quebecois, an opinion on which 
there is unanimity in Quebec, if a change needs to be made 
anywhere, it is not in Quebec but in western Canada, in the 
maritime provinces, in— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> The hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm may resume the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was about to use a few 
choice words that are popular in Quebec. However, I will carry 
on. I will take a deep breath, because it is very difficult to 
concentrate when we are constantly being interrupted. I will now 
deal with the core of this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realized very quickly that there was a consensus in Quebec. 
Even though I had already toured Quebec, even though I had 
already met people from English Canada, following the 
refusal of the Minister of Justice to hear witnesses from Quebec 
on Bill C-7 which is a response to Quebec, I decided to do another tour 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was accompanied, as everyone knows, by Marc Beaupré, the actor 
who played Kevin in a televised series. His life and 
professional experiences differ from mine, but he delivered an 
excellent message and did a very good job. I am taking this 
opportunity today to thank him for depoliticizing the whole 
debate. 
He comes from Lanaudière and has not only depoliticised the 
whole debate, but has raised perceptions in Quebec.  I think he 
has improved perceptions there of our treatment of young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, I went to hear these witnesses, people the 
minister refused to hear.  I met them on site: at youth 
court, in centres for young people, in rehabilitation centres, 
in group homes for young people and in social groups. 
The minister would have done well to listen to them, 
because their message was clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not want, for all sorts of reasons, to have Bill C-7, 
which will be passed here in the House in a few hours perhaps, 
applied in Quebec. 
What they want is to continue to apply the Young Offenders Act 
as it stands and to try to apply it better, if that is possible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised to learn that it could cost an additional 
$200 million to $250 million a year to implement Bill C-7, the bill 
no one in Canada wants, except perhaps the Alliance.  Over five 
years, the federal government will invest and 
pour $1 billion into this system of criminal justice for young persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal government opposite has 
$1 billion for young people it does not know what to do with, 
instead of paying for the luxury of new legislation, it should 
take the money and give it to the provinces, as they are asking 
it to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee, representatives from five Canadian provinces came 
to tell us that, if asked to choose between a complex, 
incomprehensible and unenforceable piece of legislation such as 
Bill C-7 and cash, to use their term, they would prefer the cash. 
Why?  In order to pattern themselves as closely as possible on 
the Quebec approach, which is based on rehabilitation, stepping 
in at the right time and treating youth fairly, which produces 
concrete results, results we have all seen.  Department of 
Justice statistics document these results.  Given a choice 
between new legislation and cash, they want the cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that if we invested $1 billion on improving 
enforcement of the Young Offenders Act, the results would point 
more in the direction of continuing with that legislation. Very 
good results would also be obtained in the other Canadian 
provinces, as they are in Quebec.  What is needed for the 
legislation to be enforced properly is money, not new 
legislation. 
The problem lies in the perception of the Young Offenders Act, 
not in the act itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government puts out publicity on almost anything 
going: Canadian defence, Canada Post, the protection of small 
birds, fish, just name it.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the federal government not publicize the real costs of 
properly enforcing the Young Offenders Act?  There has been 
success in some cases, and in many cases in Quebec.  I have 
personally met people who, at the age of 15 or 16, committed a 
murder.  Today, they are anonymous members of the public.  For 
all sorts of reasons to do with families, gangs or drugs, they 
committed a reprehensible act, but at least we saved them and 
they are now anonymous citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What good will the minister's wonderful legislation do, if a 14 
or 15 year old youth gets a life sentence? As we know, under the 
current system, that youth would serve 25 years. In 25 years 
from now, that 15 year old youth will be 40. He will still be in 
the prime of life, but he will have spent half of his life in a 
school for crime, an adult prison. What will he do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In adult prisons, there is no treatment such as the one provided 
to young people in youth centres. He will serve his time, as 
they say in the penitentiary jargon. What good will it do to 
society that that youth get out at 40? The protection of society 
might be ensured for 25 years, but that is pushing the problem 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, under the Young Offenders Act, that youth may be 
sentenced to six years of detention at worst, but those are six 
years of firm treatment, six years with specialists, because 
there are several working on any given case. Afterwards, he will 
be monitored over a 10 year period, until they are sure he has 
been rehabilitated or is on his way to be so. During 16 years, 
that youth will be monitored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually, he might end up paying taxes like us.  He 
might have children.  He might get integrated in the society in 
which he lives. He will not be branded as some would like him to 
be, with his name published, his picture in the papers and a 
life sentence for a 14 or 15 year old youth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can already hear people say “But this would make it possible 
for a province to prevent 14 and 15 year olds from getting an 
adult sentence”. This is true, but do members realize that a 
young person will still have to stand trial in an adult court, 
with adult rules? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only after the trial, whether he is found guilty or not, 
that the order comes into play. Despite the order, the crown 
prosecutor might still ask, for all kinds of reasons, that this 
young person be given an adult sentence. There would be a trial, 
with a very complex series of judicial measures before that, 
such as the adult court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would this be a service to both the population and the 14 year 
old to have him tried as an adult, to treat him as an adult? 
Would we solve his situation or his case? Would society feel 
more secure if this young person were tried as an adult? There 
are all kinds of legal fictions in this bill. Government 
frontbenchers say, one by one, that a youth justice court judge 
will hear these cases, that they will no longer be referred to 
an adult court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is true verbally, but when we take a look at clause 3 of 
the bill, we realize this is not the case. The government thinks 
we have not read the bill. To say this demonstrates a lack of 
intellectual rigour, because this is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does provide that a youth justice court judge will be 
responsible, but in fact it will be a superior court judge who, 
for such trial, will be deemed to be a youth justice court 
judge. I know very well that in several judicial divisions of 
Quebec and Canada, youth courts do not have the necessary 
facilities to hold trials by judge and jury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything is provided for in the bill. Such cases will be tried 
before adult court, but for the purpose of the proceeding, this 
court will be “deemed to be a youth justice court”, and the 
judge will be “deemed to be a youth justice court judge”. This 
is going very far. It is tantamount to being tried before adult 
court. Furthermore, the age limit will be lowered from 16 to 14. 
A young person aged 14 could be tried as an adult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People across the way tell us that the bill does not affect 
Quebec's approach. On what planet do they live? During my 12 
to 14 day tour, among the many people I met, there was not one 
who supported the bill. Everybody wishes to keep the Young 
Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Not even the natives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B>  As my colleague said, I even heard 
aboriginal people, the sons 
of the federal government, state in a press conference that Bill 
C-7 will never be applied on their territory. 
We will continue, even though the federal government passes its 
bill, to apply the Young Offenders Act on our territory. They 
even said that this act did not necessarily reflect their 
cultural values, but that it included everything they could 
use to get closer to these values and that they were getting good 
results. Even aboriginal people, and they can certainly not be 
accused of being separatists, are opposed to the government's 
bill. I challenge the members opposite: no one in Quebec 
supports Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the Minister of Justice misquoted the letter from the 
Quebec bar association. It is not true that the Quebec bar 
association supports Bill C-7. Just contact them through Carole 
Brosseau, to whom I spoke personally. This is misinformation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get a letter from the bar association, the government even 
said that the Bloc Quebecois had moved amendments to Bill C-7 in 
committee, but that is not true. The Bloc Quebecois never moved 
an amendment in committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will never seek to have an act that is so 
flawed, ill-conceived and dangerous for Quebec amended. We did 
not do so in committee and we did not do so at report stage. We 
simply did not. It is being intellectually dishonest to tell the 
Quebec bar association, in order to get a letter from them, that the 
Bloc Quebecois moved an amendment on the speediness of the 
proceedings and that we were satisfied. This was not true. No 
member of the Bloc Quebecois was satisfied with that. Contrary to 
what the minister said yesterday in the House, the Quebec bar 
association does not support the bill. No one in Quebec supports 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that some government members have friends in the 
national assembly. Jean Charest, the saviour of the Liberals 
opposite, does not support the federal approach. Liberal, PQ and 
ADQ members unanimously condemn Bill C-7. Does this not mean 
anything to government members? Do they not realize that they 
making a mistake? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They always think that they, the government, know best, that they 
are right and that everybody else is wrong: all the experts, 
youth court judges, reporters, lawyers, crown prosecutors and 
criminal lawyers whom I have met and who have expressed their 
views on this, all those who are working under the Young 
Offenders Act, and the unanimous position of Quebecers. Can they 
all be wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be so easy to make things right, and it is still not 
too late. 
The government should wake up, realize that it is mistaken, that 
members are mistaken. It is still not too late, before third 
reading, to refer the bill to committee in order to include an 
amendment that would allow those provinces that so desire to 
take a more repressive approach and to let Quebec keep its 
approach, which has required a good deal of work and hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to develop over the years—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will use the four minutes 
I have left, despite the fact that I find deplorable what is 
happening here. Frankly, when I toured Quebec I always said that 
my tour was more of a social than political initiative. It was 
an information tour. I did not want to turn the matter into a 
political issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the member of the Canadian Alliance may feel 
some resentment or whatever. However, since we are dealing with 
an issue as important as youth, and an approach that has proven 
effective in Quebec, the hon. member could put aside the 
partisanship and arrogance he has shown all morning and deal 
more seriously with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat what I have already said “It is not too late for the 
government. It is not too late”. Yesterday, I offered 
to go on another tour of Quebec with the minister, on a 
non-partisan basis and with all the necessary interpreters and 
personnel, and meet with the people I met and others also, 
because I am ready was anywhere. I am sure of what I am 
saying. Quebecers are unanimously saying that the federal 
government is on the wrong tack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister refused to meet with these people. 
She refuses to listen to them, to go to meet them, as if she 
were living in a glass bubble in Ottawa, briefed only by her 
officials who have drafted legislation in their ivory tour, the 
kind of unenforceable and complex legislation that they alone 
can draft. The minister refuses to acknowledge that kind of 
reality. 
Maybe she cannot spare the time to go on a tour of Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am saying that it is not too late to send Bill C-7 
back to the committee where it could be further reviewed, 
allowing Quebec and other provinces wishing to continue using an 
approach based on rehabilitation and reintegration rather than 
repression to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I moved an amendment that was rejected yesterday. It was a legal 
and constitutional amendment examined by specialists. However the 
government is not listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It wants, at all costs, to pass legislation based on the 
seriousness of the offence and that consideration will influence 
the whole process while the existing Young Offenders Act is 
based on the needs of young offenders. 
By correctly enforcing the Young Offenders Act, we could 
individualize the treatment needed by each youth to become an 
honest citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada took at least 15 years to interpret 
the act concerning the needs of young offenders and to say what 
it really means. How many years will it take it to interpret 
what the legislator meant when he said that the seriousness of 
the offence must take precedence over the sentence, the 
treatment and the process? How long will it take the Supreme 
Court of Canada to determine the issue of the day to day 
application of the act? There is a series of automatic processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, with the bill the government wants to impose on Quebec, 
judges will use a grid to assess a case and simply put a 
checkmark depending on the severity of the offence, without 
being able to take the kind of action they would like to take. 
That is the difference between the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my tour I met Quebecers who dealt with victims of 
crimes, including 
people from CAVAC. They shared the same opinion as everyone else. 
They were against the approach chosen by the Minister of Justice 
in Bill C-7. I would have like the minister to have heard that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also met fathers and mothers who told me that I was not making 
the point clearly enough that the Young Offenders Act gave them 
the tools they needed to help their children get back on the 
right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth crime does not affect only those families where children 
are neglected by the parents. If there is one thing that is true 
about youth crime, it is the fact that it affects families 
indiscriminately, whether the parents' wallets are full or 
empty. Youth crime can affect rich families as well as poor and 
needy families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People asked me to stress the fact that the Young Offenders Act 
gave them the tools they needed, which they will no longer have 
once Bill C-7 has been passed. Everything will be based on 
mechanisms. Certain decisions that parents can make now will be 
left to the system. This bill will take all responsibility away 
from the parents. 
It will destroy the balance reached in Quebec over a period of 
more than 20 years between the needs of the young offender, his 
or her accountability, society's intervention and the measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, a balance has been reached, and everyone agrees 
that this bill will hurt that balance. I urge, and this will 
conclude my speech, both the Prime Minister, who is from Quebec, 
and the Minister of Justice, who is responsible for the bill, 
not to go ahead with this piece of legislation. I urge them to 
send this bill back to committee to allow us to work on it some 
more so we can find a compromise for all the provinces, but most 
of all so Quebec can continue to use its approach, which has 
been proven effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Considering the many unjustified interruptions we had and the 
importance of the issue debated today, I seek unanimous consent

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>TABLING OF DOCUMENTS—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  A while ago the hon. 
member for Calgary West raised a point of order concerning the 
tabling of a document by the government House leader after 
consent had been refused to do so in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our rules provide two manners of tabling of documents by 
ministers.  The first is called front door tabling and is done in 
the Chamber during routine proceedings.  The second is called 
back door tabling, and a minister may table documents required by 
statute or by an order of the House with the clerk.  I refer 
members to <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, pages 
371 and 372. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the minister attempted to table the document by the 
front door by unanimous consent because the time provided for 
tabling had passed.  He did not obtain consent.  The minister 
still had the opportunity to table by the back door and used that 
method instead.  In this case there was no need for the minister 
to rise in the House to table his document.  He simply could give 
the document to the table officers by back door tabling. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order.  I have a question, just for 
clarification.  Could you tell me which section of our standing 
orders was applied? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  It is Standing Order 
32(1). 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I believe that when the 
government House leader stood he was doing two things if I 
understand it correctly.  My understanding is that he was, first, 
putting forward a motion and, second, tabling a document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he stood after I challenged him, saying that he did not 
have unanimous consent of the House, he then said that he did not 
need unanimous consent of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question with your ruling, Mr. Speaker, is whether or not 
you are saying that the government House leader does not need 
unanimous consent, hence my consent, to be able to go ahead and 
table documents.  Does that also apply with regard to his motion? 
Where does it stand with regard to his motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on some discussions with the clerks and my general 
understanding of the rules, since the minister did not do this 
with a front door mechanism during routine proceedings he was to 
do it by the back door.  My understanding is that when he does 
these types of things via the back door, like he did in the last 
session of parliament with regard to the MP pension plan, he 
requires unanimous consent of the House to do so.  He asked for 
it and was deprived of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, my understanding of the rules and what I was led to 
believe half an hour ago was that he did not have the ability to 
do it via the back door without unanimous consent.  Since he did 
not have unanimous consent, I have some serious questions about 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether or not there is a splitting of hairs with 
regard to the idea of tabling documents versus the motion that 
the minister was putting forward.  I am somewhat at a loss 
because I think I am doing as much as I can possibly do to try to 
raise the issues with regard to procedure and House affairs here. 
I am very frustrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically my feeling is that the government minister is fast 
tracking the MP compensation package in a way that no other bill 
has been fast tracked in this place.  I am trying to do my best 
so that he lives up to the rules that even he tried to somehow 
live up to last time with the MP pension changes in the last 
session.  I am very frustrated by this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  As I said in my ruling, 
there are two ways to table documents, from what we have analyzed 
here today, the first one being during routine proceedings where 
anyone can table a document without unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case at hand routine proceedings were finished, as we 
know, and the minister stood to table his document again, asking 
for unanimous consent to revert to routine proceedings, which was 
denied.  He could not go back to routine proceedings to table his 
document.  That solves the first problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second way of doing it is by back door tabling, as it is 
called in the rules of procedure.  Any minister, and only a 
minister, can come to the table and deposit his or her document. 
That also settles the problem.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in this case the minister chose to stand in the House 
and say that he did not need unanimous consent to table the 
document and that he would do it just the same.  If the Chair can 
express itself, it may not be the ideal way of doing it, but it 
was done and according to the rules that we have all adopted it 
is legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I still have questions with 
regard to the difference between the tabling of documents and the 
motion put by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the tabling of documents by the government House leader or 
the minister allow him also, therefore, with regard to this issue 
of MP compensation, to group the three readings of a said bill in 
that tabling of documents?  Does it allow him to group votes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it allow him to go ahead and allow something to pass on 
division without votes by members of the House of Commons?  Does 
it fast track committee of the whole so that it happens here in 
the House rather than in various committees such as, for example, 
the committee on procedure and House affairs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Again to the member for 
Calgary West, the minister stood and asked for unanimous consent, 
which was denied.  That is very simple.  He then used the second 
method of tabling his document and that is in the rules of 
procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put it a different way.  He did not even have to stand in 
the House and ask for consent.  He could have simply walked to 
the table and given the document to the clerks, who would in turn 
make sure that it was distributed.  Does that help the hon. 
member understand the situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two ways of doing it:  by the front door during 
routine proceedings and by the back door by simply tabling the 
document with the clerks.  It is as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try to simplify my 
question.  In regard to the actions of the government House 
leader, if he does not require unanimous consent, and you have 
made that ruling, does the action that he took in the House this 
morning allow him to put forward the MP compensation package 
without needing to have a vote and a say by the members of the 
House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  As a matter of fact, any 
minister can deposit any document he or she wishes.  We are not 
talking about substance here.  We are talking about the technical 
aspect of the tabling of this specific document.  Ministers can 
table any document they want.  Basically that is what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, am I to take it by the 
actions of the government House leader that this almost in a 
sense served as an order in council and that basically the House 
has no say or discretion with regard to what he has done?  He 
tried to get it done in the House but was deprived of unanimous 
consent.  Is it deemed to have been adopted anyhow? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  He could not table it 
during routine proceedings at the very beginning of the day.  He 
tried to go back to routine proceedings by unanimous consent, 
which was denied, so he did it through the back door and simply 
tabled the document with the clerks.  That is in the rules of 
procedure.  What else can I say? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This is the House of Commons, not a seminar in procedure.  The 
Speaker has made— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  That is not a point of 
order.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK47">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-7, an 
act in respect of criminal justice for young persons and to amend 
and repeal other acts, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with some regret that I rise to take part in 
the debate on Bill C-7.  It has a lengthy history.  As the Chair 
and members of parliament know, it has been before the House in 
various incarnations since 1993.  In effect, Bill C-7 is an aptly 
named bill because it is seven years old. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has had numerous changes.  It has been put through 
committee.  It has been examined and it has been adjudicated 
upon, to a degree, in the sense that we have had numerous judges, 
lawyers and prosecutors and those who work in the justice system 
look at it intensely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It saddens me to say we have a bill before us that is in a very 
flawed and very troubled state.  It is a bill that may be 
arguably the most important piece of legislation we will see in a 
decade.  It is a bill that has long term, broad implications, 
because it deals with what is, I would certainly say, perhaps our 
most valuable commodity.  I do not mean to diminish our youth by 
calling them a commodity, but the bill deals directly with young 
people in Canada.  The bill deals with their future.  It deals 
with the way in which they are dealt with by the criminal justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the supposed assets of this type of legislation is its 
flexibility.  The legislation was supposed to allow provinces to 
be flexible in the way in which they approached youth justice. 
They were supposed to be able to hold conferences.  They were 
supposed to be more inclusive of victims, of social workers and 
of accused persons in the way in which they interact, in the way 
in which the justice system was to envelop them and hopefully 
improve and thus produce a better life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet when one delves into the details, and the devil is in the 
details in this type of legislation, one finds, sorrowfully, that 
this legislation will have the complete opposite effect of what 
it is intended to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The philosophy and the emphasis in this legislation is very much 
on rehabilitation, on reintegration and on early intervention and 
prevention.  To that end I very much agree with those sentiments. 
I agree with the direction in which the legislation is attempting 
to take us in terms of our criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet again it falls far short.  The legislation will not achieve 
these noble objectives.  It will not allow our young people to 
avail themselves of all of these noble ambitions, because it is a 
bill in which the Minister of Justice and her department have 
very much tried to please everyone.  They have gone so far afield 
in trying to bring everything together in this one massive, 
complex, convoluted bill that none of these objectives will be 
achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I stand here with great consternation, because the 
bill is one which we very much want and need in the country. Yet, 
as the Progressive Conservative justice critic representing my 
party in this process, I do not feel that I can in good 
conscience support the bill.  I do not feel that the bill will 
achieve all those things that need to be achieved in our justice 
system today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the bill would give unspecified regions power to 
customize sentences and trends according to area standards, 
whatever that means.  The bill would allow judges, who complained 
that the first version of this bill was too complicated and upon 
seeing it a second time were even more confused as to what the 
bill actually intended, various sentencing alternatives, which 
might vary by province, by city and by individual judge or court. 
For example, paragraph 38(2)(b) states that sentences must be 
similar to the sentences imposed in other regions “on similar 
young persons found guilty of the same offence committed in 
similar circumstances”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, is this effective?  Is this the type of language that 
leads to any real sense of clarity in terms of what is intended? 
The bill has left judges with much experience, with years and 
years of work in the justice system, scratching their heads as to 
how they would implement this type of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest assets of any justice system is the ability 
to be timely, the ability to have justice done swiftly and to 
have it be seen to be done swiftly, as the old legal maxim goes. 
The legislation would make that virtually impossible because of 
this complexity and the new and convoluted route that cases would 
have to navigate.  In regard to timely hearings, timely trials, a 
person having access to justice will surely find that it will 
take months, if not years to reach the end, to reach the 
conclusion of that process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know, Madam Speaker, that you have a history with the justice 
committee and have taken a great interest in the process as well. 
We are left feeling very shortchanged by the bill.  After having 
heard from so many with so much expertise, understanding and 
history as to how the system works, we are left with a virtual 
nightmare in terms of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not get to the point.  It does not accomplish the goals 
that we should be striving to achieve.  Justice delayed will be 
justice denied.  That phrase will encompass and be stamped 
indelibly on the bill when it comes to fruition, if the 
government does not pull back at the last moment, which is 
unlikely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if young people were to find themselves charged 
with first degree murder in my home town of New Glasgow, Nova 
Scotia, and were taken through the process, would they receive 
the same treatment, the same end result as they would in 
Vancouver? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a test that should be met.  The purpose of our federal 
justice system is to have balance and parity.  The very symbols 
of justice must be balanced.  My genuine feeling is that it will 
not happen.  There is a great deal of reason to believe, in 
looking at the various clauses in the bill, that a parity of 
justice will not exist.  There is nothing to mandate that a young 
person who commits a deadly crime pays with serious time, 
regardless of the province in which it is committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an amendment, for example, to subclause 42(2)(o) that 
three years or less in a penitentiary would be served.  In the 
mind of the public, a three year sentence coupled with probation, 
if it is to follow, does not adequately or proportionately 
respond to the gravity of the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However many attempts were made to amend the legislation and 
however many sources came forward with innovative and intelligent 
suggestions on how to improve the bill, most of those attempts 
were rebuffed.  There was little time in this round of parliament 
to delve into the details of the bill.  For all intents and 
purposes time allocation or closure was invoked in committee just 
as it was in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, because of the importance of the bill, members of the 
opposition, some members of the government side and perhaps some 
members of the committee were left feeling very frustrated 
because they were not allowed to call witnesses to go over some 
of the very flawed legislation.  Some would argue, and I would be 
one, that there is so much wrong with the legislation that it is 
impossible to improve.  It is like trying to polish a rotten 
apple; it cannot happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supposedly this process is open to change in order to result in 
the best possible bill.  Yet that did not happen. It was not 
effective.  It was not functional.  It broke down, perhaps was 
because of the personalities involved or perhaps because the 
government was not listening.  That seems to be very much the 
case with not only the bill but with many pieces of legislation 
that we see in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an attitude of superiority, that members of the 
opposition do not quite get it, that somehow they are out for 
purely partisan purposes and have a lesser understanding of the 
importance of the government's agenda.  That is hogwash and 
simply not true. Many people in opposition approached the bill in 
a very professional, straightforward and common sense way.  They 
were left feeling as if they got very short shrift.  They were 
treated with very little respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I attempted to move an amendment to the bill with 
respect to subclause 125(6).  I did so at the request of the 
Canadian School Boards Association and other associated groups on 
behalf of teachers.  It was meant to try to improve the 
information sharing regarding dangerous youth offenders who may 
be in our school system.  The amendment would have provided for 
the sharing of information so that the provincial director, a 
youth worker, an attorney general, a peace officer or a person 
engaged in the justice system could share information 
mandatorily. 
They would have to do so, for the simple reason that information 
would be used for a very important purpose.  It would protect 
other students and help in the rehabilitative efforts of the 
young person who is in the school system.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill provides for that in some instances where it says 
may, my amendment would have made it mandatory so that it had to 
happen.  There is a breakdown in the information sharing in the 
current system.  It was very much in the interest of everyone to 
have this information mandatorily shared with our schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others are trusted with the information.  There are no privacy 
concerns when it comes to police officers, community workers or 
the staff involved in the court system.  It is almost insulting 
to suggest somehow that if we were to give this information to 
teachers they would abuse it.  One is left wondering why the 
government would vote against such a common sense amendment. 
Perhaps we will hear some response to that at some point, but I 
doubt it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tried time and time again to improve upon the 
legislation.  I worked with the old Young Offenders Act and there 
is no question in my mind that it was not a perfect system 
either.  Although it was a great motivation in my decision to 
come to parliament, I am left with the inescapable conclusion 
that the old system will function better or was functioning 
better than the system we are about to embark on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It troubles me greatly to think that simply by being here and 
participating in this system I will have to answer to some future 
generation as to how parliament could put in place such a 
convoluted and complex system, such a monster in terms of the 
delay it would wreak on the system.  I will have to ponder as to 
how I would respond, but at least I will have some solace in 
knowing that I tried.  I tried to make some changes.  I tried to 
put forward some suggestions on how to improve the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much talk again about the flexibility of holding these 
conferences in which the accused, victims and others will be able 
to participate in the system.  Yet it seems to be left in a cloud 
of doubt and a shroud of complexity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a question with respect to new responsibilities of the 
police in their actions.  They are to engage in a new venture of 
counselling wherein they will be required to issue cautions. They 
will be required to delve into the young person's life in detail 
and to some extent be required to become like social workers. All 
the information when gathered, which is another very serious flaw 
in the bill, would not be admissible for the purposes of a bail 
hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a young person has been the beneficiary of several warnings 
and cautions, if the police are aware that he or she is likely to 
embark on more serious crimes such as break and enter, violence 
or drug use, and if the person is taken into custody, the police 
will not be required to refer to the information they had 
gathered through this new system for the purposes of holding or 
detaining the young person at a judicial interim release hearing 
or a bail hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought this information to the attention of the justice 
minister and her officials, and yet there is no willingness to 
change.  The Liberal government has also ignored numerous 
community concerns with respect to mandatory increased sentences 
for gang violence or swarming.  There was no attempt to 
essentially up the ante for that type of violent behaviour. There 
was no attempt to have recognized in legislation a specific 
offence for home invasion when young people were aware or should 
have been aware that the person was at home when they entered the 
dwelling house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would have been the correct message to send if we were to 
make the legislation firmer and fairer in order to protect the 
public.  Our justice system should be about protecting the public 
and keeping in mind rehabilitation and reintegration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day there has to be corrective action taken if 
young people or otherwise are wreaking havoc in a community. 
Sometimes it involves removing them from the community for 
lengthy periods of time given the offence that has been 
committed.  The bill is not sending the signal that violent 
offenders and those who commit serious offences will be treated 
in a serious and firm but fair way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already mentioned the delay involved in bringing forth 
the legislation, but another flaw that ties into my earlier 
comments is the lack of language referring to deterrence and 
denunciation, deterrence being either general or specific and 
denunciation for the crime itself.  The bill is completely void 
of that type of language.  It makes no mention of it, yet it is 
used in courtrooms across the country every day.  The department 
and the minister in their wisdom are loath to use that type of 
language in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard many complaints from numerous individuals across 
the country about the way in which the bill has been put 
together.  I cannot stress enough the complexity of the bill.  We 
had the Juvenile Delinquents Act which comprised 30 sections. 
From there we went to the Young Offenders Act which contained 
approximately 70 sections.  Then we talked about the need to 
streamline and the need to make the legislation more user 
friendly so that parents and young people could understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the department come up with?  It came up with a bill 
that has 200 clauses.  The legislation will be more than doubled. 
Yet the department and the minister have the audacity to say that 
it is streamlined legislation.  It could not be more the 
antithesis of streamlined legislation.  It is the complete 
opposite.  The minister is being very economical with the truth 
when she uses that kind of language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, subclause 45(2)is 86 words long in one sentence. 
That is the type of complexity we are talking about.  It reads 
like Chinese arithmetic.  It is something that will be extremely 
difficult for those working in the justice system to try to 
administer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to another major flaw or chasm for the provinces. 
Due to the new complexity, new processes and new requirements for 
the administration of the bill, it will take massive resources to 
accomplish this task.  The provinces are feeling extremely 
frustrated.  Many who came before the justice committee stated in 
a very straightforward and polite way that they did not have the 
resources to accomplish the task given to them by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many ways that is exactly what is happening.  The government 
is asking the provinces to administer the bill.  Yet it is trying 
to micromanage the way in which they would do it.  It is telling 
them they have these new responsibilities and new hearings to 
administer.  The provinces will have all sorts of problems in 
trying to accomplish this task.  Yet the government will not give 
them the additional resources they require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Understandably the provinces are very upset but the government 
would not listen.  It essentially says that is too bad and that 
it will go ahead with it any event.  It thanked the provinces for 
voicing their concerns but informed them that they would have to 
do it.  That is not exactly what I would call co-operative 
federalism. This is not the type of approach that should be 
taken, particularly on a bill as important as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has talked numerous times about a decrease in crime 
and how the statistics are plummeting.  She should talk to the 
police, to case workers and to probation workers. They will tell 
her otherwise, particularly when it comes to violent crime.  We 
know that violent crime is very much on the rise, particularly 
among young women.  In the last 10 years it has risen over 77% as 
far as youth are concerned.  Since 1988 it has risen 127% among 
young women.  These are shocking statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public concern about lack of accountability for crimes, 
particularly those committed by young people, hinges on the fact 
that there does not appear to be much in the way of deterrents. 
We have new processes of statutory release, presumptive release, 
conditional release and conditional sentences.  These are some of 
the same flawed practices that exist in the adult system.  Now 
the government is downloading them on to the youth court system 
and telling the provinces to do their best.  However it will not 
be there to help them when it comes to light that it will cost 
considerably more and result in more delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frontline police officers are saying the same.  They are very 
concerned about the new responsibilities.  Victim groups are not 
satisfied that they will be given enough participation or 
recognition in the new system.

implications and grave implications in terms of delay, complexity 
and breakdown in the system.  The only people perhaps who will be 
happy will be the lawyers, particularly the defence lawyers. This

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  I know he has a great deal of 
background on this issue, having been a crown prosecutor and 
having dealt with the very act that Bill C-7 seeks to amend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned quite a bit from his speech.  I would like him to 
elaborate a little further on one thing he raised.  The old 
Juvenile Delinquents Act had some 30 odd sections.  The Young 
Offenders Act had roughly 70 sections.  This bill, which 
ostensibly seeks to clarify, streamline and make more accessible 
the Young Offenders Act, has 200 sections.  What is even more 
worrisome is the omissions in the bill, which he pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we have a new act that deals with young offenders but 
fails to contemplate or mention things like gang activity or home 
invasions?  The single most frightening thing for senior citizens 
today is the possibility that some thug will kick their doors in 
and invade their home while they are sitting watching television. 
This is a very genuine fear for Canadians.  They want some 
specific mention of the seriousness of that crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member elaborate, not so much on what is 
worrisome in the act but on some of the glaring shortcomings or 
omissions, which he pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I know he has a real 
interest in this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult for me to answer on behalf of the government as 
to why it failed to address these questions he put forward.  Why 
would the government not take this opportunity to put in place a 
system that would leave people, in particular seniors, feeling 
that they would be protected in their home?  There is no specific 
mention of home invasion or the creation of an offence that would 
react in a very deterrent and straightforward way on that type of 
offence.  Nor do we see a genuine attempt to address the issues 
of violence or violence using firearms or weapons, which is sadly 
another type of offence that is on the rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Swarming is another offence that has become commonplace, not 
only in big cities, but in rural Canada as well.  Groups of youth 
maraud, band together, turn upon individuals and beat them into 
submission.  We saw this happen outside Toronto to a young man by 
the name of Jonathan Wamback who was severely beaten within an 
inch of his life.  His father undertook a very impassioned plea 
to the country to try to bring about some change in our justice 
system, particularly in this bill.  It was completely ignored by 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure I can give any account as to why the government 
did not take the opportunity, which was the most obvious chance 
we had, to change the bill.  Instead it came forward with this 
bill and all the shortcomings, a bill so complex and so 
convoluted.  It has doubled in size the terms and conditions in 
which the legislation will operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed to attack some of the biggest problems 
which have existed in the system for the last 10 or 15 years, in 
the Young Offenders Act.  It completely defies logic.  It has 
left many, not only those in the legal community but many in the 
community who would be most affected, scratching their heads and 
wondering why they elected the government in the first place, if 
this is the type of legislation they will get as a result.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have just a few comments as the end of a long process 
winds down, not only in the context of time allocation but also 
in the context of a bill that has received a great deal of 
attention by this parliament and the previous parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We regret to say that we cannot support Bill C-7 because we all 
started from the proposition, with perhaps the exception of the 
Bloc Quebecois because the Young Offender's Act seems to be 
working in Quebec in a way that it does not seem to be working in 
the rest of the country, that the Young Offender's Act did not 
live up to expectations.  I say that as someone who was here in 
1983-84 when we passed the Young Offender's Act.  There was a 
great sense of progress in that we had finally shed the juvenile 
delinquent's act and that a new day in youth criminal justice was 
ahead of us.  Some 15 years later we do not have that feeling at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the feeling that the Young Offender's Act does not work, 
that it has many unintended consequences and that it does not have 
enough discretion built into it.  Too many young people are 
being forced into and clogging up the court system.  We feel that 
that kind of discretion should be available to the system, which 
is not available in the Young Offender's Act.  So we have before 
us the youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we can also say today that, given the 
unwillingness of the government to consider many of the 
criticisms that have been levelled at the bill, to consider the 
need for more resources if this bill is to be implemented 
properly, a point that has been made over and over again by 
various provincial governments and to consider the complexity of 
the bill and the fact that it might actually extend rather than 
shorten the distance in time between the offence and 
consequences, one has the ominous feeling that 15 years from now, 
and some of us may still be here, we will be discussing the 
failure of the youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That might be something in the nature of this kind of 
legislation or it might be something peculiar to this 
legislation.  It is probably a little bit of both.  In the end no 
amount of youth criminal justice legislation, whether it is the 
Young Offender's Act or the juvenile delinquent's act or the 
youth criminal justice act, is going to be enough to solve our 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our problems are fundamentally social, economic and moral.  They 
have a lot to do with the kind of values young people are 
picking up in the media, on television, from the popular culture 
and even from our economic system.  We have an economic culture 
that more than ever before holds up self-interest as the guiding 
light, that everything works well if we all pursue our own 
self-interest in an extremely competitive way.  The language of 
co-operation that we might find in older notions of how we should 
relate to each other or that might be found on Sesame Street, 
soon evaporates for many youths when they see how the world 
unfortunately sometimes really works.  We have a much larger task 
ahead of us than anything we could accomplish through the youth 
criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to re-emphasize some of the things we said at second 
reading and which have not really been addressed in committee. 
We find ourselves in much the same position as we were at second 
reading.  I already mentioned the fact that the complexity in the 
bill was a problem in of itself.  However it could also lengthen 
the time between the actions and the consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we know, at least it seems so to me, is that there is 
a great deal of agreement that for justice to be effective, 
particularly with young people, it should be swift.  People 
should be able to make the connection between what they have done 
and what the punishment is or what the consequences are and not 
have it so delayed as to be remote in the connection in the young 
person's mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of the changing the reverse onus provisions, 
changing the existing situation whereby the state now has to 
argue for youth between the ages of 14 and 17 to be brought 
before adult court, will change. 
What is this going to mean?  This will mean a bigger role for 
lawyers in the system.  This in itself will delay things. 
Anything lawyers have something to do with is a source of delay, 
sometimes legitimate and sometimes not.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will further complicate the system, given the fact that 
many young people who find themselves in trouble are not always 
from families of means.  This will mean an increased burden on 
legal aid.  We are very concerned about the chain reaction 
involved.  This is all part of a downloading of costs onto the 
provinces, legal aid et cetera without the corresponding 
resources being devolved to people who will have to deal with the 
complexities of this new system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Manitoba has a concern with this legislation. We 
do not want this new act to apply to children under 12. However, 
at the same time we need a strategy for dealing with children 
under 12.  In the inner city of Winnipeg and many other places we 
know that children under 12 are being employed by gangs to effect 
their criminal intentions.  We need a strategy to deal with that 
which is effective and at the same time respects the fact that we 
do not want children under 12 to be brought, strictly speaking, 
within the rubric of the youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of things that need to be done.  This bill does 
not do them in terms of resources.  It does not do them in terms 
of its own stated objectives.  For the record, for this reason 
and many others which I do not intend to go into at the moment, 
the NDP will be voting against the bill at third reading stage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I wish to inform you that I am sharing my time with the 
hon. member for Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are about to pass an amendment as important as it is needed 
in the way Canada deals with youth crime. The rate of youth 
incarceration in Canada has now reached a totally unacceptable 
level. It is the highest in the western world, even higher than 
in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members from Quebec like to praise their province's justice 
system, which they say is based on rehabilitation of young 
offenders. 
According to a pamphlet prepared by the Bloc Quebecois, the 
suggested approach calls for rehabilitation therapy in a youth 
centre before a young offender commits an even more serious 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Berthier—Montcalm declared that Quebec tends to 
personalize the process based on three fundamental principles: 
punishing the young person; making him accountable for his 
actions; and addressing his psychological and social problems, 
all with a view to rehabilitation and reintegration into society 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member neglects to tell us, however, is that 
Quebec tends to make use of committal to custody for young 
people guilty of offences that are not particularly serious, I 
repeat, as it is very important: young people who have not done 
anything particularly serious, more often than any other 
jurisdiction except one.  This tendency is not affected by 
whether the adolescent has no prior convictions or has only one 
or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous studies and experiments worldwide have shown that what 
works best is to get the young offender to assume responsibility 
outside the formal system.  This type of intervention makes it 
possible to react promptly to the adolescent's misbehaviour by 
imposing a significant measure, that is one from which he or she 
learns something, thus bringing about rehabilitation and 
redressing the wrongs caused.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get back to the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm.  He engaged in a tour, to which he 
referred, during which he described certain scenarios in order to 
convince people that Bill C-7 is bad for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will pick up on one of the scenarios to demonstrate the 
incongruity of the arguments presented by the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm.  It is the case of Hugues, which hon. members 
may well have seen in the Bloc Quebecois pamphlets so widely 
distributed throughout Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It starts by stating that, under the Young Offenders Act, 
Hugues' problem, which is connected to gang membership, would be 
revealed immediately upon his arrest and first court appearance. 
They go on to say that the crown and the defence attorney will 
probably agree on a training and social reintegration program 
where he would be kept away from his gang. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They conclude, that is the Bloc Quebecois and the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm, that with a six or eight month social 
intervention program Hugues seems to have a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, in the second scenario, according to the Bloc Quebecois, 
Hugues would receive totally different treatment under Bill C-7. 
The person who wrote the pamphlet indicates that Hugues would 
appear before a court after his offence and temporary detention 
would be accepted as a defence strategy.  After a trial, Hugues 
would be sentenced to eight months detention.  He would not have 
access to rehabilitation programs because time would be too 
short; he would be left to himself. The various intervenors, 
specialists, teachers and scholars would  become prison guards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Madam Speaker, I think you will find that 
we do not have quorum for such an important debate.  I would ask 
that you please call a quorum count. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> We now have quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B> Madam Speaker, what is very clear in 
Hugues' case, as narrated by the member for Berthier—Montcalm, 
is that the comparison between the two pieces of legislation is 
based on some unfounded premises which the author is presenting 
as absolute rules when in fact everything is hypothetical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it is hard to believe that the reasons why Hugues 
and his lawyer plead guilty and accept the sentence for an 
eight-month detention in a youth centre, as is proposed by the 
crown, according to the scenario involving the Young Offenders 
Act, would disappear simply because another act applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, it is hard to understand why Hugues would be confined to 
temporary detention under Bill C-7 when in fact this new act says 
that a young offender can be released from detention in the 
custody of someone and requires that the court check if someone 
trustworthy can and will take care of the young offender.  This 
option applies perfectly to Hugues' case, especially if the 
purpose of the intervention is to keep him away from his gang. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it is unthinkable that a teenager could be left to 
himself instead of being enrolled in rehabilitation programs.  A 
good social reintegration requires the implementation of 
programs which begin during the custody period and continue 
within the community with the support and under the supervision 
of a youth social worker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly what Bill C-7 provides for by stipulating that 
rehabilitation programs assisting young persons to be 
reintegrated into the community must kick in as soon as the 
offenders are sentenced and held in custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that the effectiveness of any 
intervention cannot be measured only by the number of days in 
custody, but rather by the quality and the relevancy of the 
programs designed for young persons and the quick and fair 
treatment of young offenders. These are the principles 
underlying Bill C-7.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to deal with the right to opt out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is asking the federal government to give 
Quebec the right to opt out so it can continue to implement the 
current legislation. The federal government has enacted the 
current Young Offenders Act and has proposed this bill in 
respect of criminal justice for young persons under its powers 
pursuant to section 91 of the Constitution Act of 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two pieces of legislation are codes of procedure and 
sentencing for crimes committed by young persons. 
The fact that criminal law is nationwide in scope does not 
require, and former Justice Dickson said so in 1990 in the 
Supreme Court of Canada ruling in R. v S. (S.), that it be 
implemented in a uniform way and in all its details in all the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act provides enough leeway to allow 
each provincial government to implement it in a way that meets 
its own challenges and particular needs. This leeway will allow 
Quebec not only to preserve but also to improve its youth 
criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to remind the opposition that Bill C-7 is the result 
of broad consultation of the provinces, territories and people 
interested by youth crime. Through this consultation, numerous 
flaws were identified in the present system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is to fix the flaws of the Young Offenders Act, while 
building upon its strengths. The main features of this reform 
have been approved by the Canadian population as a whole, 
including the population of Quebec, as shown by a CROP survey 
conducted in June 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I wish to raise is the implementation cost of 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that federal support to Quebec, in particular in 
terms of preservation and improvement of its youth criminal 
justice system, also takes the shape of an increased financial 
contribution. As a matter of fact, by 2004-05, basic federal 
transfers for youth criminal justice will have increased by 39% 
compared to 1998-99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that these clarifications will allow members of this 
House and in particular those of the Bloc to better appreciate 
the scope of Bill C-7, and that they will support the bill at 
the third reading vote.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, on the invitation of the member who just spoke, who is 
from Quebec and claims that the bill is perfect, I would ask her 
if she has taken note of all the support coming from the members 
of the coalition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if she has indeed read all the documents of 
the coalition, which is against the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to know if she has read the proposed unanimous 
resolution of the Quebec national assembly, which opposed this 
bill last week and which is asking that Quebec be allowed to 
maintain its rehabilitation program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like her to try to name organizations, not 
individuals, that would be in favour of her position, precisely to 
back up her position. 
I ask her to name a series of organizations that are in the 
justice area, the rehabilitation area or in the area of all 
those who are intervening with young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, I would like her to name those who agree with the 
position she is defending.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B> Madam Speaker, first, I thank the hon. 
member for his question. I would like to tell him that I was 
elected in the past to sit on the board of Batshaw, which is 
responsible for all the youth centres in the English speaking 
community of the island of Montreal. I know very well the youth 
criminal justice system in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, I have examined the first bill introduced by the 
minister. I did not support it, because it was too complicated 
and it penalized the young. I also thought that if it was not 
possible to make improvements through that bill, it was better 
to simply correct the shortcomings in the Young Offenders Act, 
which does have some shortcomings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the minister heeded the representations of the justice 
committee and more particularly the recommendations of the 
Quebec Bar Association. My colleague opposite will probably 
agree that the Quebec Bar Association knows what it is talking 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its presentation, this association made comprehensive 
recommendations to improve the bill. The minister listened, and 
she incorporated all or most of these recommendations. That is 
the first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I have been asked if I had any knowledge of the 
position of the coalition, for example. Yes I do, and I find it 
rather unfortunate that that position is in fact a position on 
an earlier version of the bill. The coalition does not seem to 
be aware of the major changes the minister made to her bill. I 
would like to give an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Young Offenders Act, 14 year-olds may be given adult 
sentences for certain criminal offences. However when we listen to 
some of the people who are opposed to Bill C-7, we hear them say 
how terrible it is that 14-year-olds may receive adult sentences 
under Bill C-7. The possibility already exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder sometimes if people are trying to mislead Canadians 
when they do not give the facts, when they do not interpret 
correctly the present legislation that has been in effect in 
Canada for 16 years and when they do not give all the 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, under the Young Offenders Act, teens can be transferred to 
adult court for certain criminal offences. That is terrible. Not 
one single expert working with young offenders is in favour of 
that. However, Bill C-7 corrects this flaw in the Young Offenders 
Act. 
Now, the youth court will have exclusive jurisdiction to hear 
cases involving young offenders prosecuted under the youth 
criminal justice bill, including—

comments.

that is more of a defining matter of philosophy versus pragmatism

of the official opposition would simply say that three strikes 
and the person is out and we should throw away the key.  Then we 
have other members of the official opposition who believe that 
punishment is the goal, which is what it thinks the bill should 
be rooted in.  These are two of the extremes.  We then have the 
other extreme—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  We have quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member opposite 
says that I am right in the middle.  Yes, the extreme middle is 
generally where members will find us.  We in this party believe 
in a balance that strives to deal with the root problem of youth 
violence.  Is it a serious problem?  There is no doubt about it. 
As I have pointed out, the one position on the right of the 
political spectrum is to deal with it with a supposedly firm hand 
with boot camps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I do not see quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I see quorum. 
Hopefully quorum will remain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, when the opposition 
benches empty the moment after the bells stop there will be 
difficulty in keeping quorum.  I suppose the attempt is to throw 
off anyone speaking on this side of the House.  However, it will 
not work because, fundamentally, we believe in the principles 
that are in the bill.  If members want to talk about the 
difference between punishment, revenge, deterrence, 
rehabilitation and long term prevention, then that is what the 
bill would achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell members about something I saw this morning on 
<I>Canada AM</I> that interested me.  A man by the name of Jim 
Gollert, who is the CEO of the Centre for Education and Training 
in Mississauga, has been appointed by the provincial government. 
I am hopeful that what I saw is a positive sign from the province 
of Ontario that it wants to deal with long term prevention. 
Where do criminals come from?  Jim has been asked to deal with 
young people expelled from our educational system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know, at least in the province of Ontario, that if young 
people are expelled from classes it is a very serious matter.  If 
they are expelled for violent activities it means they are not 
only expelled from their board or school but from the entire 
education system in the province.  I cannot think of a better 
breeding ground for young criminals than having young people 
kicked out of school and sent home or out onto the streets with 
no opportunity to continue their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give credit where I hope credit will be due.  The 
provincial government has announced not a boot camp, which some 
members opposite might prefer, but rather an opportunity for kids 
who are in trouble at school or who have been expelled on a 
permanent basis from the education system and sent home or out 
onto the streets.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Ontario has asked Jim Gollert to head up a 
project that would look into ways these young people can continue 
their education and be rehabilitated before they wind up before a 
judge or in jail.  I am hopeful this is a sign from our 
provincial government that it will do something about these kids 
who are the precursors of the young people who wind up being 
charged under whatever act is put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has never been so much misconception foisted upon people 
both in this place and across the land about the purpose of the 
Young Offenders Act and its replacement, this new act.  The 
intention here is to take a young person who has been charged and 
who, under the Young Offenders Act, can be put into adult court 
prior to any conviction.  Does that make any sense?  We do not 
know.  One would think that all of us in this place would live by 
the premise that one is innocent until proven guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a 14 or 15 year old is charged under the current act there 
are mechanisms in place that would allow the young person to be 
tried in adult court.  At that time the offender's name would be 
published and it would be open to the discretion of the judge to 
impose an adult sentence.  Under the new act that would only 
occur if a conviction is registered in a youth court system. That 
seems makes a lot of sense to me.  If young persons are acquitted 
or they turn out to be not guilty, why would we want to put them 
into the stressful situation of having their lives tarnished 
perhaps forever because of a charge that was not proven to be 
true?  We would not want that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new bill there would be the ability for the court 
system to deal with it in a youth system.  It then would have the 
ability to impose an adult sentence upon conviction.  That seems 
very reasonable.  I do not hear anyone on the other side telling 
people about that or speaking about it in committee or in this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the goals must be to rehabilitate.  I hear members from 
the Bloc chirping and heckling and I would say that is the other 
extreme.  The other extreme is people who are only concerned, 
frankly, about provincial jurisdiction.  They do not want any 
kind of federal jurisdictional interference in the justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why the Bloc would object to this bill.  If 
Quebec accepts the new five year youth justice funding agreement 
that has been offered, the federal government will contribute 
more than $191 million over the period 2000-01 to 2004-05 to 
support youth justice services in the province.  The increase in 
the base funding component of that agreement alone would 
represent an increase of 39% when compared to the level of 
federal support available to Quebec in the 1998-99 agreement. 
Quebec has the opportunity to receive stable funding from the 
federal government to support the youth justice system in the 
province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is driving the Bloc members?  Is it the overriding dogma 
they have about not buying into anything with any kind of federal 
direction, federal mandate or, what it would call, federal 
interference? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members might find this hard to believe coming from me, but I 
think we should look at the benefit of the youth as opposed to 
the partisan interests being espoused opposite.  It will not help 
young people if the bill is opposed because of partisan purposes 
on behalf of people from Quebec or western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell a story about something that happened in Nova 
Scotia.  I had an opportunity to work as the advocate for youth 
entrepreneurship.  We had hearings. 
In those hearings young people appeared before us.  One of them 
was a young woman.  When we asked her how she had found out about 
the opportunity for youth entrepreneurism, she said that her 
parole officer had told her about it.  It almost knocked us over.

the opportunity to grow?  It helped that young lady start her own 
business.  She has a young child and she has turned her life 
around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the bill is about.  That is what the government 
believes in.  We will be tough where we need to be, but we must

have just heard the most partisan speech that I have ever heard 
since the beginning of this debate. It is a partisan and biased 
speech made by an Ontario MP who knows absolutely nothing about 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that matter, everything he says in the House of Commons 
shows that this member knows nothing about Quebec, that he knows 
nothing about the act and that he is only trying to misinform 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the only example he can find is a situation that occurred 
in Nova Scotia, referring to parole, that makes us wonder what 
he is taking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois know what we are taking about. We know 
that Bill C-7 is unjust to Quebec's young offenders, and we do 
not want to have imposed on us the vision of the west, which, 
unfortunately, is also endorsed by Ontario MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member must know that it is different in Quebec. As the 
present parliament progresses, we are realizing more and more 
how different we are from them, and that they do not understand 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the member would accept, once and for 
all, to go to Quebec to find out what is going on there, find 
out what Bill C-7 is about and what its consequences are, and to 
understand, once and for all, that we are different from them 
and that we want to be on our own.

personal attacks.  I thought I was being fairly non-partisan in 
my debate compared to my normal approach to things.  I was trying 
to notch it down a bit so that we could deal with some of the 
substantive issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member hit it on the head.  He said he wants us to admit 
that they want to stand alone.  We know that is what drives them 
every working day, but that is not what the bill is about.  The 
bill is about young people.  Whether they are in the province of 
Quebec, Manitoba or British Columbia does not matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of the youth justice system should have nothing 
whatsoever to do with the partisan desire of that party to 
separate from the rest of the country.  Its members stand and say 
they are different from us and that we must come to Quebec 
because we do not know anything about Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell them what I do know about.  I know about young 
people.  I know about Canada.  I know that our young people from 
sea to sea to sea need a fair and balanced youth justice system. 
That is exactly what the bill will provide, and it will do so in 
la belle province.

which I take great exception.  He said that the philosophy of the 
Canadian Alliance was “three strikes and you're out”.  He also 
made reference to things such as boot camp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could not be further from the truth.  There is no such thing 
as “three strikes and you're out” in our party.  We want to see 
young people have the best opportunity possible.  It is not 
negative when we bring to the discussion comments about notifying 
school boards and schools that they have a violent offender in 
their system.  It is positive. 
By doing so we are protecting the most important resource Canada 
has, our youth, and we are also protecting the young offender. If 
we know what triggers the behaviour in a person then we can take 
the necessary steps to prevent it from happening again.

offenders.  Education was the most important component of that

from Mississauga West.  It was not my plan because he usually 
follows me but today I will get to have the last word.  I will 
also be sharing my time with the member for Kelowna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a moment to congratulate the member for Surrey 
North who has put in unlimited hours regarding the problems we 
have with youth crime in Canada.  Being a victim himself, having 
lost his son to young offenders many years ago, his work in an 
organization called Crime, Responsibility & Youth, known as CRY, 
and his work with other victims' groups over the years indicate 
to me that there is a real dedication on the part of this man to 
bring very positive changes to the whole idea of youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all his efforts and the clear message that he has brought 
to the House from various victims' groups throughout the land to 
do something about youth crime, today unfortunately we have to 
report to Canadians that the government has failed dismally to 
deal with the situation of youth crime, and it ought to be 
ashamed of itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984 the Young Offenders Act came into existence.  In 1994 
the 10 year review began.  The results of that review, which I 
carry in my briefcase, indicate quite loudly and quite clearly 
that under the Liberal government's law regarding young 
offenders, violent youth crime has increased from 300% to nearly 
400% over that period of time.  Some success.  I congratulate the 
government.  This report came out of the government's own 1994 
review.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When our party came here in 1993, we were assured by the present 
health minister, who was then the justice minister, that there 
would be a big review and a big resolution to the youth crime 
problem that we were facing and that he would require input from 
all the parties in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happened to be the head of the Reform Party justice committee 
at that time.  I met with many of my colleagues and we diligently 
put together our proposals, which we felt would deal with the 
situation.  They were mainly based on policies that were decided 
by grassroots people across the country who helped us develop 
them.  We submitted our proposals.  I looked at hundreds of 
submissions from organizations across the country who were 
calling for some serious and significant changes to the Young 
Offenders Act in 1994.  After nearly a year and a half, the 
minister at that time brought forward a proposal that was totally 
insignificant with regard to what the people across the country 
were asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have continued to carry on.  I believe this is at least the 
15th time that I have spoken on the Young Offenders Act since I 
came here in 1993.  This effort, called the youth justice bill, 
is just as my friend from Surrey North called it this morning, a 
very feeble and weak attempt to resolve the problems that victims 
across the land are facing day in and day out because of youth 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally in the hands of the government across the way to 
start listening to Canadians and to start taking their views 
seriously with the intention of bringing about a safer society 
for our young people in particular who are the majority of the 
victims.  However, the government refused to do it and it has 
failed once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members will proudly vote tonight, accept what has 
been delivered and it will be unacceptable across the land.  I 
can assure members opposite that one year from now we will be 
standing here questioning the government on why it is not doing 
something about the youth crime across the land.  That is an 
assurance that members can almost count on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard comments this afternoon about boot camps and that it was 
a shame that anybody would even suggest a boot camp.  I have news 
for the Liberals:  probably millions of people in Canada have 
gone through boot camps called the military and it did not hurt 
them one bit.  In fact most of them are quite proud that they 
went through a very disciplined training program that delivered 
them to a position where they could serve their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know of one Liberal who has the guts to visit the boot 
camps and work camps across the country.  They should come out to 
Alberta to see how our work camp is doing.  The camp is having 
great success because the young people are learning some 
responsibility.  They are learning how to work.  They are getting 
an education.  They are learning physical fitness.  They are 
learning how to treat other people.  They are learning about 
life.  They are not in a prison, they are in a work camp.  Is 
that not scary?  It must frighten that Mississauga West character 
right out of his boots that we would do such a thing to youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as what goes on in the schools, having been in the school 
system for 30 years and in administration for 15 of those years, 
I can assure the House that I would have loved to have known the 
backgrounds of the different students who were being transferred 
to my school.  Not only could we have provided a service to them 
but we could have provided better protection for some of the 
youth who suffered at their hands because of our lack of 
knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about victims.  The last thing the Liberals ever 
talk about are the victims.  What is happening in our society? 
The stories we hear from students when we visit schools are 
crazy. I believe all my colleagues in the House have visited a 
school and have heard the students say that the government should 
get tough with violent young offenders. 
Many students live in fear.  When I visit schools the majority of 
students tell me that they are fearful of the situation they find 
themselves in today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I really question the Bloc members.  They say that Quebecers 
like the law the way it is.  All the e-mails, letters and 
contacts I have had with people from Quebec over my years of work 
on justice issues have said quite the contrary.  The grassroots 
and down to earth people do not like the Young Offenders Act.  I 
would ask Quebecers to write to me and let me know if they are 
happy with the act.  I would like to know because I do not 
believe it is true.  Whenever I go to meetings or make any kind 
of speeches at town halls involving tax problems or other issues, 
at the top of the agenda is the subject of young offenders.  They 
want to know what we are going to do about youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the government to pay attention to grassroots 
people, but I know that is difficult for it to do.  I have 
received a number of notes and have had a number of conversations 
with backbenchers on that side of the House who keep encouraging 
me to fight against the bill and to keep doing what I am doing 
because they do not like it either.  Unfortunately, their hands 
are tied and they cannot do anything about it.  It is a shame 
that when members sit in the government backbenches, they are not 
allowed to have a strong voice in what the frontbench brings 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That needs to change.  The members' idea on the frontbench is to 
bring the bill forward and then put closure on the debate.  They 
claim to know best and that their little boys and girls behind 
them will vote the way they are told whether they like it or not. 
Year after year we hear the same old story.  Members do not like 
what they have but they have no choice because they are ordered 
to vote a certain way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These problems will never go away if we take the approach that 
everything we do must benefit the criminal.  If we do not start 
focusing on the victims and what their safety means to them 
instead of the rights of the criminal, we will never get 
anywhere.  No one believes in prevention more than I do.  Our 
communities are offering good measures of prevention and I 
support and congratulate them for doing so.  However the 
government has failed to do so for seven years.  The reforms are 
no different than what we had in 1994.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have witnessed the member's passion and his 
constructive criticism in the House on justice issues for a 
number of years.  I like many of his ideas, especially the idea 
of having camps or discipline centres.  I do not like the word 
boot camp but I like the notion of having rehabilitation centres 
where people could be taught skills, where they could be given a 
sense of discipline, a sense of athleticism and all the things 
that would make them a whole person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has given 30 years of his life to young people 
through the educational system.  He talked about the notion of 
working on prevention.  The area of prevention is an area that 
does not get enough discussion time in the House.  Could the 
member tell us from his experience where he has seen the best 
results of preventative measures young people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I could speak about a 
number of occasions but I must say to the member that it was very 
difficult after the Young Offenders Act came into force.  I was a 
principal before it came in. 
We were notified of their life situations when they arrived at 
the school.  After 1984 we were not allowed to have that 
knowledge, which made it a great deal more difficult.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We were able to implement some programs.  The one to which I 
like to refer the most is about little Eddy who was in grade one. 
We brought in a program in our school for students at risk.  The 
grade one teacher brought Eddy to my office one day and told me 
there might be a problem.  He had pulled a knife on the teacher 
and had been kicking the teacher in the shins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member would agree that there was a serious problem. 
We identified it early and worked with the young person over the 
years.  We did not throw him out of school.  Expelling kids was 
the very last resort although we sometimes had to do so for the 
safety of others.  We worked hard with Eddy.  We brought in his 
family and managed to get volunteers in the community to provide 
big uncle programs.  It was something we had free rein to do. 
Regulations did not disallow it.  We were able to bring in people 
who had the ability to work with a young person like him.  As we 
went through the year he began to excel a little.  He left our 
community when he was in grade six. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ran into Eddy in 1995.  He was in prison, but he was a guard. 
He remembered me from grade six as being his principal.  He ran 
up to me to tell me how much he appreciated what we did for him 
in those earlier years.  He said he would have been on the other 
side of the bars had it not happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member that unfortunately, as time progressed, as 
the charter of rights came in, as human rights factored in and as 
the Young Offenders Act came in, we were less and less able to 
put hands on programs in place to work with these students 
because somebody had the right to deny it.  We were not allowed 
the freedom we once had to work seriously in preventing these 
things from happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did it get away from us?  Police and school administrators 
used to work very closely, hand in hand, because usually my 
problems during the day were their problems at night.  There were 
very successful school resource programs.  We are starting to get 
back to that a little today.  Community involvement is starting. 
All of that is great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on for hours about the experiences we have had, some 
positive and some not so positive.  The difference is that we 
were capable of doing something because our hands were not tied 
by some right, charter or Young Offenders Act.  That really 
destroyed our efforts rather than help them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is an honour for me to participate in this debate. 
The first Young Offenders Act was brought forward in 1993, but it 
was my privilege and honour in 1993 to present a petition to the 
House signed by 6,000 young people.  The petition came to me as 
the result of a visit by two young girls who were attending Mount 
Boucherie Secondary School.  They came to me to ask if there was 
anything I could do about a problem they had in their school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were fearful because they were being harassed and 
challenged.  They were afraid they would be attacked by a group 
of other girls.  The problem was that the legislation did not 
work.  Their teachers and principal could not protect them 
because the problem was happening in the community outside the 
school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They asked what they could do.  I told them one of the best 
things would be to get their friends and other young people to 
tell me about the problem.  Some 6,000 young people could not 
come to see me, so I suggested they present a petition and that 
is what they did.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the government presented a bill to the House which was 
completely unacceptable.  My hon. colleague opposite on the 
Liberal benches asked what we could do to prevent it.  One thing 
would be to have effective legislation.  However there is more 
than that.  We need to change attitudes.  We need to change the 
attitudes of our parents, our legislators and our kids.   We need 
to develop a set of values that will encourage people to respect 
one another and not accept violent behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of values I will state.  There are some virtues 
we need to have.  The virtue of courage is an example.  The 
virtue of character is another.  We must live our lives according 
to what we know is right and wrong, where our word is our bond, 
where we keep our promises, and where truth is the watchword. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take exception when hon. members opposite or even colleagues 
exaggerate or tell something that is close to not being true. 
Members sometimes deliberately state something that is false.  We 
have a word to describe that.  It is a three letter word and I 
cannot use it here.  The important thing is that it happens and 
it should not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we all told the truth, wherever we were, our relationships 
would be different.  If integrity became the watchword in our 
relationships with one another it would be a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will respond directly to my Liberal colleague opposite.  The 
greatest preventive measure, and it ties directly into what my 
colleague said a moment ago, is that we engender in our young 
people and in ourselves the recognition that we not only have 
rights under the charter of rights and freedoms but also 
concomitant responsibilities.  The actions we undertake must have 
consequences and those consequences must be meaningful.  They 
must entail more than a simple tap on the wrist for violent 
offenders or some silly little punishment that means nothing.  We 
need to get serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people, like the hon. member for Mississauga West, will say 
I want to throw everyone in prison.  That is not what I said at 
all.  That is an example of telling something that is not the 
truth.  The truth is that when there is a serious offence there 
must be serious consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do those consequences mean we stick people in jail?  Not 
necessarily.  Do they mean we teach people better ways of 
handling conflict?  Yes, of course.  Do they mean offenders 
should face their victims and recognize the pain they have caused 
those individuals and their families?  Do they mean they should 
recognize that it is not only the victim who is the object of a 
violent attack but the victim's family and indeed the whole 
community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were the two young high school girls who came to see me 
concerned only about their own welfare?  No, they were there to 
represent a whole other group of girls whom I met later.  Then 
boys came along and said they were in the same situation.  They 
were all victims of the threat that was out there.  Let us 
recognize that we are responsible for our own actions.  The hon. 
member for Mississauga West is also responsible for what he says 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go one step further.  What have we done in the act?  I 
will refer to only one clause because it is central to the whole 
business we are talking about here.  Paragraph 146(2)(b) of Bill 
C-7 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>the person to whom the statement was made has, before the 
statement was made, clearly explained to the young person, in 
language appropriate to her age and understanding, that 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) the young person is under no obligation to make a statement 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this refer to?  It refers to a police officer or a 
person trying to preserve the peace who has the responsibility to 
make a charge if someone has broken the law.  The young person 
being charged does not have to make a statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that significant?  I will not use more arguments here.  I 
will use observations made by the former attorney general of 
British Columbia.  His name was Alex MacDonald.  Lest anyone on 
that side of the House thinks he was a Liberal or a Conservative, 
he was neither of those. 
He was not a Canadian Alliance member either.  He is retired now, 
but he was a member of the NDP.  He later became a member of the 
legislative assembly and then the attorney general.  Here is what 
he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984, Canada's parliamentarians, perhaps inebriated by their 
exuberance for rights, replaced the Juvenile Delinquents Act of 
1908 with the Young Offenders Act.  It was as if they'd heard the 
word from on high:  “Come to the charter waters!  Drink and your 
souls shall live!”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quoting Alex MacDonald.  He went on further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centrepiece of the Young Offenders Act is its Section 556, as 
it was renumbered in 1998. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was renumbered to 145 in 1999, renumbered again in 2001 as 
146, and I just read it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young person is under no obligation to give a statement to 
the police officer.  Mr. MacDonald asked what kind of signal that 
gave to teens.  It expresses one of the shibboleths of our law, 
one which the criminal defence bar is apparently prepared to 
defend to the death.  Never mind that it contradicts the wisdom 
of the ages when it comes to raising youngsters to become 
responsible adults.  Why?  Because it allows teens two ways to 
escape responsibility for their mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as passed by parliament, the bill would allow young 
offenders to refuse to answer a police officer's questions about 
wrongdoing in which they may have been involved, even if the 
police officer saw them do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a case in Kamloops where a youngster was seen damaging 
some property.  A police officer happened to be right there and 
asked the kid if he did it.  The young kid looked at him and said 
he did not have to talk to him, so he did not.  The law says he 
does not have to do so.  That is the first escape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill would place no onus on young offenders to 
explain to a court what they have been up to even after a fair, 
though not conclusive, case has been presented against them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us as parents know only too well that when our children 
behave in a manner that is not appropriate they will often behave 
in a peculiar way.  We will know that something is not quite up 
to snuff and that there is something bothering them.  Usually, 
although not necessarily, they will have done something wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simplest question is to ask what is the matter.  If they do 
not tell us it often begins to gnaw inside and turn them inside 
out.  If they have done something really bad we could perhaps 
handle it.  However when they keep burying it there is a problem. 
There comes a time when confession is good not only for the soul 
but for society.  It needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to talk about ways to rehabilitate young offenders but 
we do not have time.  I am sorry about that.  I would have liked 
to draw the attention of members to ways of amending the act so 
that it would resolve the issue better than is the case now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened to my colleague speaking 
about the Young Offenders Act and I cannot agree more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member probably has run into situations as many times as I 
have in going around to schools and talking to young people. The 
young people I have spoken to have pushed me to try to have 
something addressed in the Young Offenders Act.  They have spoken 
time and again about the fear they have of their own peers in 
many cases.  They absolutely point to the Young Offenders Act as 
one of the causes of their fear because they know young offenders 
will have no penalty handed to them by the courts.  That is one 
thing I want to ask the member about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to step out of the Youth Offenders Act for a moment. 
There are those of us who like to point our fingers at the Young 
Offenders Act, and I am one.  As far as I am concerned the Young 
Offenders Act is a disgrace to our young people and to the 
judicial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big problems with our young offenders has been the 
direct result of not only this government but the governments 
before it.  I point this out because today parents are no longer 
able to stay at home to tend to their children.  Parents have 
been forced out into the workplace over the heavy taxation and 
heavy costs of living in Canada.  Therefore, I would like to 
point the finger that way too, if I could, and maybe ask the hon. 
member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe another way for us to look at this is to hold the 
government accountable for forcing both parents out of the home 
leaving no parent to look after the children when they come home 
from school.  The children are now learning all kinds of things 
at the parks, everything that goes on in the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am glad the hon. 
member mentioned that because it is certainly a part of this 
preventive thing.  It is also a part of our responsibility as 
parents.  He mentioned, in particular, the phenomenon of the 
latch-key kids who come home and there is no one there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife and I have two boys.  One day when they were in junior 
high they were exposed to some things they were not sure about. 
In fact, it had something to do with drugs.  They came running 
into the house and, the younger fellow especially, wanted to talk 
to their mom, but she was not there.  They both needed to find 
her because they had an important question to ask.  They ran to 
the back of the house and found her working on her flower beds. 
She loves gardening.  They ran up to her and told her what they 
had been offered in the school washroom.  They then asked her 
what they should do.  She was able to deal with them.  I will 
never forget that because she was there when they needed her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know many of my friends' children come home to an empty house. 
A note is left on the fridge telling them that there are 
sandwiches and that they should help themselves, or a note is 
left telling them which button to push on the microwave if they 
want hot chocolate.  It is a different phenomenon.  Does that 
mean it is bad for both parents to work?  No.  It just means that 
kids should not be home without some kind of adult influence in 
their life.  Someone should be there to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member.  Not only do parents have a 
responsibility for their children but the teachers and the 
community also have a responsibility for these children.  How 
many of us simply ignore and walk away from the problems our 
neighbour's kids may have believing it is not our problem?  When 
I was child and I did something bad, I can remember a neighbour 
putting his hand on my shoulder and saying “Werner, do you know 
what is happening over here?  Is this what your dad would want 
you to do”, and I would behave myself.  It made a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we all have a responsibility.  It is part of the 
prevention and it is part of the cure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carole-Marie Allard (Laval East, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would be glad to share my time with anyone who wishes to speak 
to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing that strikes me in today's debate. Why is it 
that members on the other side are not pointing out to Quebecers 
that this bill serves, in fact, two purposes— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
member, but she must indicate with which member she is sharing 
her time. With whom will the hon. member be sharing her time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carole-Marie Allard:</B> Madam Speaker, I wish I could tell you, 
but I do not know who it would be. So, I guess I will not be 
sharing my time, if that is possible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something that is puzzling me today. How is it that the 
Bloc Quebecois on the other side is not telling Quebecers what 
this bill is really about? This bill serves two purposes. Where 
minor offences are concerned, the emphasis is put on community 
services instead of custody. That is easy to understand. Why 
send to prison first time offenders? In the case of more serious 
offences, three changes are being made. First, there is a change 
of courts. Young persons will remain in the youth court system. 
They will no longer be transferred to adult courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to mention that Quebec, where supposedly all is 
well for youth, presently has the highest rate of transfers to 
adult courts. This is a sad record. We and Manitoba have the 
same number of cases referred to adult courts. Why so many 
transfers? We must make sure that young people are protected and 
stay within a system adapted to their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reason why I welcome with great enthusiasm the 
amendment contained in the bill on the youth criminal justice 
system, which will allow to keep young people before youth 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other proposed change is to lower from 16 to 14 the age at 
which a young offender could be sentenced as an adult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, we know that if a youth commits a serious offence, 
the onus is on him to show that he should be allowed to remain 
before the youth court. With the new bill, this situation 
changes. The age limit will be lowered to 14 years, although 
under clause 61, a province which wishes to maintain the age 
limit at 16 will be allowed to do so. Again, the Quebec system 
remains unchanged, since the age limit remains at 16 in Quebec. 
It will be up to the government of Quebec to keep the age limit 
at 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major change in the bill has to do with the location 
where young people would serve their sentence. It will 
necessarily be a correctional facility for youth. This rule 
applies in all cases, the only exception being when the judge 
passes the sentence on the basis of the evidence submitted. 
He or she could decide, depending on the seriousness of the 
offence, that putting this young offender in a youth facility 
could indeed be detrimental to the other offenders held in that 
facility. It is the only instance, and it will be up to the 
judge to decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what this bill is all about, which is why I fail to 
understand why there is such strong opposition to this bill. A 
rather surprising misinformation campaign is going on right now 
in Quebec. Unfortunately, certain statements made by members of 
the Bloc Quebecois are a great disservice to the people of 
Quebec. 
I think the position of our opponents on the other side of the 
House, of our friends should I say, is simply unacceptable. They 
believe that putting a young teenager who has committed a first 
minor offence in a youth detention centre is better than any 
kind of action by the parents, the community or a crime 
prevention organization, and it is simply unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand that position and it worries me. For 
example, does the member for Berthier—Montcalm, the Bloc 
Quebecois' critic with regard to the youth criminal justice 
system, want to increase the youth incarceration rate, which is 
already at an unacceptable level? Right now, Canada's youth 
incarceration rate is the highest in the western world. It is 
higher than that of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in 1997 the United States put 775 young offenders 
between the ages of 12 and 17 behind bars, compared to 1,046 for 
Canada. These numbers are based on proportional calculations, of 
course.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disturbing, and all the more so because recently in 
Quebec four reliable people mandated to investigate issues of 
access to residential services and administrative and financial 
problems of youth centres in Montreal found that these 
centres were poorly managed. When there is bad management, 
mistakes and negligence are a risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if some young people are forgotten in these rehabilitation 
centres where they should get rehabilitation programs? This 
could happen if the management is deficient. It is not right to 
give the priority to structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government, our responsibility is to make sure young people 
in trouble grow to be responsible citizens in our society. I do 
not think sending them to youth court is the best way, when 
alternative measures are available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a lawyer. A few years ago, I worked in a youth court. I 
saw parents who were desperate and had to appear as 
witnesses in the case of their child. Too many young people have 
paid dearly for small offences and will have a criminal record 
for the rest of their life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to admit I am a bit ashamed of being a Quebecer when I 
hear another Quebecer opposite try to confuse the issues on a 
bill as important as this one for the future of young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this bill on the criminal justice system, and let 
us say this once and for all, offers a flexibility that will 
enable Quebec to continue its good work if it so wishes.  It 
contains precise principles which will guide the youth 
court judges.  Access to extraordinary measures was mentioned in 
the Young Offenders Act when it was passed in 1986, but now 
these are specified, and the judge has the 
opportunity to use new measures.  This is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the possibility of reprimands, orders for 
support and intensive supervision.  There is the possibility of 
orders to submit to approved programs and of custody and 
supervision orders.  There is the provision of programs, when 
the youth is in detention, to monitor him once he has returned 
to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new sentences will be to the young offender's advantage, 
since they will provide the courts with alternative measures 
proportional with each adolescent's offence and situation.  The 
new bill sets out clear restrictions on custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must also be pointed out that the bill limits the use of 
custody to crimes involving violence, repeat offenders who have 
not complied with previous sentences, who have 
already reoffended and who have been sentenced for a serious 
offence.  It also limits custody to exceptional circumstances. 
It troubles me greatly to learn that this bill has been so 
misunderstood in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I also find it regrettable that a young actor has 
been used to promote a misinformation campaign.  I believe that 
confusion is still being spread throughout the public. 
Unfortunately, I cannot accept such a situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to invite all hon. members who require 
information on this bill to contact us on this side of the 
House, and we will be pleased to explain that this bill is not 
what they are trying to make them believe it is.  It proposes 
some innovative solutions to help our young people become the 
responsible citizens and adults of tomorrow.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière—L'Érable, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, at 
the outset, I want to point out that I will be sharing my time 
with my hon. colleague from Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus on some aspects of the bill that I find 
particularly worrisome. First, we see once again that if members 
of the Bloc Quebecois were not here to stand up for Quebec, we 
certainly could not rely on federal Liberal members to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in Quebec agrees on one thing. We do not want Bill C-7. 
We do not think it reflects the reality in Quebec. 
Despite what members on the other side might say today, Bill C-7 
deals with Canada, with the problems faced by Canada, and we 
believe that the situation in Quebec is quite different. Unlike 
the other provinces, we have been successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, when the member for Laval East gave us what she called 
alarming statistics, she said that over 1,000 young persons were 
sent to prison in Canada. I would have liked to know how many 
Quebecers were among these offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was here, during last parliament, when Bill C-3 was introduced 
but could not unfortunately be passed. It was both fortunate and 
unfortunate that this bill could not be passed. When the House 
of Commons reconvened, we thought we would see some changes to 
the bill. 
We detected a certain amount of electoral opportunism with the 
tabling of Bill C-3.  We noted that the efforts of the Minister 
of Justice were directed at charming the electors.  We all know 
the results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have thought, when she again submitted her bill to the 
House that she would have provided for a little more realism and 
openness in the case of Quebec and the rest of Canada.  That was 
not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a journalist for 16 years, and worked at the Quebec City 
court house for two and a half years.  In Bill C-7, what I 
really object to is the talk of releasing the names of young 
offenders.  It permits publication of the name of an adolescent 
serving an adult sentence. 
Reference is made as well to an adolescent serving an adolescent 
sentence for violent crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no point saying that the worst punishment a young 
person could be given is to have his or her name, picture and 
background published in the papers.  Even today, we see in the 
case of repeat young offenders who have reached adulthood, 18 or 
19 years of age, that the effect is incredible.  The harshest 
punishment a criminal can be given is to have his or her 
background exposed in the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine a young adolescent, male or female, aged between 
14 and 18, who for all sorts of reasons has committed an 
offence, and we know our society is undergoing profound change, these 
are turbulent times, and that we publish his or her photo and 
background in the papers while this young person is in high 
school or college.  The effect is extremely negative and may 
harm the individual.  He or she will carry this image and have a 
really hard time, despite the best of efforts, in rehabilitation. 
The media trial will be with him or her a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As politicians, we are always on parade, facing the media and 
we often make a statement and then retract it the next day.  The 
retraction may appear in a corner somewhere, while the day 
before we made the headlines.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for young offenders who find themselves in a 
similar situation. Indeed, even after a fair trial, a trial that 
has taken into account all the circumstances, the young offender 
will be haunted by the media coverage of his trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People often only remember the original story. When there is a 
retraction, or when a sentence or a verdict is handed down later 
on, people have completely forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they remember is the front page news with the original 
story, a story that is often taken directly out of the police 
investigation, but whose impact is not fully known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that Bill C-7 will now allow the media to get 
hold of this information. If we let the media get hold of such 
stories, the young offender will be judged by the media and will 
not be able to make it, regardless of the rehabilitation 
efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out the fact that, once again, we see that 
the situation in Quebec and the one in Canada are very 
different. Some are trying to claim that the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm and the members of the Bloc Quebecois have been 
conducting a misinformation campaign, but it is the other side 
of the House that is leading such a campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Liberal federal members talk, we hear the word Canada 
constantly, and from time to time the word Quebec, but they seem 
to forget about the consensus that exists and the coalitions 
that were formed against Bill C-7. They always follow the party 
line. They always hide behind the objectives of Bill C-7 and 
forget what really matters, the Quebec reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, just a few hours away from an important vote that will 
certainly have an impact on our young people, I am asking, on 
behalf of my colleagues, on behalf of young offenders and on 
behalf of Quebec youth, that the present government show some 
openness and allow the government of Quebec to continue the good 
work it has been doing with the current infrastructures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation could allow us, Quebecers, to continue to 
function with a system that has already been proven effective, 
while respecting the other vision people from western Canada and 
maybe also people from Ontario have with regard to young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying today is that we would like to opt out of 
Bill C-7 so that Quebec may continue the good work it has been 
doing for many years.

heard my hon. colleague say that he had been a journalist, like 
me. Therefore I salute a former fellow journalist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my hon. colleague agree to say that the current situation 
is unacceptable in the sense that, as the hon. member is surely 
aware, the names of young people are currently published even 
before they are found guilty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he aware that the new legislation proposes to prohibit the 
publication of names before the end of a trial, which means that 
a young person will have to be found guilty and sentenced as an 
adult before his name gets published? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not find that is a benefit provided by the new Bill C-7?

confidential. When a 17 year old youth gets arrested, we notice 
that photographers always hide his face. I have never seen the 
names of youths under 18 identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the name of a youth can be identified if the case is 
transferred to an adult court. However as far as I know, currently 
the Youth Court Act fully protects young offenders and their 
names are not published. On the contrary, if their names are 
published, that can be considered a contempt of court. The 
legislation is rather severe on that account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carole-Marie Allard:</B> Madam Speaker, does my colleague know 
that Quebec and Manitoba have the highest rate of transfers to 
adult court? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means, for those young offenders transferred to adult 
court, and curiously there is a high proportion of them in Quebec, 
and I was very surprised to learn that we hold the record on 
this score, as soon as their file is transferred, their names can 
be published. We should recognize this is one 
improvement brought about by this new bill since there will no 
longer be any transfers to adult court and all cases will be 
heard by the youth court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member admit that the ban on the disclosure of young 
offenders' names is an improvement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Madam Speaker, the point here is not to 
find out what we will admit or not.  The point is that the 
situation is different in Quebec and that we do not want Bill 
C-7.  We find nothing positive in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want Quebec to continue to stand alone and to keep a system 
that is working well, has proven effective and, most 
importantly, is adapted to the social reality of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carole-Marie Allard:</B> Madam Speaker, does the hon. member 
realize that if Quebec opts out from the application of a 
federal act, there are risks involved? Quebecers will be free to 
invoke the charter of rights and freedoms if they feel 
prejudiced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young Quebecers not allowed to be tried in youth court, but in 
adult court, will be able to claim they were prejudiced. 
Consequently, the hon. member's excuse for exempting Quebec from 
the new legislation simply does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to explain how he will justify this to 
Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can see that once again 
Quebec federal Liberals look at Bill C-7 from a Canadian, as 
opposed to a Quebec point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, we in the Bloc Quebecois are here to call them to 
order, to remind them that in Quebec we have a system that 
works, a system that matches Quebec's reality, and that we do 
not want Bill C-7.

our government's sound economic planning is based on careful

assess our progress toward the larger goals of environmental

indicators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These indicators will provide us with hard, quantitative data to

that the government is now facing criticism for appearing to 
politicize the requirements of replacing the new helicopter and 
actually suggesting that these replacement helicopters will be 
less capable than the very ones they are replacing which are 40 
years old.

need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government send a message to members of Canada's

<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

and rescues have been contracted at this moment.  We are waiting 
for the helicopters to be delivered.  The other part of it is 
being done at this moment.  The bid requests will go out soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course in 1993 we had a Conservative government which had a 
$42 billion deficit and we could not afford at that time to 
proceed.  We waited for the government to be in a position to buy

are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently a Sea King kept in touch with the <I>Katie</I> mission

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this

so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, as soon as a young person commits a first minor 
offence, we determine the most appropriate measure for 
rehabilitation purposes. From now on, this will no longer be 
possible. The new legislation includes automatic sentences and 
it ignores the specific needs of young offenders. The 
flexibility will no longer be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister understand this? All the stakeholders say that 
the proposed legislation is too strict. Why does she not specify

some of that which the leader of the Bloc has said is a 
misrepresentation of that which appears in the youth criminal 
justice legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the guiding principles of our new legislation is the 
particular circumstances in which the young person finds himself 
or herself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
this bill, the minister is introducing into the youth justice 
system the calculation of provisional detention and the whole 
matter of conditional supervision, principles that are already 
in the adult system but are not currently part of the young 
offender system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister realize that this new method of calculating 
provisional detention, and the fact that a young offender serves 
only two thirds of his sentence as an adult, is going to have a 
direct impact and to prevent the specialists from intervening 
properly and from providing young offenders with the 
rehabilitation they so greatly need?

<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

there is no provision for parole in the new youth justice 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if that which the hon. member is complaining about is 
the fact that young people after serving all or some part of 
their sentence receive supervision in the community, I can only 
say that I profoundly disagree with the hon. member.  I think 
that is a positive thing and will help with the quick 
reintegration of young offenders back into society.

example, Mr. Speaker.  With the minister's bill, a 14 year old, 
regardless of any provincial order in council, will be tried as 
an adult for certain designated crimes, under adult rules and 
before a judge who usually tries adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister realize that the new rules will prevent the 
Quebec system from delivering the right measures at the right 
time to this young offender, and thus will bring about the 
failure of the rehabilitative approach used in Quebec?

Mr. Speaker, this week the premier of Alberta announced that he

jurisdiction over their natural resources.

their energy resources without bowing to the Prime Minister of

resources?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK211">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-7, an 
act in respect of criminal justice for young persons and to amend 
and repeal other acts, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-7, an act in respect of 
criminal justice for young persons and to amend and repeal other 
acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be my last opportunity to speak to this bill.  It is 
difficult to see how arrogantly the Liberal government in power 
is treating the citizens, youth, and adolescents of the province 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than 16 years now, Quebec has been enforcing the Young 
Offenders Act, and the system has worked very well. It has worked 
so well that the Liberal government commissioned a study called 
“Canada's Youth Justice Renewal Strategy”, conducted by the 
officials responsible for drafting Bill C-7, which involved a 
province by province analysis.  It was noted that Quebec's charge 
rate was the lowest in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's youth incarceration rate was also the lowest in Canada, 
at fewer than 500 per 100,000. Quebec is the only province under 
this threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was therefore not for nothing that last week, on May 23, all 
parties in the national assembly of Quebec, the Parti Quebecois, 
the Liberal Party and the Action Démocratique party passed a 
unanimous motion rejecting Bill C-7, which the House of Commons 
is getting ready to pass.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this House, we are supposed to represent the elite, but in 
some areas, we are not the elite. When dealing with young 
offenders, the rehabilitation and reintegration of young persons 
in Quebec and in Canada, we are not the elite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the elite is made up, among others, of members of the 
Quebec coalition for youth justice, representatives of the 
Association des policiers et pompiers du Québec, youth 
organizations and defence attorneys, all those who deal day in 
and day out with young persons. 
They are the experts in rehabilitation who, for sixteen years 
now, have made the Young Offenders Act successful in the 
interest both of the people in Quebec and in Canada who are 
watching us and of young offenders in need of rehabilitation. 
Their task is enormous but so useful to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always sad to realize that a young man or a young woman 
has committed a crime. Thanks to the comprehensive strategy 
concerning the reintegration of young offenders in the community 
developed by Quebec, the number of charges laid and offenders 
sentenced to custody is lower in Quebec than in the rest of 
Canada. So, the system in Quebec is working fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-7, the federal government is again interfering with a 
system that works well in one province in Canada. Members of the 
House must understand that, if Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan 
or Atlantic Canada had a system that was working well, everyone 
would be inclined to defend the interests of that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, that is what is happening in Quebec. As a member of the 
Bloc Quebecois, it is hard for me to see that Liberal members 
from Quebec, who were elected in that province, do not understand 
that the approach used by Quebec over the last 16 years with 
regard to the Young Offenders Act is the best in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard for me to understand that some of my colleagues in 
the House speak out against Quebec's interests, against an 
approach that has been recognized as being effective by all 
experts who deal with the rehabilitation of young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several reasons for committing a criminal offence. In 
the case of young teenagers, rehabilitation is the key to 
getting back on the right track. That is how Quebec treats young 
offenders, by going to the root of the problem and by trying to 
rehabilitate the young teenager, in his or her interest, before 
imposing a sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have the best success rate in Canada. 
So it hard for me to see members and the Prime Minister, who is 
also a member from Quebec, take a stand yesterday, in this 
House, and say: “If the Quebec act is so good”. As far as I 
know, the Prime Minister of Canada is still a member from 
Quebec. He should know and he should have noticed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numbers were used in the Canadian renewal strategy by 
those who drafted Bill C-7.  Those persons noticed, when they 
drafted tables that the situation in Quebec was the best in all Canada. I 
have copies of them that I could table in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that young people, young men and women who have 
committed criminal acts have a better chance of getting back on 
the right track in Quebec. 
Ideally we should never have to use such a bill.  Young people 
should never have to appear before youth courts, but this is 
still a reality.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It happens not only in Quebec, but in every province in Canada. 
Too often, young men and young women commit crimes for any number 
of reasons. When we can understand young persons and their 
problems, it is not too late to set them back on the right track, 
which is what the Young Offenders Act is doing in Quebec. Once 
again, the justice minister told us that all provinces 
could adapt the bill to their own situation. We still have time 
before the end of the session to include an amendment that would 
allow any province to opt out of Bill C-7 and continue to enforce 
the legislation currently in force in its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be so simple and much easier for community 
stakeholders. However no, look at how dumbfounded the members 
opposite seem to be. Even if they do not want to believe the Bloc 
Quebecois, the members from Quebec should at least take note of 
the motion unanimously passed last week, on May 23, by the 
national assembly of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the national assembly, members of the Parti Quebecois, the 
Liberal Party and the Action démocratique du Québec unanimously 
agreed to urge the federal government not to pass Bill C-7 or at 
least not to implement it in Quebec. 
Once again, in Quebec we have our own way of doing things, our 
own approach.  It is a societal choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each province has the right to have its own vision for the 
future.  It has the right to make societal choices.  Quebec made a 
choice for its teenagers.  It chose to take charge of them, to 
trust the professionals, who tried to bring the young offenders back 
on the right track, whatever their sentences were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is never too late to understand. That is exactly what I hope 
my Liberal colleagues from Quebec, the Prime Minister, who is 
from Quebec, and many of his ministers will do.  Once again, they 
are trying to make Quebecers believe they are wrong. I repeat 
that all of us here do not form the elite who can best judge what 
is good for our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let the specialists in the field decide.  Leave it up to those 
who deal with the difficult cases of teenagers and treat them 
individually depending on their crimes.  Quebec has a success 
rate that all other provinces envy.  When we get to the vote, let 
us try to make the intelligent choice.  Let us vote in the 
interest of Quebecers.  I hope my colleagues opposite will 
understand that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carole-Marie Allard (Laval East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
concerns me as a Quebecer.  The provisions of this bill do not 
dismay me.  On the contrary, this bill will improve the lot of 
young people who commit minor offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member opposite presents his statistics, does he 
realize that Statistics Canada figures show that Quebec 
incarcerates the most young people with no criminal record? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whether the member is aware of the 1996, 
1997 and 1998 Statistics Canada figures showing that 319 young 
people with no criminal record were incarcerated in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can this be called an ideal situation?  The member opposite 
comes from a small community.  Does he not trust the community 
organizations in his area to help young people who do not have a 
criminal record?  He knows very well that his municipality does 
not have youth centres, which means that young people must go 
elsewhere for the help they provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise:</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply wish to point out to 
the hon. member that, according to Statistics Canada figures, 
community centres, as she says, which should look after young 
people, are represented by the Youth Justice Coalition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
just want to make a comment. When I heard the member for Laval 
East compare the youth centres to prisons, I thought to myself 
that she must not have set foot in a youth centre in a long 
time, because these centers really focus on rehabilitation in 
the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met several of the 319 young persons she mentioned when I 
toured Quebec, and especially on the North Shore. I spent a 
whole morning talking to the parents of these young persons and 
to the people who implement the Quebec legislation on a daily 
basis. The youth centres are not prisons. That is the kind of 
misinformation we can expect from the member for Laval East. She 
should go over the bill more carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment on what the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine said this morning about the Quebec 
coalition for youth justice making its position about Bill C-3 
and Bill C-68 known, but not about Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No later than today, Pierre Lamarche sent out a press release 
where he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to realize that the federal government is going ahead 
with a backward bill that is totally inconsistent with what is 
going on in youth crime in Quebec as in the rest of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question concerns the comments made by Mr. Lamarche, who is 
the president of the coalition of the various organizations that 
were mentioned earlier, saying that, according to the coalition: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Instead of wasting public money to implement a new system that 
is not needed, the government should spend wisely and use the 
money to strengthen the current Young Offenders Act, instead of 
drafting a new legislation. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the member to say to Mr. Lamarche on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise:</B> Mr. Speaker, once again, when a taxpayer, 
an influent member of society and a member of the elite who 
knows and understands young people, both male and female, and 
young offenders in Quebec, is asking us to do that, we must 
listen to his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like him, we believe the federal government has an obligation to 
invest in youth rehabilitation instead of spending time and 
energy trying to change a law that is working very well in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I cannot but agree with Mr. Lamarche and ask the 
federal government and the Liberal members from Quebec why we 
should not take this opportunity to make a little amendment in 
committee before the end of the session to allow Quebec to opt 
out of the application of this legislation and invest the moneys 
requested by the elite, those representing the people who work 
with young people in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to advise you as I begin that I will be splitting 
my time with the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to engage in the debate on Bill C-7 today.  I 
want to do so by taking an historical look at what has happened 
in the treatment of young people in Canada.  The reason I want to 
do this is that I believe we can learn from history and that we 
can predict from history.  If we examine history, we can get a 
general feel for where we are going and for what is likely to 
happen in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the members of the Bloc Quebecois in the 10 
minutes I have that ever since the first day of Confederation 
criminal law has been the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal 
government. 
It is up to the federal government of the country to pass 
criminal law.  That makes us distinct from the United States 
where, for example, there are 50 states and 50 different types of 
criminal law.  Here in Canada we have one criminal law for the 
entire country and it has been so since the creation of our 
country.  The various laws governing the treatment of young 
offenders have all been federal laws and have pertained to all 
youth across Canada from coast to coast.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In approximately 1911 we passed the Juvenile Delinquents Act. It 
existed in one form or another for over 70 years.  I doubt very 
much there are too many people in Canada who would seriously 
argue that the frame of mind in place in the early 1900s insofar 
as it related to youth remained in place in the late seventies 
and eighties.  Over the course of those 70 years, the ideas about 
youth and about treatment of young people changed.  As a result, 
there was a movement to modernize, shall we say, the treatment of 
young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That movement to modernize culminated in 1984 in the Young 
Offenders Act, which was developed during the Liberal years in 
power.  It was, however, implemented during the Progressive 
Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It became evident rather quickly that there were some problems 
in the legislation.  As time went on, it became more evident.  A 
lot of people started to complain about the Young Offenders Act. 
Indeed, it became such a problem that during the second Mulroney 
government mandate between 1988 and 1993, the government amended 
the Young Offenders Act.  Then justice minister Kim Campbell 
brought in what I would call cosmetic amendments to try to 
placate voters who complained about what were seen as defects in 
the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example of the kind of cosmetic amendment I am talking about 
is, on the one hand, the Conservative government saying it had 
increased the sentence for violent crimes to five years when the 
reality was that the sentence remained at three years of 
incarceration with an additional two years tacked on by way of 
mandatory supervision in the community.  On the one hand the 
Conservative government pretended that it had increased the 
maximum sentence to five years in jail, when on the other hand in 
reality it was three years with two years of mandatory 
supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, along came the 1993 election.  In the 1993 red 
book we said the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act will be reformed to increase sentence 
lengths for certain violent crimes, allowing for full treatment 
and rehabilitation of young offenders.  We will ensure that 
treatment and rehabilitation services are available to all 
convicted young offenders.  A Liberal government will restrict 
the charges for which a young offender could be transferred to 
adult court, but at the same time will develop the category of 
“dangerous young offender,” designating a youth who could be 
transferred to adult court, receive an adult sentence, and be 
kept in an adult facility. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there is a question that has to be asked.  If that is 
what we promised, what did we deliver?  Indeed, it is a fair 
question.  What we delivered was this:  Bill C-37 provided for 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act which came into force in 
December 1995.  The amendments focused on harsher remedies for 
violent young offenders while encouraging alternative sentences 
for non-violent offenders.  That, however, was only phase one of 
a two phase process.  The second phase implemented by the justice 
minister of the day was to ask the justice committee of the House 
of Commons to fully review the youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That second phase began during the first mandate of the Liberal 
government and indeed was completed by the justice committee. 
That was between 1993 and 1997.  Once the justice committee 
completed that study, it then had to be studied by the justice 
department.  The department considered the study and began the 
drafting of legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Along came the 1997 election campaign.  This was one of the 
issues that was dealt with in the 1997 election campaign and we 
on this side promised to improve the Young Offenders Act.  The 
result of that promise was the youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It turned out that it was apparently too tough for the Bloc 
Quebecois.  There were some arguments about what was going on in 
the province of Quebec, which we heard many times.  On the other 
hand, it was too lenient for the then Reform Party.  I would say 
that is probably not a bad thing.  It is therefore a middle of 
the road approach:  too tough for some and not tough enough for 
others.  It is probably a fairly good middle of the road 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, we asked the justice committee to consider the 
legislation.  During a period of time between 1997 and 2000, the 
justice committee did that.  It reported, there was a filibuster 
by the Bloc Quebecois and the bill was stalled.  The bill 
continued to be stalled until along came the election of the year 
2000.  We won again, thankfully, and as a result we reintroduced 
the act in February 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember, then, that there was a two-pronged promise in 
1993 to toughen up the existing act and to study the Young 
Offenders Act. In 1997 we had the results of the study by the 
justice committee and then we introduced this legislation.  It 
got stalled, then we had the election, and we have reintroduced 
it again.  The subject matter has been studied for many years. It 
is now time to pass it.  We will not be able to please the Bloc 
Quebecois.  We will not be able to please the critics.  Our role 
in government is not to dither but to get on with the job, so we 
are going to pass the legislation, or at least that is the hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will we be able to learn from history?  I think we will be 
able to learn that the treatment of young offenders changes with 
time and with societal values.  That means it is not static. That 
means that after we pass the bill, in future years society may 
decide to treat young offenders in a different way and this bill 
may become anachronistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we can learn from history that anything drafted by human 
beings is not perfect.  That is not a startling statement, but we 
should remember it.  This bill is not perfect.  The bill before 
this one was not perfect.  Nothing we do can be perfect.  All we 
can say is that we have done the best we can given the 
circumstances and given our knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we can learn from history that it takes time and 
experience to expose the faults of any legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we can learn that it has taken 17 years for the problems 
in the Young Offenders Act to be exposed, studied and hopefully 
dealt with in the youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, we can learn that the problems with this new act, and I 
am sure there will be some, will be exposed, studied and 
corrected over time, but probably not in less than a decade.  In 
the meantime, we can only do our best to try to enact corrections 
to the problems we have found in the Young Offenders Act.  I 
believe this act does just that and I believe, therefore, that it 
deserves the support of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is very simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member explain the fact that, despite all that he 
said, nobody in Quebec supports this bill? It does not have the 
support of any youth worker, any judge, any crown prosecutor, any 
defence attorney or even any crime victims' assistance centre. 
Senior citizens are also against it. Several branches of the 
Quebec Federation of Senior Citizens in certain administrative 
regions have expressed their opposition to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I toured Quebec and I did not meet even one person who supports 
this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member was very active in the justice committee, 
perhaps not as much recently, when we started looking at this 
whole issue in 1994-1995. He has a good knowledge of the Quebec 
approach with regard to the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is my question: Why is his government refusing to allow 
Quebec to continue applying the Young Offenders Act? Why is it 
refusing to indicate clearly in Bill C-7 that a province could, 
by order in council, continue to apply the Young Offenders Act, 
knowing that constitutional experts, lawyers and legal experts 
have already assessed the legality of such measure, considering 
the fact that the Young Offenders Act deals with social law as 
well as criminal law and affects various departments within the 
province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government, his government, ignoring Quebec's 
unanimous request to continue to apply the Young Offenders Act? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to 
the questions of the member, who I know takes a passionate 
interest in the subject matter and has for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may very well be, although I am not going to concede the 
point, that there is not a great deal of support for the bill in 
Quebec, according to the member, but I heard the justice minister 
say yesterday that the Barreau du Québec supported the bill. 
Certainly the lack of support would not be unanimous if that is 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, first of all this is a very contentious bill.  It 
is not surprising that there are very polarized views about it. 
Just because there are polarized views does not mean that we 
should not act.  We are a government.  We must act.  We made 
promises to the electorate.  We indicated that we would change 
the bill to make it better, to deal fairly and more effectively 
with youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the hon. member to suggest that the current system remain in 
Quebec is the reverse of saying that Quebec should opt out of the 
new bill.  We cannot have that.  We cannot have one criminal law 
for one part of the country and another for another part of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system for the entire time we have been a country has been 
one criminal law for all citizens.  All citizens should be 
treated equally before the law, under the same law, regardless of 
where they live in the country.  That includes youth. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is something I need 
to clarify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should read today's newspapers. He would see that, 
contrary to the claim made by the Minister of Justice yesterday, 
the Barreau du Québec does not support Bill C-7. There was a 
correction by the president of the Barreau du Québec in the 
newspapers today. The member should contact the Barreau du Québec 
directly, particularly Mrs. Carole Brosseau, to know exactly 
where those people stand on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Barreau du Québec does not support the minister's bill and 
it is part of the Quebec consensus unanimously asking the 
government not to go ahead with Bill C-7. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will not argue with the 
member as to the information he has given.  I have not seen the 
newspapers and, believe me, I do not believe what is in the 
newspapers.  I can assure the member of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that certain misinformation has been 
provided to people in the province of Quebec.  I believe that if 
the information was put fairly to them, they would not be as 
opposed as the member appears to say they are. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to point out first of 
all that criminal law is the responsibility of the federal 
government, and for good reason.  The previous exchange points 
that out.  As a federal government we need to bring to view the 
balance and flexibility that is required.  I believe we have done 
a very good job with Bill C-7, the youth criminal justice act. We 
have done it in a balanced and fair way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand we hear people in Ontario saying to wait a 
minute, that we are being very weak-kneed and not tough enough, 
yet we just heard the member for Berthier—Montcalm say we are 
too tough and it is too much. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the beauty of being a federal government that has 
compassion, ability and the political smarts to get the job done. 
That is exactly what we are doing.  We are ensuring that we bring 
about the kind of balance and flexibility that is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I marvel at the Bloc member arguing about whether or not Quebec 
would benefit.  In reality, $191 million more would flow to 
Quebec between 2000-01 and 2004-05 if it signs the agreement, 
which represents a 39% increase over what Quebec received 
previously in other agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fair minded Canadians wherever they live in this great country, 
including Quebec, the maritimes, the west and central Canada, 
recognize that the government has to act in this very important 
area in a way that underscores the values and the generosity of 
the people of this country especially as they relate to our 
youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to underscore that this is a pillar of the youth 
justice renewal strategy our government has undertaken.  Yes, it 
has taken a little longer than we would have liked, but at the 
end of the day I think we have a workable piece of legislation, a 
piece of legislation that I believe people across Canada will see 
as fair minded and important given their day to day lives, the 
lives of their children, their neighbours and the children in the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it brings about accountability.  I believe it brings 
about responsibility.  I believe it notes rehabilitation in a way 
that is in keeping with the way Canadians operate, not too tough 
and not too weak, but balanced in the way the Liberal government 
has always tried to do it.  We do it effectively.  I think it is 
worth trumpeting to Canadians the fact that we are able to bring 
forward the kind of legislation that brings about the broad 
interests of all Canadians across this vast country of ours in a 
meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about respect in the bill.  We talk about fairness.  We 
talk about the kind of built in flexibility sought by the 
provinces to ensure that accountability is there at the end of 
the day.  Having listened to many witnesses, having been in 
committee, having gone through the ways of this parliament in 
terms of coming out with a good piece of legislation, that is the 
kind of measured response we have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a meaningful exercise.  Despite some of the protests 
of the opposition, I think that at the end of the day people will 
see this as a very meaningful approach to youth justice.  They 
will see it as having the very key elements that are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes to review them, if I may. 
First is prevention.  Fair minded Canadians understand that the 
key to preventing people from getting into the system is to 
ensure that prevention is there.  We will be spending additional 
money, $206 million over the course of the next little while, to 
ensure that prevention is part of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own community I think of the Waterloo Regional Crime 
Prevention Council that we were able to implement and put in 
place.  These are important grassroots initiatives.  They are 
important things that we have done community by community to 
ensure that we have built in prevention for our young people.  I 
can tell the House that if we spend one dollar now, we will not 
have to spend seven dollars later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think fair minded Canadians, who are what this legislation is 
all about, will say “Wait a minute, an investment of one dollar 
now is far better than seven dollars later”, especially in the 
process of ensuring that young people with promising futures in 
this country are then able to advance what they believe is right, 
in keeping with their family values and the values of this great 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we talk about meaningful consequences.  We have to 
ensure that people, especially young people, understand that 
there are consequences of actions.  As a former high school 
teacher, I can tell the House that this is part and parcel of 
what is required for any young person.  Knowing that there are 
meaningful consequences in place as a result of one's actions is 
part of growing up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, rehabilitation and reintegration make up the third key 
element in terms of what is required.  We do not want young 
people to get into that system and learn to become even better 
criminals.  We want them to know that there are consequences.  We 
want to rehabilitate them, get them back out with their 
community, their school, their family and others in the area to 
ensure that they go down a path that makes sense for them, their 
families and the community at large.  That is precisely what this 
bill does, and I think in a very effective way. 
We have gone on to ensure that the youth criminal justice act 
better distinguishes between violent and non-violent crimes.  For 
example, punishments are proportionate to the seriousness of 
offences.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is part of listening to people through the committee 
process, listening to Canadians through consultation and focus 
groups and listening to parliamentarians and others with vested 
interests in these very important areas.  We have done that and I 
am encouraged by the net result.  It is a very good piece of 
legislation, in keeping with what the great family of Canadians 
think is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to highlights a few things in the bill.  Canadians 
need to understand that the bill encourages community based 
sentences, for example, which will be more appropriate.  They 
will note that the compensation for victims will be part of that, 
as well as community services, supervision in the community and 
other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to note that it would allow courts to impose adult 
sentences on conviction when certain criteria apply.  It presumes 
that adult sentences will be given to young people, 14 and older, 
who are found guilty of murder or attempted murder.  In other 
words, it may be the answer to more serious offences.  That is 
important.  That is what I was talking about earlier when I 
mentioned meaningful consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would create an intensive rehabilitative custody and 
supervisory sentence.  That is in keeping with the underlying 
philosophy of this bill and the intent of the justice minister, 
who worked very hard, along with the parliamentary secretary to 
my left, to make sure the bill had the kind of details in it that 
would make sense to Canadians wherever they lived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would require in general that youth be held separate from 
adults.  We do not want them mixing in a way that would end up 
putting them into a different kind of situation that is far more 
criminal.  That is a real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would require all periods of custody to be followed by a 
period of supervision and support in custody as well.  We have 
that kind of support mechanism built in that enables our young 
people to be taken care of and hopefully mentored in a positive 
and not a negative way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While publications of names would be permitted, there would be 
limitations with respect to that.  It would only be permitted 
when the crime was very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to note that it underscores the ability of the government 
to listen to Canadians, to deal as required and act as required 
in a very positive and meaningful way in this very important 
area.  It underscores the ability of our government, the justice 
minister, the cabinet and the caucus, to ensure that at the end 
of this process, which has been a while, we come up with a very 
workable piece of legislation which is in keeping with the 
benefits that should go to our young people and with the 
requirements that I believe society demands of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It saddens me a little when I think that the Ontario government 
believes that punishment alone serves to protect society.  It 
saddens me a little when I understand that it wants to take, as a 
philosophical base, that very harsh kind of approach.  I do not 
see that as working.  I did not see that in high school.  I did 
not see that when I served with the Waterloo Regional Police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it requires is a concerted effort by all of us 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the members opposite are clapping the Waterloo Regional 
Police.  They should because that is a police service it is 
second to none in this great country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, this is a balanced approach, a flexible 
approach and is an approach in keeping with the values of this 
great country; tolerance and compassion.  We are very grateful 
that people on this side of the House had the wherewithal to 
bring in this kind of excellent legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was watching this with great intent.  I appreciate 
having the time to discuss Bill C-7, the youth criminal justice 
bill, and the implications of that bill in communities such as 
mine.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several things I want to address.  One is the age upon 
which the current Young Offenders Act is applicable to and where 
I think it should go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest questions I get when I talk to young people 
in colleges and schools is when do we decide they are adults. 
The age of sexual consent in Canada, thanks to the government, 
has been reduced from 16 to 14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People can drive cars I believe at 16.  In some provinces people 
who are younger than 16 can get a learner's permit.  Drinking is 
allowed at the age 18 or 19.  People can be sent to adult court 
maybe at the age of 18, or 17 or 16, but certainly at the age of 
18.  In fact, we are not sure when a young person is an adult. 
We give the widest of messages to our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The age of a young offender in this act remains at 12 to 18.  We 
suggested that ages 16 and 17 up to age 18 be applicable to adult 
court.  For instance, a young person can drive a car, and I 
cannot think of a bigger weapon in the hands of anybody in this 
society.  If young people are old enough to drive a car, they are 
old enough to think right from wrong and know that their actions 
are right or wrong.  Therefore, I believe the age of an adult is 
above the age of 16.  I will come back to this in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the frustrations I have personally had with the bill is 
that the government has been messing with it, quite frankly, 
since 1993 when it came into office.  I was not elected yet, but 
back in 1989 and 1990 many of us said the Young Offenders Act had 
to change because it did not work.  This is now the third act 
that has been tabled in the House after three parliaments, and we 
are still debating this.  Even today I do not have the confidence 
that this is going to become legislation at the end of the day. 
I do not feel the government has the commitment to it nor 
understands all the implications of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A part of the legislation particularly disturbs me.  It is the 
list of presumptive offences for which an adult sentence may be 
imposed.  The list includes murder, attempted murder, 
manslaughter and aggravated assault.  It does not include sexual 
assault with a weapon, hostage taking, aggravated assault, 
kidnapping and a host of other serious violent offences.  Where I 
come from issues like sexual assault with a weapon, hostage 
taking, aggravated assault, kidnapping are all serious offences. 
Yet they are not acknowledged by the government as being so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went through this with some British officials last week.  Two 
individuals in England, named Thompson and Venebles, are young 
offenders.  These individuals murdered a very young person who 
was about two and a half years old.  A price is on their heads. 
The courts said that because of that they will allow them to 
change their name and change their identity.  In fact, they are 
looking at shipping them to another country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe these two young people have turned 18.  The British 
government is looking for somewhere to send them.  My information 
is that it has one of two choices: Canada or Australia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring this up because the government side is so sympathetic to 
issues like this.  I am concerned that individuals like them 
cannot only come to our country, hide their identities and live 
next door to anyone, but under the Young Offenders Act we still 
refuse to make full identification of young offenders who commit 
serious offences.  Not only do we not disclose that, but we are 
now in consideration of bringing two young offenders into Canada 
under other names, and we will never know who they are until they 
commit another crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the solicitor general in committee a couple of weeks ago 
whether these two would be coming to Canada.  Of course he denied 
knowing anything about it.  What I did not ask him was whether or 
not the justice minister or the immigration minister knew 
anything about it.  I believe that someone in the government 
across the way has made a deal, and it is most inappropriate that 
it happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada there are individuals who commit serious offences like 
murder or kidnapping.  These are crimes for which a 16 or 17 year 
old should be treated like an adult.  There should be no deals or 
appeals to a judge.  They are adults.  In my opinion if they are 
old enough to drive a car, they certainly are old enough to know 
right from wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although complex, the bill does not address two significant 
things which I am concerned about.  It does not address the age 
factor nor the seriousness of crimes.  If it were just these two 
issues in and of themselves, I would say we probably could sit 
here and negotiate something more worthwhile with the government. 
However the fact is we have heard a whole litany of problems 
with this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we will end up with is another convoluted, ineffective 
young offenders act.  I will call it that because that is really 
what it is.  We will end up with the same mess we had before, 
except with a few more lawyers trying to simplify it and make 
sense out of it, busier judges and a lot more police scratching 
their heads, still not understanding it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as the government would like to say it has everything 
figured out on this, it has not.  It has not addressed the two 
issues that I and the people of Langley—Abbotsford, British 
Columbia are concerned about, yet because we have a majority 
government of course this perhaps will go through.  It has only 
been eight or nine years in coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be voting against this.  It is high time the government 
got off its keester and started listening to the Canadian people, 
as well as the people in opposition who know full well that this 
has become another convoluted piece of legislation that the 
police will give up on, judges will not understand and lawyers 
will make money.

youth criminal justice act.  The question I have this afternoon 
is:  Why do we even need the act?  The answer is obvious.  Youth 
crime has increased in the country.  It is something that touches 
everyone including the government, and it has finally realized 
that there is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a Young Offenders Act that has been demonstrated to be 
clearly inadequate.  Since 1993 the government has promised 
change.  The committee on justice and legal affairs held 
extensive cross country hearings in 1996 and 1997.  It presented 
its report to parliament called “Renewing Youth Justice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a change of ministers in 1997 and at that time the 
reform of the act was to be a priority.  In 1999 the government 
finally introduced Bill C-68.  It was reintroduced in October 
1999 as Bill C-3 and it hung around until the last election.  It 
was revived again this spring.  The bill has had a longer life 
than some of the young people it was supposed to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expected that when it did come forward it would deal with the 
issues but it clearly did not.  It not only demonstrates a lack 
of ability to deal with children's issues but it demonstrates the 
government's inability to address the real issues in the country. 
It shows the government is out of touch with its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of arrogant is having an exaggerated sense of 
one's own importance or abilities.  I would add a second half to 
that definition.  It shows a refusal to accept one's 
responsibility.  Arrogance is shown in how the bill has been 
handled.  It has been reintroduced for the third time with a new 
name.  Simply calling something by a different name does not 
change it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has refused to apply responsible 
amendments.  It has applied some of its own technical 
housekeeping amendments, but it would not accept responsible 
amendments from other parties.  They have not even been 
considered so Bill C-7, which was Bill C-3, which was Bill C-68, 
is the bill we are discussing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is a general refusal in the bill to deal with the 
issues. There is a refusal to take responsibility for young 
offenders. The bill does not deal seriously with the youngest 
offenders.  It still leaves children of 10 and 11 years of age to 
child welfare and social services.  We are not suggesting that 
children of this age should be locked up, but it is essential 
that they are involved with the justice system to get the help 
they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these kids need a structured solution.  In the newspaper 
in the last few weeks there was a case involving a young person 
who was so out of control in his community that the community was 
asking someone to come in and do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked with young people for many years and one thing I 
know is that they need structure.  The younger they are, the more 
important it is to give them a direction which they do not 
necessarily have.  The bill deprives them of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is a refusal in the bill to take responsibility 
for older offenders.  In our previous Young Offenders Act, 
offenders aged 14 and up could be transferred to adult court for 
a very limited number of offences.  That provision was used very 
rarely.  Bill C-7 would allow for even more latitude in this 
area.  Provinces could essentially opt out of this provision in 
whole or in part.  They could change the provision so that it 
only applies to 15 or 16 year olds.  Some kids need to be in 
adult court to get access to the services they require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a refusal in the bill to take responsibility for 
the communities.  In terms of identifying young offenders, Bill 
C-7 would prevent a limited number of instances where young 
people could be named to protect their community.  The list is 
restrictive.  It does not include all violent or dangerous 
offenders.  It would provide courts with discretion to override 
the identification of the offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw last night, in the government's defeat of a good 
amendment that was presented to it, its lack of commitment to 
these kids, the communities and the school systems that need to 
deal with young people. We saw it vote en masse to restrict the 
provision regarding the naming of young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved somewhat with education and with young 
people.  Educators and other people in our schools need to know 
who these young people are in order to deal fairly and squarely 
with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-7 the protection of the public is second to 
understanding the circumstances and the perpetrator.  There is an 
extensive emphasis on rehabilitation and reintegration.  We have 
already seen the results of that approach in my area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regina has been attacked by car thieves for years.  Some of 
these kids have been arrested dozens of times, with little or no 
consequences for their actions.  Where is the deterrence when 
people can keep going back again and again to the same offences 
and grow into adults who have little regard for the law?

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of the public is not an overriding principle in 
the legislation.  Why should the protection of our communities 
take second place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also refuses to take responsibility for crime 
seriously.  People have always been concerned about the three 
year maximum sentence in the Young Offenders Act.  We heard about 
that often.  We heard about extreme circumstances and an extreme 
crime that took place, and young people were not held accountable 
for more than the three years maximum sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 would actually reduce the maximum custody period from 
three years to two years.  The maximum is three years but a 
supervisory period must be included.  For most offences we are 
looking at two years of custody and one year of supervision being 
the maximum sentence young people can face.  One of the main 
concerns of Canadians about young offenders is being ignored in 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also refusal to take responsibility for provincial 
governments.  The government would download the bill on to 
underfunded provincial governments. At present the cost sharing 
program is at about 75%, with the provinces paying 75% and the 
federal government paying 25%.  Our position is that the federal 
government should be paying 50% of that cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a strange situation when the federal government has 
responsibility for criminal law but absolutely no obligation to 
fund the implementation of it.  There have been long term 
shortfalls in financing and there has been a shortage of 
consultation with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a refusal to keep things simple.  The bill is 
extremely complicated.  As one member mentioned this morning, the 
Young Offenders Act has gone from 30 sections to 70 sections, to 
over 200 clauses in the current bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill sets up rules.  It sets up procedures.  It sets up 
exceptions to the same rules.  The court may or may not name 
offenders and adult sentencing may or may not be imposed.  Many 
of these things are left to the court's discretion.  It is so 
complicated that there were problems in trying to define a 
violent act or a serious violent offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked with kids, as I mentioned before, but the real 
problem is not with youth crime.  It is policy that destroys 
families.  Every one of us would recognize that the family is the 
foundation of society.  We need strong families if we are to have 
stable young children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many government policies that cause community and family 
breakdowns and family stress.  We have parents who want to be at 
home when their kids get home from school.  They want to be at 
home when their kids leave in the morning.  However they are not 
able to be because of their financial situation brought about by 
government policies.  There are families that cannot keep up in 
the world unless both parents work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some things that need to be done to address the 
problem of family stress.  The government needs to take a fair 
look at its taxation policies.  At every turn people are being 
taxed to death.  Taxes continue to increase.  We hear daily about 
the government's huge supposed tax cuts that took place, but they 
just do not register with people and they do not register on 
their paycheques.  We have property tax.  We have income tax.  We 
have fuel tax.  We have sales tax.  The list goes on and on.  The 
government needs to take a look at its taxation policies and how 
they affect families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our monetary policies have a great deal to do with family 
stress.  We see our dollar falling.  We see Canada falling behind 
in production.  We see that people must work harder and harder to 
break even, which continues to put pressure on the people who 
least need that pressure on their families.  People are forced 
into the workplace.  Some of them do want to be there.  Families 
are under stress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I talked about arrogance and defined it as an 
exaggerated sense of one's importance or abilities.  The whole 
bill smacks of that.  It seems to be a congratulatory and 
ineffective piece of legislation.  It is unfortunate that it does 
not deal realistically with the problems of youth justice in a 
concrete way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem has existed.  It continues to exist and it will 
continue to exist.  Our kids are being left at risk.  The 
government should not be wasting our time and taxpayer money, but 
I am afraid that is exactly what the bill would do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
find it interesting that in consideration of the new youth 
criminal justice act opposition members are getting into tax 
policy.  It shows the depth of their opposition to the bill by 
grasping at straws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also find it interesting that members opposite and their party 
keep insisting that crime, as well as youth crime, is going up 
when in fact statistics show the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member says that nothing is new and nothing has 
changed, why does he ignore the emphasis of the act on 
accountability, proportionality, meaningful consequences, 
rehabilitation and reintegration?  Why does he ignore this 
targeting of custodial sentences for repeat serious violent 
offenders?  Why does he ignore community supervision to help 
integrate a young person after release from custody?  Why does he 
ignore adult sentences for youths 14 years of age and over for 
very serious crimes and the presumptive offences?  Why does he 
ignore the publication of names for serious violent offences when 
there is an adult sentence?  Could the member explain this to me? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Anderson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know how the 
government members could possibly justify the taxation method 
that they have in the country.  People are overwhelmed by taxes. 
We talked this afternoon in question period about fuel taxes that 
are stressing people out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we ask the kids in our high schools today if they feel safer 
than they did a few years ago they would clearly say that they do 
not. They do not feel that those people who are threatening them 
are being dealt with in a way that would remove them from the 
system and keep them safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill offers discretion in every area.  That is just an 
excuse for people not to put in effective legislation.  If we 
offer discretion in every possible area, then we could say that 
we have set it up that way, but everyone would know that we do 
not intend to use it that way.  It has just become a bureaucratic 
mess and it may get worse. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I feel privileged to have an opportunity to speak on the 
legislation.  I would like to come at the legislation from a 
different point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening to most of the speakers here today and I 
have heard some good ideas coming from all sides of the House.  I 
especially want to acknowledge some of the thoughts put forward 
by the member for Wild Rose who spoke earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally do not support the notion of a boot camp but I am 
very much in sympathy with the notion of creating environments 
for young people where they can achieve an atmosphere of 
discipline and athleticism because all those things affect the 
development of the whole person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble of the bill states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas members of society share a responsibility to address the 
developmental challenges and the needs of young persons and to 
guide them into adulthood. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that preamble in mind, I want to share with the House an 
experience I had last summer in Tor Vergata, Italy, which is a 
university campus just outside of Rome.  Last August, on behalf 
of the members of the House of Commons, I attended the World 
Youth Day event led by the Holy Father.  This was the eighth or 
ninth World Youth Day event. 
It is an event where young men and women come from all over the 
world to celebrate the values of sharing and caring for each 
other.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I experienced at the event, which was attended by close to 
two million young people from all over the world, was an attitude 
and a spirit I have never witnessed in my entire life.  I was in 
attendance with the premier of Ontario, Mr. Harris; his minister 
responsible for the World Youth Day celebrations coming to 
Toronto; Mr. Chris Hodgson; and our mayor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this event today in the House because it can serve as an 
example to members of parliament.  They can draw on it in working 
together to mobilize and motivate all the machinery of government 
around the whole area of youth crime prevention.  It can help 
build the confidence, vision and hope of young people and teach 
them that the values of caring and sharing are central to 
building the fabric of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For members of the House who may not be up to date on the 
project, in July 2002 Canada is hosting the next World Youth Day 
celebration in Toronto.  We as a nation, along with the Catholic 
church and the Conference of Bishops of Canada, will be inviting 
probably close to a million people from all over the world to 
come to Toronto for five days from July 18 to 28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these young people come together they will be demonstrating 
to us as parents and legislators that they are interested in 
working in their own communities and countries on issues related 
to personal development, human development and whole person 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one thing I wish we could talk about more today when 
debating the legislation before us.  I sense that members of the 
Bloc Quebecois are much more sensitive about the notion of 
personal development and growth than many of us, quite frankly. 
They have done a magnificent job in the debate today in talking 
about the personal growth of young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to speak to the bill today and remind the House of 
World Youth Day because it is a concrete example of where all 
members of the House have come together with over 13 departments 
of the Government of Canada to touch a million young people from 
all over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our former ambassador to Russia, Ann Leahy, and her assistants 
in Toronto are busy organizing the event.  I wanted to put it on 
the record today because as the year unfolds I do not think we as 
members of parliament can do enough in the whole area of 
prevention, of touching young people before they are put at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that has been the mission of the member for Wild Rose 
for most of his life as an educator.  It was the primary point he 
was trying to get across today in the House when he talked about 
his experience as a principal and an educator.  He said we need 
the tools that will allow us to assist in the personal 
development of young people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to the preamble of this piece of legislation which 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas communities, families, parents and others concerned with 
the development of young persons should, through 
multidisciplinary approaches...respond to the needs of young 
persons, and...provide guidance and support— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where I want to come from.  We do not do enough in 
Canada to build dreams and hope and give proper instruments of 
support to young people.  Quite frankly that is why I am pleased 
that we as the House of Commons have been so united in promoting 
this event which is coming to Toronto in July 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have not connected with the profound impact the 
project will have.  I will give an example.  If we hosted the 
Olympic games we would touch, at most, 300,000 people per day. 
With this project we will be touching one million people or five 
times that number.  I will be splitting my time with the member 
for Chatham—Kent Essex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the House of Commons and the entire federal team 
under the direction of former Ambassador Leahy, Cardinal 
Ambrozic, Bishop Meagher and Father Thomas Rosica, I want to 
convey that we believe in working with young people to develop 
the whole person.  We will be with them in Toronto in July 2002. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I believe prevention is the key to success with young 
offenders.  There is no doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member and I could debate all day about the effectiveness of 
so-called boot camp.  The ones I have seen are very effective.  I 
encourage him to visit one some time just to take a look and make 
up his own mind from what he sees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he would agree that good parenting is a good thing to 
have.  A good solid home makes a big difference in the lives of 
young people.  In the province of Alberta a poll was taken of 
working mothers.  Seventy-four per cent said they would prefer to 
stay home with their children if they could afford to do so, but 
they could not.  We have been after the government for some time 
to give tax relief to families who choose to keep a parent at 
home.  That has never occurred.  Could the hon. member tell me 
why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more 
with the member.  A mother should be given the option to stay at 
home or to work.  If a mother chooses to work, obviously that is 
not a debatable point.  However if she wishes to stay at home and 
raise her children, there is no way tax policy should punish her 
for doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that I have been a passionate supporter of that 
idea for many years.  Those of us who believe in the idea will 
keep promoting it so that one day a majority of us in the House 
will realize that it is a very special experience and a very 
special gift for young people to have a mother who chooses and 
can afford to stay at home and give that added amount of time to 
her children.

<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in debate at third reading 
of Bill C-7.  The introduction of Bill C-7 followed a lengthy 
period of consultation and review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members not only of the breadth and depth of the study 
that preceded the introduction of the bill but of the very strong 
arguments that were put forward to make sure the Young Offenders 
Act and the youth justice system would be changed.  I further 
point out the extent to which the youth criminal justice act 
responds to the recommendations of task force and standing 
committee reports tabled over a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the current Young Offenders Act was last amended in 1995 
the government reiterated its commitment to conduct a 
comprehensive review of the legislation and the operation of the 
youth justice system.  After a decade of experience with the 
Young Offenders Act it was time to step back and assess how the 
legislation and the youth justice system were working, and how 
they could be improved in ways that took into account the 
concerns and values of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee on justice and legal affairs was asked to 
undertake an extensive review of the youth justice system.  In 
carrying out its review the committee convened round table 
discussions, held a national forum, canvassed various parts of 
the country, heard from witnesses representing more than 100 
different organizations and received more than 100 written 
briefs.  The standing committee on justice and legal affairs 
released its report entitled “Renewing Youth Justice” in April 
1997. It included significant findings about the youth justice 
system and made 14 recommendations for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contributing to this comprehensive review by the standing 
committee was the report of a federal-provincial-territorial task 
force on youth justice.  The task force, established in 1994 by 
the federal-provincial-territorial ministers responsible for 
youth justice, was given a mandate to review the Young Offenders 
Act and its application.  The task force was composed of 
provincial, territorial and federal officials with expertise in 
youth justice.  Its members worked in prosecution services, 
correctional services, statistics and research, youth law policy 
and law enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In proposing its response to the standing committee report 
entitled “Renewing Youth Justice” the federal government took 
into account not only the findings and recommendations of the 
report but also the findings of the task force and calls from 
Canadians across the country for a strategy to change the Young 
Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, a strategy for the renewal of youth justice was 
released in May 1998.  The strategy sets out the basic themes and 
policy directions contained in Bill C-7 and, perhaps more 
important, the rationale.  The strategy identifies three key 
weaknesses in Canada's youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, not enough money is being put into the system to prevent 
young people from falling into a life of crime.  Prevention has 
been mentioned by almost everyone in the House.  My colleague who 
preceded me was very much of that mind and many members of the 
House have said very clearly that prevention is important.  This 
is the direction in which we need to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the system must improve the way it deals with the most 
serious violent youths, not just in terms of sentencing but in 
terms of ensuring they are provided with extensive, intensive, 
long term rehabilitation that considers their interests and those 
of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the system relies too heavily on custody for the vast 
majority of non-violent young offenders when alternative, 
community based approaches could do better.  The system must 
instil social values, help right wrongs and ensure that valuable 
resources are targeted where they are most needed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to these weaknesses, the new strategy proposes to 
renew Canada's youth justice system with a focus on three key 
areas:  crime prevention and effective alternatives to the formal 
youth justice system; meaningful consequences for youth crime; 
and rehabilitation and reintegration of young people.  All of 
these, working together, will help society have a better system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It commits us to target custody as a response to the more 
serious offenders and to provide more meaningful community based 
sanctions for the vast majority of youth crime, thereby 
contributing to a reduction in Canada's youth incarceration 
rates, which are among the highest in the western world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For provincial and territorial governments, the federal 
financial commitment takes the form of a five year financial 
arrangement worth a total of $950 million to support the 
implementation of the youth criminal justice act and the overall 
policy objectives of the youth justice renewal initiative.  The 
new agreements promote and support a wide range of services and 
programs considered most likely to assist in the rehabilitation 
and reintegration of young persons in conflict with the law and 
in reducing reliance on the youth court system and incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional federal funding would also be available to support 
the development of programs required for the implementation of 
the new intensive rehabilitation custody and supervision 
sentencing option.  These financial arrangements are an important 
component of the flexible implementation phase undertaken in 
close co-operation with the jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the youth justice renewal fund, provincial and 
territorial ministries responsible for youth justice may apply 
for grants and contributions to assist in the preparation for and 
implementation of the youth justice renewal initiative.  Funds 
are available for activities related to training, community 
partnership development or expansion, reintegration planning and 
support and implementation contingencies.  Examples of such 
activities include:  assessment of staff training needs in light 
of new legislation; development of policies that will govern 
youth justice committee work; review of policy and procedural 
materials; and development and delivery of orientation sessions 
on the new legislation for frontline workers, managers, 
administrators and youth justice committee members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the legislative process, let me note that prior 
to the third reading of Bill C-7's predecessor, Bill C-3, the 
election call came.  However, the government's commitment to move 
forward with new justice legislation remained strong.  The Speech 
from the Throne to open the first session of the 37th parliament 
of Canada stated that the government would reintroduce 
legislation to change how the justice system deals with young 
offenders.  New legislation would encourage alternatives to 
custody for non-violent offenders, emphasizing rehabilitation and 
reintegration into society while toughening consequences for more 
violent youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This commitment to reintroduce youth justice legislation has 
been kept.  Bill C-7 was introduced in the House of Commons on 
February 5.  Bill C-7 is basically the same bill previously 
introduced as Bill C-3, except that Bill C-7 incorporates 
government amendments that were made public before the election 
call.  The inclusion of these amendments demonstrates once again 
the ongoing consultation that is accompanying this bill as it 
moves through the parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has consulted and listened.  Many views have been 
expressed, some diametrically opposed to others.  The overriding 
goal is to put in place a youth justice system that is fair and 
effective, and that is what Bill C-7 would do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The substance of Bill C-7 has been open to public scrutiny for a 
long time.  Its introduction was preceded by lengthy studies and 
consultation.  Now is the time to move forward and replace the 
Young Offenders Act with the youth criminal justice act, an act 
that would instil values such as accountability, responsibility 
and respect, which are long overdue in all of our systems.  This 
is an act that would result in the kind of youth justice system 
all Canadians want. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, again I hear a speech that follows the rhetoric that the 
justice minister has put forward for the last seven or eight 
years.  No matter who the justice minister is, it is the same 
kind of carrying on in terms of rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to understand first of all that I do not 
believe that young people who commit non-violent crimes should 
even be in jail.  I believe there are some good answers as to how 
to deal with young people who decide they are going to break the 
law in a non-violent act.  I do not think jail accomplishes a 
thing for them.  Maybe after they commit many non-violent acts we 
may have to jail them, but for at least the first one or two 
times it is not necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I constantly hear from that side of the House that it would be a 
shame, for example, if the principal of a school expelled a 
violent student from the school system.  I constantly hear that 
the person needs to stay there and learn and get educated and be 
rehabilitated within that society.  When will the government 
recognize that in regard to any student who is a well known 
violent individual maybe the 400 other students would be better 
off and safer without that individual there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government start considering the safety of 
neighbourhoods by saying that we need to open up the information 
banks?  What about someone who was once in jail for murdering a 
senior and then is living next door to a senior couple, which has 
happened many times?  Why is the government so adamant that 
violent people have to be treated with kid gloves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violence is something that has to be taken out of our society. 
People should not be subjected to individuals who have constantly 
proven to be violent.  We all know it happens all the time.  This 
system allows it to happen.  When will it stop?  When will let 
young people learn that they cannot violently hurt people and get 
away with it, that it is a very serious crime and that very 
serious consequences will follow?  When will we stop treating 
violence with kid gloves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see anything in the bill or hear anything that comes 
out of the mouths of those people that indicates the government 
is really serious about protecting the innocent victims.  We 
never even hear those people use those words any more.  Instead 
it is “rehabilitate the poor guy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This violence has to stop.  What does this member suggest we do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
member for Wild Rose for giving me an opportunity to clarify that 
position.  I, like he, spent 25 years in education and I 
certainly am very aware of what can happen when young people 
disrupt the classroom.  It is very unfair to all the other people 
in the classroom.  When children are disruptive, do not allow the 
classrooms to operate and do not allow things to work, I do not 
think there is a colleague in the House, either on this side or 
that side, who would think that those children have to be in that 
classroom and continue to disrupt it daily.  That is not the 
case.  I do not believe it to be the case.  I certainly would 
never support it and I know that most of my colleagues would not 
support it either.  It is an accusation that is not supported by 
my colleagues or myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member was very clear about separating the non-violent 
people and not incarcerating them but instead giving them some 
guidance, support and help.  That is very important.  The 
non-violent people should have guidance and support where it is 
required.  However, as far as the violent offender is concerned, 
with this bill we would have a lot more latitude in dealing with 
the violent people the member referred to. 
It is not just about putting them behind bars, but we can do that 
and we will do that.  It is not just about sending them to adult 
court as adults, but we will do that under the bill.  That is 
very clear.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about just dealing with them on one basis, putting 
them in jail, locking them up and saying that is the end.  Per 
100,000, Canada has more young people locked up than any country 
that I am aware of.  We have in jail 1,000 per 100,000 young 
people who commit crimes.  In comparison, the United States has 
700 per 100,000.  The U.S. numbers are much lower.  The Americans 
do not incarcerate as many young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that those young people need more help, a tremendous 
amount of it.  They need guidance.  They need counselling.  I 
believe the members of the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I regret to interrupt 
debate, but I am particularly sensitive to the large number of 
colleagues who wish to speak in the time remaining. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am splitting my time. I 
have been given only 10 minutes to speak on third and final 
reading of Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third reading is the time to talk about the general thrust of a 
bill as a whole.  There has been a lot of talk and deliberation 
about this type of legislation since the nationwide consultation 
conducted by the Conservative government during 1992-93.  It was 
attempting at the time to address the anger in the land that had 
developed over the operation of the Liberal legislation of the 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point we as a country are still not much further ahead, 
because the Liberals are still in charge.  Since they have caused 
the present problem with the law, they are not now in any 
position to repair the basics of their errors.  The Liberals have 
had reviews and some small amendments, but this time they are to 
be judged by the public on what they are finally bringing to the 
communities of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is an example that goes to the heart of the competence 
to govern.  In the broadest estimation the bill is an utter 
failure.  It is a failure in many technical ways, but on the 
general level it is another example of why the Liberals are not 
worthy to govern.  The bill is an example of a bureaucracy 
entangling itself with objectives that are at cross purposes, 
combined with insufficient political leadership to provide 
guidance out of the forest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although many political analysts admit that the Liberals are 
without principle, the bill is certainly the technical evidence 
that the Liberals have no canopy of values to find the moral 
compass of direction when they become lost in the tall forest of 
competing interests and opposing concepts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nation is in this mess because of a previous Liberal 
government that in its usual high purpose, we know best manner, 
with all the great arrogance of the day, gave us the Young 
Offenders Act over the clear objections of millions of Canadians. 
In many respects the very objections and warnings given years 
ago about the folly of the underlying assumptions about social 
psychology and of the criminal justice theory assumptions have 
all come true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are now, years later, still trying to fix the flaws. 
True to form, the arrogance of the government over the bill, 
which would be an administrative labyrinth, brings us convoluted 
fixes to the problems that the Liberals created.  They can never 
fix their dilemmas as they do not possess the vision or the 
principled perspectives to address what the community needs in 
order to respond to the most fundamental Canadian social 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister claims with self-satisfaction that the enactment 
would repeal and replace the Young Offenders Act and provide 
principles, procedures and protections for the prosecution of 
young persons under criminal and other federal laws.  The bill 
sets out a range of extrajudicial measures.  It would establish 
judicial procedure and protection for young persons alleged to 
have committed an offence.  It would encourage participation of 
parents, victims, communities, youth justice committees and 
others in the youth justice system.  It sets out the range of 
sentences that would be available to the youth justice court.  It 
would establish custody and supervision provisions.  It sets out 
the rules for the keeping of records and protection of privacy. 
It provides transitional provisions and makes consequential 
amendments to other acts.  In summary terms, those are the claims 
of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is obvious that the government has failed, 
particularly at the operational community level and at the levels 
of broad themes and societal objectives.  The Minister of Justice 
has tabled legislation three times and three times she has struck 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like most Liberal bills this is well intentioned, but it is 
barely an improvement over the old YOA.  It does not address the 
concerns of Canadians, including provisions for realistic 
sentences for violent crimes, focusing the law to deal truly with 
young offenders rather than youthful adults or comprehensively 
accommodating victims' rights needs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia has had a legislative basis for diversion since 
1968, some 33 years ago.  Street diversion and community programs 
for offending youth, especially through Christian churches, were 
working in the urban settings of Canadian cities for years before 
matters became of such national concern that parliament began to 
deal with it in about 1908. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Liberals talk of their bill, one would think that the 
alternative measures and diversions were invented by them. 
Parliament has been struggling with a criminal set of rules at 
cross-purposes to address the specialness of young offenders 
seemingly forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we have had mostly Liberal governments, we as a society 
have never been able to put to rest these issues.  Now we have a 
bill that is so complex that it caves in upon itself trying to 
accomplish broad and competing objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to clarify the basics.  We are striving for a set of 
rules that would outline how criminal law would apply to a child 
or a young person.  It is assumed that there is a diminished 
capacity for a young person to appreciate criminal acts and 
therefore they should not be subject to the full weight of the 
law.  As the bill shows, the Liberals have fallen all over 
themselves.  They have tied themselves in knots because they do 
not have a guiding vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each province we have social welfare legislation with large 
systems of care, including social workers who have the legal 
capacity to take into care with the full authority of a legal 
parent any child who is deemed to be in need of care and 
protection.  If we had a wise but simple and more circumscribed 
youth criminal justice act, it could complement and support the 
social welfare mandates of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have a supportive law that would help break the cycle 
of offending and more fully support the huge amounts of money 
that is spent in community responses.  However the latest 
managerial disaster of the government is off target in this 
respect because philosophically the Liberals do not stand for 
anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A dichotomy is revealed in the bill.  Through many convoluted 
provisions it tries to deal with the principle of diminished 
capacity for young people, but in a most complex way it tries to 
accommodate violent offenders and criminal code precepts such as 
protection of society and denunciation.  Gradually victims are 
being allowed back into the scene.  The bill is most inadequate 
in that regard also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community expectations of a government providing peace, order 
and good government are not met in the bill.  The anger in the 
land over public observance of how young offenders are dealt with 
generally in the courts would not be diminished by this prime 
example of Liberal ideological confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the government wants a bill, any bill that is 
in the topic area, just so that it can say it has one.  However 
when the fundamentals of secrecy, age of application and a 
confusion of focus is the substance, we can understand why the 
Liberals have refused all the contrary evidence provided by so 
many that they should be going in a different direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes to the heart of how we as a society value family and 
children, how we care for those who do not seem to be able to 
care for themselves and help those who are out of step with 
community norms.  It is about the knowledge to care.  If a social 
welfare agency, a social worker and a school authority are to be 
part of the community response for children in conflict with the 
law, they must be knowledgeable and fully informed.  That must 
not be discretionary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my community are aware of young offender cases.  They 
observe what happens and they follow a case through the 
community.  They are not part of the process and anger begins to 
increase.  They watch time and time again as the case slowly 
winds through the system and then they react.  They call their 
local MP and they sign petitions of protest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has received millions of signatures in objection to 
the philosophical underpinning of the bill that we have before us 
today.  People almost have a fatalistic approach.  With a law 
that is so out of touch with community values they have just 
given up protesting at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of what I have heard over the years, I can say that my 
community does not support the bill and the underpinnings within 
it.  I cannot justify it either.  Consequently I will be voting 
against the bill at third reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak to the bill today.  It 
takes me back to the first year I campaigned for this job in 
1997. 
When I went door to door, one of the topics at the time was the 
Young Offenders Act and the changes that people wanted to see.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember one business that I went into.  The gentleman was 
completely distraught over the fact that he could not get any 
justice for the problems he had been having with young offenders. 
It is interesting to note that many years later Bill C-7 still 
does not address the issues that so many Canadians are concerned 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment my colleague from Surrey North who has made it his 
life's work to bring in proper youth justice in Canada.  Some of 
the amendments he put forward would have made great additions to 
the bill.  Every amendment we put forward would have strengthened 
the bill, made it more receptive to the needs of Canadians and 
would have made our streets safer.  These were the underlying 
factors for putting forward our amendments to the new youth 
justice act.  We wanted our streets to be safer so people could 
feel more comfortable in their homes and in their daily lives. 
The member for Surrey North put a lot of effort into those issue. 
He knows from personal experience what can happen when young 
offenders go wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things our party proposed and probably one of the 
most contentious was the lowering of the age range from 12 to 18 
to 10 to 16.  People said that we would be locking up 10 year 
olds but that was not what we were talking about.  We were 
talking about helping young people in trouble, and heading in the 
wrong direction, to get back on track and become better citizens 
in order to contribute to society in a way that all Canadians 
should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party wanted a clear definition of a violent offence.  We 
wanted a schedule of offences so there would be no necessity to 
play legal word games in the courts and no need for millions of 
dollars to be spent in legal costs for arguments and appeals. We 
should have a list of what a violent offence means.  We should 
include the offence of murder plus all the listed offences in 
schedule I and II of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. 
These are the offences Canadians want to see listed as violent 
offences.  Those were in the amendments we brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed the deletion of the term presumptive offence within 
the legislation.  We preferred the term violent offence to 
determine when a young person ought to receive adult punishment. 
We proposed the deletion of the term serious violent offence 
because we felt that all violent offences were serious and that 
it should be left up to the courts to decide the punishment in 
those circumstances.  However violent offences must be handled in 
a specific manner to protect our citizens and our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed an overriding principle making the legislation the 
protection of the public.  We heard time and again that the 
government placed more emphasis on the interests of the offender 
than on the protection of citizens.  The protection of our 
communities should not take second place to anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed the limitation of extrajudicial measures to first 
time non-violent offenders and only if those extrajudicial 
measures were adequate to hold a young person accountable. 
Accountability is a part of the act that really needs to be 
highlighted.  Young people and their parents have to be held 
accountable.  If we did that it would put some real meaning into 
the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed a requirement for the attorney general to inform 
victims of their specific rights.  We felt that was important. We 
proposed that the principles of denunciation and deterrence be 
included within the legislation.  A big aspect of any youth 
justice act should be methods of deterrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed that an adult sentence be imposed on young persons 
who commit violent offences after their 14th birthday.  The range 
of adult sentencing would still be left up to the courts, and 
that would include youth style punishments, but 14 and 15 year 
olds who commit violent offences would be held accountable for 
potential adult sentencing.  Some people felt that proposal was 
fairly harsh but we were talking about serious, violent and 
repeat offenders.  We must deal with those people in such a way 
that our communities will be safe and our public will be 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed that young persons who commit violent offences be 
identified for the protection of the public.  People wanted to 
know who those young offenders were and what they had done.  They 
felt they had the right to know if somebody who was capable of a 
violent offence was living in their community.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed that a young person who received a life sentence 
through adult court should receive parole eligibility between 10 
and 15 years at the discretion of a judge.  This was an increase 
from the present range of 5 to 10 years, to put a little more 
bite into the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also proposed an increased maximum sentence for violent 
offences other than murder.  Bill C-7 would bring a custody 
period followed by a supervisory period with supervisory time to 
be one-half of the custody time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put forward all these proposals as amendments to the 
legislation.  They were researched and had the benefit of the 
firsthand knowledge of the member for Surrey North.  Not one of 
them was accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ended up with a bill that appears to be the same as Bill C-68 
and then its subsequent Bill C-3 and now Bill C-7. There is no 
change.  There is no more bite in the bill and no more protection 
for Canadians than there was in the bill introduced as Bill C-68. 
After months of review and hearing experts from all aspects of 
youth justice, the only changes made include many of the 
technical amendments proposed by the government to correct errors 
in Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not been open to change on any aspect of the 
legislation.  There were hearings where witnesses came forward 
with many good ideas and with firsthand experience.  People 
involved in the youth justice system brought forward excellent 
ideas that were not accepted.  All the opposition parties, except 
the Bloc, presented substantive amendments to Bill C-3.  None of 
them received debate in parliament.  None of them appear to have 
been considered by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces will be tasked to administer this legal nightmare 
but the federal government does not seem to care.  The government 
has not been open to serious discussion over the proposals in its 
youth justice law.  There needed to be more willingness on behalf 
of the government to listen to Canadians, the experts and the 
other parties in the House of Commons to improve the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has promised $206 million over the first three 
years for the implementation of the bill, but it would not even 
come close to meeting the responsibility of providing 50% of the 
funding for youth justice.  The government has allowed federal 
funding to slip to about 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not only apply to the bill.  We have seen that in 
other areas of government responsibility where it has 
historically committed funding to a certain level to help the 
provinces administer the laws that are created here.  The funding 
has decreased from 50% to 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have to carry that financial burden and to take 
that extra cost into their own budgets to administer a law that 
many of them are not happy with because it does not go far 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An initial review of Bill C-7 indicates that the government has 
made it even weaker likely to appease the Quebec government and 
the Bloc Quebecois.  That was one thing we saw.  It said that if 
the Canadian Alliance thought it was too soft and the Bloc 
thought it was too severe it had to go right down the middle of 
the road.  We do not agree with that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The age range of application will remain at 12 to 18.  Many 
people thought 10 to 12 year olds that were starting to get into 
trouble needed some help.  They needed someone there to pull them 
back, to help them out and to put them back on the right road. 
That has not happened and these young people are still out there 
without direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The restrictions on naming violent offenders have not been put 
into the legislation.  It is up to the courts to do that.  That 
was something of critical importance to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the entire process of bringing the bill forward three 
times this will be its last debate before it is voted on this 
evening.  We still do not have what Canadians have asked for.  A 
lot more could have been done with the overall philosophy that 
the protection of Canadians as a whole should be the meat of the 
bill.  If the government had kept that in mind, it would have had 
a bill that Canadians would have appreciated and supported.

Mr. Speaker, I commend my hon. friend for his comments.  They 
were very precise comments that delved into ways in which the 
legislation could have been improved.  I would also attach myself 
with his complimentary remarks to the member for Surrey North who 
found out in a firsthand way the tragedy that can be invoked for 
families and victims in the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question, specifically, is about a reference that he made to 
lowering the age of accountability to 10.  I have a slightly 
different take on this.  I would like to get his reaction.  It 
deals with the element of transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently in our justice system we have the ability to transfer 
a person who fits the definition of a young offender, that is a 
person between the ages of 12 and 18, into the adult court 
system, whereby there is judicial discretion based on evidence to 
take the person and try them as an adult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to suggest to him that a system that would apply 
similarly where a young person aged 10 or 11, who had committed a 
serious offence and had escalating behaviour as identified by 
police or counsellors, could be transferred through a courtroom 
based on evidence and submissions made by interested parties and 
stakeholders before a court of competent jurisdiction, by using 
the same principles of transfer.  A child could be brought into a 
court system where the circumstances permitted, for the good of 
the child and the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be of great benefit and would enhance our current 
system.  It would enhance public protection, deterrents and 
rehabilitation, all those elements of our criminal justice system 
that we want to encompass in this and future legislation.  I 
would like to get his remarks on that suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend's input into 
the youth criminal justice act has been noted and appreciated. 
His expertise in justice issues is appreciated by all members in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any method we could use, whether it is a transfer through courts 
or whatever, to bring these young people some much needed help is 
important.  That is the problem.  We are not seeking to lock 10 
to 12 year olds up.  We are trying to do is to help these young 
people.  A lot of our young people are not in a family situation 
that most of us would recognize.  They do not have a mother and 
father in a responsible relationship and the right instruction to 
go out and be good citizens.  They need that, and a lot them are 
crying out for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation, we should be able to take these young people and 
get them on the right track before they go too far wrong.  To not 
do that is a crime.  We are turning our backs on some large 
numbers of young people.  If we had the ability and the legal 
right to reach out, help them and bring them back, we could make 
a lot of difference to a lot of young people.  Unfortunately, 
this legislation does not allow us to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am a little confused.  Is the hon. member suggesting that we 
should have a further separate system for those between the ages 
of 10 and 11 or 11 and under?  He referred to large numbers of 
individuals in this category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics I have show that roughly 1.5% of the incidents 
reported to police involve children under 12.  Of that, 81% are 
property offences and 19% are violent offences.  Two-thirds of 
the violent offences are minor assaults.  How does the hon. 
member justify those statistics with the approach that my hon. 
friend is suggesting, even though public opinion indicates that 
the preference is that these children be dealt with in the mental 
health system and mental health intervention? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in my opinion one young 
person lost is one too many if with a little help he or she could 
have turned the corner and become a productive member of society. 
We need to do whatever we can to ensure we reach out to as many 
as we possibly can.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to share my time, because the more views 
expressed in this House the better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clock is ticking. Usually, I am pleased to take part in the 
House's debates. Today, however, I am quite sad to have to repeat 
once more what I said before: this bill will leave Quebec unable 
to extend a helping hand to young offenders who are themselves 
victims more than anything else when they turn to crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They need help, not coercion. It is unfortunate that we have 
before us a bill that does not please anyone. Alberta is 
obviously not pleased at all with this bill. Ontario and Quebec 
are not either. If we were to consult the residents of all of the 
provinces, we would probably find out that a majority of 
Canadians are against this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one flicker of hope left. It may sound strange, 
but let us hope that the Liberal senators will be more 
intelligent and more understanding than the Liberal members from 
Quebec and will come up with the necessary amendments to make 
this bill more palatable to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear people say that they would like this bill to be even 
harsher, when I hear them talk about 10, 11 and 12 year olds and 
in some cases 8 year olds, I cannot help but wonder what planet 
this is. In what kind of country do we live in if we think, even 
for 30 seconds, that we should take 8 to 12 year olds and hand 
them over to the justice system because they did something we see 
as reprehensible, when the first question we should be asking 
ourselves is what kind of education they have received? What kind 
of school do they attend? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of primary care has society been providing to them 
since birth for these children not to be able to behave as we 
would like them to behave even though they were born with the 
full potential of becoming perfectly balanced citizens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me very sad, and I hope all Canadians will know it 
tonight through television, to think that in a few minutes 
members will vote in favour of this bill. Those who vote against 
it will do it for two reasons. For some, the bill does not go far 
enough, it should be even harsher. For us, Quebecers, it goes too 
far.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is so rigid, contrary to everything the minister 
said, that it will be impossible for any province to apply its 
provincial system of justice and the approach it wants to use 
with young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is astounding to see that the minister is totally deaf to all 
our pleas for justice for children. Finally, when we think about 
it seriously, two things are 
wrong: there are two officials sitting at the justice department 
who see this as a personal victory. The bureaucrats are in the 
process of defeating the parliamentarians. Since 1993, they have 
been trying to impose upon us a legislation that makes no sense 
whatsoever. These two officials, along with the minister, are 
challenging us. They keep telling her not to back down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what is so sad here: the bureaucrats are working against 
the parliamentarians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to 
make our final statement in opposition to the youth criminal 
justice system, which the Liberals are about to force upon our 
nation.  This is third reading of the bill and the last 
opportunity we have to try to force the government to change it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a moment to appreciate the hard work done by all 
my colleagues, first in the Reform Party then in the Canadian 
Alliance, particularly my neighbour and my friend, the hon. 
member for Surrey North, who has worked quite hard on the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate provides this side of the House with the chance to 
summarize the great failing of the justice minister in her 
attempt to change the Young Offenders Act.  Speech after speech 
in the House, witness after witness in the committee, bill after 
bill in the House, the government has not listened to what 
Canadians want in terms of addressing youth crime.  In all 
regions of the country there is opposition to many aspects of the 
bill.  However the justice minister will not listen nor address 
these concerns, despite the fact she stated in the House that her 
top priority was to deal with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experts with a wide range of specialties were generous with the 
government in terms of providing testimony, recommendations and 
amendments, but still the weak, arrogant Liberal government did 
not listen to them.  The government continues to reintroduce the 
bill, but it has failed to address the important issues facing 
this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now facing closure on debate on the bill.  The government 
wants to hastily pass a bill which will not work.  Even the 
senators are upset because they will not get enough time to deal 
with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the arrogant, weak Liberal government passes the 
legislation, the complexity and loopholes will cause horrendous 
delays and costs to our youth criminal justice process.  Legal 
bills will be phenomenal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not been open to change on any aspect of the 
legislation and has refused to accept amendments.  Oppositions 
parties, except the Bloc, have presented meaningful and 
significant amendments to this bill, but the government failed to 
address them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say so many things about what the government missed in the 
bill, but my time is limited.  However I will say that the 
federal government did not consult Canadians about it.  It 
refused to listen to Canadians.  It refused to have extensive 
consultations with various provinces prior to bringing forth 
these new procedures.  The provinces will be tasked to administer 
the legal nightmare, but the federal government does not seem to 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, using closure to stop debate to move the bill 
through, clearly shows that this arrogant, weak Liberal 
government does not care about the youth criminal justice system 
in the country.  Protection of the public and victims take second 
fiddle in the government's regime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this 
House, the government should work towards incorporating a 
measure of proportional representation in the federal 
electoral system, making use of a framework which includes: 
(<I>a</I>) a report on proportional representation prepared by an 
all-party committee after extensive public hearings; (<I>b</I>) a 
referendum to be held on this issue where the question shall 
be whether electors favour replacing the present system with 
a system proposed by the committee as concurred in by the 
House; and (<I>c</I>) the referendum may be held either before or 
at the same time as the next general election. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to move a motion that would 
take a look at changing the voting system in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we looked at the turnout in the last federal election 
campaign, we would see that only 61% of the Canadian people 
voted.  It was an historic low.  I was also surprised to see that 
only 67% of the people voted in 1997.  I think that was also 
lower than we had ever seen before.  During most previous 
elections we have had 75% to 80% of the people participating at 
the polls.  I think the declining turnout reflects the growing 
alienation people have toward politics in general and the voting 
system in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put a motion before the House that asks the House of Commons 
to consider the possibility of striking an all party committee 
that would look at the various models of proportional 
representation that could be mixed into our constituency member 
system and have a measure of PR in the system itself. 
Unfortunately the motion is not votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall I had the same motion before the House.  We had two 
hours of debate at that time.  Just before the third hour of 
debate was to take place and a vote was to follow, the Prime 
Minister called an election.  That vote would have been the first 
time the House of Commons had voted on proportional 
representation since 1923. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of PR in our system is one that is not very popular for 
incumbent politicians.  All of us were elected through the first 
past the post electoral system.  We were elected through a system 
where members who get the most votes in their riding get to 
become members of parliament.  Some of us get here with well over 
50% of the votes.  Roughly half of the people get here with fewer 
than 50% of the votes.  In most parliaments we have members 
elected with about a third of the votes, anywhere from 32% to 
35%.  At least half of us do not represent the majority of our 
constituents.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most other countries in the world have a different kind of 
electoral system whereby the number of seats in the assembly, the 
house of commons or the parliament reflects the number of votes 
in the country, state or province.  In fact we are one of only 
three countries in the democratic world with a population of more 
than eight million people that use the pure, first past the post 
system.  The other countries are the United States and India. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in Britain, the mother of parliaments, under the Blair 
government there has been a change where there is a blend of PR, 
in the election of the Scottish members of parliament in the 
Scottish parliament, in the Welsh parliament, and in Northern 
Ireland.  In fact, all members elected to the European community 
parliament in Strasbourg from Great Britain are elected by 
proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Jenkins commission, in the election after 
next—there is a campaign going on in Britain right now—there 
will probably be a mix of PR in the Westminster parliament 
itself.  The Blair government has committed to a referendum on 
whether it should bring some PR into the British parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the countries that have left the first past the post 
system and have gone to a system of proportional representation 
have brought in a measure of proportional representation.  Some 
of them, like France, use what I call the majoritarian system. In 
France, a member must have 50% of the vote to be elected. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In France, a candidate must have 50% of the vote or more to be 
elected to the National Assembly. The French president must have 
50% of the vote to be elected. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have the two tours, the two different votes, one on a 
Sunday and a second on the next Sunday.  If a candidate does not 
have 50% of the vote in the first selection, the two top 
candidates run off.  Most countries that do not have the first 
past the post system do have a measure of PR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under our present system we have tremendous distortions.  Today 
we have a majority government elected with 41% of the votes and 
holding roughly 60% of the seats.  It has a constitutional right 
to govern for some five years with all the powers that a 
government has under our constitution today.  In the last 
parliament the government had a majority with only 38% of the 
people supporting it, one of the lowest support levels of any 
majority government in the history of the country.  Sixty-two per 
cent of the people voted for the opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the history of our country in terms of the 
parliaments, we find that since about 1921 or 1923 we have had 
only three majority governments elected by the majority of the 
people:  Diefenbaker in 1958 and Mackenzie King twice during his 
long tenure as prime minister.  Brian Mulroney in 1988 came very 
close with 49.9% of the vote or thereabouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are electing in this country what are called fake majorities, 
whereby a majority is elected by a minority of the people.  When 
we also factor in the turnout at elections, the last one being 
61%, we find that only about 25% of the electorate actually voted 
for the governing party.  That was with a voters' list which was 
not an enumerated list.  Roughly one million people were left off 
the electoral rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, we elect a parliament that does not reflect how 
the Canadian people actually vote or how the Canadian people 
actually feel.  This also happens among the opposition parties. 
When I came back here in 1997 after being away for four years, I 
found that not only did the government get 38% of the votes, the 
Reform Party had 19% and the Conservative Party had 19%.  Reform 
had 60 seats and the Conservative Party had 20.  The Bloc 
Quebecois had 11% of the vote and our party had 11% of the vote. 
There are 21 New Democrat MPs and 44 members of the Bloc 
Quebecois.  We have these distortions right across the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking across the way, one would think that every single person 
in Ontario voted Liberal.  The Liberals had 99 of 101 seats, I 
believe, in the last parliament.  In this parliament the Liberals 
again have all but two seats in Ontario, with 101 or 103, despite 
the fact that in 1997 the majority of Ontarians actually voted 
for the NDP, the Conservatives and Reform, and despite the fact 
that last November once again almost half of Ontarians voted for 
the opposition parties.  There are great distortions. 
It is the same thing in the west.  Historically in the vote in 
the west the Liberal party is under-represented.  We have all 
these distortions right across the piece.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing sense of alienation that our country is not 
as democratic as it should be.  If we were to bring in a measure 
of proportional representation it would be a way of making sure 
that nobody's vote is wasted.  Every single vote would count in 
the composition of the House of Commons.  It would empower people 
to make sure that their votes would count not just on election 
night but during the whole four year period that the House of 
Commons is in session.  That is why I put the motion before the 
House today that we look at the various methods of PR that might 
be brought into fact in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are different methods of PR.  In Israel there is basically 
one constituency for the whole country.  People vote for a list 
and it is divided up on a proportional basis after the vote.  I 
do not think that is appropriate for our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Germany there is what is called mixed member proportional, 
where half the German members are elected riding by riding like 
we do it in this country and the other half in accordance with 
proportional representation.  There are two ballots.  Germans 
first vote for their local member of parliament and then for 
their party of preference to govern the state of Germany.  It is 
the proportion of the list votes, of the proportional votes, that 
determines the number of members of parliament in their house of 
commons.  If one party receives 30% of the vote and less than 
that percentage in terms of the elections for their own local 
members of parliament, they are compensated for that from the 
members elected by the PR system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is probably the more appropriate system to look at 
if we are to have a measure of PR in Canada.  In our country I 
believe it should be done on a province by province basis.  It is 
important that Quebecers elect Quebecers in terms of proportional 
representation and that Ontarians elect Ontarians.  It can be 
done in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, British Columbia and across the 
piece.  I think we could devise a unique Canadian system that 
would be reflective of the country and good for the country as a 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Germany, half the members of parliament are elected by 
ridings and half by the proportional or list system.  In our 
country we can look at what is best for us.  We could have a 
50:50 system.  We could have any number from 15% to 40% elected 
by the list and others elected riding by riding.  We could look 
at any kind of combination that might be good for and relevant to 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main thing to note is that Canadians are feeling so 
alienated by our political system.  They feel that their votes do 
not count, that their votes are wasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we did have a measure of PR in this country we would have 
radically different voting patterns as well.  I have now been in 
10 election campaigns of my own.  As we have campaigned 
throughout Canada, how often have we heard stories of people 
voting strategically?  They say they would vote for our party if 
it could win.  They say they would vote for our party in a 
particular riding but we could not win the particular riding.  Or 
they say they do not like such and such a party so they are 
voting for another party to stop party A.  In fact, I know 
someone who is a member of a certain party who has not voted for 
that party for 25 years because he is always voting for another 
party he does not like.  If we had a system of proportional 
representation, he would be voting for his first choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians now vote for what they call the lesser of two 
evils.  In terms of the way we try to strategize the impact of 
our votes on the electoral system, when we vote for the lesser of 
two evils we are still getting evil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With PR we vote our preference.  With PR our votes are reflected 
in the House of Commons.  As I said, every country in the world 
with more than 8 million people, except for three, has abandoned 
the first past the post system as being unfair and unjust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People feel their votes are wasted.  Most people vote for losing 
candidates.  People feel their votes do not count. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They're not voting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  They are not voting.  They are turned 
off in droves.  That is very worrisome in terms of a dynamic 
political and parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is just one of the democratic reforms we will need 
if we are to make this place more relevant for the Canadian 
people.  Parliament itself has to be reformed.  The Prime 
Minister's Office has far too much power.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's Office can appoint not only all the cabinet 
members and all the senators but the head of every important 
public agency in the country, including the judges in the supreme 
court, the head of the military, the head of the police, the head 
of state in our country and the head of state's representatives 
in each of the provinces, the lieutenant-governors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a majority government here, almost dictatorial 
powers rest in the hands of the Prime Minister of Canada.  Surely 
the time has come to reform the system, to make it more open, 
accountable and democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just had a vote in the House a few minutes ago.  We have 
votes in the House every week.  Government bills are never 
defeated.  Members cannot tell me that in the last 40 or 50 years 
every government bill has been the right one or the proper one 
for the country.  We have a system of confidence votes whereby 
members of parliament cannot vote their conscience or for the 
wishes of their constituents or for what they think is best for 
the country without voting non-confidence in the government of 
the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to change those rules.  The only votes that should be 
confidence votes in the House of Commons are budget bills, the 
throne speech or anything else that might be designated 
confidence by the government itself.  Everything else should be a 
vote in which members have the freedom to vote how their 
constituents feel.  In other words, the confidence vote should 
not be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the most handcuffed political and parliamentary system 
in the world.  In Britain even popular governments such as the 
Blair government have lost several bills in the house of commons. 
Margaret Thatcher, a very strong and popular prime minister at 
one time, lost several votes in the house of commons when she was 
the leader of a majority government.  In this country it does not 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the kinds of changes we have to make.  We need 
stronger parliamentary committees and more independence.  The 
Speaker of the House of Commons is elected through a secret, 
independent vote where the whips are not applied, but the chairs 
of committees are not elected secretly.  They are technically 
elected but are appointed by the government itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of reforms we need to make this place more 
relevant.  We need parliamentary reform, but we also need 
electoral and voting reform so that when people go to the polls 
they can vote for their first preference and when the votes are 
counted on election night the composition of the parliament would 
reflect how the Canadian people voted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that my motion today asks for an all 
party committee to study the various kinds of proportional 
representation that might be incorporated into our electoral 
system.  It also calls on that committee to report to parliament. 
If parliament adopts the motion, it calls on parliament to put 
the preferred model of PR to a referendum, whereby people can 
choose between the model of PR recommended by parliament and the 
status quo, the first past the post system.  If the people decide 
to change the voting system, we would have a system that I think 
the people of this country would feel is more inclusive and equal 
for each and every Canadian. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, for all the failings of the first past the post 
electoral system, and they are considerable, there is 
nevertheless a very powerful interest group that has a strong 
incentive to keep that system in place.  That interest group is 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All 301 members of parliament are here because the first past 
the post system put us here.  It may be that we will be able, 
through the efforts of high-minded members such as the hon. 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle and others like him, to temporarily 
build a majority within the House that is brave enough or 
self-sacrificing enough to abandon the status quo for a future 
that would return only some of us to this place, but it will be 
an uphill battle.  If we engage in uphill battles, we have to 
make sure that as many factors as possible are on our side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I want to make a specific proposal, not a proposal for a 
specific electoral system to replace first past the post.  I do 
not want to endorse the multi-member proportional system or the 
alternative ballot or multiple member districts or any of the 
other versions of proportional representation that have been put 
forward in the past.  Each of these has its own unique merits. 
Each has some demerits as well.  Most significantly, each system 
has a reasonably predictable impact on how each of the existing 
parties would perform in a future election if the vote 
distribution were to be the same as it was in last November's 
general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we try as a group to select a system in advance I can 
guarantee that the system will be reviewed and analyzed by each 
person and each party with one question foremost in mind:  how 
will this help me or how will this hurt me?  If any part of the 
tenuous coalition that we are today beginning to build decides 
that partisan or personal considerations outweigh the merits of 
the specific system being proposed, that in itself will likely 
prove sufficient to kill the proposal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am proposing that we engage as parliamentarians in a 
three stage process to bring about the successful implementation 
of genuine electoral reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we need to build a coalition of parliamentarians, 
intellectuals and journalists behind the idea that first past the 
post is not acceptable in a mature democracy and that some kind 
of electoral reform is needed.  This process is already partly 
under way.  Electoral reform has a prominent place in the 
Canadian Alliance statement of policies and principles, which 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To improve the representative nature of our electoral system, we 
will consider electoral reforms, including proportional 
representation, the single transferable ballot, electronic 
voting, and fixed election dates, and will submit such options to 
voters in a nationwide referendum. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, and here I am merely repeating my party's proposal on 
the matter, we need to establish a process by which Canadians can 
vote directly on the question of electoral reform.  However I do 
not favour a single referendum.  That would involve putting a 
single model of electoral reform on the ballot and letting voters 
choose between it and the status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead I recommend a referendum to authorize the striking of a 
commission and the holding of a second referendum on the findings 
of the commission.  The commission could contain members of all 
parties or it could contain experts and individuals of undoubted 
integrity and impartiality.  Its mandate would be to select three 
or perhaps four alternative models which could be presented to 
the Canadian electorate in a second referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third stage of the process would be the holding of the 
second referendum that had been mandated by the first.  In the 
second referendum the electorate would be presented with a 
preferential ballot on which each voter would rank the proposed 
models in order of preference.  If one model had the support of a 
majority of voters on the first count of the ballots, it would 
become the new electoral system of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If no model were chosen on the first count, the least preferred 
model would be removed from the table and all ballots in which it 
had been the preferred model would be recounted and redistributed 
according to the second preferences on those ballots.  This 
process would continue until one model had obtained at least half 
the total votes cast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a process would ensure a consensus result.  The system 
finally chosen might not be the ideal preference of most voters, 
but it would at least be a system which very few people had found 
to be their least favourite choice or totally unsuitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be on the safe side, the existing first past the post system 
should be one of the alternatives that voters could select on 
their preferential ballots.  This would ensure that even if the 
commission had done its job poorly and selected a range of 
entirely unacceptable options, the worst that could happen would 
be a return to the status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a process would produce a majority in favour of change. 
What would the new electoral process look like in the end? 
Frankly I do not know.  That is the whole point.  I can support 
the process.  The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle can support it, 
as can members on all sides of the House as long as each of us is 
confident in the wisdom of the people and hopeful that the system 
we prefer will at some future date get a fair hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the great philosophers of the past century, John Rawls, 
wrote in his book, <I>A Theory of Justice</I>, of the 
impossibility of achieving consensus on moving forward to a just 
society as long as participants in the process know who the 
winners and losers will be.  He proposed a thought experiment in 
which each person's existing position within society was hidden 
from view behind what Rawls referred to as a veil of ignorance. 
In such a situation all would endorse a new and more just state 
in an improved society because everybody would have a greater 
possibility of being a net winner than of being a net loser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we hope to succeed at changing our system of electing 
representatives to this place, we need to emulate Rawls' model. 
We need to place the final outcome behind the Rawlsian veil and 
move forward, certain only of the fact that what will be produced 
in the end will be better and more beneficial for the country 
than what we have today.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK243">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are justly proud that their country has one of the most 
stable and democratic political systems in the world.  It is a 
model for many countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has not happened on its own.  Rather, it is the result of 
the commitment of Canadians from every region to ensuring that 
all citizens can express opinions on important issues and cast 
votes for the candidate of their choice.  To translate this 
commitment into reality we have developed an electoral system 
which provides the flexibility needed to keep up with changes in 
our very dynamic country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, even the best system has its critics.  It is natural 
that from time to time people and groups will come forward with 
suggestions for improving our system.  Today's private member's 
motion, with its call for the introduction of a new electoral 
system based on proportional representation, is a good example of 
this.  The Green Party of Canada has also brought a challenge 
before the courts to look into the same issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, I will take a few minutes to discuss some aspects of 
the motion.  I will discuss how it might impact on Canadians and 
why it arguably represents a risky gamble which might not be 
warranted under present circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, it is important to note that proportional 
representation is not a new idea.  It has been tried in various 
forms in a number of countries over the years with varying 
degrees of success.  It is currently used in one form or another 
in a number of countries, most notably France, Germany, Israel, 
Ireland and New Zealand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While all these systems fall under the heading of proportional 
representation, they vary enormously and use very different 
approaches.  Some use a two ballot runoff system where marginal 
candidates are eliminated in the first round of voting.  Others 
have true proportional representation systems where the entire 
country is treated as one constituency and members are selected 
from party lists based on the percentage of the popular vote 
received by the parties.  Others have mixed systems where some 
members are chosen on the basis of first past the post contests 
while others are chosen from party lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a complex situation involving many different 
alternatives, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. 
While proponents of the system claim it leads to better 
representation, particularly of minorities and regions, and that 
it encourages higher voter turnout, the experience of those using 
proportional representation suggests there can be negative 
impacts as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, proportional representation can lead to more 
minority governments.  It can make governing more difficult, 
increase political instability and force parties to engage in 
lengthy political deal making to cobble together coalitions with 
very different interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, small one issue parties can sometimes find itself in 
the position of king maker which may allow it to force its own 
agenda on the nation as a whole.  Proportional representation 
also sometimes gives a voice to extremist groups which would have 
been shut out in the normal course under a first past the post 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some countries have found that proportional representation can 
exacerbate regional differences and cleavages within a society 
and make it more difficult to reach national consensus on 
important issues.  That could be particularly true of Canada 
where there exist and have always existed huge differences 
regionally, culturally, linguistically and religiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, some countries have found that the use of party lists 
in selecting members of legislatures can strengthen the power of 
the unelected party insiders responsible for deciding who will be 
on the lists and in what order of precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada a proportional representation system could involve a 
change to the provisions in our constitution which require that 
provinces be proportionally represented in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the strengths of our current electoral system is that 
Canadians are represented at the constituency level by a specific 
member of parliament.  This provides a specific point of contact 
for Canadians at the constituency level. 
In other words, our current system ensures that members of 
parliament must be in ongoing contact with specific groups of 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, this is a difficult and complex issue where caution 
might be urged.  Because of this and the fact that the issue is 
currently before Canadian courts in a constitutional challenge, 
it is my view that it would be unwise to go forward with the 
proposal shown in the private member's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime however, this is not to say that no action 
should be taken.  There are always many things that can be done 
now and in the future to improve the functioning of our existing 
electoral system.  This was demonstrated recently by the passage 
in the House of a new elections act.  As well, the chief 
elections officer will lay his report on suggested amendments to 
the Canada Elections Act before parliament this fall, and a 
committee will study and discuss these recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I commend the very experienced member moving the 
motion for his demonstrated and continuing commitment to 
improving Canada's electoral system.  It is a commitment I hope 
that is shared by all members in the House and by the government. 
I urge him and other members to work within the House as we all 
seek new ways of ensuring that our electoral system can continue 
to do the best possible job of serving Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to take part in the debate on Motion 
No. 21, presented by the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, which reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should work 
towards incorporating a measure of proportional representation in 
the federal electoral system, making use of a framework which 
includes: (<I>a</I>) a report on proportional representation prepared 
by an all-party committee after extensive public hearings; (<I>b</I>) 
a referendum to be held on this issue where the question shall be 
whether electors favour replacing the present system with a 
system proposed by the committee as concurred in by the House; 
and (<I>c</I>) the referendum may be held either before or at the same 
time as the next general election. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will have occasion a little later to come back to each of the 
points of this motion, but first, we must, as the 
parliamentary secretary to the government House leader has said, 
acknowledge the dedicated continuing commitment and consistency 
of the ideas of our colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle. For a 
number of years, he has regularly raised in the House the need to 
reform the Canadian electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we reform it?  For a number of reasons.  First, 
intrinsically speaking, our first past the post system has a 
number of advantages to it.  The advantage for voters is they can 
identify directly with the person they elect, to get any 
jurisdictional problem that may arise dealt with by the elected 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system has a number of minor anomalies as well.  It can lead 
to certain distortions, to certain problems that may be due to 
the fact that the candidate elected is the one receiving the most 
votes. 
This is not, however, an absolute majority.  Very often an MP 
can get elected with, who knows, 38%, 40% or 42% of the votes. 
Thus the majority of the people in the riding will have voted for 
a candidate other than the person who will be representing them 
in parliament for four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the intrinsic nature of our political system, our 
electoral system, there are certain things that have to be 
acknowledged. On many occasions during the various debates in 
this House, particularly those involving the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle and the hon. member for Halifax, when I have 
had the opportunity to speak to this matter, I have stressed the 
point that, despite the efforts of the election officials and by the 
chief electoral officer to make voting more accessible, we are 
forced to conclude to our great surprise, and I must add that 
this is cause for concern, that voting is on a downward spiral. 
There is a downward trend.  Fewer and fewer people seem 
interested in public affairs and the electoral process.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This must be of concern to us, because in a democracy, 
regardless of our efforts to make voting more accessible, fewer 
and fewer people are exercising their right to vote.  This has to 
be a cause of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, there are most certainly grounds for a parliamentary 
committee to address the matter. 
In the coming months, following the tabling of the chief 
electoral officer's report dealing with the last election and 
containing his recommendations, we will have the opportunity to 
consider the advisability of reforming our electoral system 
to better meet the expectations of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time, I hope the government will be more willing to make 
in depth changes to our electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now go back to the motion put forward by the hon. member 
for Regina—Qu'Appelle. The motion specifically refers to a 
system of proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance, the motion seems to be somewhat restrictive. 
The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle himself talked earlier about 
implementing a two vote electoral system, which would ensure that 
any candidate who is elected in a riding got the majority of the 
vote. However that does not seem to be one of his major concerns, at 
least from what we see in the motion now before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That might somewhat limit the scope of any debate we could have 
on the reform of the Canadian electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I find the suggestion to set up an all party 
committee to consider the issue quite attractive. However we 
already have the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs that would normally deal with such an issue. 
Perhaps we could then go through the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs or a special committee struck for the 
occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now wish to pass reforms following a referendum, during which 
electors, citizens of Canada and of Quebec would be asked to 
vote on the model defined by the committee charged with examining 
the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the Canadian Alliance member made it clear that we 
would also have to reflect on the referendum process used to 
approve the model proposed by the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, I find that the framework given us here is, in 
essence, relatively limiting because the desire seems to be to 
propose only the model which would be defined by the committee 
charged with examining this matter.  We presume right off the bat 
that the model proposed would be proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I wish to address one final point.  The referendum 
in question should take place before or at the same time as the 
next general election.  We obviously have no objection whatsoever 
to this last recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us return briefly to the issue of the referendum.  One of 
the concerns we should have as members of this federal parliament 
is to recognize the federal nature of this country, a federation 
composed of very different provinces. Therefore, in the event 
that we go ahead with a system of proportional representation, we 
must ensure that we take this federal nature of Canada into 
account, both in the results of the referendum and in the 
implementation of a proportional system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion, which refers to a proportional system, has already 
been debated in the House, at which time the member for Laval 
Centre laid out the position of our party most eloquently. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1835"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT98"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT98"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1835

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said at the time that, because of the current system's 
limits and despite its benefits, the introduction of a proportional 
component could ensure better representation for minority 
groups, as I always say when we debate this issue, which would be 
an improvement over the present situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking about groups such as cultural communities, the 
disabled, women and also young people, who are underrepresented 
in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a system would also better reflect the various ideologies 
found in our society, which are not well represented here. 
Indeed, people who vote for small parties often have the 
impression that their vote is lost because is it very unlikely 
that a candidate for a small party will be elected to 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of a proportional component would give small 
parties the opportunity to be represented in parliament, so 
democracy in general could benefit from their input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, this may prevent the distortions inevitably 
brought about by the current system where, for example, with only 
38% or 40% of the votes, a government, and specifically a Prime 
Minister holds in his hands 100% of the power over a certain 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could also further greater co-operation between the various 
political parties represented in parliament and prevent that 
system enhancing confrontation and antagonism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Or course, we have to recognize that, despite all that, a pure 
proportional representation system or one with a proportional 
representation component has some drawbacks, notably the 
political instability associated with pure proportional 
representation systems and also the creation of two classes of 
members in a system with a proportional representation component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, I would say that the motion before us is 
very interesting. It has some limits, and it is unfortunate that 
we do not have the opportunity to vote on the motion to follow up 
on the very commendable intentions that we have heard today 
in the House.

referendum to be held on this issue where the question shall be

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I commend the member for this.  It is very insightful.  I 
know the member spent a lot of time on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, the other day we were stranded together at the 
Ottawa airport heading east to Atlantic Canada.  With the way the 
air service was to that part of the country, we were both delayed 
by six or eight hours.  However the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle 
was on his way to Prince Edward Island to speak to students at 
the University of P.E.I. on this very subject.  Although he was 
late and did not arrive until something like 10 o'clock at night, 
they waited for him.  He gave his speech and had a number of 
interviews with the P.E.I. press on this very topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I mention that is I was able to pull something off 
the Internet today regarding P.E.I., what it is doing and how it 
is responding to some of these new ideas floating around on 
proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The headline reads that P.E.I. is now investigating proportional 
representation.  It states that Prince Edward Island's chief 
electoral officer says he hopes to have some options on 
proportional representation ready later this year.  It speaks of 
a legislative committee on the elections act which has tabled a 
report in the legislature. Therefore P.E.I. is looking at the 
situation and how it can be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I point out is that in P.E.I. the ruling party 
is the PC Party.  I guess I should not be the one arguing with 
the success of the Conservative Party in P.E.I.  However the fact 
is it has 96% of the seats, and received about 58% of the vote in 
the last election.  The Liberal Party and the NDP received about 
42% of the vote between them, but only one opposition seat in the 
P.E.I. legislature.  I think that points out quite effectively 
the problem with our system as it now exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only have to look at my home province of New Brunswick.  In 
1987 Premier McKenna won every single seat in New Brunswick.  He 
won 57 out of 57 seats, yet received less than 60% of the vote. 
The Conservative Party at the time received somewhere in the area 
of 40% of the vote, but did not elect one single member to the 
New Brunswick legislature.  If we asked Frank McKenna what one of 
his biggest handicaps was as a premier, it was the fact that he 
held all the seats.  How does one practise democracy in a forum 
where one holds all the cards? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out how our party has suffered under that system. 
Let us go back to the election of 1993.   Of course, Mr. Speaker, 
as you well know, I was part of the class of '88 as were you. 
The only difference was, you won your election and I did not. 
The Conservative Party went from the party of power to having two 
seats on the opposition side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  At least you had gender parity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Incidentally, the member has so much 
information that he wants to throw out that he can hardly resist. 
However I hope I touch on some of the things that we spoke about 
privately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Conservative Party had approximately the same number 
of votes as the Bloc.  The Bloc sent 54 members to the House of 
Commons with the same number of votes that sent only two 
Conservative members in all Canada to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 election is another example of how the system has to be 
fixed, changed or modified in some fashion.  The then Reform 
Party had within 100,000 votes, the same number of votes the 
Conservative Party had. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1845"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT100"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1845
<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet in 1997, if memory serves me correctly, the Reform Party 
sent approximately 60 members to the House of Commons and the 
Conservative Party sent only 20.  Although we received 
approximately the same number of votes within 100,000 or so, the 
Reform Party had 40 more seats in the House of Commons.  So on 
the story goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at British Columbia.  In its recent election 
of a week or so ago the NDP sent three members to the 
legislature.  The governing Liberals who won the election had 
approximately 56% of the vote but again some 90% of the seats. 
The system in some ways is patently unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not to be unkind to the Liberal Party and the government of the 
day, the truth is there are many members on that side of the 
House and on this side of the House, to be fair, who are sitting 
here with far less than 50% of the vote.  In the last parliament 
nationally the Liberal Party received about 39% of the vote and 
formed the government.  Clearly over 60% of Canadians voted 
against the very party that formed the government.  It simply 
means that the system has to be examined and changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at many examples around the world where the system 
has been changed and is working quite well.  The problem in 
Canada is that once a party forms the government there is 
reluctance on the part of that prime minister and the government 
to change the system.  Why would they change a system that is 
working in their favour?  Hence the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cited the case in P.E.I., of which the hon. member for 
Regina-Qu'Appelle is quite aware.  It has gone through successive 
elections where this has happened and now the Conservatives are 
the beneficiaries of a system which hurt them in two previous 
elections.  This flip-flopping back and forth in some sense hurts 
all of us because it basically destroys what democracy is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the member's initiative.  It is thought provoking. 
This is a place where new ideas have to be brought in, where new 
ideas have to be encouraged.  We have to examine better ways of 
doing things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot speak for the Prime Minister, but the downside of the 
motion is that I do not expect the Prime Minister will want his 
caucus to support it or his party to support it.  The truth is 
that they are in power and I guess the intent of the game 
politics is to ensure that they continue to keep power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion we support the member.  We support the initiative. 
I look forward to debating the issue and fleshing out the details 
as we go along. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in a sense the debate points to the weaknesses of our 
system in regard to private members' bills and motions.  It 
underlines very clearly that the system needs a basic reform 
because of the anomaly of finding today that we are debating a 
motion which is not votable and will die in a few minutes when 
before the election the same motion was deemed votable by another 
committee and was debated fully until acceptance or rejection. 
Perhaps we should reflect upon why the same motion is votable one 
day and non-votable today.

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of reservations about strict proportional 
representation because of the instability it has caused in so 
many countries where it has been tried as a pure system.  I also 
have reservations about a referendum that would decide on a 
question with either a yea or nay without a huge amount of study 
as to what is the best system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle for bringing 
the motion before us.  I wish it was votable because I believe 
these fundamental questions should be debated and studied by us. 
I believe that for us to say our present system is the best of 
them all without looking at all the others and finding out what 
improvements can be made is short term.  We should not close our 
eyes to possible improvements that could make our democratic 
process far more effective and far better for Canadians at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members before me have quoted obvious examples.  In the last 
B.C. election three New Democrats were elected but no Green Party 
members were elected in spite of having gathered 12% of the vote. 
B.C. now has a government with all the seats except three.  This 
obviously will create problems because a government cannot govern 
without an effective opposition to put pressure on it to perform 
over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the example of New Brunswick and of our own party. 
Although I rejoice in that, when I look at it objectively and 
fairly I have to admit that it was a quirk of history which gave 
us most of the seats in the province even though we did not get a 
majority percentage of the votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at what the Australians have done and admire them for 
their grit, daring and courage in having looked at different 
systems.  They have realized that first past the post is not the 
perfect system.  They have devised a system where the person who 
wins truly wins an overall majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at various European nations that have tried different 
systems and have decided that pure proportional representation 
does not quite work but have adopted a mixed system of runoffs 
and different types of proportional representation systems. Today 
certain countries in Europe, such as Germany, Finland and France 
are showing very stable democracies and all have various segments 
of their populations duly represented by elected representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the motion had been made votable because I would have 
voted for it.  I believe we must study these questions.  During 
this quiet debate I felt there was a consensus or a feeling among 
us that nobody had the perfect answer but that everybody wanted 
to seek out a way to make democracy fairer and more workable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle.  I invite him 
to bring his motion back to the House but to perhaps leave out 
the referendum and strict proportional representation.  Perhaps 
he could look at fixed term elections every four years.  I wish 
he would bring it back because I for one would love to vote on it 
and have the matter studied further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to follow two 
themes in conclusion.  First, I thank the member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis for his remarks.  I had exactly the same motion 
before the House last fall and it had been deemed votable.  We 
had two hours of debate and were about to have a third hour when 
the Prime Minister called the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the election there has been growing popularity in looking 
at the idea of PR.  A court case has been launched by the Green 
Party and it is now before the courts.  However, all of a sudden 
the private members' committee decided not to make the motion 
votable even though it is exactly the same motion as the one I 
introduced last fall.  This motion too will die in about four 
minutes time. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1855"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT102"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT102"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1855

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the House to look at the idea behind this.  All the 
motion is asking is that we strike an all party committee to look 
at the various models of proportional representation or various 
measures that could be mixed into our system.  It does not call 
for a pure system of PR but leaves it very wide open.  This all 
party committee could hold public hearings to look at improving 
our electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the process, if we agree in parliament, we would 
go to the Canadian people in a referendum with our 
recommendations and the status quo so that they could choose 
between the two.  The people would be sovereign and would choose 
want they want to do, as they did in New Zealand a few years ago. 
That is all the motion calls for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we could look at new ideas.  It is a radical new idea in 
the country but we as parliamentarians should be looking at new 
ideas and new ways to do things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a national organization called Fair Vote Canada which 
is trying to organize across the country a push on voting reform 
and proportional representation.  It is not trying to push a 
particular model but a principle of having a system where the 
people's votes are accurately reflected in the House of Commons 
so that we do not get the great distortions we have had over the 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I want to say is that we may have some initiative 
on the provincial level.  I was in Prince Edward Island three 
weeks ago, as the member for Fredericton said, and I met with 
Premier Binns.  I wish to commend him publicly.  They are looking 
now at bringing in a blend of PR in Prince Edward Island.  A 
legislative committee there recommended some options.  The chief 
electoral officer of Prince Edward Island is saying that he hopes 
to have some options for proportional representation ready later 
this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last four election campaigns in Prince Edward Island 
resulted in very lopsided parliaments.  In three of those four 
elections there were only one or two members of the opposition. 
Today there is only one member despite the fact that 42% of the 
people voted for the opposition parties.  I was there for their 
question period.  There was one Liberal member in opposition to 
the leader asking question after question for over half an hour. 
That kind of system does not function properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Binns has made Canadian history by being the first 
premier in the first province, just like it was a cradle of 
Confederation, to bring in a blend of PR.  My conversation with 
the premier has led me to believe that he is very sincere about 
putting the question to the people of Prince Edward Island in a 
referendum as to whether they want to try a blend of proportional 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have so many distortions.  In the last provincial election in 
Quebec, Jean Charest and the Liberals got more votes than Lucien 
Bouchard and the Parti Quebecois, yet Bouchard formed a majority 
government.  In my own province of Saskatchewan, Roy Romanow of 
my party got 38% of the vote and the opposition Saskatchewan 
Party got 39% of the vote, yet Mr. Romanow formed a majority 
government.  In British Columbia five years ago, to show I am not 
partisan because it is not a partisan issue, the provincial NDP 
led by Glen Clark got fewer votes than the opposition Liberals, 
yet Glen Clark formed a majority government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on about these great distortions but the time 
has arrived for us to do something about them.  I will keep on 
pursuing this matter.  All I am saying is that we should set up 
an all party committee to look at the various models that might 
be relevant to our country and to design in the end a unique 
Canadian model that would be good for Canada, that would be more 
inclusive, empowering, democratic and accountable.  Part of that 
model, I say to my friend across the way, is a fixed election 
date.  I believe in that and I always have.  We need 
parliamentary reform to make our country more democratic, more 
inclusive and more accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate has now died.  I appeal to all members on all sides 
of the House, because of the alienation people toward the 
political process, to consider in the future an all party 
committee to look at the important area of voting reform.  I 
thank members for their participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time provided for the 
consideration of private members' business has now expired.  As 
the motion has not been designated a votable item, the order is

contract awarded to it by the Government of Canada.  I have some 
concerns which I have put to the Minister of Public Works and

occasions in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many unanswered questions on this file.  For the 
benefit of the interested Canadians who are watching tonight, I 
am referring to the selling of surplus military equipment, spare 
parts, under a contract awarded to Lancaster Aviation.  It won 
that contract under competition.  It was a tendered contract. It 
went from selling spare parts to selling Challenger aircraft. In 
addition it sold 40 Huey helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could it go from selling spare parts to selling helicopters 
and Challenger jets?  We are not talking about nickel and dime 
items.  We are talking about assets worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars.  When we examine the sale of the Challenger aircraft, by 
all accounts they were sold for less than 50% of their value. How 
could that be allowed to happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same situation with the helicopters.  There have been 
allegations of kickbacks within the department in terms of how 
the contract was let and how Lancaster Aviation was allowed 
without tender to sell these aircraft.  Where did the aircraft 
end up?  To whom do they now belong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Government of Canada at last count had about 
$100 million in surplus inventory that left the plant owned by 
Lancaster Aviation in Milton, Ontario, only to wind up in 
Florida.  Those parts are now in a warehouse owned by a convicted 
felon who owns a company by the name of Airspares Incorporated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not making this up as I go along.  I can quote from a story 
in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> of May 4 of this year talking about 
Mr. McFliker, the man who owns Airspares.  He is now awaiting 
sentencing on drug trafficking, international transportation of 
women for prostitution and money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What recourse do we have to that military equipment now sitting 
in a warehouse in Florida owned by a convicted felon?  That is 
the bottom line.  Why was that equipment allowed to leave Canada? 
Once the individual is sentenced, will we be able to get the 
equipment back? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is watching this man?  Why would something like this be 
allowed to happen in Canada?  Where is due process?  How was a 
convicted felon allowed to get into a contractual agreement with 
a Canadian company, putting Canadian assets at risk?  With that I 
rest my case.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to respond.  Lancaster Aviation won competitive contracts 
in 1997 and again in 2000 for the disposal of surplus aerospace 
assets, not simply spare parts as the member alleges. Allegations 
that the contract to dispose of the Twin Huey helicopters and 
Challenger aircraft were sole sourced are also false.  They were 
competitively bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 RPF also contemplated special project sales such as 
planes.  When such a need arises the process calls for an 
amendment to the contract to legally bind the parties.  That is 
exactly what we did with the sale of the helicopters and the 
Challenger aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Lancaster Aviation the government sold eight Challenger 
aircraft to DDH Aviation of Fort Worth, Texas, for approximately 
$30 million.  The sale was a result of a competitive tender 
issued by Lancaster Aviation.  These aircraft did not have civil 
certification.  Nor were they outfitted for executive use.  As 
such they were in need of extensive modifications.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the assets being warehoused in Florida, I reiterate once 
again that Lancaster Aviation is using and renting that facility 
in Florida strictly for warehousing purposes.  Lancaster Aviation 
is solely responsible for marketing the sale of assets.  The 
assets are in Florida because that is where the market is and 
that is where the sales are taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DND assets are not in danger as the member alleges.  The 
assets are the property of the Department of National Defence and 
are only in the custody of a contractor.  Lancaster Aviation is 
responsible for the safekeeping of the assets and is liable for 
any losses.  No parties other than the crown have any rights to 
those assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that shows the assets are not at risk.  Even though 
there may be allegations against somebody out there, our assets 
are not in danger.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
issue is with the Minister of Human Resources Development.  We 
were discussing the summer career placement program.  This year 
the minister changed the rules of hiring under the program as it 
relates to municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until this year all non-profit sector groups could take on 
students for the summer and it would not cost them anything.  The 
private sector would pay 50% of the wages.  Municipalities would 
pay the benefits, which would be a very small amount, but 
generally they received practically full funding to hire 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year for some reason the minister decided that 
municipalities would be lumped in the same category as the 
private sector.  They in turn would pay half the wages of the 
students who would be hired during the summer by the municipality 
or any agency directly connected with the municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked the minister why she did it, she basically said 
that it made sense because she could spread the money a lot 
further.  Instead of a municipality getting full funding for one 
student, it could hire two students because it was contributing 
half their wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sounds very laudable.  It would give more students the 
opportunity to receive employment for the summer.  However the 
minister is forgetting that many municipalities throughout the 
country are in no position at all to pay the cost of hiring 
anybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The smaller municipalities in particular have been subjected to 
downloading from the federal government to the provincial 
governments and eventually to the municipal governments, to the 
degree that many of them cannot afford to pay for the basic 
services they provide right now and are in deficit positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many small communities in rural Canada are trying to balance 
their budgets by cutting back on services such as picking up 
garbage and providing street lights.  Consequently they have no 
extra funding to hire students or anybody else, as I mentioned, 
during the summer or at any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that many municipalities are taken off the hiring 
list entirely.  It did not solve any problem.  It created a big 
one.  In many smaller communities the most responsible body, the 
best organized body, is the municipality.  Supervision and 
organization of programs are usually done better by 
municipalities than some of the other agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year in smaller communities in particular, and even in 
larger ones, other non-profit groups have to pick up the slack 
and hire the students.  Nobody wins.  The municipalities lose. 
That is why we ask the minister to change her mind, to allow the 
municipalities to hire students and to pay the full funding to 
them to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take great 
pleasure in answering the question asked by the member for St. 
John's West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summer career placement program is a program that provides 
wage subsidies to employers in the private, public and not for 
profit sectors to create career related summer jobs for students.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers gain by hiring high school, college or university 
students from 6 weeks to 16 weeks.  Students benefit by gaining 
career related summer work experience and by earning income to 
further their education and thereby prepare for future entry into 
the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister understands that some municipalities have raised 
concerns about changes to wage subsidy levels under this year's 
summer career placement program.  The SCP program is very popular 
and each year the total demand exceeds the total amount of funds 
available. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, in the riding of Laval West, which I represent in the 
House of Commons, this program will have helped over 300 students 
find gainful employment this summer. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the SCP program is so popular, the Government of Canada 
looked at new ways of allocating SCP funds to help even more 
students get summer jobs.  That is why the public sector SCP wage 
subsidy was changed to match the private sector SCP subsidy, 
which is up to 50% of the provincial minimum wage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be fair to all applicants, we are treating public sector 
employers the same as private sector employers.  The difference 
in wage subsidy to employers in the public sector could 
potentially result in up to 1,400 additional students gaining 
work experience through SCP this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall funding for the program will be at least the same as 
last year, that is $90 million, which is expected to help over 
50,000 young Canadians acquire work experience through the 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We encourage employers to hire summer students with or without 
subsidies.  All summer programs help to ensure that students gain 
valuable, much needed workplace experience.
