<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> moved that Bill C-369, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
(gaming and betting), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, on March 12, I spoke before the 
Sub-committee on Private Members' Business to introduce a 
private member's bill which would have made it possible to open 
casinos on cruise ships sailing on the St. Lawrence and the Great 
Lakes.
<P>
	This bill reflected, not some fantasy of the federal member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, but a need expressed after 
long consultations with port administrators, community 
organizations and municipalities along the St. Lawrence. A number 
of municipal councils have even gone so far as to pass resolutions 
in support of Bill C-369, not the least of these being Quebec City, 
Beauport, in my riding, Charlesbourg and Ancienne-Lorette. I also 
consulted with ship owners, organizations promoting navigation on 
the St. Lawrence, and tourist associations.
<P>
	As you are aware, a bill is not prepared without the help of 
consultants and legal experts. The latter have done the required 
research and helped me draft the bill which I am tabling in the 
House of Commons today. This undertaking was, therefore, a 
serious one, well prepared and necessary for all stakeholders.
<P>
	Yet, the Sub-committee on Private Members' Business, the 
majority of whose membership comes from the other side of the 
House, has not seen fit to accept Bill C-369 as votable by the 
representatives of the people, or in other words the members of this 
House.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, I would like to explain the advantages of this bill, 
if not to convince members opposite, then at least to let the public 
know about the sometimes mysterious ways in which the party in 
power operates.
<P>
	Bill C-369 would amend the Criminal Code in the section on 
gaming and betting to allow any person on an international cruise 
ship sailing in Canadian waters to conduct and manage a casino for 
the passengers of that ship, under certain conditions.
<P>
	There are four very important conditions I would like to 
mention. First, the voyage made by the ship shall not constitute a 
coasting trade, which means operating within domestic waters 
only. Second, the casino cannot be accessible to the passengers of 
the ship during the hour preceding the arrival of the ship at a 
Canadian port. Third, the casino shall not be accessible when the 
ship is in a Canadian port. Fourth, the casino shall not be accessible 
during the hour after the ship departs from a Canadian port.
<P>
	It is clear that this private member's bill does not propose any 
drastic changes to the Canadian Criminal Code. It merely suggests 
a few amendments to help economic development.
<P>
	All members present in this House, and you may have noticed 
there are not that many, know or ought to know that the Criminal 
Code currently allows casinos to be open in international waters 
only, which means that any ship that operates a casino and wishes 
to visit cities along the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes is obliged 
to close the casino as soon as it reaches Anticosti Island.
<P>
	However, the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes represent a 
majestic waterway that compares with the greatest rivers in the 
world. The St. Lawrence is neither a sea nor a small river. It evokes 
the power and grandeur of nature and reveals the general vastness 
of Canada. Whale watching, one of the unique attractions, adds to 
the splendour of these waterways.
<P>
	The Saguenay is an impressive fjord that offers passengers on a 
cruise ship an unforgettable visual experience. With its steep cliffs, 
it offers the traveller a unique opportunity to see what nature has 
wrought.
<P>
	Quebec City, according to a number of surveys, is the port of call 
preferred by passengers on this route. With its harbour a stone's 
throw from its historic and much visited centre, with the Château 
Frontenac that  dominates the skyline and its unique location, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9352"> 9352 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec City is a cultural and historical focal point in an 
exceptionally attractive setting. In fact, it is the only fortified city 
in North America designated by UNESCO as part of our global 
heritage.
<P>
	The city of Montreal and its port where passengers board and 
disembark offers an urban experience that is unique in North 
America: a dynamic metropolis with a very special flavour. 
Montreal has something to offer the religious tourist and the night 
life tourist, the art connoisseur, the sports fan, the intrepid walker 
and the avid consumer.
<P>
	The St. Lawrence has all sorts of natural and human attractions 
to offer. A single thread links them all: the French fact. The St. 
Lawrence offers American tourists a foreign experience in a safe 
setting.
<P>
	Furthermore, cruise ship facilities on the St. Lawrence are more 
than adequate. The docks in Quebec City and Montreal are located 
in the old ports, near the tourist areas. Cruise ship passengers will 
especially appreciate their cleanliness.
<P>
	The St. Lawrence is a safe destination for passengers and ship 
owners alike, a haven from terrorism. In addition, Quebec City and 
Montreal provide visitors with the sense of security American 
visitors look for on their holidays.
<P>
	The efforts by the two major tourist destinations on the St. 
Lawrence and the ports and cities along the New York-Montreal 
route in recent years have favourably impressed ship owners.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	According to the statistics, ship owners consider that casinos 
bring in 15 per cent of their revenues. As the casinos must be shut 
down for several hours or as long as two days, when the ships enter 
the St. Lawrence and its gulf, a number of owners prefer another 
port over those serving the cities along the St. Lawrence and the 
Great Lakes.
<P>
	Furthermore, tourists who enjoy the casino will choose a port 
that does not require the closure of the casino for several days.
<P>
	The cruise industry lives at the crossroads of the tourism and 
marine industries. It is a rapidly growing industry, making it 
particularly interesting for stakeholders in the tourism and shipping 
sectors, all the more so as they are experiencing a certain 
stagnation in their respective sectors in Quebec.
<P>
	Cruises are tremendously popular worldwide, and particularly so 
in North America. The North American cruise industry has grown 
over 800 per cent in the period since 1970, when 500,000 people 
went on cruises.
<P>
	This industry grew an average of 9.4 per cent annually between 
1980 and 1992, when the number of passengers hit 4.3 million. And 
in 1993, this figure exceeded 4.7 million.
<P>
	Cruises now occupy a solid position in the market. All the 
international associations expect the number of cruise passengers 
to reach 8 million annually by the end of the century, despite an 
expected dip in demand of 1.4 per cent annually over the next few 
years.
<P>
	The cruise market potential is therefore enormous, particularly if 
one bears in mind that only 5 or 6 per cent of Americans have ever 
been on a cruise. Over the next two years, it is estimated that this 
market will reach $50 billion internationally. A tourist market of 
this scope naturally leads to fierce competition between cruise 
zones.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the St. Lawrence market is not developing at the 
same rate as North American markets. The St. Lawrence River is a 
key route in the Canada-New England cruise zone. It is used 
primarily for seven day ocean cruises between New York and 
Montreal. The Saguenay, Quebec City and Montreal are the main 
drawing cards on the St. Lawrence route. The Canada-New 
England run, with its 420,415 cruise days, accounts for only 1.2 per 
cent of the total cruise market, which will reach 50 million cruise 
days in two years.
<P>
	The route that takes in the St. Lawrence occupies only a very 
small part of the market, and ranks twelfth among cruise routes. 
Even this position is threatened by the sustained and organized 
efforts being made by southeastern Asia, Australia, New Zealand 
and the Far East.
<P>
	A look at the evolution of traffic on the St. Lawrence since 1980 
reveals regular growth, with two particularly good years. These 
statistical anomalies are directly related to the fact that the route is 
considered particularly safe. We have only to remember the 1987 
season, which was very good for us because it followed on the 
terrorist attack on the <I>Achille Lauro</I> in the Mediterranean. The 
1991 season was very good because of the Gulf war.
<P>
	Taking in these two record years, the average annual growth rate 
on the St. Lawrence is around 4.7 per cent. This rate was notably 
lower than the 9.4 per cent of the industry in general, however.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	An examination of the statistics for all of the industry in North 
America indicates clearly that the St. Lawrence is progressing 
twice as slowly as the market as a whole. A quick survey of the 
decision makers in the cruise lines indicates that there are two 
drawbacks: the climate, and the fact that casinos cannot be open. 
These are what might be called the two irritants to development of 
the St. Lawrence route. It is very hard to do anything about the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9353"> 9353 </A></B>
<P>
climate, but I hope that, if the other irritant were  removed by this 
bill, the deck would be stacked in our favour.
<P>
	The economic impact of cruise ships is essential to the 
development of the cities located along the St. Lawrence. A study 
carried out in Montreal in 1991 established that the average 
expenditure was $113 per passenger, and $100,000 per ship, which 
means a total of $5.3 million for cruise ship passengers, and $4.1 
million for cruise ship operators.
<P>
	Revenues to the Government of Quebec from these expenditures 
are $1.4 million, and to the federal government, $700,000. In 
addition to the cash, and direct or indirect employment spinoffs 
from this, cruise ships on the St. Lawrence generate other benefits 
which, while unquantifiable, are equally important to the 
profitability of the tourist industry.
<P>
	For example, autumn, which is when the ships change locations, 
is a particularly good season for cruising the St. Lawrence, on top 
of which there is the attraction of the fall colours, particularly in 
October. In fact, high season is in September and October, thus 
extending a summer tourist season which is often too short, and 
indirectly enabling the bus companies, restaurants, attractions and 
museums to turn a better profit. We might also mention the 
St.Lawrence pilots, the retention of whom has been defended by 
the Bloc Quebecois, for environmental reasons in particular; they 
too could profit from development of the cruise industry.
<P>
	By actively marketing the strengths of the St. Lawrence as a 
destination, and by doing away with the irritant of having to close 
down casinos, the St. Lawrence should be able to develop as much 
as, if not more than, the industry as a whole. Informal surveys 
conducted among ship owners are very revealing. The legislation 
on casinos is the main obstacle to operating more cruise ships on 
the St. Lawrence.
<P>
	Of course, the shipping lines are very discret about this problem 
because they do not want their clientele to know that 15 per cent of 
their revenue comes from casinos. They would rather give 
passengers the impression that casinos are there for their 
entertainment, if they so desire.
<P>
	Changing the legislation to allow casinos on the St. Lawrence 
would have several advantages, the main one being to increase 
traffic and expand economic and fiscal benefits as well, estimated 
at $215 million over the next two years.
<P>
	As you know, all ships sailing on the St. Lawrence must be 
piloted and brought safely to port by experienced pilots who are 
members of the Corporation of the Lower St. Lawrence Pilots, as I 
said earlier. Imagine the number of jobs that would be created and 
preserved for St. Lawrence pilots if this amendment were to 
increase the number of ships on the St. Lawrence by 10 per cent.
<P>
	A study has shown that if we maintain the status quo, by the year 
2000 we will have a little over 50,000 passengers, but if we amend 
the legislation, we will attract more than 101,000 passengers to the 
greater Quebec City region and the St. Lawrence. Initially, the St. 
Lawrence would make up for lost time with an increase of 20 per 
cent annually, while later on, the increase would be commensurate 
with the growth of the international cruise ship industry as a whole.
<P>
	Since the bill before the House today is not supported by the 
current government, because it was not considered to be a votable 
item, according to the Committee on Private Members' Business, I 
would like to point out the negatived impact of the status quo. The 
status quo would, first of all, deprive Quebec and Canada of 
considerable revenues because cruise ship traffic on the St. 
Lawrence would remain well below global figures.
<P>
	The status quo marginalizes the St. Lawrence because it would 
be the only river in the world of this size where casinos cannot 
operate on ocean cruises.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	The status quo sends a clear message to the owners of 
ocean-going cruise ships, which are not particularly welcome in the 
St. Lawrence. Ports and tourism offices are working actively to 
attract the lines, but the federal government does not want them. 
The status quo tells the ship owners that Canada is overregulated 
and unable to adapt its legislation to everyday economic realities.
<P>
	Furthermore, the status quo confirms that federal legislation may 
be applied very differently according to whether the sea front is 
Halifax or Vancouver.
<P>
	In conclusion, how are the people of Quebec supposed to 
understand that what is acceptable in the Pacific in Vancouver is 
not on the St. Lawrence? On the other hand, Quebecers will 
understand clearly that, if Quebec were sovereign, it would have 
complete political leverage to decide its own economic future, 
which does not seem to be the case within the Canadian federation.
<P>
	On several occasions, Quebecers have told English Canada they 
want to be ``maîtres chez eux'', as Jean Lesage put it. And the 
response from English Canada is: ``What does Quebec want?'' 
Well, what we want is to ensure our own economic development 
with the necessary tools, something we cannot do now, because 
they are under the control of the federal government, which does 
not seem to want to allow Quebec to develop as it could if it were 
sovereign. This is another deciding factor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canada is unique among the nations of the world in having two 
popular venues for international cruise ships that involve sailing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9354"> 9354 </A></B>
<P>
within Canadian domestic waters. These venues are the St. 
Lawrence River and the west coast's inside passage.
<P>
	As cruise ships sail from international waters toward the St. 
Lawrence River they pass into Canadian domestic waters. From a 
location near the island of Anticosti and on into the St. Lawrence 
River, these domestic waters are provincial waters.
<P>
	Typically, international cruise ships on the inside passage 
between mainland British Columbia and Vancouver Island sail a 
round trip route between Vancouver and Alaska. Under the 
Canadian interpretation of the law of the sea, vessels on the inside 
passage route are either in U.S. domestic waters or Canadian 
domestic waters. They do not traverse international waters.
<P>
	The Canadian Arctic represents a third, albeit less travelled, 
venue for international cruise ships where extensive sailing within 
Canadian domestic waters might be involved, again on the 
Canadian interpretation of the law of the sea.
<P>
	There are several other Canadian ports or sailing venues which 
international cruise ships could visit during favourable seasons of 
the year. These would involve less extensive sailing in domestic 
waters, including provincial waters.
<P>
	Shipboard casinos with slot machines are part of the 
entertainment mix that is offered by international cruise ships to 
their passengers. Apparently these casinos are valued by these 
passengers. Shipboard casinos generate revenues for the cruise ship 
companies and the ability to operate a casino would probably factor 
into a company's choice of its cruise routes.
<P>
	For their part, Canadian port communities are anxious to have 
the added tourism and industry that cruise ships may bring, 
including return visits to the area by former cruise ship passengers 
with land and air transportation.
<P>
	I am sure that the Canadian government appreciates that 
international cruise ship interests and Canadian port communities 
are deeply concerned about this issue. It is important to note that 
there have been several other requests for private commercial 
gaming in domestic waters on vessels that are not international 
cruise ships.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	I believe that the issue of private commercial gaming in 
domestic waters of Canada should be considered and addressed 
comprehensively. Our consideration should not be limited to 
international cruise ships.
<P>
	The gambling provisions of the criminal code are contained in 
part VII. They can be generally described as prohibiting all forms 
of gambling except those that are specifically allowed under the 
code.
<P>
	As an exception to the lottery scheme offences in section 206 of 
the code, section 207 provides that provinces and territories may 
operate a broad range of lottery schemes, not including slot 
machines. These permitted lottery schemes may only operate 
within the province or territory or within another province or 
territory where there is co-operation from that other jurisdiction.
<P>
	It would appear that the provincial government could presently 
choose to operate a casino with slot machines but not dice games 
on a vessel within provincial waters. However, a province could not 
operate such gambling in Canadian waters that are not provincial 
waters.
<P>
	Similarly, while a province might conceivably issue a licence for 
a lottery scheme that is conducted within provincial waters, it 
appears that the licence cannot cover a lottery scheme that is 
operated in domestic waters that are not provincial waters.
<P>
	Currently the provisions of the criminal code give no permission 
for private commercial gambling except on a very small scale and 
only where the province or territory is issued a licence. Under 
section 207 of the criminal code, the price to participate in a 
licensed private commercial lottery scheme must be $2 or less and 
the prize offered must be $500 or less. Very few Canadian 
jurisdictions choose to licence any private commercial lottery 
schemes.
<P>
	Paragraph 202(1)(b) of the criminal code makes it an offence to 
import into Canada any machine or device for gaming or betting. 
While there is an exception in the gambling provisions of the 
criminal code for importing gambling equipment that relates to a 
lawful lottery scheme such as a provincially operated or 
provincially licensed lottery scheme, there is no similar exception 
related to international cruise ships with unregulated private 
commercial casinos. It appears that even where gaming equipment 
is not operated while in Canadian waters, an international cruise 
ship which carries its own slot machines or its own table casino 
games within domestic waters of Canada would technically violate 
the present provisions of the code.
<P>
	As we all know, the enforcement and prosecution of criminal 
code offences has been assigned in the provinces to the attorney 
general of each province.
<P>
	I believe, in response to international cruise ship interests, Bill 
C-369 proposes a criminal code amendment that goes beyond 
simply legalizing the presence of gaming equipment on 
international cruise ships while these ships are within domestic 
waters. The changes proposed in Bill C-369 would significantly 
alter the present gambling provisions of the criminal code.
<P>
	Bill C-369 proposes amendments that would legalize the 
unregulated operation of a private commercial casino on an 
international cruise ship within the domestic waters of Canada. 
This differs markedly from the approach that the province of 
Quebec wishes to take if the criminal code is amended to allow 
casino gaming on international cruise ships in domestic waters.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9355"> 9355 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1996 the province of Quebec passed legislation that would 
permit the establishment of provincial licensing for private 
commercial gaming operations on international cruise ships that 
are within provincial waters. This licensing would apply to cruise 
ships that are on an international voyage. Quebec recognizes that 
prior to the provincial licensing legislation becoming effective, an 
amendment to the gaming provisions of the criminal code would 
be required.
<P>
	One of the greatest concerns related to the legalization of 
gambling is ensuring that there is integrity in the gambling. 
Regulation is a necessary part of accomplishing this. Regulation 
ensures that security features such as background checks on 
operators, suppliers, investors and key employees are in place. It 
also ensures that surveillance features, including monitoring for 
cheating at play and auditing, are in place.
<P>
	Bill C-369 provides for unregulated casino gambling in 
Canadian waters. It does not address the issue of ensuring the 
integrity of the gaming that would be offered within Canadian 
waters.
<P>
	The second notable aspect of Bill C-369 is that it would 
significantly expand the narrow window that exists for private 
commercial gaming in Canada. The present window is so small that 
the Canadian approach in effect is to legalize large scale gaming 
only where it is operated and licensed by a province or territory. 
Virtually all Canadian gaming profits go to public purposes, 
whether it is through licensed charities or through government 
revenues.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	This Canadian approach to the proceeds of gaming differs from 
the U.S. approach to casino gaming which typically sees profit 
going to private interests with government taxation of these profits. 
Bill C-369 would would present a major shift in gambling policy 
that should only be pursued after careful consideration of the 
implications.
<P>
	The third notable aspect of Bill C-369 proposed the introduction 
of the word casino into the Criminal Code. The term casino is not 
defined in Bill C-369 but is left to be defined by the regulation 
made by the Attorney General of Canada within six months of this 
bill's coming into force. Presumably in defining the term casino by 
regulation the attorney general would have unlimited discretion to 
list the forms of gaming that may occur within a casino.
<P>
	It appears that international cruise ship lines see slot machines as 
pivotal to their casino operations. Under the bill it might be argued 
that the attorney general through the regulations that would define 
a casino could effectively authorize certain forms of unregulated 
gambling on international cruise ships which a province cannot 
licence such as slot machines or which a province cannot even 
operate such as dice games.
<P>
	There are a number of other considerations that time will not 
permit me to put forward. However, as has been indicated, we
<P>
prefer a comprehensive review of the provisions of the Criminal 
Code with regard to gaming in waters in Canada.
<P>
	We thank the hon. member for putting forward this bill to aid the 
consideration of that issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I begin by congratulating the member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans for bringing this forward.
<P>
	A few weeks ago in the House I sponsored private member's Bill 
C-353 relating to the whole notion of amending the Criminal Code 
so that we could develop a set of regulations around Internet casino 
gambling.
<P>
	It is no secret to anyone in the House that currently Internet 
gaming is taking place around the world and is totally unregulated.
<P>
	The first hour of debate we had on my bill, members of 
Parliament from the Bloc Quebecois, the Reform and Liberal 
parties agreed to send the bill to the justice committee for a 
comprehensive evaluation.
<P>
	As I listened to the member speak about his bill this morning, he 
is proposing that we amend the Criminal Code to allow gaming and 
full casino operations on cruise ships on the St. Lawrence and the 
Great Lakes. I cannot help but see certain similarities with Bill 
C-353.
<P>
	It is important that we in the House and in the country 
understand why we are becoming interested in this whole area of 
gaming. The gaming industry is exploding in the world and not just 
because people now enjoy gaming and the diverse opportunities in 
the gaming realm. It is also because the tourism sector of the global 
economy is growing. For many countries tourism is the thing that is 
actually keeping their economies viable. In the last four to five 
years members of the House of Commons through their support 
have encouraged this government to quadruple the advertising 
budget for tourism Canada. They understand from a public policy 
point of view the number of jobs linked to tourism.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Tourism today is a very competitive industry. When we think of 
tourism, it is no longer simply about a couple or a family taking a 
trip to another part of our country or another part of the world for a 
holiday. Tourism today is linked in many cases with business. In 
other words, there are sectors within our economy where large 
associations are linking their conventions and trade shows and the 
private enjoyment of those who participate in those conventions as 
part of the overall package.
<P>
	For example, the Shriners meet in Las Vegas every year and 
many other conventions are held there. Various cities and countries 
encourage these conventions to come to them. There is massive 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9356"> 9356 </A></B>
<P>
competition. Convention  organizers do not just look at a city for 
what is offered in terms of hotels, convention centres and trade 
show capability. They also look at the entertainment factor. They 
look at live theatre. They look at sports events. They also look at 
gaming.
<P>
	In his bill the member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans 
puts particular emphasis on the province of Quebec and does not 
exclude the Great Lakes. I noticed that in his remarks. He was very 
specific when he said that allowing this full package of gaming 
capability on international cruise ships would allow for much more 
tourism activity in places like Charlevoix, Quebec City, et cetera. 
When those cruise ships land in those areas the tourists tend to 
spend a lot of money. They spend a lot in restaurants. Sometimes 
people are so tired of being on these cruise ships, they like to get 
off for three or four days. When they come into a community, the 
spin-off or the multiplier is profound.
<P>
	I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice 
that this issue needs a comprehensive approach. I do not disagree 
with that at all. I also believe that we in this House must grab the 
moment. We should give this member's bill a chance to have every 
aspect of the regulatory component looked at. The Parliamentary 
Secretary to Minister of Justice talked about the notion of 
background investigations and making sure there is full 
surveillance and accountability on the parts of all people involved 
in this. These issues have to be dealt with to ensure the consumer is 
protected.
<P>
	I also believe that if an international cruise ship comes within the 
jurisdiction of our waters, the waters that Canada is responsible for 
and not just the waters under provincial jurisdiction, there must be 
some kind of tax. There must be some kind of benefit to the 
treasury of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	Cruise ship operators would be happy to negotiate some kind of 
a fee. Even though the gaming and gambling activity is not under 
the regulatory umbrella, we all know it is going on. There is not a 
cruise ship in the world on which people are not gaming. They are 
obviously not gaming in a legal fashion; they are doing it on their 
own. It is like bookies and under the table gaming.
<P>
	I have always held the view that legislators are much better 
positioned to get an overall regulatory framework on the whole 
realm of gaming. I also believe the Government of Canada has to 
get back into the business of understanding the gaming realm. If it 
means that we have to amend the Criminal Code to allow for dice, 
we should do it.
<P>
	Let us take a look at our friends in Windsor which has one of the 
most profitable gaming centres in the country. In the not too distant 
future they will be facing severe  competition in Windsor from the 
gaming operation in Detroit. Detroit will have dice and Windsor 
will not. We will expose them. It is another area where we have to 
take a good hard look at the Criminal Code to make sure that dice is 
part of the regulatory component.
<P>
	In 1979 then Prime Minister Joe Clark essentially gave away 
gaming as a national government responsibility to each of the 
provinces. We obviously know why they guard it with their lives. It 
is because the revenues from it are so large. If we were to take away 
that revenue from the provinces we would find some resistance.
<P>
	There is an opportunity in the bill sponsored by the member 
from Beauport to do some good work on the tourism trade. I salute 
him for his contribution.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-369, which was introduced by my 
colleague for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans. First of all, I 
would like to make a few comments on the comments made by the 
last two speakers.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice got 
himself lost in a maze of legislation, private lottery schemes, 
supervision of lotteries, all manner of things which might be 
surreptitious, might be illegal. He did not agree with the bill, 
arguing that it needed to be studied in its entirety, as it somehow 
threatened public safety.
<P>
	Then the other Liberal member from the Toronto region said that 
this was a worthwhile initiative on the part of my colleague for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, but that it essentially opened 
up the debate. They did not deal with the basic issue, but claimed 
that, on certain cruise ships, owners kept casinos open to illegal 
betting and so on.
<P>
	That is not really what is being debated. What the hon. member 
for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans has stated very clearly is 
that there are licensed casinos on board cruise ships in international 
waters. The comparison with the Canadian Criminal Code relates 
to certain ports on the Atlantic or Pacific coasts. When a cruise ship 
is on its way to Vancouver, for instance, it can be in international 
waters and then, only an hour, or an hour and half later, be tying up 
in Vancouver. The same holds true for Halifax or St. John's.
<P>
	The difference is that the cruise ships plying the St. Lawrence do 
so for all of the reasons given by my colleague for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans: the majesty of the great river, 
the possibility of seeing whales, sometimes even the endangered 
beluga, the immensity of the Saguenay River fjord, and the magical 
fall colours.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, international cruise ships sail for about one 
thousand kilometres on the St. Lawrence and throughout that time 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9357"> 9357 </A></B>
<P>
cannot open their casinos. The sole  purpose of the bill presented by 
the hon. member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans is to 
allow casinos to be operated until one hour before the ship is 
berthed. The legislation cannot be compared with legislation that 
applies to Vancouver or Halifax because this is within Canadian 
territory.
<P>
	True to form in this Canadian federation, the government wants 
to have the same legislation apply to all parts of the country, 
although quite obviously, the economic situation, accessibility and 
natural resources are not the same. The bill presented by the hon. 
member is clearly specific to the St. Lawrence, if you will, but it 
could also apply to the Great Lakes. If this bill were adopted, 
perhaps some cruise ships would go as far as the Great Lakes on 
some of their longer cruises.
<P>
	We must stop saying, as the hon. member from the Toronto area 
has done, that this could create certain legislative problems. He 
even referred to legislation in Quebec which allows the operation 
of casinos on international cruise ships. Unfortunately, we live 
under a federal system, and this is covered by the federal Criminal 
Code. As soon as a cruise ship enters Canadian costal waters, its 
casino must be closed.
<P>
	The hon. member from the Toronto area said that he knew or 
people had heard that casinos can be operated even if this is 
prohibited by law. This means lost revenue for the government. 
And as far as advertising these cruises is concerned, for wealthy 
passengers there is an additional attraction in the fact that, as they 
sail along the St. Lawrence for more than 1,000 kilometres, after 
admiring the landscape they can relax with a variety of games in 
the casino. That is all the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans is asking.
<P>
	I would like to make a connection here with the Liberal Party's 
platform. Throughout the last campaign and even today, they have 
said: jobs, jobs, jobs. I must say that tourism brings a larger number 
of cruise ship passengers to the port of Quebec. Quebec City has in 
fact passed a resolution to support this initiative, and my colleague 
from Quebec City also intends to speak in support of this proposal. 
Charlesbourg also passed a resolution supporting my colleague's 
bill.
<P>
	Clearly, with lots of cruise ships entering the ports of Montreal 
and Quebec City and the Saguenay fjord, direct and indirect jobs 
will be created. Reference was made earlier to piloting. I would 
also point out that, when the cruise ship passengers visit cities like 
Montreal and Quebec City, they spend and thus help the economy.
<P>
	With the Liberal Party in sub-committee denying my colleague's 
bill the opportunity to be voted on and setting it aside for a general 
study, I have a hard time understanding their convincing anyone 
that they want to create ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. I could even call that a 
sort of aggressive treatment, given, for example, the proposals of 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, whose coast guard bill 
proposed increased fees for dredging and coast guard  services.
<P>
Perhaps this too is intended to hobble the tourist industry by its 
effect on cruise ships.
<P>
	In closing, I simply want to say it is clear that, when federal 
legislation-whether it involves the Criminal Code, the 
environment or some other area-applies to the entire country, 
certain locations are bound to suffer. In terms of tourism, it is the 
St. Lawrence region and the Province of Quebec that will lose 
tourists and the economic benefits they provide.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	This is why my colleague from 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans introduced this bill and why I 
dare to think that the members opposite will not only consider it but 
will want to consider it so it may become a votable bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to speak in support of the intent of the bill and to 
congratulate the member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans 
for putting it before the House.
<P>
	There is no question that the fastest growing industry in North 
America today is the gaming industry. It is time that we in this 
place started to examine in a serious fashion what that can mean in 
terms of the economy of the ports on the Great Lakes and on the St. 
Lawrence. It is also time for us to examine how we can utilize more 
efficiently the seaway system, the St. Lawrence River and the Great 
Lakes. It is time for us to tap the potential we are seeing tapped in 
the southern U.S. and on the west coast of the United States and 
Canada.
<P>
	There is a little town called Skagway in Alaska which has a 
population of 712. It is the northern terminal of west coast cruise 
ship run. Skagway, Alaska, imposed a 4 per cent municipal sales 
tax on all goods and services and last year collected something like 
$42 million, which represented 4 per cent of all the money spent by 
people coming off cruise ships. There is no other way to get there.
<P>
	The seaway is underutilized in many respects. We know what is 
the fastest growing industry and that corporations operating cruise 
ships in the southern U.S. in the winter would love to put some 
boats on the Great Lakes in the summer.
<P>
	This is an opportunity, as one member has pointed out, to 
employ people. Estimates I have seen from operators indicate that 
four ships with a capacity of 600 to 700 operating on the Great 
Lakes would create 10,000 jobs in Ontario and Quebec in the 
operating season. It is a very short season but some 80 million 
Americans within a day's drive would love to have the opportunity 
to cruise the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes.
<P>
	This is a serious piece of legislation. The Americans are about to 
amend their territorial waters act. The  Americans are willing to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9358"> 9358 </A></B>
<P>
deal with respect to the Johnson act in terms of cross-border cruise 
ships. The Great Lakes come under federal jurisdiction. This is the 
time to move to create an industry that will create jobs and will spin 
off into great implications for tourism.
<P>
	As was mentioned, a former Prime Minister gave a great deal 
away but we still retain jurisdiction over the waters.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
think I have time to address all aspects of this bill. However, as the 
member for Québec, I feel directly concerned by this bill 
concerning the operation of casinos on cruise ships sailing on theSt. Lawrence River.
<P>
	I feel concerned because there is a major economic impact for 
the riding of Québec. You know that we were elected to the House 
of Commons to defend the interests of Quebec and of our 
constituents. This bill is a concrete example of what the Bloc 
Quebecois can do, of how it can get things moving.
<P>
	We know that every year thousands of dollars are lost through 
passengers choosing other destinations, because the Criminal Code 
as it now stands does not allow cruise ships to operate casinos.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	I think there has been a lot of stalling around over the last seven 
years when this bill should have been passed. I will also mention, if 
I may, the bad faith of the justice minister, because in response to 
questions from my colleague, the member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, the minister told us that he 
would consult and that, if an official request was made by the 
Quebec minister, he would have the legislation changed.
<P>
	The minister was also a bit vague on other questions. At this 
point, he is conducting consultations and considering the issue. I 
think a sufficient number of stakeholders have expressed their 
views, including the shipping industry, tourist associations, 
organizations promoting shipping, national harbour masters and 
municipalities along the St. Lawrence, including Quebec City. The 
municipal council has passed a resolution asking that the 
legislation be changed.
<P>
	I think the minister is stalling. I do not know whether we can call 
it bad faith, but the Government of Quebec passed a bill that would 
allow casinos to operate on cruise ships sailing on the St. 
Lawrence. I wonder why this bill was not deemed votable by 
members of this House sitting on the committee on private 
members' business, most of whom are Liberals.
<P>
	I can only deplore this lack of political will by the government 
members across the way. As we know, this has a major economic 
impact on the economic development of cities along theSt. Lawrence. Future  economic spinoffs can be estimated at$50 billion. Only 5 or 6 per cent of Americans have had this 
experience, and this is as close as one can get to a sure thing, 
economically speaking.
<P>
	Quebec City, in my riding, attracts many tourists and has the 
requisite infrastructure to receive this type of clientele. This is a 
market that is expanding rapidly, and if there were a change in the 
legislation, we could expect an annual economic growth rate of10 per cent. The number of passengers would rise from 40,000 to 
95,000, with economic spinoffs estimated at $215 million. In 
Vancouver, they can count on 701,000 passengers with 
commensurate economic spinoffs.
<P>
	Why should the cities along the St. Lawrence not get their share 
of this clientele? Is the government just plain unwilling to change 
the legislation, so that cruise ships will be able to open their casinos 
until one hour before arrival or one hour after their departure from 
the various ports along the St. Lawrence?
<P>
	In various parts of Canada where ports exist, these are in 
international waters so there is no problem. However, there is a 
problem here because upon reaching Anticosti Island, ships are not 
allowed to open their casinos on the St. Lawrence. So what do 
people do who like to go to casinos? They decide against a cruise 
on the St. Lawrence.
<P>
	I think we have mentioned all the economic spinoffs. My 
colleagues did so this morning, and I support this bill, in the hope 
that the government will realize that we are right and that it will go 
along with these changes. I know the bill standing in the name of 
the hon. member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans is not a 
votable item, but I do hope that this government, after so many 
consultations that seemed to go on forever, and the industry has 
already had its say on the subject, that this government will come 
up with a positive answer very shortly.
<P>
	The objectives in this bill are realistic, and we hope the 
government will do the right thing and change the legislation so 
that we can increase economic development twofold.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Since certain experts say the increase could be 20 per cent 
annually, I wonder why operations on the St. Lawrence continue to 
be marginalized, thus penalizing the tourism industry throughout 
the Quebec City region. I think it makes sense in this matter to 
allow casinos to operate by passing such a bill.
<P>
	I know this bill is not votable, but why not reverse that decision? 
If the minister ends up proving the Bloc Quebecois right in this 
matter, he will introduce his own bill. So why delay it? I think we 
have already deprived every city along the St. Lawrence, especially 
Quebec City, of enough money and economic benefits. I would 
therefore ask this government to move very quickly.
<P>

<P>
	The hon. member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans on a 
point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask for the unanimous 
consent of this House to extend the debate by one minute so I can 
respond.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent for the proposal by the hon. member?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hon. member has one 
minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the members of the 
government party.
<P>
	My colleagues and I have tried to demonstrate that private 
member's Bill C-369 is essential to the development of ports along 
the St. Lawrence and to the economy in general of cities on its 
shores.
<P>
	We have also tried to show the House that this bill is not about 
playing politics, but about making it possible for the Quebec 
economy to develop, like all other areas in Canada.
<P>
	I ask my colleagues across the way to forget about partisan 
politics for a minute-there will be time for that during the 
upcoming election campaign-and to treat this bill as a matter of 
conscience. Why stand in the way of an entire region's 
development for purely political reasons?
<P>
	On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois and of the people of Quebec, 
who are served both by representatives of the Bloc Quebecois and 
by the other parties, I ask my colleagues in the House to allow this 
bill to go to a free vote. I ask the House for unanimous consent to 
put it to a vote.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Do we have the 
unanimous consent of the House to put the hon. member's bill to a 
vote?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There is not unanimous 
consent.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed from February 4 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-46, an act to amend the Criminal  Code (production of 
records in sexual offence proceedings), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this 
debate. Over the last few weeks the justice committee, which I 
chair, has been hearing a series of witnesses in relation to the 
subject matter of Bill C-46. The committee will continue to hold 
hearings on the bill when and if it is referred to it for consideration.
<P>
	Over this period of time committee members have heard a great 
many witnesses on all sides of the debate, witnesses who support 
the bill and witnesses who do not and who have concerns about it. 
The committee hearings have been open and fair and have given us 
an opportunity to now reflect on what, if any, amendments should 
be brought forward.
<P>
	We have heard from witnesses representing sexual assault crisis 
centres, from victims, from defence lawyers and from a group that 
purports to believe in the existence of something called recovered 
memory syndrome or false memory syndrome. I will talk about this 
a little more later in the debate. Basically, we have had a very broad 
look at all of the issues which this draft legislation has stimulated.
<P>
	I believe several things have been lost in this debate. One is the 
fact that nothing in Bill C-46 prohibits the production of records. In 
fact, these amendments make it clear that a trial judge has the 
jurisdiction to order a third party to produce records to an accused.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	I am speaking of records that are in the possession of a third 
party which relate to personal information about the victim in the 
case. The bill makes it very clear that a judge has the power to 
order that third party to produce those records. All the bill is doing 
is setting out the criteria on which such an order will go forward.
<P>
	In order to do so the law lays down the ground rules and 
demands that the accused establish how the records that are 
requested are likely relevant to an issue at trial. The accused cannot 
simply speculate, for instance, on how those records might be 
relevant. The accused has to offer more than that. He or she must 
set out the grounds on which he or she is relying to establish how 
the rules are likely relevant.
<P>
	These amendments clarify that certain assertions are not enough 
to pass the initial hurdle. An assertion in and of itself is nothing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9360"> 9360 </A></B>
<P>
more than an unsupported statement. An accused cannot simply 
state ``I need the medical records of the complainant because they 
might be helpful''. In fact, the accused has to take it a step further 
than that.
<P>
	Some critics contend that this places the accused in a catch-22 
situation. They argue that the accused may not  be able to establish 
how the records are likely relevant because the accused does not 
know what information is in the records.
<P>
	A two-step process is required. First, the accused has to establish 
the likely relevance of the records. Second, several of these 
assertions I am talking about on their own, without any supporting 
information, are not sufficient to demonstrate the likelihood of the 
relevance of the records. That requires the accused simply to go a 
step beyond making the assertion.
<P>
	I do not accept that this is a catch-22 situation. First, if the law 
does not impose some sort of threshold of likely relevance on the 
production of records, then it would be open season on those 
records. They would be available simply by the accused requesting 
them. In my view, that is not what Canadians want and it is not 
necessary for the accused to have full answer in defence.
<P>
	If an accused does in fact have a defence to the charges, for 
instance, if he did not have contact with the complainant, if he 
believes the complainant consented, if he asserts that the incident 
did not happen, he can pursue that defence in an appropriate 
manner. But the accused should not, in my view, have carte blanche 
to peruse records in search of a defence in the form of impeaching 
the complainant's character or credibility or by intimidating the 
complainant to such an extent that the charges are withdrawn.
<P>
	I would also point out that we are talking about personal records 
which have been made by third parties who have come in contact 
with the complainant. These third parties are counsellors, teachers, 
doctors, who have no obligation to provide these records to the 
accused, except through this process.
<P>
	As I indicated, the legislation sets out several assertions which 
the accused cannot rely on solely to establish the likely relevance 
of the record. The need for articulating these insufficient assertions 
was highlighted in the consultation process and go right to the heart 
of why these amendments are necessary.
<P>
	The accused will not satisfy the likely relevance threshold for 
production to a trial judge for review by setting out any 
unsupported assertions of why the records are or may be relevant. 
The accused must set out the grounds on which he or she relies to 
show how or why the records are likely relevant to an issue at trial.
<P>
	The accused cannot simply state that records should be produced 
because the records about the complainant merely exist, or because 
they may disclose a prior inconsistent statement, or they may relate 
to the credibility of the complainant or witness, or may reveal 
allegations of sexual abuse by others. These are insufficient 
grounds. These are simply assertions which are intended to ensure 
that speculation will not found an application for records. Fishing 
expeditions are not going to be condoned by our law in this area. If 
the legislation  permitted an accused to guess why records may be 
relevant, then in every case records would be produced and the 
legislation would have accomplished nothing.
<P>
	The assertions are not impermissible per se. The accused may 
still be able to offer some support for the assertion. For example, if 
the accused can establish to the satisfaction of the trial judge that 
the records are likely relevant because they disclose a prior 
inconsistent statement, the trial judge can determine that the record 
should be reviewed.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The defence is not precluded from asserting the existence of a 
prior inconsistent statement. Nor is the defence precluded from 
cross-examining on that prior inconsistent statement because a trial 
judge under the circumstances could have the records produced.
<P>
	One speaker in the House raised the issue of records of therapy 
resulting in so-called recovered memories. It has been suggested 
that such records would be prohibited if the legislation were 
passed. This is simply not true. That view is based on a 
misunderstanding of the legislation and how it will work.
<P>
	Some criticism arises from misinterpreting a single provision 
without referring to related provisions or to the whole scheme of 
the bill. A previous speaker focused on one provision of the 
proposed amendments, subsection 278.3(4) that sets out a list of 
assertions which on their own will not establish the likely relevance 
of records. That is what we were just talking about. The member 
also suggested that the list made it impossible for an accused to 
defend himself particularly where allegations relate to sexual abuse 
occurring a long time ago but only recently reported because of 
recovered memory.
<P>
	There is a lot of controversy about so-called recovered or false 
memories. Psychiatric and health experts cannot agree on how 
these memories are held, repressed, recovered or suggested. Bill 
C-46 is not intended to resolve the controversy. Nor is it intended 
even to wade into it.
<P>
	It is not intended to prohibit records relating to the issue. It will 
not give any special treatment to records where they are alleged to 
relate to memory. Just like any other records sought, the likely 
relevance of the particular record has to be established by the 
accused.
<P>
	An earlier speaker may have left the House with the impression 
that countless Canadians are being charged with sexual offences 
based on allegations arising after controversial treatment involving 
memory recovery techniques. This is simply not true. There have 
been some cases but courts have been very careful to recognize the 
frailties of such evidence.
<P>
	It is important not to lose sight of the fact that whatever we do in 
terms of evidentiary law the crown still has the burden of proving 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9361"> 9361 </A></B>
<P>
every element of a  criminal offence beyond a reasonable doubt. 
This is a high standard and often an insurmountable standard in 
sexual offences, particularly where the offences have an historic 
quality in that they happened a long time ago.
<P>
	In addition it does not place much faith in crown attorneys. 
Charges are not laid willy-nilly simply because somebody makes 
an assertion. The crown has to be of the view there is sufficient 
evidence to support the charge. We should not assume that people 
can simply say they have been abused or assaulted and charges will 
be laid.
<P>
	The records of a therapist or a psychiatrist relating to memory 
retrieval may however be the subject of an application for the 
production of records. To obtain the records the accused must 
establish, simply to the satisfaction of the judge as I said earlier, 
that the records are likely relevant to an issue at trial or to the 
competence of a witness to testify.
<P>
	Clearly an accused cannot assert that medical, therapeutic or 
psychiatric records are needed because they can reveal a memory 
has been recovered or is false. These issues do not arise in all cases. 
If the allegations relate to events which occurred long ago and were 
only disclosed after therapy, an issue at trial will be the 
complainant's ability to recall the events. There is no question 
about it. In such cases the accused can apply for production of 
records by setting out grounds for production rather than bear 
unsupported assertions.
<P>
	People forget that there are all sorts of opportunities for 
disclosure. The crown has an obligation to give full disclosure of 
the complainant's statement. In addition there is generally in these 
cases a preliminary hearing which will allow the defence, either by 
calling his or her own witnesses at the preliminary hearing or 
through the crown's witnesses, to get at the basis of some of these 
assertions.
<P>
	The accused can lay the necessary evidentiary foundation for the 
application by referring at a preliminary hearing to evidence from 
doctors, other experts or the complainant regarding the nature of 
therapy or treatment. Let us remember that nothing in Bill C-46 
prevents the accused from calling as a witness any person who is 
likely to give material evidence and asking them relevant 
questions. An accused can still call as a witness a doctor who 
treated the complainant. An accused can also cross-examine the 
complainant about her recall of events and the nature of therapy 
during the preliminary inquiry and at trial.
<P>
	Where the issue of recovered memory is a real issue and the 
accused can point to information from the preliminary or from 
affidavits of other experts to support the assertion I anticipate that 
the records may be relevant to the issue. Then the trial judge can 
determine he should review the records after taking into account 
the other factors the bill requires him to consider. The list of 
insufficient grounds in the bill would never prohibit a  judge from 
reviewing records where the accused has supported his assertion of 
how the records are relevant.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-46 demands only that applications for personal records be 
carefully scrutinized by the trial judge after the accused has 
established that the records are relevant. The bill makes it clear that 
any unsupported assertion by the accused will not be enough to 
meet the threshold of likely evidence. While the bill lists assertions 
which are insufficient on their own, these are by way of example 
and to highlight some of the reasons that may be cited when 
speculating about the contents of records. However the underlying 
rule is that the accused must always set out the grounds to establish 
how the records are likely relevant. The underlying rule applies to 
all records covered by the definition, including records of therapy 
relating to memory.
<P>
	Bill C-46 addresses the issue of the production of records in 
sexual offence proceedings in a fair and balanced manner. The bill 
will not prohibit the production of records but will ensure that the 
only records produced are those which are likely to be relevant. It 
will ensure that judges carefully consider the rights of both the 
accused and the complainant. The trend by defence council to seek 
personal records to attack credibility is not a uniquely Canadian 
problem. I am aware the same trend has emerged in virtually all 
American states, in the United Kingdom, in Australia and in New 
Zealand.
<P>
	The solutions proposed in other states vary. Some have opted for 
statutory privileges which apply to specific communications and 
records. We decided not to do that. Others have opted for an 
application for production model. What all have in common is the 
recognition that rights to privacy must be accommodated along 
with the right to a full answer in defence and where personal 
records are at stake the accused must demonstrate their likely 
relevance.
<P>
	Our legislative proposals address the problem in a fair, balanced 
and comprehensive manner. I emphasize that the bill will not 
prohibit the production of records. Records can still be produced. I 
also emphasize that the bill will not prohibit the calling of 
witnesses who may have information relevant to those records. 
Those witnesses are still compellable. It ensures that the only 
records produced are those that are likely relevant. It ensures that 
judges carefully consider the rights of both the accused and the 
complainant before such records are produced.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the remarks of the member for Windsor-St. 
Clair with great interest.
<P>
	The bill is fundamentally flawed because of a misunderstanding 
of the import of certain words used by the member for Windsor--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9362"> 9362 </A></B>
<P>
St. Clair. She said that the bill  did not provide any prohibitions for 
the production of records. She went on later to explain that the bill, 
with its amendments to the Criminal Code, set out criteria the judge 
must use to consider whether the records are to be produced.
<P>
	Later she went on to say there were underlying rules the accused 
must meet to be entitled to have access or to have the judge demand 
the records the accused wishes to have.
<P>
	When we set out rules and criteria by which records are to be 
produced or not to be produced we are setting up prohibitions. The 
best way to approach the production of records is to leave the 
production of records to the discretion of judges and not to set rules 
which are in fact prohibited reasons for the judges to consider 
demanding records as requested by the accused.
<P>
	Is it not true that if an accused does not meet the underlying rules 
or the criteria laid out in Bill C-46 the judge will prohibit the 
production of records? Is there not a prohibition there in fact?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are playing an interesting semantic 
game here. It is important to understand and appreciate that judges 
do not make law in a vacuum. If the legislation passes we are 
influencing the way in which judges will make decisions in 
courtrooms. That is what laws are. That is no great revelation. That 
is what we do. We make laws.
<P>
	Judges cannot create laws in a vacuum. They cannot make 
decisions about evidence in a vacuum.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	There has been a problem in the area of sexual assault cases for 
some period of time. As those cases have evolved in the courtroom, 
because of deficiencies in evidentiary laws there has been a free 
ride for the defence in terms of how it investigates and how it 
explores its cases. That free ride has caused a situation where the 
courts, not necessarily of their own volition, are riding roughshod 
over the privacy rights of complainants, victims and other 
witnesses.
<P>
	All this law seeks to do is to set a structure within which a judge 
can make a determination and to set out guidelines for a judge to 
follow. It is not a question of prohibiting. It is a question of 
basically saying that we will respect the rights to privacy of people 
who come to the law with a complaint. We will balance those rights 
fairly and in an even fashion. We are doing it in such a way that 
there can still be full answer in defence.
<P>
	The people on the other side who are beating this horse are 
forgetting that the doctor whose records they are seeking to 
produce can still be called. He or she can still be asked questions. 
The psychiatrist and the counsellor can still be called. They can 
still be asked questions about the complainant and about what may  
have transpired in terms of the nature of the therapy or whatever 
happened.
<P>
	However they will not get at those records. They will not get a 
free ride or a fishing expedition on those records unless they can 
demonstrate some form of relevance. It is not that they must be 
absolutely guaranteed to be relevant. It is that in all likelihood they 
are relevant. That is a good balance. We must remember that 
people who come to the courts or to the police to complain have 
rights to their own privacy.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her presentation. On review 
of the legislation and her comments on the legislation there I have a 
question that was not covered by your presentation.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I know from time to time members have to 
get back into the swing of things but all hon. members will address 
their remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member mentioned the 
possibility of records being available from third parties if they 
meet the criteria of the selection process in the review of a trial 
judge.
<P>
	Could she clarify if it is just records from third parties that go 
through this process, or did I read in the legislation that records 
collected by the crown could be blocked in the same way?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, there has been some confusion on that 
issue. I thank the hon. member for raising the question.
<P>
	In my experience from time to time third party records get into 
the hands of the crown through police investigation. For instance, 
victims may have told the police they can talk to their social 
workers or psychiatrists. Those things get into the police file and 
ultimately get to the crown.
<P>
	They are third party statements. They would be subject to this 
test. The fact that they are out of the hands of the third party and 
into the hands of police and/or the crown does not make them 
fodder for the defence. They have to be vetted in the way set out in 
the legislation by the judge.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member made a statement that judges do not make law in a 
vacuum. She said that in response to another question.
<P>
	I would like the member to comment on that, judges making 
laws at all. She was implying, by saying that judges do not make 
laws in a vacuum, that they make laws with information available. I 
would like her to comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel like I am back in law school. The 
hon. member is raising a fair point.  Legislatures make law; judges 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9363"> 9363 </A></B>
<P>
interpret law. When there is a vacuum, when the legislature has not 
clearly set out society's intention, judges can wander from that.
<P>
	Precedents are built on precedents and so we have to be vigilant 
as legislators to ensure that the law is actually delivering what we 
want the law to deliver in court rooms and in our lives as they are 
regulated by legislation.
<P>
	There is tremendous ongoing debate about what is often called 
judge made law. A broader debate would be better held at another 
time. This is a case where judicial interpretation of the law has 
gone so far afield that there has been public outcry. We have lost 
the balance between private rights and public rights and between 
the rights of complainants and accused.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-46 regarding the 
production of records in sexual offence proceedings.
<P>
	As I was beginning to ponder this bill a symbol came to mind, 
the very symbol of justice. Therein we see a woman holding a 
scale. In the symbol is a picture of a balance. A weighing of 
evidence and actions are put to that balance where the rights of the 
accused and the rights of victims are weighed; all people are equal 
before the law.
<P>
	The scale in that picture is the legislation that we craft in this 
place. That legislation should be designed to be fair. It should be 
designed to be free from built-in bias. It should be crafted outside 
specific cases so that it serves the best interests of all.
<P>
	The woman in that picture is blindfolded, typifying that the 
human judgment factor of justice should display an absence of all 
prejudice. There should be equal rules for all in the justice system.
<P>
	Increasingly in our system, the rights of the accused and the 
rights of victims come into conflict with our rules. Increasingly the 
purpose of the justice system is in debate in the public sphere. Is it 
to protect law-abiding citizens? Is it to rehabilitate criminals? What 
are the priorities that must be established in our justice system?
<P>
	As the weight is shifted from the rights of the public to the rights 
of the accused, we see a consequence in our social fabric of lack of 
accountability, an increase in crime, more victims because of it and 
those victims left out of the process and often revictimized by that 
process.
<P>
	A major concern of the Reform Party is that justice serve all 
Canadians, that it serve as a deterrent to crime, that it demand 
accountability of those who would break the laws of this country, 
that it uphold the rights of victims. The bottom line is safer streets 
and security for our families and for the citizens of Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-46, this debate, deals with the pursuit of justice in cases of 
sexual assault. It seeks to strike a balance between complainant 
rights to privacy and accused rights to a fair trial and full disclosure 
in that trial.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	The discussion is extended in this debate to a right for equality 
for the complainant, equality based on items such as race and 
gender.
<P>
	The difficulty of balance is part of the history of Canada's rape 
shield law, the law that was designed to shield victims from being 
cross-examined about their sexual history and making judges 
responsible to decide when questions are permitted in that sphere.
<P>
	Originally in law a man accused of sexual assault had an 
absolute right to cross-examine an accuser about previous 
relationships and their sexual history. Changes in 1992 to section 
276, known as the rape shield law, resulted in most of the alleged 
victims' sexual history being out of bounds. The decision to allow 
evidence to come forward was made by the judge in a private 
hearing at the beginning of the trial.
<P>
	However, opposite to the anticipated results of this change came 
demands for counselling and other private records. Counselling 
centres were besieged with requests from the courts so they began 
to minimize the records that were kept. Some records were 
destroyed. There were costly fights over subpoenas. Indeed, 
victims were not coming forward because they wanted to avoid 
public disclosure or review of their private past.
<P>
	In December 1995 there was a supreme court ruling where the 
defendant in a sexual assault case need only establish records 
``likely to have relevance in order to be produced'', and therefore 
such workers as doctors, priests, health workers and counsellors 
could turn over records to the alleged assailants.
<P>
	Bill C-46 severely limits this access by defendants to records of 
alleged victims in sexual assault cases. Applications for production 
of records are determined by a trial judge and there is a two stage 
application put forward by this bill.
<P>
	First, the accused must establish that the records exist, that there 
is specific grounds for requiring those records and that they contain 
information relevant to the issue.
<P>
	The second stage is that the trial judge will review those records 
privately, determine which ones will be released and take into 
consideration privacy safeguards in so doing.
<P>
	Both third party and crown records are included in this debate, as 
has been clarified, which is in direct contradiction to the supreme 
court ruling of 1995.
<P>
	My colleague mentioned that records can be produced through 
the process in Bill C-46. Will they be produced with so many 
checks and balances? There is no prohibition for production of 
records but, given the rules and the criteria, would they amount to a 
prohibition of the records?
<P>
	As I reviewed these issues there were more that came to mind. 
The issues range from the priorities of the  justice system and the 
priority of a complainant versus the accused within the system. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9364"> 9364 </A></B>
<P>
Would the system affect the willingness of a citizen to come 
forward with charges?
<P>
	Then there is the issue of the definition of who is a victim. In this 
case, can a victim be the complainant or can the victim be the 
accused if justice is not served in the process?
<P>
	The process of justice is another issue and the basic principle in 
law that someone is assumed innocent until they are proven guilty.
<P>
	Another issue is the role of the crown and the accountability of 
the accuser when the crown takes their place.
<P>
	There are three more definitions and applications. Where does 
the definition and application of sexual assault charges stand in the 
law? Where does the definition and application of privacy rights 
stand in Canadian law? Where does the definition and application 
of equality rights stand in Canadian law? All these issues surround 
Bill C-46.
<P>
	Many of the issues have been discussed in previous debate. Of 
particular note is the issue of the protection of the complainant 
versus the false accusation that might come from that individual. 
This could break down into two situations.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	First, there could be false accusation without intent. That is, as 
we have heard, false memory syndrome which was put forward 
very succinctly by the member for Hamilton-Wentworth. I will 
not repeat the arguments.
<P>
	The other issue is false accusation with intent. I will get to that 
later in a brief discussion of Bill S-4 and how that could put 
forward protection for an individual against false accusation with 
intent.
<P>
	A second issue that has come up in previous debates is victim 
rights. This is of course a priority of our party. Too often people in 
the justice system who are victims are revictimized. Certainly we 
have seen in the last month or so the dismal failure of the Liberal 
Party, which had an opportunity to change the criminal justice 
system to revoke section 745. Section 745 allows for the 
application for early parole after 15 years for first degree 
murderers. In the last little while we have had victims revictimized 
by having to relive the horror in order to accommodate the killer of 
their children who is once again in the public spotlight.
<P>
	This party, which forms the Government of Canada at this point, 
could have supported the repeal of that section of the criminal 
code. This party could have served Canadians but it chose not to.
<P>
	The greatest slap in the face to British Columbia residents is that 
B.C. Liberal members chose to avoid supporting the repeal of 
section 745. A murderer, who was in their own backyard, came into 
the public sphere  again. This abused the public's sensibilities of 
not only the victims but of the population of our province.
<P>
	The stated intent of the bill that we are looking at today is 
commendable: increased protection of victims of sexual assault 
and to serve better their needs in the justice system by eliminating 
any disincentive for them to come forward for justice.
<P>
	However, today I would ask what the government is doing, how 
effective it is and how selective it is in the process. As we have seen 
in section 745 and this government's treatment of that bill, very 
often justice and legislative proposals are brought forward to suit 
political purposes but do not serve the real victims, whether those 
victims are the accusers or the accused in the process. Thus too 
much legislation does not serve Canadians as a whole.
<P>
	Today I would like to focus on three areas of discussion in 
particular, the definition of sexual assault in Canadian law, privacy 
concerns of the Liberal government, and special rights based on 
historical disadvantage.
<P>
	First, the definition of sexual assault as proposed by the Liberal 
government was changed in 1988. Bill C-15 under the 
Conservative government redefined sexual assault. In doing so, the 
age of consent was lowered to age 14 from age 16.
<P>
	Today I put to the House that the most tragic victims of sexual 
assault are children aged 14 and 15 who are exploited by adult 
pimps across our country and who are virtually untouchable by our 
laws. Child prostitution in Canada rips families apart and destroys 
the lives of young people. This fact is obviously not a priority of 
the Liberal government.
<P>
	When I questioned the justice minister on March 3 he gave an 
equivocal answer to that question and obviously displayed no will 
to change, ignoring the recommendation from provincial 
governments and ignoring the incredulity of the public when it 
realized that the age of consent in Canada was 14. This issue was 
actually made worse by the Liberal justice minister who refused to 
challenge an Ontario court decision in 1995 that actually broadened 
the definition of sexual consent of children aged 14 to include 
homosexual activity. The Liberals are not only unwilling to protect 
our youth, but they would broaden the potential for sexual 
predators to destroy the lives of young people and not bring to 
account those who set about to destroy those lives for their own 
gain.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	The second issue is privacy and the Liberal government. A 
recent tour by the human rights committee on the public concerns 
about privacy brought to light that the public is woefully 
unprotected in privacy matters in Canada. The Privacy Act is 
virtually without enforcement and applies only to the public sector. 
Other  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9365"> 9365 </A></B>
<P>
jurisdictions in other countries are far ahead. The Canadian public 
is not well served in privacy matters.
<P>
	There is general scepticism about both invasion of privacy by 
private sector and public sector concerns. Privacy rules are 
subjective and serve the purposes of government priorities.
<P>
	The Employment Equity Act violates the privacy of businesses 
by making their business plans open to review procedures. On the 
other hand, in refugee hearings through privacy choices of the 
government, records relating to the individual are not available to 
the committee reviewing the refugee hearing.
<P>
	In my constituency the latest government household survey, the 
detailed census, provides a severe penalty for non-compliance. 
This invasive questionnaire sent to households invades the privacy 
of individual Canadians and is now being challenged in B.C. courts 
because of privacy concerns.
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of the House how the 
government deals with the privacy rights of children. I quote from 
a report by a government committee in Beijing which states: 
``Human rights activists applauded a Canadian breakthrough in 
Beijing that recognizes children's evolving rights to make their 
own decisions. The issue pitted the child's right to learn about 
issues such as birth control against the right of parents to prevent 
access to subjects in which they do not believe''. That is pitting the 
rights of children against parents by citing the privacy rights of 
children.
<P>
	I heard the other day about privacy rights in foster care, a 
provincial matter, but it illustrates how governments can use these 
matters to their own end. In B.C. it is illegal for a foster parent to 
inspect the room of a foster child for weapons or drugs. 
Governments seek to protect children from parents but does not 
protect those children from those who would abuse them.
<P>
	In Bill C-46 the restriction on access to complainant's records is 
limited to cases of sexual crimes. Today we recognize the sensitive 
nature and the trauma of the events that might surround them and 
we recognize the need for some privacy. However, we must also 
recognize the vulnerability of the accused if the accusations that 
are made are false but unchallenged. The credibility of the 
complainant is an important factor in all legal proceedings.
<P>
	Bill C-46 however states that the fact that the records may 
disclose a prior inconsistent statement of the complainant is not 
grounds for getting access to the document. Previously defence 
lawyers could show that the complainant had lied before. If all 
players within the legal system are not accountable, then equal 
treatment in that legal system is denied.
<P>
	Bill C-46 would also prevent access to crown records, not just 
third party sources. This is unique and precedent setting in the 
justice system. It implies special case  treatment. It implies rights 
imputed to the complainant and because they are imputed to one 
party, rights are denied to the other.
<P>
	I would put to the House that we cannot know the victim until 
guilt is established. A victim in this case can be the complainant or 
the accused. We cannot know which one could be victimized by the 
process until justice is served.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I mentioned Bill S-4 previously. It creates three new offences in 
the Criminal Code. It would make known false statements outside a 
tribunal illegal. It would make illegal proceedings that are 
instituted primarily to intimidate or injure another person. It would 
also make illegal knowingly deceiving a tribunal.
<P>
	The bill introduces the concept of accountability of the accuser 
in the process. It underlines the concept, and I will quote from the 
hon. member who introduced this bill, a concept to ``uphold the 
principle that truth is central in judicial proceedings and pivotal to 
the interests of justice''. It was introduced on behalf of those whose 
lives were destroyed or could be destroyed by false accusations. I 
know in my riding, the reputation, the family, the careers of 
individuals can be destroyed through false accusations. Those 
things cannot be recouped through any court. We must make sure 
that great care is taken for the protection of all citizens in our laws.
<P>
	The legislation is also founded on equality rights, particularly 
equality based on race and gender. This is a common theme of the 
Liberal government. It includes the concept of historical 
disadvantage.
<P>
	These arguments have fueled legislation such as the employment 
equity legislation which grants special rights by way of hiring 
quotas for women or visible minorities. As we have seen in society, 
the results of these kinds of policies have been reverse 
discrimination in the marketplace. Very great care must be taken in 
this place that the balance of justice is not re-engineered with the 
same principles. Just as we cannot make up for past discrimination 
simply by reversing the targets of discrimination, we cannot and 
should not make up for past injustice by creating a system of future 
injustice.
<P>
	Today my concerns have revolved around the definition of 
sexual assault and the lack of protection given by the government 
for our most vulnerable citizens, our children; second, the 
capriciousness of the privacy policy of the Liberal government and 
the selective response by the government in different areas of 
jurisdiction; and third, the disturbing and destructive recurrence of 
the Liberal mind-set of special rights based on historical 
disadvantage.
<P>
	The track record of the Liberal government has been one sided, 
agenda driven justice policy. I will go back to the symbol of true 
justice. It must be maintained by the  government in the best 
interest of all Canadians. The legislation requires checks and 
balances to assure fairness in the system and amendments to 
guarantee the assumption of innocence of the accused. That is basic 
in Canadian law so that the final result is that the privacy of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9366"> 9366 </A></B>
<P>
complainant is balanced but with the protection of a fair trial of the 
accused.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for Port Moody-Coquitlam for her 
very excellent speech which covered a number of very important 
points, points of reservation about this legislation.
<P>
	I wish to convey to her this information. The Canadian 
Association of Defence Lawyers has declared that if the bill goes 
through as currently written, innocent people will go to jail. The 
reason is that the bill puts limitations on what records the accused 
can obtain because it puts prohibitions on what the judge can 
request of a third party. These limitations, these guidelines, and the 
member for Port Moody-Coquitlam gave some examples, restrict 
the opportunity of the accused to have a fair trial because the judge 
does not have unlimited discretion to determine what third party 
records can be called forward.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	The member for Port Moody-Coquitlam made the interesting 
point that the symbol of justice is a female and it is sort of relevant 
to this. It would be terrible if this legislation were to go through and 
innocent people did go to jail, remembering that the symbol of 
justice is a woman.
<P>
	Nevertheless I would ask the hon. member whether she feels that 
in principle we as legislators should always protect the rights of the 
innocent versus the rights of people to privacy. In her mind which 
is more important?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer to the question is 
interesting. That the Canadian Association of Defence Lawyers 
feels that this will take innocent people to jail is of great concern 
and certainly reflects some of the concerns that I had in developing 
my thoughts with the presentation I made.
<P>
	I feel, given the conflicting needs and certainly since coming to 
this place and my involvement in different committees and 
different debates within the House, the conflict of rights at various 
points within Canadian society is more and more of an issue. There 
are basic rights and certainly the right to maintain innocence within 
the judicial process should be a pre-eminent right for all Canadians. 
The justice system is there for the protection of those who are 
innocent, law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	My concern is that this bill will-I am not alone in that concern 
obviously-trample on the very rights of those who are innocent. 
That is of great concern to me and should be a concern to the 
government obviously, even  though it may not be but certainly it 
should be to the Canadian people. I thank you for the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member for Port Moody-Coquitlam a question 
with regard to an event that is taking place outside here today.
<P>
	The mother and grandmother of Sylvain Leduc, who was 
brutally murdered in Ottawa in October 1995, are leading a protest 
in front of this place as we speak. It is just about to start. They are 
calling for the scrapping of the Young Offenders Act. They are 
saying that the balance in the justice system has been completely 
thrown out of whack as a result of changes made by Liberal and 
Conservative governments over the past 30 years.
<P>
	They feel the sentences handed down at the end of last week 
regarding the brutal murder of their son and grandson is totally out 
of line with what they should have been. It does not send the right 
message. It does not keep these people who have committed such a 
heinous crime off the street. The sentence handed down will allow 
one of the four people who committed the crime to move freely 
about, or at least to be released from any kind of detention 
immediately, and the others very soon. Some will be released 
within a few months and the one convicted of manslaughter within 
about a year and a little bit from now.
<P>
	Clearly the balance is between protecting the rights of the 
victims, the family, relatives and friends of the young boy who was 
murdered and the rights of the criminal. It is out of balance 
completely.
<P>
	The hon. member commented on that but I would like her to 
comment further. In particular, can she connect it to the situation 
we have that requires victims to take actions such as the one they 
are taking to try to bring public attention to the issue through a rally 
being held out in front of the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. 
In the very policies of this government, whether the Young 
Offenders Act or section 745, the absence of any type of support for 
victim rights in any legislation tells me that what is happening on 
the stairs of this place is too long ignored by a government that has 
its own agenda, which seems more intent on supporting the rights 
of the criminal, of looking to create a system that does not assign 
blame or accountability. It would indeed wipe the slate clean with 
early parole for someone who has committed a heinous crime 
against victims and their families. It would have that revisited on 
them, thinking more of the perpetrator of a crime than about those 
who have to live with the consequence of his action.
<P>
	It is a common theme. It is an example of an agenda driven not 
by the best interests of the Canadian public but by special interests, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9367"> 9367 </A></B>
<P>
by some unknown thought process that considers it is the criminal 
who should take  precedence in the system. That is not where 
Canadians are. That is not where the Reform Party is.
<P>
	The priority of the justice system should be the law-abiding 
citizen. It should be to keep law-abiding citizens safe to the point of 
making our streets safe for our families, for our children and for 
their children. Our policies would put that into place so Canadians 
could look forward to a safer and stronger country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for her speech. Could she comment on 
something that has been raised on both sides of the House. It has to 
do with this false memory syndrome or recovered memory 
retrieval syndrome that some people have raised as a potential red 
flag issue with this legislation because it deals with the production 
of records.
<P>
	The Canadian Psychiatric Association has issued a caution on 
this. It has said that we need to be very careful about the production 
of records because of this retrieval memory system where someone 
who is an adult can be counselled to think back into their past and 
could possibly come up with some reason for why they feel the way 
they do today based on a memory they have trouble retrieving.
<P>
	The association has some concerns about the reliability of these 
memory retrieval systems, about whether they are putting words 
into people's mouths and so on. Is that a concern, or has the 
member had cases in her own riding office, as I have, of people 
who have said that this is a very serious concern and something on 
which we must proceed with caution because lives can be 
unnecessarily disrupted if those memory retrieval systems are 
proven false?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for the 
question. I have had cases in my own riding of accusations that 
have later been found to be false based on false memory syndrome. 
They have literally torn families apart.
<P>
	There has been quite an extensive review of these matters in the 
United States. Red flags are going up all over North America that 
this is something that is very real and very destructive if not 
properly checked and balanced within the justice system. I question 
whether this bill has those checks and balances.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my 
speech on Bill C-46 I will start by making a few comments on the 
bill itself. Then I will talk more about the issue of the lack of 
balance between the rights of the accused and the criminal and the 
rights of the victims in our justice system. Then I will talk about the 
prevention of crime and the Liberal record on the prevention of 
crime, which is not dealt with in any way in this piece of legislation 
or in any other piece of legislation this government has dealt with.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	I will deal with these three areas. I will start by making a few 
comments on Bill C-46, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
regarding the production of records in sexual offence proceedings.
<P>
	This bill is intended to strengthen the protection of privacy and 
equality rights of complainants in prosecutions for a variety of 
sexual offences. The added protection is gained through restricting 
defence lawyers' ability to apply for the production and disclosure 
of private documents such as medical, counselling and therapeutic 
records. That is what the bill is intended to do.
<P>
	There is merit in this bill and I will be supporting it at least at 
second reading. I will have to see what happens in committee as the 
committee hammers out some of the possible impacts of this 
legislation before I can say that I will support it at third reading.
<P>
	We will have to see what kinds of amendments come at report 
stage. Hopefully we will have a better interpretation of exactly 
what this legislation will do. However, there is merit in this bill. 
For that reason I will be supporting the bill at second reading.
<P>
	I will not spend a lot of time talking about the bill itself. I would 
rather talk about the changes to the justice system in a general way, 
the things this bill does not deal with.
<P>
	In the past, records sought by defence lawyers have included 
psychiatric, social welfare, employment, personal counselling and 
other private records. The fear of having such personal records 
revealed is believed to be a deterrent to victims to report sexual 
assaults against them.
<P>
	That is what has been happening. There has been that concern. 
Probably a lot of sexual assaults have not been reported because of 
that. Therefore there is reason for action from the fear that such 
records may, at some future date, be called for as hampering the 
process of counselling and assistance provided to victims at 
support centres. That is part of the reason for the need.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports legislation which provides increased 
protection for law-abiding citizens and victims of crime. We 
support this bill in principle. I will talk more about some concerns 
regarding this later.
<P>
	We are also mindful of the longstanding tradition in the 
Canadian-British legal system that an accused person must have 
the opportunity to take a full and fair defence to any charges 
brought against them. Of course, that is the concern that people 
who are speaking out against this legislation are bringing forth.
<P>
	They are concerned that the accused may not be able to get a 
proper hearing with this legislation put in place. It is a serious 
concern. They are asking questions that should be asked. I do not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9368"> 9368 </A></B>
<P>
feel we have the answer to a lot  of these questions yet. We always 
must be concerned with the protection of the rights of the accused.
<P>
	It is a matter of balance. I will speak more about this later. I feel 
in general in our justice system we have a very poor balance 
between the rights of the accused and the rights of the criminals, 
people who have been found guilty of a crime, and the rights of the 
victims. The balance is not there.
<P>
	I will spend much of my time today talking about that. I have a 
few more comments on the bill itself. This is a subject that was 
brought up by the hon. member for Port Moody-Coquitlam. In 
some sexual assault cases the accused is a former spouse or a 
spouse of the accuser. In some cases we found out that charges 
were laid just to give the accuser an added advantage in a fight 
taking place between the two over child custody. We are finding out 
more and more that these accusations often are not true.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member asked who the real victim is in these cases. 
Because of the increasing prevalence of false accusations being 
made we have to ensure that there is no victim under the law until 
the case is finally proven. That is an area of concern which I know 
other speakers will address later.
<P>
	I would like to speak about two issues which are related to this 
legislation. The first is the balance in our justice system or the lack 
of balance between the rights of victims and the rights of the 
accused. The second is the prevention of crime and the inaction of 
this government in dealing with crime prevention.
<P>
	The words have been uttered and the government has brought 
forward the issues but it has not dealt with crime prevention in an 
effective way. I will speak about some of Reform's proposals in 
this area. First I will speak to the balance in the justice system.
<P>
	In general we do not have a proper balance between the rights of 
the accused and the rights of the victims. Liberal governments in 
the 1970s deliberately changed the balance in the justice system. 
No longer are the rights of the victims and the protection of society 
top priorities. As a result of change, the protection of the accused 
and criminals has a higher priority in our justice system. The 
balance is clearly out of whack. It is important that we restore the 
balance which was there before Liberal governments and 
Conservative governments threw the balance out of whack.
<P>
	In the 1970s a Liberal solicitor general said that for too long the 
top priority of the justice system had been the protection of society 
and that the rights and protection of criminals had not been made a 
high enough priority. Changes since that time have shown that 
Liberal governments believe that. They have demonstrated that in 
law time after time. They have distorted what Canadians see as the 
proper balance.
<P>
	Several pieces of legislation passed by the current government 
have further thrown out the balance between the rights of society to 
be protected and the rights of criminals.
<P>
	Bill C-65 is intended to protect endangered species of plants and 
animals. The intent is good, nobody would argue that. However, I 
have several concerns with the legislation. One of them has to do 
with a lack of balance. Another concern I have with the endangered 
species legislation is there is no compensation offered to land 
owners and land users if an endangered species is determined to be 
on their property. Under the legislation they could be required to 
pay dearly to protect endangered species with no compensation, the 
way the legislation is proposed. If amendments go through there 
will only be compensation through a charitable contribution 
process. There is no compensation, which could impose an 
incredible fiscal hardship on the land owner or land user.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Another concern is that it is a heavy handed interventionist piece 
of legislation. We have seen much of that from the government. 
What we need instead is co-operation. We found that land owners 
and land users co-operate on a voluntary basis to protect 
endangered species.
<P>
	Another concern is in the area of balance in the rights of society, 
the rights of the accused and the rights of the criminal. It is 
interesting that under the legislation someone can anonymously 
accuse another citizen of harming an endangered species. The 
person who accuses can have his or her name kept completely 
confidential. The accused under the legislation would have 
absolutely no right at any time to know the name of the accuser or 
to face the accuser in court. That is the kind of legislation the 
government is putting forth. It is not something we can accept.
<P>
	This type of legislation tramples on the rights of citizens, in 
many cases law-abiding citizens. For example, Bill C-68 on gun 
control tramples on the rights and freedoms of law-abiding 
Canadian citizens. There is heavy handed interventionist type of 
legislation in some cases and on the other side very narrow pieces 
of legislation like Bill C-46.
<P>
	I will support the legislation. I await the final examination but it 
looks like a piece of legislation that will do some good.
<P>
	The Liberal record since 1993 really did nothing to restore 
balance in the justice system. It has made it even worse in spite of 
the fact that it was not what Canadians wanted. If it was what 
Canadians wanted we would not see what we saw today, it being 
left to the mother and grandmother of Sylvain Leduc who was 
brutally murdered in Ottawa in October 1995. It was left to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9369"> 9369 </A></B>
<P>
victims, the mother and grandmother, to try to restore  balance in 
terms of sentencing and to give victims some rights.
<P>
	Young offenders who are committing vicious crimes are being 
left out to walk the streets with very little punishment. This 
certainly does not provide a deterrent for people who might commit 
similar crimes in the future. It certainly does not protect society. 
These vicious murderers are walking the streets after spending a 
little time incarcerated. We would not see this if there were balance 
in our justice system right now and clearly there is not.
<P>
	It is important to point out what Reform would do in this regard. 
In our fresh start platform we have put forth a substantial package 
of proposals to help restore balance. The first is a recognition that 
the justice system is out of balance and too heavily weighted in 
some cases in favour of the rights of the criminal rather than the 
rights of the accused.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	One way of shifting the balance proposed by the hon. member 
for Fraser Valley West was to have in law a victim's bill of rights. 
This idea is well accepted and supported by Canadians and by the 
House. A document outlined 10 specific rights that must be given 
to victims which are not there now. Although it has been supported 
by the House, including the governing party, it has been almost a 
year and nothing has happened. We have a year and half until the 
government is required to hold an election. I dare say it will not be 
dealt with before an election is called. That is very sad. It shows the 
government does not place rebalancing of the justice system as a 
high priority.
<P>
	I will read some of the points included in the bill that would help 
restore balance and give victims some rights. First, we want 
victims to have the right to be informed at every stage of the 
process, including being made aware of available victims' services. 
Routinely that does not happen. It happens for the accused, the 
criminal, someone found guilty of a crime.
<P>
	I do not know how many court cases Clifford Olson, a mass 
murderer, has before our courts right now. He knows his rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> More than 30.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> That is a sad commentary on the lack of balance in 
the system. Why should a vicious mass murderer like Clifford 
Olson have this kind of access to our justice system at the expense 
of taxpayers? They are clearly frivolous cases. Where is the 
balance in the system? Canadians are as sickened by that as they 
should be. My colleague from Fraser Valley West wants to give 
victims the same rights accused and murderers have.
<P>
	Second is the right to be informed of the offender's status 
throughout the process, including but not restricted to plans to 
release the offender from custody.  One would only think that 
would make sense. Who could possibly believe that someone who 
committed a very serious crime against someone else could be 
released without the victim's knowledge? The victims who were 
directly involved will be concerned about the release of the 
criminal who might offend again. The family and relatives of 
victims will also be concerned.
<P>
	Third, we want the right to choose between giving an oral or 
written victim impact statement at parole hearings before 
sentencing and at judicial reviews.
<P>
	I am being signalled that my time is up. I have much to say on 
the issue. I will be saying it from now until the time the election is 
called and throughout the campaign as will other Reform MPs and 
Canadians who take part in the political process. This will be a 
huge issue in the upcoming election. The lack of balance is totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What election?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> We will have an election within the next year and a 
half. The law requires it. Perhaps the member believes we should 
cancel elections altogether and make the system completely 
undemocratic. I am sure that is not what he is proposing.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that I support the legislation at second 
reading. We will see what comes out in committee. We will get 
more information on what the bill means in some areas to make 
sure there is a reasonable measure to strengthen the rights of the 
accused. Neither I nor the Reform Party can be accused of only 
being concerned with the rights of victims or the rights of society. 
We are also concerned with the rights of the accused and always 
have been. For that reason I support the bill which will help protect 
those rights.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the rash generalizations of members of the Reform Party 
of our disinterest in defending the rights of the victims are very 
unfair.
<P>
	It is absolutely fair to have good constructive debate. I respect 
that the Reform Party has always made, along with the deficit 
campaign, the issue of law and order a pre-eminent piece of its 
platform.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has amended more justice legislation in 
the last four years than has been the case in the history of the 
country. Members opposite always use the words lack of balance. 
They indicate that we on this side of the House seem to be 
defending the criminal over the victim. I represent a downtown 
Toronto riding, Broadview-Greenwood. I have the Don jail in my 
riding, the largest city jail in the country.
<P>
	Issues related to law and order, crime and young offenders are 
key issues in my community. We have made great strides in the last 
four years in these areas. To make a blanket statement that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9370"> 9370 </A></B>
<P>
government is not  concerned about issues related to law and order 
is not an accurate statement of fact. We will show in the upcoming 
election in detailed form a list of all legislation that has been 
amended.
<P>
	Is it perfect legislation? I am not standing here saying it is 
perfect. I have never seen a piece of perfect legislation on any 
issue. We all have to compromise on certain issues, but there is 
absolutely no way the government is putting the rights of the 
criminal ahead of the rights of the victim.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am more than a bit distressed the 
hon. member would make such statements. He has shown some 
good judgment in the past in many areas and is not showing good 
judgment in this area. He cannot really believe what he is saying. I 
assume he does but I find it surprising.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice amended a great deal of legislation and 
has clearly been tinkering. He has not made the changes that are 
necessary. I will raise three specific situations that have happened 
because the law is not right and the balance is not there.
<P>
	First, where is our victims' bill of rights? The hon. member for 
Fraser Valley West had a motion passed in the House about a year 
ago. Where is the legislation to put it in place? It has not even 
started through the process. It has been held up. The government 
clearly does not support it.
<P>
	Second, where is the law to prevent Clifford Olson from 
applying for early release? Where is the law to prevent Clifford 
Olson from having over 30 court cases at taxpayers' expense? 
Where is that law? It is not there. The member should be ashamed 
of himself.
<P>
	Third, where is legislation so the family of Sylvain Leduc would 
not have to protest in front of the House of Commons for proper 
balance in the justice system?
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	Where is that legislation? It is not there. That is why the protest 
is taking place. It is sad and unbelievable when these issues come 
up that Liberal members claim they have done a lot. Then you look 
at reality and it is so frustrating. We need action. We do not just 
need talk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to Bill C-46 and to acknowledge that the bill is 
intended to strengthen the protection of privacy and equality rights 
of complainants and prosecutions for a variety of sexual offences. I 
think the government is headed in the right direction on this. Since 
I am the author of the national victims' bill of rights and it has 
come up here, I want to address a few very specific instances with 
regard to that and maybe to set the Liberal member for 
Broadview-Greenwood straight on exactly what the problem is on 
the victims' bill of rights.
<P>
	From my perspective and the perspective of people right across 
the country, victims' rights are not legislation amendments. They 
are not tinkering with the details of gun law. They are not minor 
changes necessarily to the Young Offenders Act. They are not 
amendments to the Conditional Release Act so to speak. They are 
specific rights that people are looking for as a result of the criminal 
justice system, as it used to be called, becoming a legal industry.
<P>
	I can give all kinds of examples. I had been to numerous parole 
board hearings, numerous sentencing cases and on and on it goes. I 
was there in Vancouver when the insult of insults to the victims of a 
mass killer had the right to a hearing under section 745-I am 
talking about Olson-and where he actually debated with the judge 
the terms and conditions of the whole sentence. It was quite 
appalling.
<P>
	Let me give an idea of what is problem with victims' rights. 
These rights are almost considered a privilege by the government. 
They are the kind of things where the government suggests perhaps 
it will give you a little right, it will throw in an amendment to this 
particular criminal justice act, the Criminal Code, and it will kind 
of tell you it is working on your behalf. That is not what these folks 
are looking for.
<P>
	They are looking for a standard right across the country that 
applies so they know very specific things. They know that from the 
moment they become a victim, they will be told what are their 
rights, just like a criminal is today. That is all they ask. That is not 
too much to ask. That should be very quickly resolved by the 
government. It could have been three years ago and it could have 
been last year on April 29 when the justice minister said he agreed 
with it. It could have been last fall or this winter. I understand I will 
be addressing this issue tomorrow. He knows as well as I do that it 
is too late. The government is going to call an election and it will 
do nothing about this.
<P>
	When the hon. member suggests that the Minister of Justice has 
amended more justice legislation than anyone ever has before, that 
may be so, but again he has missed the point of what we are looking 
for here. I will give an example. The government brought in Bill 
C-41 on conditional sentences. I happened to attend an appeal 
hearing of a conditional sentence a few weeks ago and the 
arguments I heard from defence lawyers were really quite 
appalling. It happens that conditional sentencing exists nowhere 
else in the world. It was brought in by this justice minister. That is 
the argument I heard in court by defence lawyers and by the crown. 
I presume it is true.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Conditional sentence virtually means that the criminal will let 
off this crime on condition that it does not happen again. That is as 
simple as it comes.
<P>
	In my community, Darren Ursel met a young lady who was a 
single mom of two. He met her in a restaurant,  talked her into 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9371"> 9371 </A></B>
<P>
going to have a coke with him. He went behind the restaurant, 
locked the car door, pushed the front seat where she was sitting 
back and ripped her clothes off. He could not get an erection so he 
took his racquetball handle to her, front and back, and tore her 
open. For 90 minutes she suffered in this car, then managed to 
escape. He did not let her go.
<P>
	When in court in front of Judge Harry Boyle, who made the 
decision, he said he was tender at times. It was his first conviction 
and he was darn sorry for what he did. That is what he told the 
judge. He got a conditional sentence, thanks to this justice minister. 
That means he does no time. I believe it is the first time in my life I 
witnessed something as terrible as that, an individual not getting 
any time in prison. He had a conditional sentence.
<P>
	``Do not do it again. If you do, they might do something about 
it''. He was out the next day. In fact, that creep was in the court 
room during the appeal smiling.
<P>
	Those are the kinds of amendments that are brought into the 
House. I heard defence lawyers at that appeal tell the crown that the 
Liberals were motivated for this kind of conditional sentence 
because there are too darn many people in our jails and they are 
trying to keep them out.
<P>
	At the same time, I heard many women across the country say: 
``Do you mean they are back into raping women, sodomizing them, 
and there is no jail time?'' What that will do, quite frankly, is take 
us back 20 years and put women in the closet again in these kinds 
of cases. They will not go through what happened in this case with 
that offender, Darren Ursel, and have nothing happen to the 
offender and expose their whole private lives.
<P>
	That is why that whole issue was in the closet for years in the 
first place. There has to be punishment befitting the crime in this 
country.
<P>
	When I hear Liberals say that they care about victims' rights, I 
would like to ask where in conditional sentencing they give two 
hoots about it, given Darren Ursel's case. By the way, I have a 
petition of 13,000 names coming in here this week saying that this 
is very wrong. I agree that it is wrong.
<P>
	Do not tell me that we have a justice minister who has brought in 
a whole bunch of legislation, therefore you care about victims. I do 
not see that one iota in conditional sentences. Neither does the 
young lady whom I have had the pleasure of talking to a number of 
times. Neither will the next woman or young girl who has met the 
same fate.
<P>
	That is what is wrong with trying to relate victims' rights with 
amendments to justice. Members can go right back to Bill C-45, 
which takes the automatic right of a victim impact statement away 
in a hearing for serious offenders to get early release after 15 years. 
That is wrong too.
<P>
	We fought too many years to have people express themselves, to 
have the right to express themselves. Even today when I am 
listening to sentencing hearings and so on, I hear victim impact 
statements that are expunged. Certain sentences are taken out 
because in the defence's opinion, it may harm the character of the 
client. In fact this happened in one case when his good client 
bludgeoned to death a young lady from my riding by hitting her 26 
times. He did not want all of the expressions of the victim to come 
out in the sentencing. He had already been proven guilty.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Therefore we must look at what it is that people are asking for. 
They are not asking for a whole bunch more amendments to 
criminal justice legislation. Although that may be another request 
they have, it is certainly not the impetus behind a victims' bill of 
rights.
<P>
	I am quite appalled at defence attorneys, specifically at some of 
the comments they make about victims and victims' rights. I have a 
few quotes to illustrate this. If you really think this is where the 
country is going, then you should vote Liberal. But if you do not, 
you have to consider other options.
<P>
	Listen to these quotes about victims: ``There is no such thing as a 
victim. It's just a state of mind''. That comes from a defence 
attorney. ``Victims want someone else to fix their petty problems''. 
That comes from a defence attorney.
<P>
	``Victim impact statements are just a venting of the spleen and 
don't serve justice and should be outlawed''. That comes from a 
defence attorney. Are we getting the message? We have long past 
the time when we dealt with something called criminal justice. We 
are now into a legal industry. Let me go on.
<P>
	``Victims' rights groups have outlived their usefulness. What 
these groups are doing is pushing criminal justice policy toward 
punitive measures rather than rehabilitative measures''. This 
comes from a criminologist and it is wrong, patently wrong. I have 
not yet met a victim I have worked with who was looking for 
punitive measures. They were all looking for justice.
<P>
	The folks in Ontario, where a major battle is brewing over the 
politics of this country, should be listening to what is right and to 
what needs to be changed. The government does not give two hoots 
about victims' rights. ``Victims should not have the formal right to 
make submissions before a judge since this will result in an 
arbitrary justice system''. That is patently wrong and comes from 
another criminologist. I could give all kinds of quotes but I think 
my message is getting through.
<P>
	Victims are no longer just interested in sweet amendments to the 
criminal justice legislation, the Criminal Code as we call it today. 
They are interested in distinctly designated rights that pervade our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9372"> 9372 </A></B>
<P>
society from  Newfoundland to British Columbia. Mr. Speaker, 
how much time do I have left?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Seven minutes.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> One minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> A Liberal member wants me 
to speak for one minute but the member will get seven minutes and 
the member will listen. I am trying to say that this goes beyond 
party lines. There is something amiss in this country. Victims want 
and need rights. They are not privileges handed down from a 
government to its people.
<P>
	Let us look at the core values, the core rights we are looking for. 
Why not define what a victim is? I sat in a room shortly after a 
young lady in my riding was murdered. Her mom, Sue Simmons 
was in very bad shape, understandably so. Sian was murdered, shot 
to death. Chris, Sian's dad, could not get assistance for Sue, the 
mother, because she was not considered a victim. Sian was the 
victim, they said. That is patently wrong. If it is my daughter, my 
son, my wife, then I am a victim.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	The government fails to understand how large this movement is. 
It is compounding quickly because of the crime in this country.
<P>
	I sat with five parents on Saturday. They told me that three 
offenders were trying to get two young girls off the street and into a 
car. The victims are the two young girls, the parents, the friends, 
and on and on it goes. The government says that if it is one crime, 
there must be one or two victims. All those people are victims.
<P>
	The Liberals are in trouble. These people are joining victims' 
rights groups. The Liberals cannot understand all the noise, but 
they will have to because victims need these rights.
<P>
	Victims must have the right to be informed of what their rights 
are. That is common sense. There is no need to expand on that any 
further. So why are we not putting it in legislation?
<P>
	I heard a lawyer say it is going to cost more money to do that. 
Take a little money away from the inmates. Take away a few of the 
grants that the government is giving to its buddies in order to get 
re-elected. The money should be put where it belongs.
<P>
	Victims should have the right to be informed of the offender's 
status throughout the process. What is wrong with that? They 
should know where he is incarcerated, where he is going and when 
he is going. They should know the terms and conditions of getting 
out.
<P>
	I could tell the House horror stories about what happens when 
the victim does not know and the perpetrator, after getting out of 
prison, after changing his name, shows up on the doorstep and 
beats the living  daylights out of the victim who had no idea they 
were out on parole.
<P>
	Victims must have the right to submit unrestricted victim impact 
statements, whether they be oral or written, at sentencing hearings 
and judicial reviews. The government took that automatic right 
away from the people with Bill C-45.
<P>
	I stood in Vancouver and I watched the parents of the victims of 
Clifford Olson ask for the right to submit a victim impact 
statement. Good grief, what have we crawled down to in this 
gutter? We should be ashamed of ourselves.
<P>
	Victims should be informed in a timely fashion of the crown's 
intention to plea bargain before it is submitted to the defence. What 
is wrong with that? How many times have we heard of people 
walking into a courtroom only to find that what they thought was a 
first degree murder charge had been changed to an assault charge? 
The sentence went from life to two or three years.
<P>
	Give these folks some decency. Listen to what they are saying. 
Victims should have the right to know if a person convicted of a 
sexual offence has a sexually transmittable disease. What is wrong 
with that?
<P>
	In my riding Tasha would have liked to know that. She was raped 
by an individual who is not even a citizen of this country. Now he is 
out of here, thank goodness. This should not have to be something 
we ask for or go into a prison and beg for; it should be a right. Do 
not bother with amendments to criminal legislation on that. State it 
clearly, enunciate it, articulate it.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Victims should be informed as to why charges were not laid if 
that is the decision of the police. They should be protected from 
anyone who intimidates, harasses or interferes with their rights. 
They should have the police follow through on domestic violence 
charges once a victim files a complaint. That is not much to ask in 
this country. I am at a sincere loss as to why this Liberal 
government did not and will not move on it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
interested in the comments of my colleague from Fraser Valley 
West. Certainly of all the members of this House, not just of this 
party but of this House, he has done more to bring the issue of 
victims and victim rights to the attention of the Canadian public 
than any other member possibly in the last 25 years. I commend 
him for that.
<P>
	It is really interesting to note that in addition to Bill C-46, by the 
Minister of Justice, an act to amend the Criminal Code, the 
production of records on sexual offence proceedings, on today's 
Order Paper the Minister of Justice also has Bill C-27, an act to 
amend the Criminal Code, child prostitution, child sex tourism, 
criminal harassment and female genital mutilation, and  Bill C-55, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code, high risk offenders, the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9373"> 9373 </A></B>
<P>
Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the Criminal Records 
Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act and the Department of the 
Solicitor General Act.
<P>
	It is particularly interesting, looking at Bill C-27 and Bill C-55 
which cover so many topics under the Criminal Code, to note how 
they are really omnibus kinds of bills. What does this indicate? 
Very clearly this indicates that we are coming up to, of all things, 
an election. What the justice minister is trying to do in this 
particular case is clear the deck. What he has done with Bill C-27 
and Bill C-55 is make an omnibus collection of a whole bunch of 
detail that he could have taken care of and should have taken care 
of over the last three and a half years.
<P>
	However, what does he do? He pulls them in at the last minute, at 
the 11th hour, the witching hour of the election. Therefore when I 
take a look at Bill C-46 and the fact that the justice minister is 
finally getting around to this bill and I take a look at the fact, as the 
member for Fraser Valley West has pointed out, that a member's 
motion about bringing in a victims bill of rights has just been 
languishing, I ask myself are these amendments to the Criminal 
Code under Bill C-46, Bill C-27 and Bill C-55 actually more 
important than the member's motion that came before the House to 
give victims in Canada a bill of rights, to give victims in Canada an 
opportunity to have some say in the courts, to give victims in 
Canada some standing in the justice process.
<P>
	It is very clear in my mind that what the minister is doing, with 
massive cynicism, is a clean-up at the very last minute.
<P>
	I wonder if I could ask the member for Fraser Valley West for his 
opinion. It seems to me the justice minister has had a clear track to 
do these things. It seems to me that the justice minister has had 
opportunity after opportunity to do something on the victims bill of 
rights and in spite of the fact that there is an election coming he still 
is not doing anything on the victims bill of rights.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	He has taken the time to do his house cleaning and sweeping and 
getting it all together at the last minute on these other things. I 
wonder if the member would like to express an opinion. It defies 
logic why the justice minister did not move long ago on his motion 
for a victims bill of rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for the question. It is a very good point.
<P>
	I was informed very late last week that the justice committee 
will be discussing the victims bill of rights tomorrow from 3.30 to 
5.30. I will have an hour to make a presentation and the justice 
committee will have part of that hour to ask questions and so on, 
and victims will have an hour to make a presentation; one hour in 
front of a committee to talk about victims and that is it.
<P>
	There are more victims in the country than the government 
understands. Why are we not asking for input on this important 
issue? The answer is the government has no appetite for it. That is 
why I say to people in Ontario, where a good part of this election is 
going to fought, young people, some who know victims and are 
asking why this or that does not happen, this is important. Let us do 
it and do it right. But under no circumstances should we insult 
victims by giving them one hour in the House of Commons, less 
questions, so probably 40 minutes, to discuss this merely so that 
the Minister of Justice can say ``we dealt with victim rights'' 
during the election. That is what this is about. It is wrong and 
misleading.
<P>
	This has not gone unnoticed. Exactly as my colleague stated, this 
is where it is at. The government is bringing in all kinds of 
amendments to bolster up the sagging image of the Minister of 
Justice before the election. What the public really does not 
understand is that these pieces of amendments to legislation have 
to go through committee, come back to the House for second and 
third reading, and on and on it goes, but it will not go anywhere. 
When the election is called it will be dropped.
<P>
	We have to live with the future, and the future is with kids and 
victims and our seniors, many of whom are victims of crime.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is almost two o'clock. We will now proceed to 
Statements by Members.

	Since 1976 the forum has provided over 10,000 young

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans,

Republic of Iran have been systematically persecuted, harassed and 
discriminated against, solely on the grounds of their religious 
convictions.
<P>
	The official document in which the Iranian government sets out 
its co-ordinated policy for dealing with the Baha'i question is still 
in effect.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	The economic and social repression of this community is 
progressing rapidly. It appears that the pressure is constantly being 
stepped up, and that the Iranian government is in the process of 
gradually and systematically implementing restrictions and 
limitations on the life of the Iranian Baha'i community.
<P>
	The Baha'i community does not pose any threat whatsoever to 
the authorities of the country, since the tenets of its faith call for 
obedience to one's government and abstinence from partisan 
politics, and forbid violence in any form. What, then, is the present 
Liberal government waiting for to denounce this unacceptable 
situation?

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
many in the legal industry object to victims of crime participating 
in the courts on the following bases.
<P>
	First, it opens up another front against which an offender must 
defend.
<P>
	Second, it compromises judicial independence. Judges cannot 
resist emotional and political pressures.
<P>
	Third, it yields evidence irrelevant to the offender's case.
<P>
	Fourth, it prejudices offenders because victims may encourage 
special sentences.
<P>
	Fifth, I understand they say it is unfair to offenders because some 
victims may be eloquent speakers.
<P>
	The rights of victims are not a privilege we have to beg for from 
any government. These are rights, rights like being informed in a 
timely fashion of the details of the crown's intention to offer plea 
bargaining before it is presented to the defence and the right to 
choose between giving oral and written victim impact statements.
<P>
	It is the rights of victims first, not criminal rights.

Wilton, and Rob Wolfeld brought home the top honours to

	The firefighter combat challenge is one of the most gruelling and

The life saving skills demonstrated by the Brampton team prove its

	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Vancouver South, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to share with my colleagues some good news 
about recent agreements between the province of British Columbia 
and the federal government.
<P>
	Last month both parties settled the residency requirement 
dispute. British Columbia will be refunded $26.6 million in 
transfer payments. In the spirit of co-operation the province will 
abolish its three-month residency requirement.
<P>
	The agreement will alleviate fiscal pressures placed on B.C. 
resulting from the arrival of numerous Canadians from other 
provinces across Canada. In addition B.C. will receive a total 
increase of $67.2 million in immigration settlement funding over 
the next three years in recognition of the province's substantial 
immigration settlement costs.
<P>
	These two initiatives are evidence of the strength of the 
partnership between B.C. and Ottawa and the fact the federal 
government is responsive to the needs of British Columbians.

Ontario and Glaxo Wellcome, a pharmaceutical company located

<P>
	Ontario's 78 hospices give people with life threatening and 
terminal illnesses the opportunity to be cared for at home. The 
demand for community based care continues to grow. It is 
estimated that hospices are the largest providers of direct services 
within Ontario's voluntary health care sector.
<P>
	The survival of hospices in Ontario depends on the support and 
partnership of companies like Glaxo. Glaxo's commitment to 
hospices is in keeping with the recommendation of the National

big disputes between Canada and the United States to complicate 
the Prime Minister's visit to Washington. ``Things are very, very 
smooth'', he said.
<P>
	I guess the Pacific salmon treaty negotiations which have been 
deadlocked for years and which show no sign of coming to a 
conclusion as we approach the fishing season is not a big deal for 
the Liberals. I guess the Americans flagrant infringement of 
Canada's sovereignty and their refusal to back down from the 
Helms-Burton law is not a big deal to the Liberals. I guess the 
ongoing attack by the Americans on our forest industry is no big 
deal as well.
<P>
	We know for sure that the American attack on Canada's cultural 
policies under international trade rules is not a big deal to the 
Liberals because the Prime Minister's nephew described the 
dispute which threatens Canada's entire magazine industry as 
simply peanuts.

	We promised a National Forum on Health and the national forum

$150 million are devoted to helping the provinces put in place new 
approaches to areas like home care, drug coverage and other 
innovations.

children and the Canada prenatal nutrition program. The 
government remains committed to the values and principles of the

the Canadian government did nothing to force Americans to change 
their behaviour.

	The Bloc Quebecois deplores the government's failure to take

position to do since July 1996.

	Maybe the Prime Minister thinks he can brush up his sagging

	Canadian people are smart enough to know what this trip is

he cuts health care and keeps taxes high, he cannot simply fix his

witness to our past and are a reminder of the sacrifice made by 
those who died for love of their country and of freedom.

	I am happy to be able to report that these stone monuments are 
not our only means of paying tribute to these individuals. In

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wish to make a very brief statement that has to 
do with the question period.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Recently, we had questions about guidelines for the Speaker 
during oral question period. More specifically, the Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs proceeded with a review of the rule 
stating that one cannot, during oral question period, anticipate an 
order of the day.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In its 61st report tabled in the House on March 21 that committee 
unanimously suggested this guideline cease to be enforced. As your 
servant, the Chair will follow this advice. From now on, questions 
and answers will no longer be ruled out of order on the basis that 
they anticipate an order of the day.
<P>
	I thank all hon. members for their time.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week the Minister of Justice stated that he felt that the 
Quebec government had not been sufficiently co-operative 
regarding an anti-bikers bill.
<P>
	However, in a letter dated April 3, sent by his Quebec 
counterpart, we find the exact opposite is true. Quebec proposed 
three specific scenarios, which were discussed with federal 
officials, for neutralizing biker gangs and putting an end to this war 
that has already caused the deaths of several people. Two meetings 
on this basis between federal and Quebec officials have already 
taken place, and a third meeting is scheduled today.
<P>
	Would the minister agree that Quebec is now doing everything in 
its power to find a solution and that in the final instance, it is the 
federal Minister of Justice who is engaging in obstruction while 
trying to make Minister Bégin responsible for his own failure to 
act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, and on behalf of the 
Canadian government, this is not a quarrel about jurisdiction but a 
matter that concerns the safety of Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9378"> 9378 </A></B>
<P>
	Nearly three weeks ago, I went to Quebec City to meet my 
counterparts and mayors from the Quebec City area to discuss 
their concerns. They asked for changes in the Criminal Code. 
Since then I have been trying to respond to this request.
<P>
	At the Department of the Justice I have set up a special task force 
to deal with this matter on an urgent basis. We have now reviewed 
and examined all the alternatives for making criminal legislation 
more effective and more powerful in order to help police forces in 
their fight against organized crime.
<P>
	That is our objective, not these quarrels about jurisdiction 
between various levels of government. We genuinely want to deal 
with the core issue which is about making Canadian laws more 
effective so that we can help our police forces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, who mentioned jurisdictional quarrels? We in the Bloc 
Quebecois asked the minister to intervene because the Criminal 
Code is enforced by Ottawa, as far as we know. We never 
mentioned jurisdictional quarrels.
<P>
	What we are saying is that the minister has the full co-operation 
of Quebec on this matter and that the scenarios proposed by the 
Government of Quebec could help the minister to table 
amendments to the Criminal Code if he only had the political will. 
Is the minister waiting for Quebec to do the job for him? That is the 
question.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker. Like all Canadians, I am 
waiting for each level of government to act responsibly and make 
our society a safer place to be.
<P>
	As the federal Minister of Justice, I am responsible for the 
Criminal Code, but it is up to the province to administer justice, 
according to the Constitution of Canada. We each share part of this 
responsibility.
<P>
	I am very pleased to be able to work together with my Quebec 
counterpart. As I said earlier, I met him three weeks ago. For years 
and during the past few weeks we have had meetings with officials 
on this important matter. Next week we intend to announce the 
measures we will table to achieve the objectives we share with the 
Government of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the minister is so pleased to be working with his Quebec 
counterpart, he should inform his press secretary who does not say 
the same thing. The minister might also point out to his press 
secretary that the French legislation does not go back to 1936 but 
1992. The numbers are the same in both official languages.
<P>
	When the minister tells us that he will table amendments to the 
Criminal Code or C-17 or will bring forward new legislation next 
week, will he promise-and  we promise to do our share-to 
ensure that this bill is passed before the next election is called?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to hear the hon. 
member agrees there is some urgency involved here in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	However, as far as my dealings with Mr. Bégin, the Quebec 
Minister of Justice, are concerned, it is true that last week, I was 
disappointed by Mr. Bégin's response to my request. I merely 
asked him to clarify his position on an anti-gang bill. I asked some 
legal questions. I asked legal opinions, opinions of his 
Department's lawyers. I have yet to receive the details. So I am 
disappointed.
<P>
	Forget about the politics of the issue, forget all that because the 
real issue is to have a more effective Criminal Code to help our 
police forces. That is the objective of the Government of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, clearly, as we see again today, the minister has decided to 
do a bit of petty politicking with this and create a media diversion 
to hide his lack of political will.
<P>
	Far from simply doing something to resolve the war of the biker 
gangs, he is deliberately twisting the practical and realistic 
proposals of the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	Given that Bill C-17, an act to amend the Criminal Code, has yet 
to be passed and is supposed to resolve part of the problem, will the 
minister accept the full co-operation of the official opposition in 
amending this bill at the stage it has reached in this House to 
include in it one of the three scenarios proposed by the Government 
of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, as I said, I asked Mr. Bégin a 
number of days ago to clarify his position. The proposals put 
forward by my Quebec counterpart are vague and general. I have 
some legal questions.
<P>
	I feel it is very important in all this to avoid passing legislation 
that will be struck down or nullified by the courts in six months.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	This sort of approach would only give Quebecers and Canadians 
false hope. We must pass effective legislation that is also valid and 
constitutional. So, as I said, we intend to announce next week the 
measures we will propose, and I am very happy to hear the member 
from the Bloc Quebecois say that he is prepared to work quickly 
with us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have been calling for this legislation from the minister 
for two years now. He should perhaps pay attention and produce 
more realistic laws.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9379"> 9379 </A></B>
<P>
	I would remind the minister that he is the guardian of the 
Criminal Code and of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, and that if, with his hundreds of lawyers and the 
millions of dollars he spends in his department, he is incapable 
of drafting legislation that passes the test of the charter, the 
problem lies not with the Bloc Quebecois or the Government of 
Quebec but with the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Since he has just mentioned it, and in the light of the discussions 
he has had with the Government of Quebec in the past two or three 
weeks, will he promise that the amendments he is about to table, 
that he claims to be about to table, will be in line with one of the 
three scenarios of the Government of Quebec and will incorporate 
as well the four criteria set by the Government of Quebec to put an 
end to the bikers' war? In particular, will he promise that this 
legislation will be approved, passed and in force before the 
upcoming federal election is called?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have spent a lot of time, since my 
meeting with Mr. Bégin, meeting with those involved in the matter, 
that is the mayors of the Montreal and Quebec City regions and the 
chiefs of police. I have also spoken to the mayors and chiefs of 
police of other places, because this issue concerns Canadians 
everywhere. Gangs and organized crime may be found in other 
cities as well.
<P>
	I promise today to produce next week this government's 
proposals and measures, which will be effective as well as valid 
and constitutional.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RIGHTSOFVICTIMS">RIGHTS OF VICTIMS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the justice minister.
<P>
	It has taken a year and an upcoming federal election to get the 
justice minister to really discover victims' rights. For three and a 
half years the decisions of the Liberal government worked against 
victims and their families. Now the Liberals' pollsters are telling 
them that it is an important issue so the justice minister is all too 
eager to jump on the bandwagon.
<P>
	My question is for the justice minister. Why has it taken a year 
since we first discussed victims' rights in the House and the threat 
of a federal election for the Liberal government to finally realize 
that Reform's victims' bill of rights is long overdue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is regrettable that after so short a 
period of time in national politics that the hon. member would have 
become so cynical. It is also very sad that the hon. member is 
prepared to ignore the facts on such a wholesale basis.
<P>
	The hon. member speaks about victims. In June of 1994 when we 
had Bill C-68 before the House and the victims of crime, children, 
husbands and wives, mothers and fathers who have been shot to 
death by firearms, came to this building and asked the Reform 
Party to join with the government in doing something for victims, 
to those victims this party turned a deaf ear.
<P>
	When the government proposed changes to the Young Offenders 
Act and introduced for the first time victim impact statements in 
youth court, it was that party that voted against it.
<P>
	Finally, when the government proposed in Bill C-41 on 
sentencing to provide true restitution for victims so they could get 
back what they have lost, it was that party that voted against it. It is 
the government that stands up for victims in this country.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
should forgive him, for he knows not what he is saying.
<P>
	Section 3 of our victims' bill of rights guarantees the opportunity 
for victim impact statements at any parole or judicial hearing. The 
justice minister, who pretends to care so much for victims, slipped 
the provision into Bill C-45 that takes away the automatic right to a 
victim impact statement until the year 2012.
<P>
	How can the justice minister pretend to be a champion of 
victims' rights when his section 745 early release legislation gives 
more rights to murderers like Clifford Olson or Paul Bernardo than 
to their victims? Explain that one.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to use rhetoric when 
talking about a victims' bill of rights. It is quite another thing to 
produce actual legislation that makes a difference in the lives of 
victims. That is exactly what the government has done.
<P>
	There are a dozen examples of concrete ways in which the 
government has acted to help victims. I refer as an example to Bill 
C-46, the very intent of which is to assure confidentiality for the 
private records of victims in cases involving charges of sexual 
assault.
<P>
	Let me treat the precise subject the hon. member has raised, 
which is the role of victims in hearings under section 745. The 
government believes, and I believe, that victims should have a role 
at the hearings under section 745. It is for that very reason that 
three years ago we proposed in Bill C-41 that the right be given.
<P>
	The hon. member and his party voted against Bill C-41. Since 
Bill C-41 was tabled, the Supreme Court of Canada released a 
judgment which according to the common law, recognizes that 
judges have a discretion to allow victims to participate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9380"> 9380 </A></B>
<P>
	If the hon. member feels that any part of Bill C-45 interferes 
with the hearings of victims as such proceedings, I am happy to 
join with him in making such amendments as may be appropriate. 
In fact, last week-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Fraser Valley West.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
nice to get a word in edgewise. Based on that answer, I am 
convinced the justice minister does not understand this issue.
<P>
	If the Liberals were serious about victims' rights, they would 
have acted on the documents we tabled and debated in the House 
last April 29, or three and a half years ago when they came into 
office in the first place.
<P>
	Victims should come first unconditionally. They should come 
before criminals. They should come before privacy laws. They 
should come before the freedom of information act. And they 
should come before the political fortunes of the Liberal Party of 
Canada.
<P>
	I would like to ask the justice minister point blank today: Will he 
put victims first? Will he put their rights ahead of the rights of 
convicted criminals unconditionally in legislation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, not only am I able to say that we 
are going to do it, I am able to say that we have done it. Time and 
again when we have brought forward legislation that does it, and 
the Reform Party for one reason or another votes against it.
<P>
	As I was saying before the hon.member put further words in 
edgewise, I have already said to him and to his colleagues that I am 
happy to participate with them in making appropriate amendments 
to Bill C-45 if they believe that any such amendment will make it 
even more crystal clear that victims should have a role at hearings 
under section 745. Indeed, I wrote last week to the hon. member's 
colleague making that position clear.
<P>
	Let us work together. If the hon. member feels that the matter 
can be made clearer, I am delighted to work with him and with the 
other parties in the House to achieve that objective.
<P>
	Let it never be forgotten that time and again the party in the 
House that stood up for victims of crime, not with rhetoric, not with 
florid faces-

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SPENDINGCUTS">SPENDING CUTS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois has been saying for some  months 
now that the government has not cleaned up its own backyard, but 
has just shovelled more than half of its cuts over into the provinces' 
backyards.
<P>
	The cat was let out of the bag, recently, and not just any cat. The 
President of the Treasury Board was forced to admit in front of a 
committee of the other House, with all of his habitual candour, that 
the government would meet fewer than half of the commitments 
contained in the 1995 budget when it came to reducing the 
expenditures of federal departments.
<P>
	My question is for the President of the Treasury Board. Does he 
finally acknowledge that, based on his own statement that the 
federal departments' expenditures would be reduced by 9 per cent 
over three years, instead of 19 per cent as promised, it is the 
provinces which have done most of the work and have absorbed 
more than half of his government's cuts through this nice little 
dumping exercise?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> First of all, Mr. 
Speaker, I have never admitted such a thing.
<P>
	I have reviewed the transcription of the Senate committee 
proceedings. What I said, and I repeat it here, is that, based on the 
period from 1993-94 to the end of the program review, slated for 
1998-99, the reduction in government department expenditures is 
14 per cent, while the reduction in transfers to the provinces is 9.9 
per cent. Consequently, the federal government has imposed upon 
itself a burden that is 40 per cent greater than what it has imposed 
upon the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is not an interpretation of what he said, but an 
interpretation of what we read. In 1995, the Minister of Finance 
was talking about a 19 per cent reduction in expenditures, and in 
the last three years his department has reduced its expenditures by 
only 9 per cent for this fiscal year. That is what we can conclude.
<P>
	Now we have a better idea of why the Minister of Finance 
bought those work boots in 1994. It had nothing to do with creating 
jobs, it was to be properly dressed to operate a steam shovel for 
dumping the debt onto the provinces. That is the reality.
<P>
	I am also asking the President of the Treasury Board whether he 
acknowledges that his government has acted as a poor manager and 
whether the Quebec government deficit forecast for this fiscal year 
would be 60 per cent lower without the federal government's 
drastic cuts in transfer payments to the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, the figures in the 1995 budget are totally valid. The 
reductions in departmental expenditures are exactly as indicated, 
that is to say close to 19 per cent, and this is the case quite simply 
because we have taken money away from the departments'  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9381"> 9381 </A></B>
<P>
budgets. The cuts have, therefore, been implemented across the 
board.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance and myself issued a press release a 
few days ago, we indicated exactly how to reconcile the figures 
contained in the 1995 budget with the present ones. Without a 
doubt, once again, not only have we made the cuts announced in the 
1995 budget, but departmental expenditures have also been cut, as 
indicated.
<P>
	Reconciliation of the figures is done via programs approved in 
budgets brought down after 1994-95. This reconciliation is shown 
very clearly in the tables released by the Minister of Finance and 
myself. I hope the hon. finance critic for the opposition can at least 
check those figures.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="VICTIMSOFCRIME">VICTIMS OF CRIME</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, victims of 
crime claim the justice minister has betrayed them. He betrayed 
them through Bill C-41 when he denied them the right to make 
verbal impact statements. He betrayed them in Bill C-45 by 
denying them the unconditional right to make impact statements of 
any kind at parole hearings.
<P>
	I ask the justice minister this. Why has he added to the suffering 
of these victims? Why did he deny victims, particularly the 
families of Olson's victims, the automatic right to be heard at 
section 745 hearings?
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one thing I can certainly deny is 
that the hon. member speaks on behalf of victims in this country. 
He does not. When victims look at the record of this government 
they find in a dozen pieces of legislation grounds upon which to say 
that we have improved the law for the benefit of victims.
<P>
	In terms of section 745, as I have already told my friend's 
colleague, in Bill C-41 we provided for the victims to have a role at 
the hearings. After that the Supreme Court of Canada came down 
with a judgment that made it clear under the common law that it 
could do so.
<P>
	If my hon. friend thinks there is any part of Bill C-45 that should 
be changed to make that any clearer, and I have already told him in 
writing that I am happy to work with him to that effect, then let the 
hon. member, instead of standing in the House and carrying on with 
theatrics and rhetoric, work with us to make changes in the law to 
improve it for the objective of victims.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, of course we 
have to address the bungling of this justice minister. Under Bill 
C-41 he granted victims the right to make written impact 
statements and under Bill C-45 he took that right away from them. 
We are talking about the bungling of this justice minister.
<P>
	The minister and his government have made the claim that 
making Bill C-45 retroactive could result in a charter challenge. 
Why would the minister worry about a court challenge? He should 
be used to them by now.
<P>
	So far the justice minister's Bill C-68 has been challenged as 
being unconstitutional. The conditional sentencing provision of the 
justice minister's Bill C-41 is in court in B.C., Ontario and Alberta. 
The minister cost the taxpayers $1 million in the Airbus fiasco and 
now taxpayers may have to cough up millions more in the Pearson 
airport deal.
<P>
	Why is he not willing to err on the side of victims, even if it does 
result in a court challenge? Whose rights are more important to 
him, those of mass child killer Clifford Olson or those of the 
families of his victims?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, along with everything else the hon. 
member must struggle with, his abject inability to make 
distinctions between different cases is also a terrible burden. It is 
evident in his questions in the House.
<P>
	The challenge to Bill C-68, the gun control bill, is before the 
court. There has been no judgment yet because the argument has 
not taken place. I would venture to say that the hon. member can 
count on that bill being constitutional and valid. Those are the 
submissions we will be making before that hon. court.
<P>
	In terms of victims, I would like the hon. member to consider the 
position I put to him last week. If he thinks that Bill C-45 can be 
improved in any way to assure the right of the victim to participate 
in section 745 hearings, let the hon. member come forward and 
work with us to achieve that result. Spare us the tendentious 
partisan rhetoric in the House of Commons and work with us to 
make it better.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	On March 27, Federal Court Justice Sandra Simpson stated that 
the government's decision to impose a time limit on the Royal 
Commission of Inquiry on Somalia was unlawful, considering the 
extent of its terms of reference. In response to this judgment, the 
minister maintained his decision and went so far as to change the 
terms of reference of the commission to include only what 
happened before the Canadian troops arrived in Somalia.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9382"> 9382 </A></B>
<P>
	By unlawfully cutting short the commission's proceedings and 
subsequently restricting its terms of reference, is the minister not 
only to trying protect the military establishment but also some 
Liberal friends who are close to the government, such as, for 
instance, Bob Fowler, former Deputy Minister of National 
Defence and currently Canada's ambassador to the UN?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in his question 
the hon. member said that the federal court ruled that the procedure 
followed by the government was inappropriate. In this decision, the 
court indicated how we should proceed to ensure that the 
commission of inquiry reports only on the matters it has examined.
<P>
	Obviously, we wanted to make the situation very clear to prevent 
any confusion, such as, the government asking the commissioners 
to report on and draw conclusions respecting situations they had 
not checked, examined and heard described in testimony. That is 
what we did.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
clearly, the current Minister of National Defence has been subject 
to the same pressures from the military establishment as his 
predecessor who resigned.
<P>
	Will the minister agree that his shocking decision to change the 
terms of reference of the commission will leave several 
fundamental questions unanswered, questions that were the very 
reason why the commission of inquiry was set up in the first place?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the commission 
of inquiry has now spent more than two years examining elements 
of the incidents in Somalia which it considered to be a priority.
<P>
	As I have pointed out many times, I never commented on the 
commission's work schedule or on the way it organized its hearings 
to hear witnesses and their testimony.
<P>
	Two years, 125 witnesses and 100,000 pages of documents later, 
I am now, like all Canadians, looking forward to the report and 
conclusions of the commission of inquiry, which will probably 
make a number of suggestions that will be very useful and will do 
so soon enough that they can be used.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the court 
told the Somalia inquiry that it had every right to investigate the

Ottawa, the government changed the mandate to hide the truth from 
Canadians.

of the Liberal Party is now the policy of this government, will it

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, we should not impute motive either 
in our preamble or in our question. I would like the hon. member to 
immediately go to his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the Liberal government 
in its election red book, part two, put in the true facts of what 
Canadians have really heard from this Somalia inquiry so they 
really know what the beliefs of this government are?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to say to 
my hon. friend that the decision of the federal court indicated 
clearly that the government should spell out, in unmistakable 
language, what we thought we had done in the original request to 
bring the commission to a close by the end of June, and that is that 
we would not be asking the commissioners to report on matters 
which they had not looked into or which they did not feel were 
appropriate to report on.
<P>
	What is going to be happening is, at the end of June, after two 
years of hearings, 125 witnesses and hundreds of thousands of 
pages of documents, the commission of inquiry on Somalia will 
report on those matters it has had an opportunity to evaluate and 
which the commissioners feel are important to report on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, two years ago in 
the House the former minister stood and said we are going to get to 
the bottom of this; whatever it takes, we will get to the truth.
<P>
	The promise was made to the Canadian people, it was made to 
our troops who are out there trying to do their job, that the inquiry 
will go right to the top and get to the truth. Now we hear that we 
will change the mandate.
<P>
	With its terrible record of broken promises and utter disrespect 
for judicial hearings and quasi-judicial bodies, why should 
Canadians ever believe this government again?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member and his party, I know, have a long record of unmitigated 
support for the justice and court system of Canada. We have heard 
many times in here over the last three years the great respect 
Reformers have for the justice system.
<P>
	What I would suggest to the hon. member is that if he wants to 
find out how the Canadian forces feel about the decisions of the 
government, he might demonstrate his intestinal fortitude and go 
on to the bases in this country and-
<P>

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. Conservation 
groups are urging the government to declare the largest underwater 
canyon on the east coast, described as an underwater Grand 
Canyon, as Canada's first marine protected area.
<P>
	Using the powers under the new oceans act, will the minister 
move swiftly to designate this biologically rich and diverse region 
as Canada's first protected marine area?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows that the passage of the oceans 
act, which concentrated and focused on conservation and the 
environment, made possible the marine protected areas issue.
<P>
	To that end and before the passage of the bill, I met with Heritage 
Canada officials and spent a day with them discussing this issue, 
along with consultation with many fishermen in eastern Canada.
<P>
	As a result of that, about a month ago I made an announcement 
with the hon. Minister of Canadian Heritage which allowed for a 
marine protected area on the east coast of Canada as a test case so 
that we can develop policy and have a look at the evaluation criteria 
to make sure this system will work.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member would also be interested that with 
respect to the specific issue of the gully I have been in conversation 
with the World Wildlife Fund in the last week. I am sure that once 
the policies are developed we will be looking at this as one of our 
priority issues.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	When the Minister of National Defence tries to justify his 
decision to put an end to the Somalia inquiry, he always offers the 
same excuse of its going on too long and costing too much, despite 
the fact that Madam Justice Sandra Simpson considers that the 
commissioners have performed their duties with diligence.
<P>
	Since the commission is now limited to explaining the events 
preceding the arrival of the Canadian troops in Somalia on January 
10, 1993, how will the people of Canada and Quebec know exactly 
what happened on March 16, 1993, when a young Somali was 
tortured to death?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in the decision 
of the justice of the Federal Court, it was clear that the government 
was given certain options to ensure that the commissioners were 
not asked to report on situations they had not examined.
<P>
	Obviously, it made perfectly good sense not to ask people to 
report on matters they had no knowledge of. However, the hon. 
member is no doubt aware that the terms of reference given the 
commissioners by the government indicate clearly that they are to 
report on what occurred prior to the incidents in Somalia and on 
anything else they feel competent to comment on or reach 
conclusions about.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in limiting the commission's mandate, the minister is very 
much aware that he is in fact limiting the activities of the inquiry. 
They will not be in a position to shed any light on such important 
matters as the disappearance of 60 documents from the archives of 
the former deputy minister of national defence, Mr. Fowler. That is 
set aside.
<P>
	How can the minister continue to defend his decision to limit the 
inquiry, when we will never know what documents, which were so 
compromising, the former deputy minister, now ambassador, 
caused to disappear?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, obviously I 
have considerable respect for the hon. member, but she has just 
alleged that a deputy minister committed certain acts.
<P>
	In my opinion, she should pause to reflect before repeating such 
allegations outside the Parliament of Canada, because it is a fairly 
serious allegation to suggest that such an act was committed by a 
public official who was working at the time under the tutelage of a 
minister of national defence who subsequently became the Prime 
Minister of Canada. If the hon. member has knowledge in this 
regard, I am certain she will want to pursue her allegations outside 
the House.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy

has been asked to audit the expense account of Mr. Weatherill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
hope the auditor general looks at this expense account and the other 
expense accounts that we have raised over the years and finds them 
all at fault. This type of business cannot continue.
<P>
	We have children going hungry in Canada while Mr. Weatherill 
and others like him spend. He spent $148,000 on meals over eight 
years; one person, $148,000. That is disgusting.
<P>
	Why has the President of the Treasury Board let this abuse 
continue for the three and a half years that they have been in office? 
Will he get rid of these types of people who enjoy patronage 
appointments and abuse the trust they have been given?

	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> If they would listen maybe they would learn 
something. The problem with Reform members is that they want to 
have their cake and eat it too. If they would have voted for instead 
of filibustering Bill C-66, the bill that creates a new labour 
relations board, we could have dealt with this problem immediately 
instead of waiting. They cannot have their cake and eat it too.

<P>
	The American President and the Israeli Prime Minister are 
meeting today in Washington. They will be discussing ways of 
salvaging talks with the Palestinians on the last phase of the Oslo

<P>
	Since Israel is trying to acquire new land by going ahead with 
Jewish settlements in order to operate from a position of strength in 
the upcoming negotiations with the Palestinian authority, will the 
Acting Prime Minister agree that such a strategy will lead to an 
impasse inhibiting the peace process rather than renewing it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister of Canada is indeed in Washington, 
accompanied by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. I am sure that the

is over in order to be able to evaluate all the issues raised by the 
Prime Minister.

<P>
	Next, the minister's lawyers testified in a court of law that had 
the contract proceeded, the contractors would have lost money.
<P>
	My question is for the minister. Given that he and his new airport

rent relief, terminal 3 purchase and the grandiose spending scheme 
of the new airport authority, can the minister tell the taxpayers of 
Canada how it is in their interests to spend $3 billion on a project

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member and his party have consistently failed to 
understand the circumstances surrounding the Pearson situation.
<P>
	When we entered government in 1993 we examined the Pearson 
agreement with the private consortium and determined that it was 
not in the public interest but it was, however, in the private interest.
<P>
	We thereafter established a public not for profit corporation

authority to GTAA which is now engaged in developing Pearson

	A number of banks in Canada offer their customers certain 
benefits which are not available to all of their customers. For 
example, some banks offer rebates on services to youth and 
seniors. Unfortunately most bank customers are completely 
unaware of the benefits to which they are entitled.
<P>
	I believe my bill would remedy this situation by obligating banks 
to give notice to a customer of the bank regarding the benefits to 
which he or she is entitled. My bill would also prevent banks from 
charging any fee against an inactive bank account unless the bank 
first mailed a notice to the customer at least 30 days prior to its 
intention to charge the fee.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-46, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (production of records in sexual 
offence proceedings), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on Bill C-46, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code involving the production of records in sexual 
offence proceedings.
<P>
	Victims who have been sexually assaulted are often hesitant to 
come forward, probably because of the fear of disclosure of 
personal records which they feel would be tremendously 
embarrassing to them. We can understand that, but some of these 
charges are very real and very tragic. Lives can be ruined before 
they have even had a chance to get started.
<P>
	The question we have to ask today is: Are there those who 
hesitate to come forward because they are disturbed by the very 
public nature of the court process? It is a fact that the accused of 
any crime, especially a sexual offence, will put forward a defence 
of some nature. Of course the gloves will come off.
<P>
	In the past, defence lawyers have sought records from the 
victim's past to try to help their clients, to smear the victim and try 
to cause the victim to lose credibility. These records have included 
psychiatric, social welfare, employment, personal counselling and 
other very private facts.
<P>
	Few of us want our personal lives exposed to all and sundry. The 
fear of having such personal records revealed is believed to be a 
deterrent to victims to report sexual assault against them. Going 
further, the fear that such records may at some future date be called 
for is hampering the process of counselling and assistance provided 
by victims' support centres.
<P>
	Most of us are in favour of and support victims' rights but how 
we do it is another thing. Often in counselling the victim is afraid 
of disclosing too much for fear of the  exposure. In fact the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, when he spoke 
on Bill C-46, asked us to consider this scenario.
<P>
	A person is sexually assaulted and following the assault receives 
counselling from a sexual assault centre. The counsellor may take 
notes of the sessions where the complainant is distraught and full of 
self-doubt about why this has happened. The notes are the 
perceptions or recollections of the counsellor. They may not 
necessarily truly reflect what the victim says.
<P>
	They are not verbatim transcripts of the conversation. They are 
not statements, yet defence counsel may attempt to gain access to 
and explore those records, looking for perhaps what is in the view 
of the defence an inconsistent statement. Perhaps the complainant 
has undergone therapy for depression or child sexual abuse long 
ago and of the assault which is now subject to the criminal charges.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	It is not enough to only be concerned about the victims' rights. 
We have to be concerned that the victim, in having those rights, is 
protected even more so in that everything personal about them has 
to be looked at very carefully and that it will actually impact on the 
proceedings that are going to be followed through on the 
investigation.
<P>
	Victims' rights have long been a basic plank of the Reform Party. 
Of course we would support legislation that provides increased 
protection to law-abiding citizens and victims of crimes. Therefore 
we support the bill in principle. However, I still have reservations 
regarding the government's commitment to victims' rights.
<P>
	However, we must also be mindful of the longstanding tradition 
in our country and in the British legal system to protect everyone's 
rights. That includes an accused person's right to have the 
opportunity to make a full and fair defence to any charges brought 
against him or her. How can we as legislators ensure that the right 
to a full and fair defence is not affected or weakened through 
provisions of the bill?
<P>
	Sexual assault is a very serious offence and we must make it 
possible for victims to come forward without fear of public 
exposure of their most personal records. Yet we must also 
acknowledge that there have been instances where accusations of 
sexual assault have been found to be false. The bill must consider 
two competing or conflicting interests.
<P>
	Genuine victims of sexual offences need to be protected from 
being further violated by having their personal lives and intimate 
thoughts put before the public as the defence goes on a fishing trip 
to dredge up some unsavoury but irrelevant personal detail.
<P>
	Similarly, some persons have been wrongfully accused and must 
be entitled to all resources available to clear his  or her name. As 
you can see, Madam Speaker, there are strong arguments on both 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9390"> 9390 </A></B>
<P>
sides of this question. We are given a position in Bill C-46 to look 
at very closely and to balance very carefully the rights of all 
individuals.
<P>
	I am very concerned about the possibility of someone being 
wrongly accused because of a constituent who came to me just after 
I had been elected in 1994. A man and his wife felt some authority, 
in this case myself, the MP, should hear his story. In spite of the 
fact that he was charged, found guilty and served his sentence, he 
maintains his innocence. This man lived in British Columbia's 
north country in the 1960s when the alleged sexual abuse was 
supposed to have taken place. The alleged victim decided to come 
forward when she was 31 years of age and accused this man of 
sexually abusing her when she was seven years old. At that time the 
offender was married to the victim's aunt.
<P>
	His wife of the day said he could not have done the offence. He 
explained that at the time of the alleged assaults he was not yet 
home from his shifts at work. Yet this woman of today had a school 
friend of yesterday who testified that the assaults happened after 
school. As well, time had not been too kind to this victim. 
Apparently she had serious problems with drugs when the 
accusations were made.
<P>
	There are serious questions rising from this case which have had 
lawyers and law professors very disturbed about the chain of events 
and the lack of accountability of the legal system. The result was 
my constituent was found guilty in 1989 and sentenced. He spent 
three years in jail. He told me he could have been paroled in six 
months if he had admitted his guilt to this offence. All along he has 
maintained his innocence. He was released from minimum security 
in April 1992. Did this man get a fair trial? Is he in fact a victim? 
There were some problems with a parole officer. There were 
problems with the offender's rights being dealt with according to 
the law. Was he a victim of the court system?
<P>
	The man I met in my office was devastated by what had 
happened to him. In one thing he remained steadfast. Regardless of 
the day passes and the Christmas passes he could have received if, 
as he says, he had gone along with the system, he would not give in. 
He was innocent and he served his full sentence. Although he was a 
good prisoner and worked well in prison, he was not given any time 
off for good behaviour. He served his full sentence and all the time 
maintained his innocence.
<P>
	With a case like that we have to stop, pause and think. Is it 
possible that there are errors that slip through the cracks? Is it 
possible that in fact this man is completely innocent and was a 
victim of the system?
<P>
	I am perhaps overly concerned about the rights of the accused 
because it seems the legal system has many flaws and judges are 
not perfect. They are only human. Many of us wonder how a judge 
could accuse a three-year-old child of being sexually aggressive 
and be blamed for her  own sexual abuse. What kind of a judge 
could decide that? It makes one wonder.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Lately a man who stabs his wife many times, resulting in her 
death, all this in front of her children, is not guilty because he was 
drunk. Alcoholism is an illness. It is not an excuse. What kind of 
judge would allow it to be used as a defence, then decide in favour 
of using the drunken plea as a defence and include that reasoning in 
sentencing?
<P>
	When is everyone going to be held responsible for his or her 
actions? It seems so simple and yet we have such difficulty having 
everyone just being accountable for his or her own actions without 
excuses. The question to be asked here, in spite of the faults in our 
legal system, and maybe because of it, is this. Does this legislation 
strike the proper balance between these competing interests, the 
protection of the victim and the rights of the accused?
<P>
	Under the terms of the bill, the accused will have to pass a 
two-stage process in order to obtain the production of personal 
records of the complainant or a witness in sexual offence cases. 
The accused will first have to satisfy the judge that the records will 
likely be relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a 
witness to testify. All parties have an opportunity to oppose the 
application by the accused. The judge holds the hearings in camera.
<P>
	If the judge decides that the record in question may be relevant 
to the case, he or she orders the production of the records for 
review and subsequent decision on whether or not they may be 
used. Even if the judge rules in favour of the accused for some or 
all of the records, conditions may be attached. The records cannot 
be used in other proceedings.
<P>
	Again, it is important to point out that not all complainants are 
true victims. We are all aware of instances where complaints have 
been frivolous or malicious. Some of us are also aware of 
accusations arising from a condition called false memory 
syndrome. I heard a Liberal member speaking on it this morning, 
bringing out some facts and actual figures on it. There are cases 
where parents in their later years are being subjected to accusations 
of sexual assault that allegedly occurred 30 or 40 years earlier, 
assaults that were not recalled until the victim was undergoing 
some form of therapy, in other words a helping process. There is 
also growing evidence that these vivid memories, repressed for 20, 
30, 40 or more years, may be highly unreliable. Great care must be 
taken in accepting this type of evidence without solid 
corroboration.
<P>
	There will be concern expressed about the kind of discretion that 
is placed in judges. It is noteworthy that the judge must provide 
reasons for orders made to produce records or refusals of such 
orders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9391"> 9391 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to add here that the judge's reasons should be based 
on facts and not based on his or her opinion of what seems to be. 
I say this because again of personal experience. I have been a 
victim of the court system. In my case it was the civil court 
system, not the criminal system. Either way, we have many 
problems with the legal system, judges being not the least of them.
<P>
	In our case we had sold a family home of many years in 1980 and 
bought a small business out of receivership. Originally we paid 
insurance of what was then perceived to be the business' value. As 
the business prospered we had to increase our premiums as the 
value of the business had increased. At this time we had the 
business appraised by an experienced hotelier and his appraisal 
agreed with the insurance company's appraisal. We sold our small 
business due to a family illness at a value which was less than the 
market value of the day.
<P>
	The purchasers ran into trouble after a year and a half. The 
business was run down and they stopped making mortgage 
payments to us. They tried to sell it and even had a commercial 
appraisal of a value which was far in excess of what we sold it for. 
We went to court and obtained a judgment against them for the 
balance owing to us for our business.
<P>
	The judge of the day dealt with the facts and protected our rights 
as one would expect. We received our judgment. To stop us from 
collecting on our judgment the purchasers charged us with 
misrepresenting the sale of our business. Of course the facts were 
there to prove otherwise but the couple was successful in stalling us 
for a couple of years from collecting on our judgment.
<P>
	In the period of three years we went through three lawyers: one 
was disbarred, one was fired and the last we just ran out of money. 
So we represented ourselves in an eight day supreme court trial in 
British Columbia.
<P>
	Three days before the trial, the claimant's lawyer offered us 
$50,000 and they would drop the charge if we would take the hotel 
back. However, the trial proceeded. This new judge did not like us 
lay people in his courtroom without a lawyer. This is not just 
fiction from my imagination. This is the result of having the 
judgment read to two retired judges and two senior lawyers in 
Vancouver who all gave us the same answer.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	In fact, the judge would not let a lay person win against a senior 
lawyer. He decided we had sold the hotel for too much money even 
though all the evidence presented proved just the opposite. He said 
that we should have sold it for an amount much lower than the 
market value and he took $50,000 from us but ruled that we would 
keep our judgment.
<P>
	The judge based his decision on his opinion and not on the facts, 
thereby making it impossible for us to win an appeal on his 
decision. It appears that a judge is god in his or her courtroom. That 
is a frightening experience to  go through. He or she is 
unaccountable for his or her actions, therefore it is only through the 
reasons given in his or her judgment that we can appeal the case. If 
he had based his decision on his or her own opinion rather than the 
facts, there is no way to get a successful appeal. We had to live with 
the results.
<P>
	We now have our property back. The other couple lost 
everything which is exactly what they deserved, but the public has 
had to pay the bill for an unnecessary court case that wasted years 
of the court's time and many tax dollars.
<P>
	What kind of judge would violate our rights so badly? In the civil 
justice system, there are thousands of complaints a year against 
lawyers and judges registered with the Law Society in British 
Columbia. I am only familiar with the Law Society in British 
Columbia but I would imagine in every province in Canada there 
are thousands of cases against what has happened in the legal 
system to individuals.
<P>
	Therefore, I repeat regarding Bill C-46, there will be concern 
expressed about the kind of discretion that has been placed with 
judges. It is worth mentioning that the judge must provide reasons 
for orders made to produce records or refusals of such orders. The 
reasons would have to be read into the record or given in writing.
<P>
	Again, I ask that these reasons be based on facts produced. I ask 
the members sitting opposite to look very carefully at Bill C-46 to 
make sure that the judge has to give reasons based on facts and not 
on the judge's opinion.
<P>
	The bill also allows for the right of appeal. That too is an 
opportunity that can be played with. It must be a proper right of 
appeal.
<P>
	Generally this bill attempts to be a fair compromise between two 
very serious individual rights. Let us hope that this bill has the 
merit, that it treats victims fairly, that it may be a start on victims' 
rights that we can improve on until Reform's concerns are dealt 
with, until we have full legislation on victims' rights. Then victims 
can truly know that they matter, that they count, that when 
something terrible happens to their families, they too, not just the 
individual in the family but the person in the family who is affected 
by it, are victims. They too can be addressed.
<P>
	Motion No. 267, my private member's motion which will have 
its last hour of debate tomorrow, deals also with this matter in a 
roundabout way. That is the fact that we have private member's 
bills presented to the House, agreed on by members of the House, 
pass second reading, go to committee and then the members of the 
committee vote them down, often without any reasons as in the 
case of my bill. No reasons are given in committee. There is no 
discussion in committee on the witnesses who appear before the 
committee and the bills are not being returned to the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9392"> 9392 </A></B>
<P>
	It is very important that the House recognize the rights of the 
members who have been elected to push forward their 
constituents' wishes, that the bills that the House agrees on which 
should be presented to committee should also be returned from 
committee with reasons for judgment.
<P>
	If the justice committee or whatever committee deals with the 
bill wants to vote it down, that is fine. The reasons for voting it 
down must be returned to the House. We must understand fully. We 
must have a complete circle of democracy.
<P>
	I am also concerned about the fact that sexual abuse has 
happened in my riding as well as in many other ridings. In my 
instance, the girl was handicapped. She was in a wheelchair. She 
suffered from cerebral palsy and yet she had the courage to come 
forward. She had many people, myself included, to be beside her 
for the sentencing. She was a victim and the man she accused was 
found guilty. However, he is still in the country although he is not a 
Canadian. He has not yet been sent back to his country. We are 
following it through.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	These are issues that all of us have to take very seriously. In Bill 
C-46, which I find to be working toward the betterment in both 
cases, I would still hope that the Liberals will look very seriously at 
amendments for it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I note with interest that the Reform Party on many occasions stands 
to ask when are we going to stand up for the rights of the victims or 
when are we going to put the rights of the victims ahead of the 
accused in every single case. I think those words were used today.
<P>
	This is a good example of legislation that the government has 
brought forward to assist victims to go through the criminal 
process, to make sure that their lives are not subject to fishing 
expeditions. I am very curious to know why it is the Reform Party 
in this case, where we are doing something concrete for victims of 
crime, bends over backwards to say: ``But we still need to make 
sure the accused has a right to full answer in defence''. Why is 
there all this concern about the rights of the accused when we are 
dealing with sexual offences against women and children? Why the 
inconsistency?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the 
parliamentary secretary for his question.
<P>
	First, what the member has said is not quite accurate. We are 
very concerned about victim's rights. We are very concerned with 
the Liberals following through on victim's rights.
<P>
	I have honestly said in the House today that I recognize the fact 
that the government has put forward the bill with the purpose of 
helping. I hope that is what  happens. However, I cannot let the 
question go by without pointing out to this member that the 
government had ample opportunity to remove section 745 from the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Answer my question.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> I am answering the member's question and I am 
sorry he was out when I answered it.
<P>
	Clifford Olson has now been given permission to question the 
families of his victims. The government had ample opportuntiy to 
stop that. That is very poor. I do not know how the government can 
justify it. It had an opportunity. It even had one of its own 
members, whom it has now got rid of, came forward with a private 
member's bill which was buried in committee, just like mine. This 
member will know because this member was in that committee.
<P>
	How can this member stand and ask such a question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, earlier in the debate I raised the issue that Bill C-46 
involves prohibitions on the opportunities of the accused to seek 
information that is relevant to his defence. It was elsewhere said 
that this was not really a prohibition, but it was a limitation that 
was being talked about in the bill and that the point I raised earlier 
was entirely a question of semantics.
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of the Speaker to some 
definitions in the Oxford Concise Dictionary. For ``prohibition'' we 
find in the dictionary the definition of ``to prevent, make 
impossible''. Then elsewhere in the dictionary under the word 
``limit'' we find ``a point or line, or level beyond which something 
does not and may not pass''. Elsewhere under the definition of 
``restrict'' or ``restriction'' we find the definition of ``a limitation 
placed on action''.
<P>
	I would suggest the point that I made earlier is not a matter of 
mere semantics. It is at the very core of this debate. If we are 
talking about limitations on the rights of the accused to defend 
himself, to prove his innocence or to demonstrate his innocence, if 
we are talking about limitations or prohibitions, they are one and 
the same. We are limiting the right of the accused to defend himself 
and we run the risk of sending an innocent person to jail.
<P>
	I believe that is something we should give the highest priority to 
prevent.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Madam Speaker, unfortunately I was not 
listening when the member spoke earlier. I thought I made it clear 
in my speech that I was very concerned the accused receive a fair 
trial and have all the information they need at their disposal to get a 
fair hearing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	I spoke of the case of a man in my riding. I am positive in my 
experience with human nature and having spoken to him he was 
innocent. Yet he was charged, found guilty and spent three years 
in jail.
<P>
	I agree with the member that exact wording is a very serious 
matter. I hope I have made a suitable comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, in the opinion of the hon. member from the 
Reform Party is it coincidental that a bill like this one shows some 
recognition of victims rights? Is it coincidental that the bill is 
coming forward on the eve of an election?
<P>
	Why in her opinion have the Liberals completely ignored 
victims rights for 3.5 half years? Why does it take an impending 
election for them to bring forward some politically expedient bills? 
Are they in fact taking advantage of victims for political reasons?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Prince George-Bulkley Valley for his question.
<P>
	It would appear that this is the case. Unfortunately we have not 
seen any victims rights bill being addressed by the government 
over the last 3.5 years. Now an election is pending and suddenly we 
see Bill C-46. The government has ignored essential victims rights. 
I cannot stress how serious a violation the Clifford Olson case was.
<P>
	We are heading to a general election. We know victims rights 
could have been dealt with beforehand. There have been serious 
cases in my time in Parliament when we have asked for assistance. 
Victims have rallied on the Hill asking for assistance.
<P>
	It seems the Liberal government addresses the issue a bit but 
never enough. That is a major concern to me and I find it in every 
piece of legislation.
<P>
	In viewing all the legislation that has come from the Minister of 
Justice I have found its purpose appears to be more litigation for 
lawyers. That can be found if we look carefully at every piece of 
legislation that has been passed since I came to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am certainly pleased to address the bill before us.
<P>
	As the Reform member for Mission-Coquitlam mentioned, it is 
interesting the issues of victims are becoming more prominent in 
the rhetoric of the Liberal Party. Bill C-46 has some benefit for 
victims, especially sexual assault victims.
<P>
	Before I get into the specifics of the bill, a question was asked of 
the justice minister today dealing with victims. Of course the 
justice minister went on and on.
<P>
	We on this side of the House and members of the public who 
were watching heard a somewhat revealing dissertation from the 
justice minister on how his party  has supported victims over the 
3.5 years it has been in Parliament. The justice minister related to 
several bills which were introduced allegedly dealing with support 
for victims of crime.
<P>
	He mentioned Bill C-41 which deals with granting victims the 
right to make impact statements. That is a very key issue for 
victims. They must have their day in court. There is no question 
about it. However in our current system that is not happening.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	The justice minister made the proclamation that the Liberals 
gave victims the right to introduce their victim impact statements 
in court. Almost in the same breath Bill C-45 was passed which 
took that right away. The court sits in the same position it did when 
this began. The victim no longer has the right and the discretion is 
granted to the judge. He decides whether or not the victim can 
introduce the statement.
<P>
	I have listened to section 745 hearings concerning early release 
for those who have committed first degree murder. Victims have a 
real struggle trying to tell their story at those hearings. The judge 
can even edit the victims' statements.
<P>
	The judge tells the victim what he or she can or cannot say. Yet 
the accused can get up on the stand and clearly state all his feelings 
and even reconstruct the events that put him in jail. That is what the 
jury hears. There is no real opportunity to cross-examine the 
accused because the trial has long passed and the witnesses are not 
there to support or deny the story.
<P>
	The justice minister talked about Bill C-68 and what it has done 
for victims. What has it done for victims? The bill is quite intrusive 
into the lives of law-abiding citizens. It will create more victims as 
opposed to helping them. The bill is an intrusion into the lives of 
law-abiding gun owners, yet the justice minister claims that it will 
support victims. I would like to know how the gun control bill will 
limit the use of firearms in crime. I have not yet heard a plausible 
answer from that side of the House.
<P>
	The justice minister talked about Bill C-55 which deals with the 
incarceration of dangerous and violent offenders. The fact is that 
violent offenders will still be released on parole. As has been 
already pointed out, they will be able to victimize the community 
again. The violent and the dangerous will still be released under 
Bill C-55, the bill that is supposed to get tough on crime.
<P>
	I hesitate to speak on some of the other bills which allegedly 
support victims. With the five bills I have mentioned the chances of 
victimization occurring is greater now than it was before the 
Liberals formed the government.
<P>
	Bill C-46 is intended to strengthen the protection of privacy and 
equality rights of complainants in prosecutions for a variety of 
sexual offences. There is no  question there needs to be some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9394"> 9394 </A></B>
<P>
revision, but I caution members opposite including the justice 
minister that false accusations have been made by those claiming 
sexual abuse. Witnesses, even expert witnesses testifying in sexual 
abuse cases, have pointed the finger at the so-called accused when 
the expert witnesses have also been sexual abusers.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	What have been the results? In those cases would an innocent 
person be tossed into jail upon the expert testimony of a witness? I 
do not think the justice minister or the entourage of lawyers under 
his purview have really thought about some of those situations. 
False accusations have been made time and time and time again.
<P>
	One must admit that when it comes to some of the sexual abuse 
charges which have been laid not all complainants are true victims. 
I have had privy in some of my investigations as a police officer to 
realize that. Whether they be children, male or female, some 
people have come forward with false accusations of sexual abuse. 
Those are difficult investigations to involve oneself in. It is 
difficult to lay out all the information. On the other hand I have 
seen very legitimate complaints laid and unfortunately no 
conviction in court.
<P>
	As a precautionary measure it is always good to have 
corroborative evidence when it comes to sexual abuse accusations. 
I remember one investigation that involved children and a high 
ranking member of the community, a high profile person. The 
accusation was made by a young lady some 10 years after the 
offence. It is not that she had forgotten about the incident. It had 
happened and had a psychological effect on her. Obviously it had 
been pushed to the back of her memory. Through counselling it 
actually came forward and the accusation was reported to the 
police department.
<P>
	A decision has to be made on the part of an investigator to 
release the name of any high profile person because the impact on 
the individual's life could be very substantial. It could be 
devastating. It could lay his whole life to ruins. I have seen that 
happen too.
<P>
	The accusation was made. The investigator made the decision to 
release the name of the abuser, the high profile person who had 
committed the act. The outcry from some in the community was 
substantial: ``How dare you do this on the statement of one 
person?''
<P>
	Investigators are trained. There are some good ones. Some may 
not be as experienced but there are some good investigators in 
criminal abuse or sexual assault cases. There were some very 
important consistencies in the woman's statement that caused the 
investigator to release the name of the accused. With that came 
dozens and dozens and dozens more. There were young victims and 
some older victims who had been abused by the individual over the 
years.
<P>
	The end of this story clearly indicates the need to have a good 
investigation and qualified investigators. All the information that 
can be made available should be made available to the courts. It 
should all be laid out on the table for cross-examination. It could 
include some of the past of those who are making the complaint. It 
should not be shut out completely.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	This particular incident resulted in the conviction of the accused 
person. There was a group of individuals who refused to accept the 
fact that he was guilty of such an offence, and they still believe that 
to this day.
<P>
	The accused ended up pleading guilty to a number of charges and 
he did his time. Justice, I might point out, was nearly served had it 
not been for the fact that they released him early. An abuser is an 
abuser and I believe that information should come forward in its 
finest form.
<P>
	Let us go to the fact that there could be a false statement made. 
Some have made accusations against teachers, pastors and others 
holding high profile positions in society some years after the 
alleged incidents have taken place. Some of the accusers have had 
questionable backgrounds. Some had fantasies they have expressed 
to others that I think would definitely be relevant to the case at 
hand. I think this is the cautionary side in restricting some of this 
information because it could mean the difference between guilty or 
not guilty.
<P>
	This legislation as it is struck has two built in safeguards in 
examining the past record of a subject that some may feel is 
relevant. If the first goes to the judge, is he or she the one who 
should have the final say in deciding whether this information goes 
any further? Given some of the comments from the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam about the decisions and the viewpoints of 
some judges, I have a major question about that because he would 
be the one deciding whether the background of a particular witness 
is suitable to enter as evidence into court.
<P>
	This individual judge, as mentioned by the hon. member for 
Mission-Coquitlam, certainly has given rise to another concern. Is 
each judge in himself or herself suitable in making that decision of 
what is relevant and what is not? There is a standard drawn up by 
the prosecution that testified before the committee. It is called the 
likely relevance standard. There is a requirement here of whether it 
is sufficient. The concern expressed by the prosecution was that 
there is not enough definition in this whole area of relevancy when 
it comes to the background or the records relating to some of the 
witnesses. Her statement in the end was that for the courts the 
decision is going to be business as usual.
<P>
	In other words, because it is not defined as it should be, the lower 
courts will go on as if nothing has changed with the odd exception 
that there is going to be an objection somewhere along the way 
maybe by the crown  or the defence over one of the decisions that is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9395"> 9395 </A></B>
<P>
being made and it will be appealed through the appellate court and 
up to the supreme court.
<P>
	Here is a qualified prosecutor who has been in the business of 
producing the arguments necessary to defend or to protect the 
innocent. This also recognizes that there is a protection and a duty 
of care required on the part of the accused because ultimately it is 
the prosecution and the defence who really have the same goals, at 
least in an ideal sense, that is what our courts should represent. 
They should have the same goals, to find the guilt or innocence of 
the accused.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Here is the prosecutor very concerned with the definition of 
likely relevance when it comes to the decision made on the part of 
witnesses and their backgrounds being tossed into the lap of one 
individual, the judge who will evaluate it. She has concerns that it 
is not really going to do the job.
<P>
	I listened to a number of those witnesses and I have to say that I 
believe her statements in testimony were the most relevant to the 
case. They were the most significant when it comes to the shortfall 
of Bill C-46.
<P>
	On that point I can say that Reform has certainly analysed the 
bill. We have some concerns and reservations about the bill, 
especially in relation to the records of those people who will testify. 
With some reservations, at this point we are going to support this 
legislation. However, as a cautionary note I think this whole area of 
witnesses or accused testifying in court and making accusations 
against individuals has not been fully addressed by Bill C-46.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to 
begin by telling you what the Reform Party stands for in case 
members opposite do not understand.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports a judicial system which places the 
punishment of crime and the protection of law-abiding citizens and 
their property ahead of all other objectives. Reform also promotes 
greater emphasis on assisting victims of crime.
<P>
	When we look at this bill we find it is much like many that we 
see in this House. It has a good concept and a number of very good 
points which we could support very easily. However, then there is a 
whole bunch of mush and that mush is what the problem is, 
particularly when we are talking about our judicial system. There 
are so many things left out and so many fudge words that are left to 
the interpretation of the bureaucracy and the courts. That is what 
the problem is and what the people on the street are saying about 
the justice system.
<P>
	When we look at this we find that same sort of problem. We want 
to ensure that we do not create new victims. We want to be sure 
there is protection for the  victims and that we uphold the rights of 
the accused. Obviously that is what a justice system is supposed to 
do.
<P>
	However, the confidence in the justice system is just not there. I 
really want to point this out as much as anything. As members 
know, I am not the justice critic and am not involved in the justice 
committee, but in my riding over this past couple of weeks I had an 
example which I think brings closer to home than anything else 
what people are saying about the justice system and their total 
frustration with it.
<P>
	To do this I want to set the stage so that members will understand 
what I and the people of my community went through and the 
frustration they have in the justice system. This could happen in 
anybody's constituency in any part of Canada, but this is a factual 
example of what happened to me.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	A pedophile was to be released into our community. Initially we 
were not to know who it was, where he was going to be staying, 
what part of the community he would be in. However, because of 
some circumstances that I will explain, the decision was made that 
his picture would be released and his name would be given.
<P>
	This individual had offended nine times previously. This 
individual was a pedophile, as I mentioned, and had served his full 
time on his ninth conviction. He had entered a rehabilitation 
program but was removed from that rehabilitation program 
because he was considered by the other participants and by the 
instructors to be too violent to stay in that program.
<P>
	He had served his time and now the ruling of a number of people 
was there for all to see. The prison officials said that he would 
likely reoffend. The psychiatrist who examined him said that he 
will reoffend, that there will be a tenth victim. The parole board 
said he would reoffend. His ex-wife said he would reoffend.
<P>
	The RCMP stood in front of a packed gymnasium of parents and 
said that this man will reoffend, that each time his offences get 
more violent, that young parents out there, the two or three hundred 
of them, we will see a tenth victim.
<P>
	I have never been so proud of a group of people in my life, 
thinking of the emotion they were going through. Their children 
were potentially the next victims.
<P>
	They showed compassion for this individual. They did not talk 
about vigilante tactics. They did not talk about running him out of 
town. They said what is society, what is government doing for 
people like this?
<P>
	The answer of course was he has served his time. Yes, we know 
he will reoffend and yes, we had to release him. I do not know that I 
could have been as calm and reasoning as the parents in that hall 
that afternoon at five o'clock. A lot of them came right from work 
to this school gymnasium, some of them with their little kids  and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9396"> 9396 </A></B>
<P>
said ``what can we do?'' The RCMP said this person will reoffend 
and that they must streetproof their children.
<P>
	A lot of us in this place have children. This person attacks three 
to six-year-olds. He likes three to six-year old female children. 
They say that they will streetproof a three-year old.
<P>
	This child's whole future is in front of them. If they tell this 
young child the truth and tell them never to talk to strangers, 
emphasizing the danger, they could affect this young child's 
personality for the rest of their life.
<P>
	Young children three years old do not remember everything they 
are told by their parents. What is the answer? Many people stood 
up and asked the RCMP whether they could do something? The 
answer was no, they were there to carry out the law.
<P>
	Can Mr. Politician do something? He makes the laws. Can he 
protect our children from a nine time offender being released into 
our community? Can he talk to the justice minister?
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	By the end of today I expect about 175 letters written by parents 
in the community of Oriole Park in the city of Red Deer, just one 
little place. Those 175 parents are sending a message. They want 
something to happen. They cannot accept that we cannot do 
anything. They will not accept that from us any longer.
<P>
	We finally had his picture circulated. That is not done very often 
but it was done. The police have offered to train parents in child 
proofing and go to all of the schools. However, I do not think I will 
ever forget the genuine fear in those parents' eyes. I trust that the 
justice minister and the justice committee will think about that fear. 
The victims are not necessarily just the person who has been 
attacked. I consider that the people of the community are now 
victims of our justice system.
<P>
	The justice system needs to be reformed. It needs to be changed. 
It needs to be representative of what people want.
<P>
	I have a letter which probably sums up almost everything that we 
are talking talk about today. The letter is written by a young 
teenager who lives in the community. The only thing I have 
changed in this letter is the exact address and so on because I 
believe I should protect her exact name and address. However, she 
has given me permission to use it because it tells us exactly what 
people think of the justice system and these sexual predators.
<P>
	It states: ``It is 5.30 in the morning. I haven't had much sleep. 
How about you? How do you expect me to sleep at night when a 
potentially dangerous creep lives in our area? That is right, Kevin 
Valley lives in our area.
<P>
	``The creepiest part is he got out of jail two days earlier than he 
was supposed to. Where is he now? Nobody knows for sure except 
for him and his mother.
<P>
	``What really blows my mind is the police and his therapist know 
he is a very dangerous man. He is an unstable man. They know he 
will reoffend and they say he will probably kill somebody. If he is 
that dangerous, why is he being let back into the community, 
especially into the neighbourhood where he lives, three blocks 
away from an elementary school?
<P>
	``There are more children in this neighbourhood now than there 
were three or four years ago. This man needs to be 
institutionalized, not put back into the community in which I live.
<P>
	``Twelve years ago when my parents bought our house who knew 
the neighbourhood would be one so dangerous? We can't go into 
our back yard for fear of a mean German Shepherd whom the 
owners are afraid might jump the fence. Now we've got a child 
molesting potential killer and all round creep living in our area.
<P>
	``You have no idea how scary this is''.
<P>
	Remember this is a teenage girl writing this letter. ``I no longer 
feel safe stepping outside of my home. The whole neighbourhood 
had to change our way of living Friday when we heard that Valley 
had been released from the Bowden penitentiary. We have to keep 
the doors locked, especially if we are home alone, keep the blinds 
closed at night and we can't answer the door at night if we are home 
alone, unless we are expecting someone.
<P>
	``Even when we have to be careful, these are just some of the 
new house rules that have been put into effect. Others include not 
walking down the back alley, making sure we come home with 
friends if it is after dark. If we are driving home we make sure the 
person driving us home waits until we are safely inside.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	``Does that sound like a fun way to live? Let me tell you, it is not. 
One man gets a second chance''-actually it is his ninth 
chance-``but everyone around him loses their freedom. A good 
deal for Valley but not such a good deal for the rest of the 
neighbourhood.
<P>
	``Something else that is scary is being home at night by yourself. 
Every sound makes you that much more scared, especially if those 
sounds are coming from outside. The house never sounded or felt 
so strange as it did last night when I was home alone.
<P>
	``At night when the doorbell rings, I jump. This is totally 
ridiculous. Boy, am I so glad Oriole Park is such a safe community 
to live in and to let children play knowing that there is a potentially 
dangerous threat lurking somewhere close by. Gee, that sure makes 
me feel better.
<P>
	``How can our judicial system not carry this thing any further? 
Why do they have to wait until he reoffends  or until he kills 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9397"> 9397 </A></B>
<P>
somebody, at which time it will be too late because somebody's life 
may be taken to keep him locked up? This creep who could not be 
rehabilitated and who served his jail term is released back into the 
community because he paid his debt to the community.
<P>
	``Well, try telling that to the parents and/or loved ones of the 
person who is either killed or molested by this person some time in 
the near future. All that because the law says he served his time and 
they cannot keep him locked up any longer.
<P>
	``It is really soothing to the soul knowing that Valley will 
probably kill somebody. And we are supposed to be able to sleep at 
night? I do not think so. The law was thinking of only one man 
when they let that creep out of jail, not the population of Red Deer, 
especially not the people residing in Oriole Park. Maybe our 
well-being does not mean much to them. But why wait until he 
kills?
<P>
	``My parents were always telling us kids-I have an older 
brother and a younger sister who grew up in this 
neighbourhood-to say no to drugs. Drugs were always the big 
thing in school. Now we have to worry about the creep in our area. I 
would much rather have someone walk up to me and offer me drugs 
than to see that person's face in our area.
<P>
	``Hey, if this guy is potentially dangerous, does that mean he is 
packing a gun, or maybe a knife, maybe both? That is something to 
think about now, isn't it?
<P>
	``This creep does not deserve to be back in our community. He 
does not deserve to be let back into any community. He needs to be 
institutionalized. Put him somewhere, lock him up and throw away 
the key''.
<P>
	I read that entire letter because I have talked to this person. As I 
have said, she is a young teenage girl. That letter represents a lot of 
what I heard. I talked to parents and they are asking: ``Why is the 
criminal justice system not working?'' Obviously it is happening in 
a lot of places. There are a lot of reasons why we do not trust the 
criminal justice system. I have just mentioned a few of them, but 
we could go on and on about this but I know I cannot do that.
<P>
	If I had to list some things, Bill C-68 would be one. There are 
many people who are in favour of gun control. But the way the bill 
was designed, the search and seizure aspect, the orders in council, 
the lack of anybody saying it is going to stop crime, created a 
serious question about the judgment of the justice system and the 
minister.
<P>
	I have been involved with and followed the Somalia inquiry. A 
judge said: ``Yes, you have the right to examine all of the areas. Get 
this thing cleared up once and for all so that we can go on''. Then 
we have the defence minister saying: ``No. We will change the 
mandate. We will not get to the bottom of this torture, murder and 
possible cover-up. We will not do any of that. We will just change 
the mandate''. Therefore, the  government changed the law so that 
the inquiry does not go to its natural conclusion. The historical 
danger of that sort of thing happening, where governments 
disrespect the legal system to the point where they will actually 
change it when there is a ruling they do not like, is a pretty scary 
scenario.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	The Olson and Bernardo situation, the section 745 situation, has 
touched people as well. Why did this legislation not get changed 
three years ago so that people like Olson would not have the 
opportunity to go before a judge?
<P>
	The parole board patronage appointments that have gone on for 
years have brought about questions with respect to the judicial 
system, as well as the refusal to change in any substantial way the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	The point that I am making is that people have lost confidence in 
the system, and not just in the judicial system. I was at the Pearson 
building today and saw a report which indicated what Canadians 
think about Canada and what foreigners think about Canada. Of 
course we all know what we think about Canada. It is the greatest 
country in the world. We want to save it, although it needs a lot of 
fixing. Only 51 per cent said they were happy with government. 
This was a government survey. Forty-nine per cent of Canadians 
are not happy with government.
<P>
	We have a problem which ultimately will lead to apathy. 
Ultimately people will give up on the system. When that happens 
democracy is in real trouble.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to my colleague's comments. The one 
thing which stood out was his taking the time to read the letter. The 
reason I draw the attention of the House to the reading of the letter 
is because all Reform Party members believe there is more 
common sense in the average coffee shop than there will ever be in 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	The letter poses some very interesting challenges. This kind of 
letter would never be read by the Liberals in the House. The letter 
represents a legitimate point of view from a young person in my 
colleague's constituency. If that constituency was represented by a 
Liberal-and there is a hot place that might get awfully cold before 
that would ever happen-we could count on the fact that the letter 
and the expressions of the people in that constituency would never 
be heard in this Chamber.
<P>
	Why is it, when it comes to a criminal justice issue like this, that 
we do not get a balanced point of view? Why is it that we always 
get the totally homogenized version of the justice department that 
ends up rendering toothless the things that are required in order for 
us to bring back a proper balance to society?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9398"> 9398 </A></B>
<P>
	The writer of the letter has posed a very serious concern which 
is reflected in every constituency, whether the Liberals want to 
admit it or not.
<P>
	I would ask my colleague if he could give us some thoughts on 
what are some of the very practical, down to earth ways in which 
we could start to address this problem, not as a position of our 
party, but thoughts that are simply common sense by which we 
could enter into a dialogue with Canadians. That is what the 
Reform Party wants to do. It wants to include Canadians' thoughts 
in the process so that the Chamber for once will become 
meaningful.

	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, the point is very clear. 
This is not a political item. This is an item of concern to all 
Canadians. I used an example from my constituency but it could be 
from any of the 301 constituencies.
<P>
	We need to find an answer. The long term picture is to look at 
what has happened to society to create people like the person I am 
talking about. We have to go right back to birth and all the things 
that can happen. Instruction on parenting would help not to create 
victims and criminals. The big picture is one of long term planning 
and getting back to what went wrong to create such people.
<P>
	There must be an immediate answer for an individual who has 
committed nine offences and who everyone says will reoffend. I am 
sure he does not like the fact that everybody is talking about him 
and saying that he will reoffend. The pressure put on the individual 
not to reoffend is phenomenal. We could let it be quiet and not tell 
anyone, but that is not the answer because nine other times he has 
reoffended. We must be protected from the individual. For his own 
protection he cannot be put into the general population.
<P>
	I do not mean we should build jails or throw away the keys. I 
mean we should look at it with some compassion. We must find an 
answer. We cannot let the things that have gone on continue to go 
on. People are saying we are not doing our job. They mean all of us. 
They mean that 295 of us are not doing our job when this sort of 
thing happens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for Red Deer for his comments today.
<P>
	He referred to the fact that we have to deal with certain things 
right now and that we should look at what in a person's background 
makes the person a criminal; in other words what is the cause of 
crime. We have heard this so often from Liberals and 
Conservatives over the years that I get sick just hearing about the 
cause of crime and looking at the cause of crime. However I think 
we should.
<P>
	In our campaign material we deal with the whole issue of the 
cause of crime. We recognize that families should be considered a 
top priority. We say that parenting has real value and should be 
recognized in legislation. We say there should be zero tolerance of 
family violence. We say that child pornography and child 
prostitution should be dealt with in a very firm way. Other 
proposals have been put forth.
<P>
	Could the hon. member comment on how we can deal with the 
cause of crime?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, as I mentioned, the 
immediate problem we have to deal with right now is that these 
kinds of people must not be out in the general population.
<P>
	What about the big problem? It is a long term process. As the 
hon. member mentioned we need to go back to family and some of 
those values. There is a bill in the other place that says we cannot 
spank. That indicates the Liberal thinking that has caused the 
problems we now have. We have to make changes that will help the 
family. We could have tax deductions that favour one parent or the 
other staying at home with their children, that do not make it so 
necessary for them both to get out and earn full incomes. We have 
to do things like that because of what has gone wrong with our 
system.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	I certainly do not know all the answers but we are looking at 
them. We are saying that we should emphasize family and the 
things that happen when children are young. We should talk about 
what happens in the education system. We need to work on all 
those things collectively in the House as opposed to participating in 
partisan politics.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to return to Ottawa today to take 
part in debate on some of the issues facing the country. I am happy 
to see so many Reformers and so few Liberals in the House today. 
Maybe they are watching their leader play golf on closed circuit 
television.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I ask the hon. 
member to refrain from referring to members being in or not in the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> I apologize. When Reformers were elected in 1993 
and prior we said to our constituents that if the government put 
forward a bill worthy of support we would support it. Even though 
the frequency of a good piece of legislation coming from the 
Liberal government is about as often as a comet goes through the 
skies, we have here a piece of legislation that is worthy of support. 
It might be coincidental that the Hale-Bopp is flying across the 
skies right now and a good piece of Liberal legislation comes 
forward.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9399"> 9399 </A></B>
<P>
	I may give it too much credit when I say good. It is acceptable 
because it goes some way to providing some changes to the 
criminal justice system in relationship to how records of victims 
can be brought into the court.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-46 is to strike a fair balance between the 
rights of the victims and the rights of the accused at sexual assault 
trials. In past trials of this nature defence lawyers would often ask 
for a complainant's psychiatric report, reports from the Children's 
Aid Society, social welfare, school and employment records, as 
well as personal diaries and journals.
<P>
	There is no doubt that in this country as in many countries there 
are some very unscrupulous lawyers in the practice that have taken 
the opportunity and privilege of asking for all these records and 
proceeded in the case not to try to prove the innocence of their 
client but to try to win the case. They take any little piece of 
material they can from the records and attempt to discredit the 
complainant. It is not a popular way for defence lawyers to deal 
with crimes like these. However defence lawyers are demanding to 
see these records sometimes to provide a full and fair defence of 
the accused. Too many times defence lawyers have used this 
information to directly, viciously and unscrupulously attack the 
complainants in crimes, which is very wrong. It is one of the 
reasons many Canadians rank lawyers below politicians, in 
particular Liberal politicians.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	It is understandable why some people who have been sexually 
assaulted have been reluctant to come forward and press charges. 
They know what goes on in the courtrooms. They have seen 
evidence in the newspaper and in the media of complainants being 
viciously attacked by defence lawyers who have obtained records 
that are years old, have asked the court to look at the record and 
have said that the person is not credible in any way because of 
something that happened 32 years ago.
<P>
	They are on the attack, attack, attack. It does not matter whether 
the evidence against their client is overwhelming. They may know 
that if they rely on the evidence to try to show their client's 
innocence they could very well lose the case. They go on the attack 
and unscrupulously use records of the complainants.
<P>
	There is a need for legislation to balance the right of the accused 
to a full and fair defence and the right of the victim to privacy. I 
would suggest that the latter is of prime importance in this case.
<P>
	Bill C-46 tries to strike that balance by establishing a two-step 
process that would deal with defence lawyers obtaining these 
records. The complainant's lawyer is given the ability to object to 
certain arguments during the in camera hearings. The judges have 
to be satisfied with the argument put forward by the accused for 
orders to be sent out. If the judges feel some of the records are not  
relevant to the case they can refuse to let them be introduced.
<P>
	Under the Canadian justice system defendants have a right to a 
fair trial. Unfortunately most trials show little sign of any type of 
justice or fairness, particularly when it comes to victims of crime.
<P>
	Having sat in this 35th Parliament I know that victims rights are 
not something the Liberal government understands or has ever 
been prepared to deal with.
<P>
	The Reform Party has pressed the Liberal government and the 
Liberal justice minister over and over again for the last 3.5 years to 
take some action on the issue of victims rights. Our suggestions, 
our comments and our private member's bill on the issue have met 
with deaf ears on that side of the House.
<P>
	It is coincidental again that there might be another comet 
coming. On the eve of an election, in the 11th hour before an 
election, all of a sudden the Liberal government and justice 
minister recognize there are victims of crime in society. Lo and 
behold they are to become overnight the champions of victims 
rights.
<P>
	I do not call that giving Canadians and victims of crime a fair 
shake. I call that exploitation of victims. Were there not an election 
pending the Liberal justice minister would not be dealing with the 
issue. He knows the Reform Party has been effective in dealing 
with the issue, in bringing it to the public's awareness and in 
bringing the lack of sensitivity of the justice minister to the 
public's awareness. He knows, his Liberal strategists know and 
their campaign managers know that they had better show they are 
trying to do something. They had better give some sort of illusion 
that they are trying to do something.
<P>
	Some time this week the Minister of Justice and the Liberal 
government will make a mock attempt to show they are the 
champions of victims rights, but Canadian people are a lot smarter 
than that. They are not going to buy this facade that the Liberal 
government and the justice minister are putting forward.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Speaking of private members' business, here is a good example 
of the Liberals' lack of recognition of victims of crime in this 
country. My private member's Motion No. 78 to strengthen and 
enhance deterrents for people who drink and then jump in their cars 
and drive was passed in this House. It was adopted by the House in 
February.
<P>
	This is a crime that kills 1,800 people a year currently, injures 
some 90,000 people a year currently and costs Canadians billions 
of dollars because people drink and drive in this country and they 
have not had adequate deterrents and governments have not 
addressed this.
<P>
	This motion is sitting on some shelf somewhere. A motion that 
deals with a crime that is 100 per cent preventable, a motion that 
deals with a crime that kills  some 1,800 people a year, about four 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9400"> 9400 </A></B>
<P>
and a half times more people than murder, a motion that deals with 
a crime that injures some 90,000 people a year and creates untold 
misery for the victims of this crime is sitting on some shelf because 
this Liberal government does not have the backbone to deal with it. 
So much for the recognition of victims rights in this country. So 
much for the concern of this Liberal justice minister for the victims 
of crime. The people of Canada will not be fooled by this facade 
that is coming.
<P>
	Motion No. 78 would not be the first time the Liberal 
government ignored the will of Parliament when it comes to 
strengthening the justice system and putting victims first.
<P>
	The House passed a private member's bill, and I am sure the 
chairman of the justice committee will remember this one, Bill 
C-226, which would have abolished section 745 of the Criminal 
Code, thereby denying killers an opportunity at early parole. No 
one in the House can forget the passing of Bill C-226. No one can 
forget it but there are many in the House, including the Liberal 
justice minister and the Liberal chairman of the justice committee, 
who can easily ignore it. They cannot forget it but they can ignore 
it.
<P>
	Once this bill passed, at the direction of the justice minister, it 
sat in limbo at the justice committee for about two years. It was 
never dealt with even though it was the will of the House, even 
though millions of Canadians across the country wanted this bill to 
be enforced. Finally the committee tried to scrap the bill. It tried to 
scrap it but it failed. It remains before the committee to this day 
and yet will never be brought forward before the committee 
because it is not the will of the Minister of Justice, nor probably the 
will of the Liberal members on the justice committee.
<P>
	The passage of the bill was the will of Parliament. The fact that it 
was the will of Parliament does not matter. The fact that it was the 
will of the House does not matter one bit to the Liberal justice 
minister because it does not fit in with his Liberal philosophy that 
individuals are not responsible for what they do because it is 
society that made them that way.
<P>
	Let all victims of crime in this country, let all people who fear 
for their safety, let all law-abiding citizens who have concerns 
about the safety of their family and children hear this. The Minister 
of Justice said in this House not a few months ago that the number 
one priority of the criminal justice system in this country is the 
rehabilitation and the reintegration of criminals into society.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	That is exactly what he said in this House. The average Canadian 
is out there saying that punishment for crime does not count. 
Protection of our society does not count. The rights of victims do 
not count.
<P>
	What counts is the philosophy of the Minister of Justice and his 
friends in upper York, in Toronto, as they sit around sipping 
cappuccino and discussing how society is so tough on everyone 
that criminals are a result of society and should not be treated too 
badly. That does not count.
<P>
	It was no surprise that Bill C-226 did not get very far once it was 
adopted by this House. It does not fit into the philosophy of the 
Minister of Justice and many of these Liberals opposite.
<P>
	Victims rights groups fully backed Bill C-226 but that does not 
matter to the Minister of Justice. It does not matter to the chairman 
of the Liberal justice committee. Canadians from across the 
country were on national television imploring the Liberal Minister 
of Justice to deal with this bill but that does not matter.
<P>
	People who live in Winnipeg-St. James stood up in the media 
and said they want section 745 of the Criminal Code abolished but 
their member of Parliament for Winnipeg-St. James came to this 
House and said that basically he did not care what the people in his 
riding said, that he did not care that the people in Winnipeg-St. 
James said they wanted section 745 abolished. He does not care 
about that. ``The Minister of Justice said that it would not happen 
and I am a good Liberal and it will not happen''.
<P>
	To dodge criticism, the justice minister brought in some half 
baked measures with respect to amending section 745, measures 
that only require killers to jump through a few more hoops before 
applying for early parole.
<P>
	These are good. One of the amendments would ensure that serial 
killers who murdered after 1997 would not have access to a 745 
review. That is not bad. Sitting in prisons in this country are several 
serial killers who are perfectly at liberty to spend taxpayer dollars 
and bring back tragic memories of the victims of crime. We are 
going through the Clifford Olson thing. They do not fit into this 
bill.
<P>
	The justice minister said that we cannot do that because there 
will be a court challenge. I do not care if there are a dozen court 
challenges. Clifford Olson should not be allowed to apply for early 
parole and the Liberals across the way know it.
<P>
	Their amendments were nonsense and that is why the Reform 
Party voted against them. They were nonsense and they did not in 
any way reflect what the Canadian people wanted. That is why the 
Reform Party voted against them.
<P>
	These Liberals across the way are saying that Reformers vote 
against all the good things they put forward. When they put through 
something good we will support it. However, this bill we are 
talking about now is just milk toast.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9401"> 9401 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberals had plenty of time to address victim rights since 
their election in 1993 and they have not done it. Now an election 
is looming and it is time. Let us throw a few little carrots out there. 
They want to create an illusion that they really mean it.
<P>
	That is nonsense. The Liberals tinkered with sentencing 
amendments and introduced a reverse onus provision with respect 
to the Young Offenders Act, transfer to adult court. In the end, 
justice is not served.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	We could go on and on to talk about conditional sentencing. That 
is a wonderful one. In Alberta a man fired a gun at his wife in an 
attempt to kill her. Fortunately he missed. He was given some sort 
of a Mickey Mouse conditional sentence to do some work in the 
community.
<P>
	In B.C. a man convicted of sexually assaulting his 11-year old 
babysitter once a week for three years is given some sort of a 
Mickey Mouse conditional Liberal sentencing type provision.
<P>
	A conditional of sentence of two years was handed down to a 
B.C. man who raped a woman in his car because this type of 
sentencing fits into this Liberal philosophy.
<P>
	It is a travesty the way this Liberal government treats victims of 
crime in this country. Their bleeding heart approach to punishing 
people who commit crimes is a travesty.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was hoping to hear how the Reform Party members were 
going to vote or whether they support or do not support Bill C-46.
<P>
	I cannot figure that out. Bill C-46 is a major initiative to deal 
with issues of great seriousness to victims because of the numbers 
of these types of crimes and the number that have been prosecuted. 
It turns out that most of the victims are female.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member could let us know if he is going to 
vote for Bill C-46 in the same way he voted against the gun bill, 
which all those victims wanted, and against Bill C-41, which 
victims wanted, and other initiatives that we have taken. Is he 
going to vote for or against Bill C-46?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Madam Speaker, if the hon. member had been 
listening to what I said she would have clearly heard me say I 
intend to support Bill C-46.
<P>
	Certainly this is far from a major initiative, for goodness' sake. 
If this bill is a major initiative to the hon. member, the chair of the 
Liberal Justice committee, then this country is in a lot more trouble 
than we think it is.
<P>

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SITTINGRESUMED">SITTING RESUMED</A></H4>
	The House resumed at 5.21 p.m.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Before the interruption the 
hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley had the floor. He 
was giving a response to a question. I invite him to resume his 
response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. chairman of the justice 
committee asked me if we were supporting Bill C-46. I said that 
bill has some merit and in all likelihood we will be supporting it. 
Then the member asked me why we did not support Bill C-68. 
There is quite a contrast in credibility in those two questions.
<P>
	I want to clearly say to the chairman of the justice committee and 
all Liberal members that the reason the Reform Party did not 
support Bill C-68 was it was a completely redundant piece of 
legislation. It had no value. We are inclined to support bills which 
have value, but that bill had none.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party, I included, stood in the House day 
after day debating Bill C-68 and we implored the Minister of 
Justice and all Liberal members to give us one substantive piece of 
evidence that Bill C-68 would stop the criminal use of firearms and 
would fight crime in the country. If they had been able to do that, 
perhaps we might have supported the bill. However, in all the hours 
of debate on Bill C-68 the Minister of Justice was unable to answer 
that question. He was unable to provide one shred of evidence that 
the gun control bill would do any good for the country or would 
prevent one crime in the country involving a firearm.
<P>
	Everyone in Canada knows that the reason is law-abiding 
citizens do not commit crimes with firearms. It is the crooks who 
commit the crimes. I cannot imagine one crook in this country who 
gives a darn about the Liberal justice minister's gun control bill.
<P>
	Therefore he was unable to reply to that question, as he has been 
unable to reply to many questions. Today the hon. member for 
Crowfoot asked him some great questions in question period and he 
was unable to reply.
<P>
	As we have done so many times in representing the people of 
Canada, we have asked pertinent questions, meaningful questions 
on justice issues, on behalf of victims of crime, on behalf of 
law-abiding citizens, but the Liberal government is lost somewhere 
in space with the Hale-Bopp comet and is not with it when it comes 
to justice issues.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak this bill. To put the chair of the justice 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9402"> 9402 </A></B>
<P>
committee at ease, I anticipate that I will be supporting this bill 
when it comes to a vote. This bill, which deals with the production 
of records in sexual  offence proceedings, attempts to find a 
compromise between conflicting interests on an important topic. 
Although, I would argue with the chair of the justice committee 
that this is hardly the kind of stuff that will make women, children 
and families feel more secure in their homes tonight. I do not know 
that is going to happen, but it is a bill we will be able to support 
because it deals with the very important matter of records in sexual 
offence proceedings.
<P>
	There is no doubt that of all the crimes committed in Canada, 
and there are many of them and none very nice, the one that does 
strike fear in most people more than any other is sexual crime. It is 
no accident that around the world when an invading army comes 
into another land it will plunder, steal and burn the houses, but 
when it wants to degrade people and treat them as less than human 
it will often commit sexual crimes against that population. We have 
seen that recently over in Europe. Certainly in Africa and other 
places it is common to wars. Part of what makes it a war against 
humanity is the degrading nature of sexual crimes.
<P>
	This bill attempts to find that balance between the right of a 
person who has been accused of a crime to have the right to 
cross-examine the accuser. On the other hand, in times past the 
lawyers have often gone on a fishing expedition. Rather than seek 
information that is germane to the topic and the case, they end up 
with a fishing expedition that asks for everything. It asks for diaries 
and letters. It goes into a person's past which sometimes has 
nothing to do with the case and is totally irrelevant except that it 
strikes fear into the heart of the person being cross-examined.
<P>
	This bill tries to find the balance between when the accuser 
needs some protection from that fishing expedition and when the 
person being accused has the right to say ``hold on, I am innocent 
and I need the right to cross-examine''. This bill attempts to find 
that balance. There are competing interests.
<P>
	Persons have been wrongfully accused of sexual crimes in this 
country and in others. It is only right that they be allowed to defend 
themselves and use all the systems they can, all the 
cross-examination that is necessary in order to bring our the truth, 
because the truth is what a court case should get to. This bill does 
seem to find that balance. Like all bills, it is not perfect but 
perfection eludes most of us so there is enough good in this bill that 
it should be supported.
<P>
	I will point out a few concerns in terms of records that I hope the 
minister will monitor in his regulations and in the administration of 
this act. In September 1996, I wrote to the minister about this bill. I 
told him about a constituent of mine who came to my office 
because of what they call memory retrieval technique. It has been 
used by some psychiatrists and therapists to try to get to old 
memories that have been buried deep in the  subconscious and to 
try to bring them up to see if they need to be examined in the light 
of current facts.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	They brought up the case of a child of theirs who claimed that 30 
or 40 years previously had been sexually assaulted. They had no 
memory of it but a therapist had convinced them that it must have 
happened and therefore they needed to bring charges against the 
father in this case.
<P>
	The Canadian Psychiatric Association has cautioned that this can 
be, in the production of records, a real problem in a criminal case. 
There is quite a bit of documentation suggesting that these kinds of 
memories are often a fabrication of a so-called victim. There is no 
defence for the accused.
<P>
	Sometimes there will be no other witnesses. There is 30 or 40 
years of silence between the supposed infraction and the current 
date of someone suddenly remembering something. It is no wonder 
that some of these people, like the father sitting in my office, who 
ask, ``what is my recourse? How can I defend myself when an 
accusation is made right out of the blue?'' I have asked the minister 
to respond to these concerns as it applies to Bill C-46 and to 
so-called retrieved memories.
<P>
	The sixth recommendation of the Canadian Psychiatric 
Association suggests that the reports of recovered memories which 
incriminate others should be handled with particular care. I have 
yet to have a response from the minister on exactly how he is going 
to handle that part of the records ``with particular care''. I hope that 
he will respond before this bill becomes law. Six or eight months 
have gone by and he has not responded to this.
<P>
	I am told that he has a nine month waiting list with respect to 
answering his letters. Now we are being asked to vote on these bills 
some six or eight months after I have asked some pretty important 
questions and I have as yet to see the answers. I hope he is going to 
respond quickly.
<P>
	The next thing involves records of sexual predators. I have 
brought forward a private member's bill in response to some 
33,000 names on a petition that I have been presenting over the last 
couple of months. It is with regard to the preservation of records of 
those who have committed sexual crimes.
<P>
	Right now those records go into what is called CPIC and become 
part of an accessible file for day care workers or people working 
with children who might want to have access to it to see if the 
person applying for a job has a criminal record.
<P>
	The problem in the private member's bill I brought forward is 
that those people who are pardoned from their sexual crimes have 
their records removed from the CPIC computer record system. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9403"> 9403 </A></B>
<P>
would ask the minister if that is wise. I suggest that someone who 
has committed a  sexual crime, especially against children, even if 
later pardoned, should have a record of their crime somewhere in 
the system.
<P>
	The record does not necessarily have to be common knowledge 
but surely there must be some way of maintaining it so that if 
something comes up later and that person is again accused of a 
crime, there is some way of making sure that person's record is not 
just wiped clean. There is a price to pay when you are convicted of 
a crime and part of that conviction I believe should be that your 
record stays in the computer and is there for concerned parties to 
access.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that sexual crimes are the most odious of 
crimes because they treat someone as less than human. They treat 
them as an object and as a way of degrading someone. They are 
often hurtful physically. The emotional damage affects not only the 
victim but also the victim's families and co-workers. As was the 
case in my town of Abbotsford, when the so-called Abbotsford 
killer was on the prowl and had assaulted and killed one woman 
and left another for dead, the entire town was affected by it. It got 
so bad that no one would attend sporting events for fear of their 
lives. Even high school students were told not to go out in public 
unless they were in large groups and stuck together. It can terrorize 
an entire town.
<P>
	Although this bill when it comes to sexual records will be 
relatively easy to support, there is much left to be done by the 
government when it comes to the protection and enhancement of 
victims' rights.
<P>
	The government for some reason seems to be reluctant to deal 
harshly with the most hideous of crimes. I do not know why but it 
does not elevate it to the level it should be elevated to which is to 
treat the perpetrators of these crimes like the animals they are. If 
they need to be locked up for some time then we have to lock them 
up. Often they cannot be treated. They are habitual criminals. They 
are sometimes only caught after they have assaulted many victims 
and many families are ruined. In my opinion, the government does 
not seem to take that seriously enough.
<P>
	I will bring this case forward again because it happened in my 
area. A fellow by the name of Darren Ursel confined a lady from 
my area in a car and sexually assaulted her for 90 minutes using the 
handle of a racquetball racket. He terrorized this woman for 90 
minutes. One can only imagine the terror, the physical damage and 
the awfulness of that crime.
<P>
	They caught Darren Ursel and at his trial the judge, Judge Harry 
Boyle, said that because Mr. Ursel did not have a criminal record 
and that he showed apparent remorse for what he had done that a 
conditional sentence would be passed and he would not have to 
serve time. He was back on the streets that very same day.
<P>
	What am I supposed to tell this lady after the hideousness of that 
crime when it is reported in the paper that the judge felt that Ursel 
seemed to be sorry and if someone is sorry it is good enough and 
they can go back on the street again the very same day? What am I 
supposed to tell this woman who comes to see me or when people 
who know her come to see me?
<P>
	I will tell the House what is happening. In my area there is 
another woman I know who has started a petition drive to remove 
that judge from the bench. She is so outraged, as are the people in 
Abbotsford and Chilliwack, that they believe that judge does not 
deserve to sit on the bench any more. How can anyone say that if 
the guy feels sorry that it is okay and that is the end of the issue? 
What does it take to get time in jail for one of these perverts?
<P>
	As I mentioned, this is the worst of crimes. That person may 
never recover psychologically. Her family may be destroyed. Who 
knows what the effect will be on loved ones and relatives around 
her? An entire community again puts another lock on the door and 
bars on the window because that person gets out on the street the 
next day. What does it take to have something treated as a serious 
crime in this country? What could be worse than that? Short of 
killing somebody, what can be worse than that? I do not know what 
the government expects. What does the government want before it 
starts to treat it as a serious crime?
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	That is where I have trouble. The bill is a small thing. It is easy 
to support. Let us get it over with and we will do it. But when we 
have cases like this, where we see many lives being ruined, I see no 
support from the minister. As a matter of fact his bill allowed for 
the conditional release sentence to be issued for this guy. I see no 
compassion in that. I see no empathy for the victim. In fact I am 
outraged that the judge said: ``If you feel sorry, no time in jail''.
<P>
	A colleague from Prince George-Prince River told me of a case 
where someone was released from jail for a particular crime, drove 
400 miles through the night, got back to where his estranged wife 
was in a house somewhere, broke down the door, sexually assaulted 
her and left her for dead on the kitchen floor. The judge decided 
that it would be too disruptive on the family to put that guy in jail 
because he would not be able to make his alimony payments. The 
judge turned him loose.
<P>
	What kind of a message does that send? To me, it sends a 
message that a sexual crime is not all that serious. What the heck, if 
the person does not have a previous record the first one is free. The 
first one does not count. If you get caught after that you had better 
be careful because you have a record. But the first one does not 
really count. Even if a person uses a racquetball handle on the 
victim it does not matter. That is okay. That is the message that is 
being sent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9404"> 9404 </A></B>
<P>
	It says that as a victim your life is destroyed likely. You will 
probably go through life needing counselling help, but that is okay 
because you are just a victim and the first one does not matter, 
so you just have to roll with it and get on with life. That is a sick 
attitude. It is a sick response to a victim who has been trivialized 
by the current justice system.
<P>
	Most victims of sexual crimes are female, but not all. As we see 
on the news all too often, many young boys are also assaulted. It 
sends a message to people who are often not physically strong 
enough to fight back. I will put it that way. I think that is a safe 
thing to say. They cannot outrun, they cannot out wrestle, they 
cannot get away from the perpetrators of these crimes. Often they 
are people who abuse a position of authority in order to force 
somebody to do something sexually that they do not want to do.
<P>
	What does it say to people the way the current law is? It says 
sexual assaults are not that serious. You just have to shrug your 
shoulders and accept them as something that happens in society 
and if you happen to be the poor unlucky person who is assaulted, 
these things happen. We just have to be understanding toward that 
guy because as long as he is sorry, we will turn him loose. That is 
not acceptable.
<P>
	In my riding the difference between four years ago when I first 
started campaigning and today is that almost every door that I 
knock on has a sign saying: ``This place is patrolled by a private 
security agency. This place is protected by an alarm system''. The 
doors are always locked. People often will not come to the door any 
more. That is all in a short three or four years.
<P>
	They can say on the Liberal side that crime is in decline. That is 
just not true. The rise in violent crime between 1960 and 1995 went 
from 200 incidences per 100,000 to 1,000 incidences. Worse than 
that is the many that do not get reported. People say: ``If the guy 
who so badly abused that woman gets nothing, if he gets turned 
back on the street the next day, then if I go in with just a simple 
abuse case,'' if I can call it that, ``what are they going to do? Laugh 
me out of the police station''.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	Serious crime needs to be treated seriously. Under the current set 
of laws it is not. It needs to be changed. The Reform Party will put 
the rights of the victim first. It is high time the Liberal government 
did so. Bill C-46 is easy to support, but let us get serious about 
serious crime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
interested in some of the comments of my colleague relative to the 
issue of where there has been a rise in crime and what is going on as 
far as statistics are concerned. I was also interested that the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice interjected by 
saying that there had been a decrease.
<P>
	There are realities and there are perceptions. Both reality and 
perception do not go along with what the parliamentary secretary 
said. There are figures and there are statistics that can be used in 
many ways. The Liberals have gone out of their way to use figures, 
statistics and other things that do not necessarily reflect reality to 
their own benefit.
<P>
	This is the third time I have been on my feet today. Every time I 
rise I ask the same question. There are 50 constituencies in Canada 
where people seem to find access to their members. Their members 
in turn come to the House and reflect the realty of what is being 
said in coffee shops, on street corners and around kitchen tables. I 
cannot believe the same concerns we in the Reform Party 
hear-and we do listen to the people-are not the concerns being 
expressed to the Liberal members of the House. I find that 
absolutely inconceivable and absolutely unbelievable. Liberal 
members for whatever reason will not reflect those realities to the 
House. Clearly they have not reflected those realities to the justice 
minister.
<P>
	The Reform Party has taken a look at the issue. The number four 
step in how we are to put Canada back together again is that we will 
make the streets safe again. That has to happen.
<P>
	The bill takes a step in the correct direction. We commend the 
justice minister in the fact that he has taken a step in the correct 
direction. We condemn the justice minister that it is just one of 
many steps that should have been taken long before now.
<P>
	The Reform Party would shift the balance. We would shift the 
balance. We would shift the balance of the rights of criminals to the 
rights of victims and law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	We do not understand why the justice minister, who has the 
ability to make the changes that are essential to make our streets 
safe, will simply not do that. We do not understand why he is taking 
mincy steps forward.
<P>
	The Liberals certainly seem to be well established in the track of 
calling an unnecessary election. I believe the Prime Minister will 
be announcing it on April 26 for the vote on June 2. We do not 
understand and most Canadians do not understand why the Liberals 
would do that. They have a majority. They have the mandate to 
govern. We do not understand why they will be going to the people 
on June 2.
<P>
	Because we are undoubtedly going into an election the member 
for Fraser Valley East will be up against some poor piece of cannon 
fodder who will run for the Liberals in his constituency. Does he 
have any idea what in the world that candidate will be able to say to 
defend how it is the justice minister took it to this point? The 
minister has had 3.5 years to get his act together and he has botched 
and taken mincy steps all the way along.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, in some ways I am a little nervous of 
my Liberal opponent. He is the local mayor of Chilliwack. In one 
sense he may be appealing to the prison vote. Prisoners can vote. 
Perhaps he will pick up a couple of thousand votes there.
<P>
	I do not think so because of what the mayor of Chilliwack said as 
soon as he became a candidate. He is now the official candidate for 
the Liberal Party. Mr. Speaker, you will want to listen because he 
will be one your co-runners in the upcoming election. He said that 
section 745 must be eliminated and that he would work hard to 
eliminate it as a Liberal member of Parliament. He said that 
Clifford Olson should never see the light of day and all pedophiles 
should be hung by the neck until dead.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> You are kidding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> No, no. This is a Liberal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> He really said that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> He said that. That is interesting. All pedophiles 
should be hung at the end of a rope until dead and not just Clifford 
Olson. They should be round up. It would clean out the prisons. Is 
that not interesting?
<P>
	It is a new Liberal philosophy. I heard of running on the left and 
then ruling from the right, but this guy is not satisfied by just 
hanging Clifford Olson, which many people might agree with. He 
said we should round up the pedophiles, drop them through the old 
six-foot drop and see how many come out the other end.
<P>
	I asked him whether he knew what happens when people get to 
Ottawa with such tremendous ideas. People get to mention them 
once. A little birdie comes along and says that they have a seat for 
them. It is called the back corner next to the wall, just one step from 
nowhereville. That is what happens to a Liberal who comes up with 
that kind of nonsense.
<P>
	It is interesting. It is not enough that he wants to do the old long 
necktie stroke on these guys. The next thing that happened was in 
an adjoining riding, what used to be Fraser Valley West. The hon. 
member for Fraser Valley West will be running against a fellow by 
the name of Peter Warkentin who is a good Liberal. He said that 
they would work to abolish section 745 because that is what the 
people want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> You are kidding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> No, no. Now we are starting a little crescendo here. 
It is a wonderful thing. They can say anything they want when they 
are running because they know darn well that none of it will come 
to pass with this  current minister. The current minister laughs at 
people who ask to abolish section 745.
<P>
	Mr. Gary Rosenfeldt phoned me in my office the last week we 
were here and asked us to keep the pressure on the minister. He is 
so out of touch with reality that he thinks he is right. He tells the 
victims of Clifford Olson that it is too bad, that Olson will taunt 
them, that is what they have to put up with and that is just the way it 
is. He tries to blame the Reform Party and all that stuff.
<P>
	The worm is turning. In their own ranks now, at least two in B.C, 
Liberals have had an Epiphany, a change on the road to Damascus. 
They come forward now advocating the elimination of section 745. 
At least one of them said not just hang all the beggars but hang all 
the pedophiles.
<P>
	The local school trustee got a hold of me and said that he was a 
parole officer with 60 pedophiles whom he monitors and works 
with in the community. He asked whether the local mayor would 
round them all up and have a public hanging. What is it with these 
Liberals?
<P>
	I will say what it is. The Liberals will say anything they think 
they need to say to get elected. When the get on that side of the 
House they will do whatever they darn well please. Liberals have 
no interest in the rights of the victims. Liberals have no interest in 
true justice. Liberals say that sexual offences are one free one for 
the road. Liberals will do that.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	That is why the people in my riding are writing letters to the 
editor saying: ``It is about time. If you are going to run as a Liberal 
you had better act as a Liberal. That kind of nonsense will not get 
you to first base. You cannot try to win votes by threatening to hang 
everybody in town, knowing that the justice minister will tell you 
to be a good little boy, shut up and sit in the corner''.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-27, in Clause 1, be amended by deleting lines 20 to 29 on page 3 and 
lines 1 to 7 on page 4.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see that the government 
has decided to bring Bill C-27 back to the House for final 
consideration and passage.
<P>
	Could members of the Reform Party be asked to be a little 
quieter, so that I may continue? We gave them our attention, but the 
debate is over for them now.
<P>
	This is a bill covering three topics: sex tourism, child 
prostitution, criminal harassment and female genital mutilation. I 
think that it goes in the right direction, but I deplore the fact that the 
government has not agreed to all our suggestions, which were all 
based on comments made by witnesses who appeared before the 
committee.
<P>
	I myself introduced two private member's bills on sex tourism 
and female genital mutilation that were more in line with the 
wishes of the witnesses heard.
<P>
	Today, the Bloc Quebecois is proposing an important 
amendment to Bill C-27 as it relates to sex tourism. The Bloc 
Quebecois' purpose in introducing this amendment is to remove 
from the bill a completely new provision that did not appear in the 
original text and that was quietly slipped in by the standing 
committee during clause by clause study of the bill.
<P>
	Once again, the government has acted at the last minute, without 
notice, to impose upon us a measure which changes considerably 
the scope of the original bill. I would like us to take a closer look at 
this little trick that the government is trying to perform.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to remind the House that the purpose of 
the new provisions on sex tourism is to allow the prosecution in 
Canada of Canadian citizens who go abroad to sexually exploit 
children knowing that they have little chance of being prosecuted, 
let alone punished.
<P>
	Since the people of Canada and Quebec do not condone the 
sexual exploitation of children by their fellow citizens, whether 
these children live in Canada or elsewhere, the government is 
seeking to change the Canadian legislation to include an exception 
to the usual rules so that those who commit such acts outside our 
borders can be punished. As we can see, the objective of this 
measure is to send a clear message to all Canadians. The message is 
clear indeed: do not touch children;  respect for children and their 
physical integrity are very important to us.
<P>
	I said this was an exceptional measure. It is exceptional in that, 
according to the usual rules of law, each country is sovereign 
within its own territory and no other country can interfere with 
what goes on within that territory.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	In other words, when a Canadian citizen travels abroad to 
sexually exploit children, it is up to the authority in the country 
where the crime occurred to press charges. Unfortunately, 
governments in several of the countries where child sex tourism is 
widespread do not have the legislation, the manpower or the 
political will to put a stop to this type of abuse.
<P>
	This is why Canada is taking its responsibilities and finally 
fulfilling its international commitments concerning children rights. 
With this bill, the Canadian government is getting the means to sue 
its own citizens once they are back from their little trips abroad. We 
support this principle, but now the government has introduced a 
provision whose results will be in conflict with the goal we are 
trying to reach here.
<P>
	This provision is found in clause 1 which amends section 7 of the 
Criminal Code to provide for a procedure to be used when a child 
sexual assault has occurred outside Canada. Pursuant to this new 
provision, for legal proceedings to be instituted in Canada, the 
country where the assault occurred must submit a request to this 
effect to the Canadian Minister of Justice. And the minister has to 
agree to prosecute.
<P>
	Those who are somewhat familiar with sexual tourism soon 
realize that this proposal is sheer nonsense. How can we expect a 
third world country, known as a haven for sexual tourists, to ask a 
foreign government to sue in its place? How can we believe that 
these countries, even if they do not have the laws, the manpower or 
simply the political will to protect their own children, are going to 
admit to the whole world that they are unable or unwilling to do 
anything? This is asking a bit much.
<P>
	This whole legislative effort is all for naught since it is a well 
known fact that child sex tourism has reached such alarming levels 
precisely because of the tolerance or lack of resources on the part 
of the host countries. These countries are certainly not ready to be 
humiliated and ask a foreign government to step in and fill this 
legal vacuum. I honestly believe that the only instance when these 
provisions would work is if the victim and the criminal are 
Canadian.
<P>
	It goes without saying that any country would then realize how 
appropriate it is to let the Canadian government deal with the case. 
One can easily assume that in all other instances nothing will 
change and children will continue to be sexually exploited by 
tourists looking for kicks. My bill did not contain such half 
measures. It was quite clear. It provided for the  prosecution of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9407"> 9407 </A></B>
<P>
offenders, regardless of the willingness of foreign governments. 
This was too much to ask, I believe.
<P>
	In the name of the sacrosanct sovereignty of states, the motion 
passed by the government will insure that crimes against children 
will go unpunished, those same children Canada solemnly 
committed to helping when it signed several international 
documents. This is the way this government honours its 
commitments. My amendment would eliminate this procedural 
requirement and allow the bill to do what it is supposed to do, 
namely protect children.
<P>
	I urge you to support the Bloc Quebecois' amendment, in order 
to better protect children in Canada and abroad.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to </B><B>Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
purpose of this motion is to remove two procedural requirements to 
prosecution in Canada of cases of sexual abuse committed by 
Canadians abroad. Bill C-27 proposes to allow for the prosecution 
in Canada of Canadians who obtain the sexual services of a child 
for consideration, what is often referred to as child sex tourism.
<P>
	However, following testimony before the justice and legal affairs 
committee, the committee amended the bill in order to allow as 
well for the prosecution in Canada of Canadians who sexually 
abuse children while abroad. This new amendment requires two 
preconditions to the prosecution in Canada of a Canadian who 
sexually abuses a child while outside of Canada which do not exist 
in the case of child sex tourism offences.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	First, a request has to be made by the foreign state where the 
offence is alleged to have been committed. Second, the consent of 
the responsible provincial attorney general has to be obtained. Both 
preconditions are essential to the exercise of Canada's 
extraterritorial jurisdiction. The motion proposes to remove these 
two procedural requirements.
<P>
	The justice and legal affairs committee heard from witnesses as 
to the importance of these procedural prerequisites. They are 
necessary for two reasons. The first reason is that prosecuting in 
Canada for offences committed abroad is contrary to the principle 
that a country has jurisdiction for offences committed on its 
territory. An exception to this principle is accepted when it is so 
required by an international convention or permitted by customary 
international law or international consensus, as is the case for sex 
tourism.
<P>
	The emerging consensus to allow states to prosecute their 
nationals involved in child sex tourism is evidenced by the drafting 
of an optional protocol, in which Canada is playing an active role, 
to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
sale of  children, child prostitution and child pornography. But it is 
not the case for child sexual abuse.
<P>
	The optional protocol addresses only two sexual offences 
relating to children, child prostitution and child pornography. At 
this time it does not deal with other sexual offences against 
children. The declaration and agenda for action recently was 
adopted at the world congress against the commercial exploitation 
of children which was hosted by the Swedish government in 
August 1996. It also dealt with only child prostitution and child 
pornography. The lack of international consensus with respect to 
the country's extraterritorial jurisdiction over sexual abuse of 
children committed in a foreign country underscores the 
importance of having procedural requirements in order to comply 
with proper jurisdictional principles.
<P>
	The second reason for keeping the additional procedural 
requirements can be explained in terms of sovereignty and 
practicality. The request from the foreign state indicates an interest 
from that state in the prosecution of the offence and assures Canada 
that the foreign state will co-operate in facilitating the Canadian 
prosecution of the offence. Without a request from the foreign state 
and the underlying assumption of co-operation Canada would have 
no basis to send law enforcement officials into the foreign state to 
interview witnesses and collect evidence. The co-operation from 
the foreign state is necessary to gather evidence required for the 
prosecution.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is my belief that these procedural requirements 
are essential in order to make the committee's amendment work 
effectively. For these reasons I do not support the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-27 
will receive the support of our caucus. We think there are measures 
in the bill that are going in the right direction.
<P>
	I have some real concerns about the ability of Canada to enforce 
laws against offences committed outside our jurisdiction. Because 
of that concern I am prepared to recommend to my caucus that we 
support the amendment that has been placed before us which we 
are debating today.
<P>
	What are some of the reasons for supporting this amendment and 
really what is the amendment to do? The amendment will strike 
from the bill sections 4.2 and 4.3.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	Section 4.2 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Proceedings with respect to an act or omission that if committed in Canada would 
be an offence against section 151, 152, 153, 155 or 159, subsection 160(2) or (3) or 
section 163.1, 170, 171 or 173 shall be instituted in Canada only if a request to that 
effect to the Minister of Justice of Canada is made by:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) any consular officer or diplomatic agent accredited to Canada by the state where 
the offence has been committed; or,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9408"> 9408 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) any minister of that state communicating with the Minister through the 
diplomatic representative of Canada accredited to that state.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Section 4.3:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Proceedings referred to in subsection 4.2 may only be instituted with the consent 
of the Attorney General</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This means the attorney general of the province in which the 
individual the charge is being initiated against lives.
<P>
	First of all, what this would entail is an intrusion by the Justice 
Minister of Canada into what is normally the constitutional 
jurisdiction of the provinces which is to initiate criminal 
proceedings. It would give the justice minister an overwhelming 
say in the prosecution of offences under the criminal code. We 
would see a division of powers. I should say we would see an attack 
on the division of powers. In fact, there would be a collapse of the 
division of powers between those who make the law in this country 
and those who are supposed to enforce it.
<P>
	All of a sudden we would have the justice minister being the key 
figure not only in making the law but in initiating any criminal 
proceedings and prosecution under the law. I think that is wrong 
and we have to be very aware and cautious of allowing that kind of 
collapse between the division of powers that exist in a democracy.
<P>
	Second, I have great concern that we are going to be able to 
successfully prosecute an infraction that occurs in another country. 
How will we do it? How will we get the evidence into this country 
to successfully prosecute? If the justice minister is going to be the 
one who decides whether or not there is sufficient evidence to 
proceed with a criminal prosecution are we going to look at the 
same delays that we now see when individuals apply to the justice 
minister under section 690 of the Criminal Code, those who feel 
that there has been a miscarriage of justice occur? We have had 690 
application after 690 application presented to the justice minister 
and in some cases it has taken years for him to assess the fresh 
evidence and make a decision.
<P>
	We just saw two cases that have been hung there for years and 
finally decided upon by the justice minister. One was the King case 
and the other was the Beaulieu case. We still have a case that has 
been outstanding for at least four years, a 690 application that the 
justice minister is still looking at, the delay for reasons unknown.
<P>
	Are we now going to say the justice minister has to decide on all 
these cases that might be coming forward as a result of the creation 
of this new law? It is absolutely wrong. Not only that, the justice 
minister can only move on complaints not if they come from you or 
me, Mr. Speaker, who might be over there and happen to witness a 
crime. No, they have to come from a consular officer or a 
diplomatic agent accredited to Canada. Therefore, if you or I are 
over there and happen to see an offence  committed by some 
individual against a child, we cannot bring this to the attention of 
the authorities here. We cannot even bring it to the attention of the 
justice minister.
<P>
	According to this legislation, we have to bring that to the 
attention of the justice minister through a consular officer or a 
diplomatic agent accredited to Canada by the state where the 
offence is being committed or, if we cannot do it that way, by any 
minister of that state communicating with the minister through the 
diplomatic representative of Canada accredited to that state.
<P>
	Do members know what that is setting up? It is setting up a 
situation that looks good, that we are taking some action against 
these child sex tourists, people who would go to another country 
and involve themselves sexually with children.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	I will say five years from now if the justice minister is still 
around and we ask him how many successful prosecutions or 
otherwise have been registered in this country as a result of this 
legislation, it will be very close to zero. Why? Because of the 
narrow restrictions that are being placed on any successful 
prosecution. It is not just the fact that it is going to be difficult to 
produce evidence. Are we going to bring the victim over here? Are 
we going to bring witnesses over here at enormous cost? How are 
we going to do it?
<P>
	That is part of it. Once the complaint information has gone 
through this very narrow restricted channel and the justice minister 
says to the attorney general of the province in which that accused 
person or the targeted person lives ``go ahead and charge this 
person'' it is wrong. It is not going to work.
<P>
	It is another attempt by this government to create a smoke screen 
that it is going to get tough in an area that is very difficult to handle 
and that is frowned on and creates revulsion in the minds of every 
decent thinking Canadian.
<P>
	We are prepared to support this bill in the hope that we are wrong 
in our estimation of the difficulty that is going to be presented 
toward any successful prosecution. We are prepared to support this 
bill. But I am not prepared to support that part of the bill that gives 
the justice minister the final say on prosecution under this statute. 
Why should be trust the judgment of the justice minister when a 
lack of sound judgment and common sense runs like a current 
through a host of the legislation that he has brought forward and 
other decisions that he has made?
<P>
	How can we trust the judgment of a justice minister who grants 
victims the right to make written impact statements in Bill C-41 
and takes away that very right in Bill C-45? How can we trust the 
judgment of a justice minister who tells this House that he 
consulted on a regular basis with the attorneys general of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9409"> 9409 </A></B>
<P>
provinces  when putting together Bill C-68 and we had those 
attorneys general appear before the committee and say that there 
was no consultation at all? How can we trust the justice minister? 
How can we trust his judgment?
<P>
	I support the amendment to strike from the bill this special 
power granted to a justice minister whose judgment over the last 
three and a half years has proven to be unsound and lacking a basis 
in common sense.
<P>
	I cannot support the justice minister's having this kind of power 
and it is not unlike the kind of power he has given himself in many 
bills through orders in council. He will not get my support in this 
area for this kind of authority and power that could stymie any 
successful prosecution or any complaint from going beyond his 
office or beyond his desk. I will not support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a good case where the Bloc has contributed in an 
exceptional way to improve a bill or even to impose its vision on 
some matters.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to commend the hon. member for Québec, 
who was one of the people that started this whole debate on sex 
tourism, excision and other related matters in Bill C-27.
<P>
	However, as is often the case with the Liberal Party, the 
opposition had to take the initiative and to introduce private bills to 
get it to respond. Bill C-27 is a blatant example of that: the hon. 
member for Québec introduced a series of bills, among others, on 
sex tourism, as well as sex tourism in other countries, so that the 
government would budge.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Québec did not merely introduce a bill. 
Since the government tabled Bill C-27, which we are examining, 
the hon. member, as well as the official opposition, have very 
closely followed the committee work. Testimony heard in 
committee indicated that the bill fell short on some things, so we 
tried to co-operate with the government, to move some 
amendments so that Bill C-27 would come as close as possible to 
meeting the objectives of the private member's bills tabled by the 
hon. member for Québec, particularly with regard to sex tourism.
<P>
	A number of witnesses told us that this Liberal bill does not go 
far enough, and that we should give it more teeth if we are to get 
effective results in protecting sexually abused children in third 
world countries.
<P>
	Despite the support we had from some women's groups, social 
interest groups and even legal experts, the Liberal government 
waited until the last minute to move amendments to try to meet the 
demands of the Bloc Quebecois. Even these last minute 
amendments failed to support our goals in dealing with sex 
tourism.
<P>
	That is why, once again, the official opposition felt it had a 
professional obligation to put forward in this House an amendment 
about the extraterritorial impact. I invite government members to 
think very seriously before coming out for or against the 
amendment put forward by the hon. member for Québec in the 
overall context of the implementation of this bill.
<P>
	In some third world countries, in Asia, in India, sex tourism is a 
very profitable industry. In spite of the government's last minute 
amendments, we have to understand that any country where sex 
tourism exists must submit a request to Canada so that the attorney 
general can prosecute the individual who committed the offence in 
that country.
<P>
	Tell me what country where sex tourism is known to exist, where 
it is tolerated, would do that. According to witnesses, there even 
are countries that favour sex tourism because it is good for the local 
economy. Considering the clause that is before us, why would those 
countries themselves ask the Canadian government to prosecute 
someone who practised sex tourism on their territory? None will do 
it. Those are often countries which encourage sex tourism.
<P>
	The amendment put forward by the hon. member for Quebec 
aims at giving the Canadian government the power to prosecute 
individuals who commit the crime. I understand there are issues of 
territoriality and extraterritoriality. However, we should not forget 
that the law aims at protecting the young.
<P>
	Again, several young people who appeared before the committee 
told how individuals sexually abused them. Often, it is Canadians 
who go to other countries, and it is people who know them who 
sexually abuse these children, these young women or young men.
<P>
	I think that the amendment presented by the member has only 
one purpose, that is to better protect the children. If there is a 
problem with enforcement, we will take care of it as we go along, 
but we must at least help the families and the victims by giving the 
Attorney General of Canada the ability to prosecute those who 
sexually abuse children and who even profit from sexual tourism.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	In closing, I ask all the hon. members on the government side to 
read very carefully the amendment; it is very short, but very broad 
in scope. If they have the time, they should also read the testimony 
of some young people who came before the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Legal Affairs to complain about the fact that Bill 
C-27, which was introduced by the government party, falls short of 
the objective sought.
<P>
	I think that the amendment moved by the hon. member for 
Québec should be adopted because it would correct a deficiency in 
the bill as written by the Liberal government. In the case of Bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9410"> 9410 </A></B>
<P>
C-27, as in the case of  several other bills, we see that the 
government has tabled a series of amendments and a bill, and 
following the testimony of a number of people before the 
committee, the government intends to make further amendments. 
This is akin to tabling a bill without knowing what consequences it 
will have or considering all the possibilities it will open up.
<P>
	Although they may have done so in the case of a number of other 
clauses, I think they failed to amend this particular clause and go as 
far as the hon. member for Quebec was suggesting. That is why the 
Bloc Quebecois will vote in favour of this amendment to Bill C-27, 
and I would ask that the government give this amendment serious 
consideration. I hope it will also vote in favour of the amendment, 
with the official opposition, so as to improve the bill and help it 
achieve its objective to protect children.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill to 
a certain extent does make me think of tourism. Not to make light 
of the issue; the issue is desperately serious. The sex tourism 
business is an absolute scourge and by all means must be wiped 
out. But this bill does not do it.
<P>
	This bill reminds me of being a tourist somewhere in England 
where I saw a suit of armour which was the real, authentic thing. 
Obviously if a person had gone into battle with that suit of armour 
it would have offered some kind of protection. It is rather 
interesting that about a year later I happened to be going through a 
wax museum or some such thing in Victoria, British Columbia, 
where again I saw the same suit of armour. However, the difference 
was that suit of armour was made out of plastic.
<P>
	Imagine, if we were to go back to the time of King Arthur, the 
difference between going into battle with the real suit of armour 
and going into battle with what appeared to be the real suit of 
armour but which was only plastic. The very first time the person 
wearing that suit of armour was engaged in battle he would have 
been fatally wounded.
<P>
	And so it is with this bill. The bill appears to be a suit of armour. 
This clause appears to be something that would be effective and 
would actually work. However, it is like all the other trappings the 
government continuously comes forward with.
<P>
	In another life I believe that you, Mr. Speaker, were and perhaps 
still are a lawyer. You would know as a lawyer that when evidence 
is going to be collected in another country, under what terms and 
conditions is the evidence collected? Who is able to actually 
clearly state that the evidence is real? What about the difference in 
jurisdiction? What about the difference in standards of proof 
between the two justice systems, between the  country where the 
offence is taking place and where the adjudication would actually 
take place?
<P>
	This bill is nothing more than a plastic suit of armour and it is so 
typical of the Liberals that they would be trying to trot this out and 
actually say that the bill is going to make a move in the direction 
that is so desperately needed.
<P>
	Taking a look at the total motion before the House, Bill C-27, 
and the fact that it includes child prostitution, child sex tourism, 
criminal harassment and female genital mutilation, clearly this is 
nothing more that window dressing by the justice minister where 
he has pulled together all of these bits and pieces so at the end of 
the day he can say ``see, we tried, we made some kind motion in the 
direction we need to be going''.
<P>
	This bill is a plastic suit of armour that will fall to any lawyer 
coming in right after being called to the bar. How can there be a 
case, as has been pointed out by my colleague from Crowfoot, 
where an individual witnessing the sex tourism business has to go 
to another individual who in turn has to inform the justice minister? 
The justice minister would then have to inform the officials. The 
officials would then have to write letters, and heaven only knows if 
we have not learned something about the justice department 
writing letters in the Airbus affair I do not know when we will.
<P>
	The letters go to the country where the alleged offence took 
place. People take a look at them and try to make decisions about 
what they should do. They then turn around and perhaps they go out 
to get some witnesses. They try to collect evidence. There would 
not be that much evidence related to this case. After obtaining the 
evidence it would be transported back to Canada where this lawyer 
freshly having been called to the bar would squash it right out of 
sight. This is nothing more than plastic art-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. The chief 
government whip on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the next 15 minutes we will be 
summoned back to the Chamber to vote on some deferred recorded 
divisions. I have had some discussions with the other parties. We 
have come to an agreement. I want to thank the representatives of 
those other parties for their co-operation. When we reconvene for 
the deferred recorded divisions, the first division we would ask the 
Chair to call would be No. 15, the ways and means motion of the 
government on the matter of the budget.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> That would be followed 
by the two private members' motions, Motions Nos. M-31 and 
M-277 in that order. Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> So ordered.

	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you consider that I 
voted with my party. I was in my seat. Pardon me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was wondering if I could seek 
your guidance on the validity of a vote when the actual mover of 
this motion saw fit not to be here on this occasion.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is perfectly in order that we take this vote 
because it is an order of the House. Very gently I would remind 
hon. members that we never refer to another member when he or 
she is not present.
