not receive reimbursement unless they met two thresholds. At 
present, the threshold is to have spent 10 per cent of the

Canada Health Act. Provinces and territories were given until 
October 15, 1995 to put into place the necessary legislative or 
regulatory framework to ensure that medically necessary 
services are provided on uniform terms and conditions wherever  
they are offered. Some provinces have already announced plans 
to develop such frameworks. As provinces and territories have 
until October 15 to complete these efforts, it would be premature 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11257"> 11257 </A></B>
<P>
at this time to name facilities that after October 15 may not be 
operating in such a way as to cause a deduction under the Act. 
Federal/provincial consultations will take place in connection 
with this issue.
<P>
Question No. 158-<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What is the total annual sum of money, by province/territory, that private 
health care facilities bill patients as user fees, as defined by the Minister of 
Health?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> On January 
6, 1995 the Minister of Health wrote to all provinces and 
territories informing them that facility fees being charged to 
patients at private clinics are user charges contrary to the 
Canada Health Act. The letter further stated that where a 
provincial plan pays the physician fee for a medically necessary 
service delivered at a clinic, it must also pay for the related 
hospital services provided or face deductions for user charges. 
Provinces and territories were given until October 15, 1995 to 
put into place the necessary legislative or regulatory framework 
before the penalty provisions of the Act are implemented. 
Therefore the total sum billed to patients that might be deemed 
user fees after October 15 depends on how each province and 
territory responds to the deadline and cannot be determined until 
the deadline has passed. Federal health officials will consult 
with their provincial and territorial counterparts in connection 
with this issue.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT,1995">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1995</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (for Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec)</B> moved that Bill C-76, an act to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament 
on February 27, 1995, be read a second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, last month , this government 
introduced a budget that has been described as historic. The 
description is apt, for it was a budget of fundamental reform and 
national renewal. Today, we are considering legislation that will 
help turn those goals of reform and renewal into reality for the 
benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
	The budget redesigns the very role and structure of 
government itself-because getting government right is 
essential to getting the economy right. The budget achieves 
dramatic savings to secure our deficit reduction targets-real, 
bottom-line savings based on prudent economic assumptions.
<P>
	And this fiscal reform will continue to pay off, because the 
structural changes introduced by the budget will deliver 
savings, not just over the next two years, but every year 
thereafter. It is a tough budget, but it is also a budget of 
commitments kept and meaningful results.
<P>
	Just as important, it is a budget of nation building-because it 
is firmly rooted in the principles of economic leadership; 
compassion; and increased fairness. Before describing the 
specific measures in the legislation, I would like to say a few 
words about the importance of passing it on a timely basis.
<P>
	Canada's economic future remains at risk because of a $550 
billion debt. A huge portion of government revenues are 
consumed by the cost of servicing this debt. That's money that 
could otherwise be spent to provide Canadians with services and 
programs, or to reduce the amount of taxes we pay.
<P>
	The debt also makes us unacceptably vulnerable to financial 
markets and the harsh impact of interest rates. The unexpected 
increase in these rates since last year's budget has put 
tremendous pressure on our deficit targets. Meeting our targets 
is essential to strengthen confidence and bring interest rates 
down. This, in turn, is essential for greater growth and more jobs 
for Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The budget takes the actions necessary to meet these 
objectives. To hit our targets, we are implementing cumulative 
savings over the next two years of $15.6 billion. Over $13 
billion of the savings will spending cuts. There will be no 
increase in personal income tax rates.
<P>
	Going beyond, to 1997-98, our reforms will deliver a further 
$13.3 billion in savings for a three-year total of $29 billion. 
This is the largest set of actions in any budget since 
demobilization after the second world war.
<P>
	We are also taking firm steps to increase tax fairness and close 
loopholes. The budget delivers almost $7 in spending cuts for 
every $1 in new tax revenue. The actions set out in the budget 
involve changing the size and shape of government by hard 
choices on priorities. By 1996-97 program spending will fall 
from $120 billion last year to just under $108 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11258"> 11258 </A></B>
<P>
	By 1996-97 our financial requirements, the amount of new 
money we will have to borrow in the financial markets, will 
be down to $13.7 billion or 1.7 per cent of GDP. That is better 
than every other G-7 country. Most important of all, by 
1996-97 the debt no longer will be going faster than the 
economy. That is the key to fiscal stability, to putting our debt 
ratio on a permanent downward track.
<P>
	Canadians realize the importance of achieving fiscal targets. 
They know this is the budget our economy needs. They affirmed 
this in the consultations leading up to the budget and they 
reaffirmed it in the response to the budget itself.
<P>
	Financial markets have also recognized that the budget will 
promote an improvement in public finances. However, to secure 
the savings that will lead to this improvement, we must pass the 
legislation as expediently as possible. Anything less would 
compromise our commitments to a secure and prosperous future 
for ourselves and for our children.
<P>
	There is no need for further budget background. It has been 
extensively discussed in the House. Let me turn therefore to the 
specific elements of the bill before the House.
<P>
	Provincial transfers. One of the most important elements of 
the bill is the reform of transfers to the provinces. The federal 
government wants to create a transfer system that functions 
better and is fiscally sustainable. The centrepiece of this reform 
is the replacement, beginning in 1996-97, of established 
program financing for health and post-secondary education and 
the Canada assistance plan, with a single consolidated block 
transfer, the Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	The Canada health and social transfer represents a new 
approach to federal-provincial fiscal relations. This new 
approach is marked by a greater flexibility for provincial 
governments, and more sustainable financing arrangements for 
the federal government. It continues the evolution toward more 
mature fiscal relations.
<P>
	Although provinces will have greater flexibility in addressing 
their priorities, the budget made it clear that the principles of the 
Canada Health Act will be enforced. There will be no change in 
the principle that provinces must provide social assistance 
without minimum residency requirements.
<P>
	We believe the new system will be more effective in meeting 
contemporary needs. Our fiscal situation demands that it also be 
less costly than the current system. That is why, when the CHST 
is fully implemented in 1997-98 the total of all major transfers 
to provinces will be down by about $4.5 billion from what it 
would have been if it had been transferred under the existing 
system. However, to put this into perspective, the reduction will 
be equal to about 3 per cent of the aggregate provincial 
revenues.
<P>
	We believe our approach to provincial transfers passes three 
important tests. First, the federal government has hit itself even 
harder. Second, we have given the provinces ample notice of our 
intentions. Third, the reduction in transfers is equitable across 
all provinces.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	In addition to the introduction of the Canada health and social 
transfer, the bill also introduces other measures that will help 
reduce the cost of payments to the provinces. For example, the 
government is proposing to reintroduce to the fiscal 
stabilization program a provision which will trigger payment 
under the program only when economic conditions cause 
provincial revenues to decline by more than 5 per cent. The 
fiscal stabilization program compensates provinces if their 
revenues decline from one year to the next due to economic 
circumstances.
<P>
	When the program was introduced in 1967, it provided 
compensation only in situations where the economic conditions 
caused revenues to decline by more than 5 per cent, that is, in the 
event of a severe economic downturn. The program was 
amended in 1972 to provide compensation if province's revenue 
fell at all.
<P>
	Despite that change only two payments were made under the 
program between 1967 and 1990. However, the combination of 
the last recession and low inflation has triggered recent 
stabilization payments to virtually all provinces.
<P>
	Now that inflation is low and stable, even a minor economic 
downturn can cause a decline in a province's revenue and thus 
result in a stabilization payment. This is not consistent with the 
intent of the program and is not consistent with current fiscal 
realities. Therefore, the government is reintroducing the 5 per 
cent eligibility threshold to the program. This measure will take 
effect for stabilization claims in 1995-96 and subsequent years.
<P>
	The federal government will continue to play a major role in 
stabilizing revenues of provincial governments. However, it 
will do so only in times of severe economic shocks, as was 
intended when the program was originally introduced. There are 
no immediate savings associated with this measure.
<P>
	The bill also includes an amendment to the Public Utilities 
Income Tax Transfer Act, PUITTA. Under PUITTA the federal 
government transfers to provinces and territories most of the 
federal corporate income taxes paid by privately owned 
electrical and gas utilities.
<P>
	These payments were intended to level the playing field 
between privately owned utilities which pay income tax and 
provincially owned utilities which under the Constitution do 
not. However, it is up to the provinces and the territories to 
decide whether or not they will pass these savings through to 
utilities companies or to consumers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11259"> 11259 </A></B>
<P>
	Most provinces and territories do not rebate the payment to 
utilities or consumers. The majority retain it as general 
provincial revenue. Moreover, none of the provinces rebate its 
own provincial income taxes to these utilities.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Finance recommended that the 
federal government eliminate PUITTA transfers. Under the 
current fiscal circumstances, the continuation of PUITTA 
payments can no longer be justified. Therefore, the legislation 
proposes that PUITTA be terminated as of March 31, 1995. This 
measure is expected to reduce expenditures by an estimated 
$200 million in 1996-97 and $280 million in each of the two 
subsequent fiscal years.
<P>
	The bill contains a final measure affecting transfers to 
provincial governments. It concerns the vocational 
rehabilitation of disabled persons Act or the VRDP. Under this 
act the federal government pays 50 per cent of the cost incurred 
by provinces in assisting disabled persons to become 
employable. As part of the government's reform of social 
programs, the maximum contributions to the provinces under 
the VRDP will not exceed the 1994-95 levels starting in 
1995-96. VRDP entitlements are expected to be about $168 
million in 1994-95. This measure will result in estimated 
savings of $4 million in 1995-96; $8 million in 1996-97 and $12 
million the year after.
<P>
	Let me turn now to another major area dealt with in today's 
bill, assistance to business. In the course of program review, 
departments across government took actions to reduce business 
subsidies. Such subsidies frequently fail to achieve their desired 
objectives. Many work counterproductively, discouraging 
adjustment and innovation. Overall the government is proposing 
to cut business subsidies by 60 per cent. This includes 
agriculture and transportation subsidies that were designed 
decades ago.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	The bill proposes to repeal the Western Grain Transportation 
Act, WGTA, and to terminate the western grain transportation 
subsidy paid to railroads effective July 31, 1995. The reform of 
the WGTA will result in savings of $2.6 billion over the next 
five years.
<P>
	However it is more than a deficit issue. The elimination of the 
subsidy will encourage the development of value added 
processing and the production of higher value goods. It will 
result in a more efficient grain handling and transportation 
system. It will help maintain our market access for grain sales in 
foreign countries and comply with our obligations under the 
agreement established with the World Trade Organization.
<P>
	A number of further initiatives will facilitate the transition to 
the new system. They include a payment of $1.6 billion to 
owners of prairie farm land.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> That is not enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> For the NDP it is never enough. The bill 
provides for the regulation of maximum freight rates that can be 
charged by railway companies to move grain from the prairies. 
The transition from these maximum regulated rates to 
commercial rates will take place over a five-year period.
<P>
	The bill also proposes the elimination of the Atlantic freight 
subsidies under the Atlantic region freight assistance program, 
ARFAA, and the Maritime Freight Rates Act, MFRA. These 
measures to take effect July 1995 will save nearly $100 million a 
year.
<P>
	The Atlantic freight subsidies have proved inefficient in 
reducing shipper costs. They have, moreover, encouraged 
companies to structure their investments and organizations to 
meet regulatory criteria rather than for sound business practice. 
The subsidies are of marginal and declining importance to 
regional economic activity since transportation services in the 
region are now much more competitive than they once were.
<P>
	To help ensure that elimination of a subsidy contributes to a 
better transportation system, the budget announced a five-year 
$326 million transportation adjustment program. Provinces will 
be able to target assistance under the program to meet local 
shippers' needs and upgrade infrastructure. Among other things 
it should help modernize the highway system in Atlantic Canada 
and eastern Quebec.
<P>
	A third area of concern is transfers to persons, particularly the 
veterans program. An initiative as sweeping as program review 
must inevitably touch upon some programs that provide 
payments to individual Canadians. When the Department of 
Veterans Affairs underwent review the decision was taken to 
preserve all essential programs and services for veterans who 
had served Canada. However the department took steps to 
control cost, eliminate overlap and duplication, and return 
programs to their original purpose.
<P>
	Accordingly the bill proposes that the war veterans allowance 
be discontinued for former members of resistance forces and for 
allied veterans living abroad for more than six months within a 
calendar year. As well, new allied veterans will be ineligible for 
war veterans allowance unless they were pre-war residents of 
Canada.
<P>
	Further, effective from budget day no new applicants will be 
accepted under the education assistance program because it 
duplicates other available programs. Also the veterans travel 
program will be restructured so that the benefits are 
rationalized.
<P>
	A fourth area of concern is consular services. Not all 
departments offer the same scope for savings under program 
review. However each is contributing to the restructuring 
process. Cost recovery is one such step. The Department of 
Foreign Affairs, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11260"> 11260 </A></B>
<P>
for example, will be shifting a greater portion of the cost of 
consular and trade development functions to the prime users.
<P>
	Therefore the bill includes provision that would authorize the 
department to levy an additional fee for Canadian travel 
documents such as passports. As a result of the measure the cost 
of a regular five-year passport is expected to rise between $20 
and $30. However, even with the increase, the cost of a Canadian 
passport will still compare favourably with that of many other 
industrialized countries.
<P>
	The measure will help the Department of Foreign Affairs to 
maintain the high quality consular services it currently 
provides.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	The next area is the public service. The measures I have 
outlined along with other initiatives arising from program 
review mark the transition to a more focused, effective and 
frugal federal government. Such a government will need fewer 
employees to deliver programs and services.
<P>
	At the time the 1995 budget actions are fully implemented 
federal employment is expected to decline by 45,000 or 14 per 
cent. The government appreciates the valuable service its 
employees provide. We are committed to managing the 
reductions in a fair and orderly fashion.
<P>
	In keeping with the commitment the bill proposes to change 
the public sector compensation act to allow for an early 
departure incentive. The incentive can be taken up by as many as 
13,000 to 15,000 employees in the departments most affected. 
We estimate the cost of the program for the public service, the 
military and certain separate employers and crowns to be about 
$1 billion, which will be included in the 1994-95 fiscal year.
<P>
	Other proposed changes in the act will allow for cost neutral 
changes to non-salary terms of employment and for certain new 
kinds of leave. For example, employees will be permitted to take 
off blocks of time and have their incomes averaged over the 
year.
<P>
	In addition, we are proposing amendments to the Public 
Service Employment Act that will give public sector managers 
more flexibility in staffing arrangements. This would include, 
for example, the block transfer of employees with their 
functions within the public service.
<P>
	Employees affected by the downsizing who decide not to take 
advantage of the departure incentives will have a reasonable 
period of time to find employment elsewhere in the public 
service, but that period cannot be indefinite. The government 
simply cannot afford to pay people for not working.
<P>
	Accordingly the bill also includes amendments to the 
workforce adjustment directive so that surplus employees in the 
departments most affected who decline departure incentives 
will cease to be paid after six months and will be laid off one 
year thereafter unless alternative employment is found.
<P>
	The vast majority of items in the bill are obviously about 
reducing the deficit. However there is one that relates to 
financing the deficit and the debt. The bill contains amendments 
to the Financial Administration Act that will enable the 
government to efficiently sell debt securities to individual 
Canadians under the retail debt strategy. The amendments will 
allow the federal government to offer Canadians improved 
access to a family of safe and secure Government of Canada 
obligations.
<P>
	The proposed amendments include new authority for the 
government to issue securities without physically printing 
certificates, thereby promoting more efficient and less costly 
electronic transfers.
<P>
	The amendments will also enable government to buy its own 
securities at the time of issue. This way they can be sold to retail 
buyers through a special government agency set up for the 
purpose.
<P>
	There is one final measure in the bill I should like to mention, 
locked-in RRSPs. Currently holders of locked-in RRSPs are 
limited to purchasing life annuities with the funds. In order to 
provide such individuals with greater flexibility in managing 
their retirement income, the bill includes an amendment to the 
Pension Benefits Standards Act that will allow holders of 
locked-in RRSPs to purchase life income funds.
<P>
	Today's legislation will play a key role in setting our country 
on a course to fiscal responsibility and to governmental renewal. 
The legislation will help ensure that our budget goals are 
translated into real performance. It draws directly on the advice 
we have received from across Canada. It focuses on the total 
economic and social picture before us and addresses the 
challenges we all face.
<P>
	The budget and the bill reaffirm the government's 
fundamental objective of sustaining growth and job creation. 
They achieve that by meeting the fundamental requirement of 
restoring fiscal health by refocusing government on priority 
roles and needs.
<P>
	In summary, Canada needs and Canadians support the 
legislation. They have already demonstrated support, and I urge 
all members of the House to do likewise.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, thank you for giving us the opportunity to speak again 
to some elements of the finance minister's budget through Bill 
C-76, which implements, in particular, three important 
provisions regarding transfer payments to the provinces, rail 
trans-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11261"> 11261 </A></B>
<P>
port and part of sea transport, as well as labour relations in the 
Canadian public service.
<P>
	If I may, I would like to focus my remarks on the part of Bill 
C-76 dealing with transfers to the provinces. I will let my 
colleagues address other important aspects of Bill C-76 during 
this debate but, if I may, I would like to focus my presentation 
this morning on the important issue of transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	As members know, Bill C-76, as announced in the budget 
speech by the Minister of Finance, provides for the elimination 
in 1996-97 of two federal transfer programs. The first program, 
commonly called the Canada Assistance Plan or CAP, is the 
federal government's contribution to the various social 
assistance programs implemented by the provinces. This 
contribution amounts to 50 per cent of the social assistance 
budget in most Canadian provinces.
<P>
	The second transfer program to be eliminated, commonly 
called EPF or Established Programs Financing, is the federal 
government's contribution to the cost of provincial health care 
and post-secondary education.
<P>
	Starting in 1996-97, Bill C-76, which derives from the 
finance minister's budget speech, would replace these two 
programs with a single payment called the Canada Social 
Transfer.
<P>
	There is a snag, however. Before giving the money to the 
provinces, the federal government would slash the funds 
historically allocated to the Canada Assistance Plan, health care 
and post-secondary education. One might say that, in the next 
few years, the federal government will make cuts to this 
proposed single payment, this block funding, to the provinces.
<P>
	It will cut transfers to the provinces by $7 billion over the next 
three years. I would put it to you, as we have repeatedly said 
before and as we can never say often enough, that this so-called 
reform of federal transfers is just a plot to offload onto the 
provinces deficit problems that the Minister of Finance is 
unable to solve.
<P>
	In 1996-97, the cuts in transfers will be distributed among the 
provinces according to each province's share of transfers for 
Established Programs Financing and the Canada Assistance 
Plan. Under clause 15 in Part V of Bill C-76, Quebec will be 
deprived of more than $650 million as of next year.
<P>
	In 1997-98, the Canada Social Transfer-imagine calling it a 
social transfer-will be distributed among the provinces 
according to criteria to be negotiated. Although technical, the 
distribution criteria are crucial for the financial future of the 
Canadian provinces, and Quebec in particular.
<P>
	Although my demonstration may appear technical, I urge you, 
Madam Speaker, to pay attention because it is of paramount 
importance in helping us understand the smoke screen, the 
fraud, the sham that is the reform proposed by the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	If the criteria established to determine how this fund will be 
distributed among the provinces, if the method of distribution 
remains the same as it is today, Quebec will have a $1.2 billion 
shortfall in 1997-98. I put it to you that this is not likely to 
happen since, according to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, the method of distribution may be changed 
because, for example, Ontario-which elected a large number of 
Liberal members-demands such changes. Ontario, the 
wealthiest of Canadian provinces, feels discriminated against 
under the current distribution criteria because it does not receive 
a share consistent with its demographic weight within Canada.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	In spite of what it may have been saying since the tabling of 
the budget, the federal government wants to change the 
allocation criteria of the fund, which was originally targeted for 
social assistance, health and post-secondary education, and use 
the demographic weight of the provinces as the primary 
criterion for allocating these moneys. In other words, Ontario, 
which has the largest population, would get the largest share, 
even though it is also the richest province. We keep asking the 
Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister about this issue, and 
neither one will deny the intention to split the Canada Social 
Transfer according to the population criterion.
<P>
	If this is the case, and if our fears are founded, the result 
would be catastrophic, particularly for Quebec's public 
finances. Such a system might also be unfair. Indeed, if the 
population of a province is the criterion used, as suggested by 
the Minister of Human Resources Development and not denied 
by the Minister of Finance or the Prime Minister, Quebec would 
absorb 41.7 per cent of the total reduction in provincial 
transfers, in 1997-98.
<P>
	If this allocation criteria is used, Quebec's shortfall will go up 
from $1.2 billion, based on the current allocation system, to 
close to $2 billion in 1997-98. Quebec's public finances would 
already suffer a loss in 1997-98. The federal government is 
saying to the Quebec government: it is your problem; we did not 
have the guts to assume our responsibilities, but you do it. A 
shortfall of $2 billion is not peanuts.
<P>
	Two billion dollars. And the government has the nerve to 
imply that it might not be the case. The members opposite do not 
deny anything, yet we are told that this might not be the case. 
Even if the current criterion is maintained, there will be a $1 
billion shortfall. If you use the population as the allocation 
criterion for this federal money, that shortfall climbs up to $2 
billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11262"> 11262 </A></B>
<P>
	Someone will have to do some planning in Quebec. We do 
not know what awaits us? Why is that? It is because this 
government lacks the courage to get down to work, to assume 
its responsibilities and exert tighter control over Canadian 
public finances, but it is also because it is incredibly 
hypocritical. This government knows that Quebec is about to 
launch a referendum campaign and that Quebecers will have 
to make a crucial decision this year.
<P>
	Consequently, it does not want to show its true colours. It does 
not want to show that the federal system is obsolete and going 
bankrupt. It does not want to show that the federal budget will 
hurt Quebecers, who will have to pay more and more taxes for 
fewer and fewer services, and who will witness a crisis in their 
provincial public finances, thanks to Ottawa. The federal 
government is hiding all that.
<P>
	I can tell you that the allocation of federal money based on the 
population criterion is being formally discussed among top 
government officials. These senior public servants are saying: 
do not mention the fact that we told you. Do not mention the fact 
that this government is hypocritical, that it is waiting for 
Quebecers to decide on their political and constitutional future 
before giving them a shock treatment and making them pay and 
get bad news year after year, since this federal system can no 
longer survive and can only cause serious damage to Canadian 
public finances. Where is this said? Nowhere. Why? Because it 
would be tantamount to telling Quebecers: ``Look, this is 
hurting you and it will continue to hurt you year after year''.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	This system is taking us nowhere, with the morose political 
and social climate it will be creating for the next few years, 
because cosmetic and hypocritical changes like those regarding 
transfer payments to the provinces will not fix the basic problem 
of the system. The problem is that it is a big machine, totally 
outdated and completely dysfunctional, no longer capable of 
meeting the needs of the 1990s and of the next century. The 
government will certainly not tell us that before the referendum.
<P>
	Regarding transfers to the provinces, Bill C-76 also contains 
a provision that I consider cynical and arrogant, particularly as 
far as Quebec is concerned. Clause 13, Part V, provides for the 
maintenance of national health standards and the introduction of 
new national standards in the areas of social assistance and 
post-secondary education. Provinces who do not comply will 
lose their entitlement.
<P>
	Imagine that, they will be cut off. As if what we get back from 
the federal government in the form of transfer payments was all 
Ottawa's to begin with. As if these public funds were a gift from 
this munificent federal benefactor to the provinces. The fact is 
that this is taxpayers' money being redistributed to taxpayers in 
Quebec as elsewhere.
<P>
	In Quebec, we pay the federal government $30 billion in taxes 
each year, $30 billion. And they are threatening us? They say 
that new national standards on social assistance and 
post-secondary education will be introduced and that provinces 
who do not comply with these standards-which may be sheer 
nonsense in relation to the socioeconomic and cultural reality in 
Quebec-will see their transfers cut off.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, can you imagine what that could mean to 
have, in Quebec, education standards imposed by the 
anglophone majority in Canada? Do you have any idea? Can you 
imagine how this sounds to Quebecers, with all the historical 
references we have?
<P>
	Can you imagine Clyde Wells, in Newfoundland, with his 
friends and accomplices elected to the federal Parliament, 
determining indirectly, through Canada-wide standards, the 
content and goals of the education system in Quebec? Can you 
believe that we will be entitled to only 25 per cent of the power 
of decision over post-secondary education matters? Is that what 
the people of Quebec want? I do not think so.
<P>
	They should know, however, that this is what this government 
stands for. We know what the introduction of Canada-wide 
education standards means. It means that Ontario, 
Newfoundland, the anglophone majority in Canada will have a 
say in how our education system, this system through which our 
identity and culture as Quebecers is perpetuated and passed on 
from one generation to the next, should operate. That is what is 
proposed, what this says.
<P>
	We are told not to worry because, before Canada-wide 
standards can be implemented, negotiations will be held with 
the provinces and a consensus will be have to be reached. This is 
not a guarantee that there will be no Canada-wide standards. 
Given this government's record, a government that forced the 
repatriation of the constitution upon us, in spite of the numerous 
objections raised by Quebec, and the Quebec National Assembly 
in particular, we can easily imagine that these Canada-wide 
education and social assistance standards will be implemented.
<P>
	This measure may not have a financial impact, but I can 
assure you that its political impact and the impact it will have on 
Quebec's culture and cultural future are indeniable. That is what 
is unacceptable to the official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	It should come as no surprise that this bill contains a provision 
that thumbs its nose at historic facts and ignores the need for 
Quebecers to control 100 per cent of their future, their culture 
and what they are. It should come as no surprise that this 
political bludgeon should materialize in a bill on public 
finances.
<P>
	I am certainly not surprised, and this week I had the same 
reaction when a motion was tabled in the House on Quebec's 
representation in the House of Commons, asking for 
guarantees-as was the case in the draft  constitutional 
agreements that followed the demise of Meech Lake-that 
Quebec would have <BR>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11263"> 11263 </A></B>
<P>
25 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons, and I even saw 
Quebec members of the Liberal Party vote against the motion.
<P>
	I saw the hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi, the newly 
elected member, the other guy's brother, rise in the House to say 
he was against guaranteeing 25 per cent of the seats in the House 
of Commons. I saw the Minister of Finance and member for 
LaSalle-Émard rise in the House to vote against guaranteeing 
Quebec 25 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons. This 
is a man who represents Quebecers, Madam Speaker, and he rose 
in the House to vote against this guarantee of representation in 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	So it should come as no surprise to see one of the main pillars 
of the preservation and renewal of Quebec culture, our 
education system, bludgeoned in this way, and I am referring to 
the possibility that national standards will be imposed and that 
decisions will be made elsewhere on the orientation, content and 
objectives of our education. I am no longer surprised. Nothing 
would surprise me in this Parliament. Nothing would surprise 
me, coming from this Liberal government and its few 
distinguished members from Quebec.
<P>
	It is a disgrace. I felt sick to my stomach this week when I saw 
that. I had the same feeling I did last week, when I saw a member 
from Manitoba speak out against revoking the conviction of 
Louis Riel for high treason. This was hard to stomach, 
especially from a member for the same riding Louis Riel 
represented before he was hanged for high treason. What is 
going on here? I knew, and we could tell from the outside before 
we were elected, and now we can see it firsthand. What is 
happening here is a disgrace, a patent denial of our history, and 
again, this refusal to make amends for certain historic facts that 
are a disgrace to Canada and Canadian federalism.
<P>
	They tell us: Do not worry, national standards will be 
negotiable. It does not say anywhere in this bill that national 
standards will require unanimity or a consensus among the 
provinces. The federal government reserves the right to apply 
them whether the provinces agree or not. Here, the old guard is 
up to its old tricks: the current Prime Minister, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development were all there in the previous Liberal government. 
They are up to their old tricks of wanting to tell the provinces 
what to do and arrogantly imposing a centralist vision on all 
Canadian provinces, including one province they feel is just like 
the others, and they say that right here, and I am of course 
referring to Quebec.
<P>
	It is the same gang that misled us in 1980, when those 
federalist members, now ministers, were out on the hustings. 
One is now Prime Minister. They went around saying: If you 
vote no in the referendum on sovereignty, it will be a yes to 
renewed federalism, yes to decentralization and yes to 
flexibility. A year later, they  literally shunted Quebec and the 
Premier of Quebec and Quebec's aspirations aside, saying: We 
have an agreement, the federal government has an agreement 
with the other Canadian provinces, and Quebec will have to go 
along. That is happening now with a very ordinary bill to 
implement certain provisions of the budget of the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	The old gang, the one responsible for the show of force in 
1981, patriated the constitution. We have to keep saying this. We 
tend to forget what happened. Despite the near unanimous 
decision of the Quebec legislature, the Liberal government of 
the time patriated the constitution. This was the government of 
Mr. Trudeau, who is no longer a member here, and his 
acolytes-the present Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, the Minister of Human Resources Development and 
others. The Liberal government, at that time, also ensured 
Quebec's exclusion. I tell you I see the hand of the old gang in 
this bill. This is the gang that is telling Quebec: ``Forget your 
nationalist and sovereignist claims, that is all over, you are 
going to be included. You will have to bend and we will make 
you bend'', to the delight of the Reform Party members.
<P>
	The government's objective with regard to transfer payments 
to the provinces is clear. The government presented things 
clearly too. It wanted to avoid having to make difficult decisions 
this year, because, with the Quebec referendum, it would mean 
revealing the failure of the federal system. Furthermore, it 
wanted to try and minimize the impact of cuts in social 
assistance, post-secondary education and health care transfers 
to the provinces. These cuts are serious.
<P>
	The government, and its Minister of Finance, is an old hand at 
deception, illusion and hypocrisy. It managed to leave the 
impression that these cuts would hurt neither Canadians nor 
Quebecers. It managed to do what it wanted. Things this year do 
not look too bad, really. However, for next year, it covered up the 
fact that everyone is going to have to pay and that it is going to 
be tough and will keep on being tough. It will keep on being 
tough until 2050, because the system is outdated and does not 
work anymore.
<P>
	I will tell you that the shortfall the Quebec government will be 
facing in the next few years is equivalent to the operating 
budgets of all of the hospitals in Quebec, except those in 
Montreal and Quebec City. This is a considerable amount. The 
money to operate all the hospitals in the outlying regions, that is 
what the federal government is cutting from its transfers to the 
provinces.
<P>
	In other words, in this budget, with regard to transfers, the 
federal government is making Quebec and the other provinces 
shoulder the offensive part of the reform, which the Minister of 
Human Resources Development was unable to complete, for the 
moment, and which the Prime Minister wanted to keep under 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11264"> 11264 </A></B>
<P>
wraps this year for strictly political reasons. I tell you-this is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	In essence, the approach, the thinking, by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development is more or less as follows. I 
would not be stating it too directly by putting it this way: social 
programs and unemployment insurance have to be cut in order to 
stimulate job creation and growth. Imagine, Madam Speaker, 
hitting the unemployed and the poorest people in our society in 
an effort to stimulate growth and boost job creation. What great 
thinking. It sounds like Liberal thinking to me. It sounds like 
Liberal ideals.
<P>
	I tell you, as is often said: this Liberal government is the most 
Conservative government Canada has ever had. Its thinking runs 
totally counter to Liberal thinking.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	And I repeat, it is too important not to, that we have noticed 
over our 16 months here that the government believes it should 
cut social programs and unemployment insurance in order to 
create jobs and stimulate the economy. Even the 
ultraconservatives of the last century were less direct, less tough 
than that.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Less hypocritical.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> You are right, dear colleague, most 
importantly, they were less hypocritical. But why should we be 
surprised? Earlier, we talked about the failings of the old Liberal 
gang coming out again in the national standards issue and the 
push to bring Quebec into line. And other old flaws are surfacing 
too. Relatively new old flaws, however, because they only go 
back a few months. They only seem old because we were so 
shocked by what they said that it seems that they have always 
been saying it.
<P>
	Why should we be shocked by the ultraconservative 
philosophy of creating jobs and kick starting the economy at the 
expense of the unemployed and the most needy, when a few 
months ago the Prime Minister himself said to a group of 
influential Toronto business people, a bastion of federalism and 
of extreme right-wingers, maybe even friends of the Reform 
movement, that the unemployed all sat around and drank beer? 
The leader of the country and of the government, the Prime 
Minister himself, said that the unemployed sit around and drink 
beer.
<P>
	In light of this, what is so surprising about creating jobs and 
kick starting the economy at the expense of the unemployed 
when the philosophy of the country's number one man, the head 
of the government, is not to help the unemployed, not to create 
jobs, but to call them all beer drinkers?
<P>
	How do you expect the government to take a different 
approach in Bill C-76, which by the way, basically says the 
same thing as the Prime Minister except in more diplomatic and 
eloquent language, when the Prime Minister's opinion is that the 
unemployed, the people  displaced by the structural changes in 
the workforce, all just sit around and drink beer?
<P>
	Why should it come as a surprise that the Minister of 
Transport was cynical and arrogant during the latest dispute, 
when he once again used bully tactics, harshness instead of the 
civilized options proposed by the official opposition? Once 
again, in front of a large audience, he said things that were so 
revolting that union representatives walked out on him. He said 
how do you expect railway workers with only a grade nine 
education to understand what is going on? Just imagine the 
arrogance and cynicism it takes to say such a thing, that railway 
workers cannot possibly understand what is going on because 
they only have a grade nine education, and for the Prime 
Minister to say that the unemployed like to sit around and drink 
beer.
<P>
	In your opinion, what kind of bill, what kind of vision of 
social and economic development for Canada can come from 
people with that kind of attitude? Such things as cutting the 
unemployment insurance fund, cutting everywhere. That is the 
Prime Minister's vision, which the Minister of Transport and the 
Minister of Labour both share.
<P>
	This is not surprising, here I digress from the bill, but it is not 
surprising because last year, the Minister of Finance took $600 
million from the unemployment insurance fund without batting 
an eye, this year, he will take $2.4 billion and next year, $4 
billion. That is their full employment policy, the full 
employment of all means available to them to take from the 
unemployed all means at their disposal to replace a lost job with 
one of equal quality and to participate in the growth of the 
economy which has been stunted since the 1990 recession.
<P>
	Overall, the federal government will cut transfer payments to 
the Government of Quebec by 32 per cent between 1994-95 and 
1997-98. That is a lot. A $2 billion shortfall to be made up has 
been mentioned, but 32 per cent is enormous.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	I repeat, this is no gift. The federal government is not giving 
us a gift. It is not a gift from any other source either. It is money 
from Quebec and Canadian taxpayers. The government is telling 
us that it is making cuts, but keeping certain other transfers. It 
cuts 32 per cent of our own money, which it redistributes in the 
areas of health care, post-secondary education and social 
assistance and we have absolutely no say in the matter.
<P>
	No one at the prebudget discussions, and I attended all of 
them along with my hon. colleague for Témiscamingue, some of 
my colleagues went several times, no one told the Minister of 
Finance to do what he did. No one ever told the Minister of 
Finance he should avoid his responsibilities and offload his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11265"> 11265 </A></B>
<P>
problems onto the provinces. No one told the Minister of 
Finance he should blithely cut unemployment insurance.
<P>
	At no time, during the hearings held across Canada, from east 
to west, in the maritimes, Quebec, Ontario, the prairie provinces 
and British Columbia, at no time did anyone say that education 
should be cut. On the contrary. Education is fundamental to the 
success of nations today. No one ever said it should be cut.
<P>
	No one ever said there should be cuts in health care either. 
Canadian nationalism is built in part on social programs, and the 
health care system in particular. Canadians are proud of this 
system. No one called for cuts to this system. What we got, 
however, was a 32 per cent cut over the coming years. I can 
count on my fingers the number of people who advocated this 
route to the Minister of Finance. I could even name them for 
you, but it would be a waste of time, and I have other things to 
say.
<P>
	I will name one, Thomas d'Aquino, the head of the Business 
Council on National Issues. He told the government to slash 
everywhere, everywhere that is, but in subsidies to Canadian 
business. He was the only representative of business to tell the 
government not to cut the $3.8 billion paid to business or to 
suggest it be done gradually to avoid having a harmful effect. He 
never said, however, that a $7 billion cut in the unemployment 
insurance fund would hurt. It was not a major concern for him.
<P>
	Some business people suggested cutting transfer payments, 
but these are not the people the government has to serve if it 
really cares about meeting the needs of the citizens of Quebec 
and of Canada. It should be working for ordinary people in 
Quebec. But their hands are tied when they form the government 
and come against those who finance the federal party. That 
cannot be stressed enough.
<P>
	When a bank contributes $45,000 to the Liberal Party of 
Canada, should we be surprised to later learn that the bank, and 
all banks in fact, do not pay their share of taxes? Why should we 
be surprised to see that they only have to pay a temporary tax, 
staggered over two years, which will bring in a paltry $100 
million, even though banks made $5 billion in profits this year? 
That is what happens when there is no policy on the public 
financing of parties. That, and other things.
<P>
	Regarding this 32 per cent cut in transfer payments over the 
next few years, I would say that although Canadian federalism 
was at one time profitable for Quebec, we all agree on this 
point-if we go back 30 years, as did one study recently, or 20 
years-so, yes, it was profitable at one point, but it no longer is. 
They should stop trying to fool us.
<P>
	Even André Raynauld, a good Liberal economist, whom I 
regard as very competent, a former Liberal minister at that, said 
when he appeared before the Bélanger-Campeau Commission in 
1990, that from 1988 on, Quebecers had not been getting more 
from the federal government than they were putting in. That was 
in 1988, but since then the difference between the $30  billion in 
income taxes and other taxes that Quebecers pay into federal 
coffers and what the federal government gives in return has 
grown.
<P>
	We are in the red. Look at it from any angle you wish, go 
ahead and crunch the numbers and try to make it look as if the 
deficit were equally shared by all the provinces. Between you 
and me, it is an exercise in futility. We all know that the right 
calculations, the true credit and debit entries show that Quebec 
gets less from the federal government than it contributes. And 
this deficit will only grow over the next few years.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	And the reason is precisely because it represents 32 per cent 
of federal transfers to the provinces, including Quebec, 32 per 
cent less in federal transfers. In the case of one of the items, we 
were told that we were receiving more than we were paying. 
That was before this year, with reference to the unemployment 
insurance fund. But, this year, the fund will no longer have a 
surplus. This means that the contributions of employees and 
employers in Quebec will also correspond pretty much to what 
unemployed Quebecers receive. Even if the trend continues, 
there will be a deficit of 188 million dollars with respect to what 
employees and employers in Quebec are paying and what 
Quebecers will be receiving in unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Therefore, not only is there no longer a surplus, but there are 
cuts of 32 per cent in federal transfers, and, as is always 
forgotten, that will be on top of this deficit. Given this deficit, 
the federal government's expenditure items need to be looked at 
carefully. We have always said, and it is even truer today, that 
the most important expenditure items are those which stimulate 
the economy, such as research and development, purchases of 
goods and services, expenditures in the agricultural and 
transportation sectors, and so forth, the expenditures that 
contribute to prosperity, economic growth and job creation. But 
in Quebec, these growth promoting expenditures are a concern. 
For 25 years now, Quebec has indeed had a surplus, but a surplus 
in terms of unemployment and social assistance benefits. And 
this surplus situation is attributable in part to structural 
problems in the Canadian economy. The problem was also that 
this system did not meet the needs of Quebecers in need.
<P>
	And so we were told: ``There are problems, but do not 
complain because you are getting larger transfer payments''. 
This is no longer the case. Now, there is no longer any attempt to 
provide any relief for the increasing unemployment and poverty 
in Quebec, and, in addition, the transfers necessary for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11266"> 11266 </A></B>
<P>
economy are not available. Hardly an advertisement for 
federalism. We have seen better elsewhere.
<P>
	If at least-for there is nothing in the budget that I find 
acceptable as far as transfers are concerned-there had been 
some sign of a real, not just a cosmetic, improvement. Even the 
financial community has issued a warning, saying that, in the 
first year, the government's rating was being maintained, but 
that it was being watched. But no real improvements were made. 
The big federal machine, the heartless federal machine that is 
cut off from the needs of Quebecers and Canadians, rolls on.
<P>
	No departments are eliminated. There is a transfer of 
expenditures, of deficit responsibilities to the provinces. 
Because the minister lacked the courage to assume his own 
responsibilities, he is letting the provinces do the dirty work, but 
the system as such remains unchanged. The big, inefficient 
system is still in place. They will say that we disagreed with 
them. Not only did they not do anything, not only did they not fix 
anything, but they hurt the provinces, the most disadvantaged, 
the unemployed, the people on social assistance, and they are 
about to do the same to seniors.
<P>
	I would have liked to address the issues of transportation, 
labour relations and the disgraceful layoffs in the public service. 
Again, we never said that we should not cut fat throughout the 
entire system. This has always been our policy, except that there 
is a way to do it while showing respect for the workers. It is easy 
to see, however, that this government has no respect for 
anything. It does not even comply with the Canada Labour Code. 
It tried to silence us in last week's debate on the rail dispute and 
refused an opposition motion for more civilized labour relations 
and a return to work with the possibility of collective 
bargaining.
<P>
	If only for the issue of transfers, I would like to propose a 
motion. I move, seconded by the hon. member for Châteauguay:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' 
and substituting the following therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Bill C-76, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 27, 1995, be not now read a second time but that it be 
read a second time this day six months hence.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
In other words, the Minister of Finance should go back to the 
drawing board and do his homework, because he acted in a 
disgraceful way, even in trying to meet his goals some time in 
1997-98.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The House has heard the 
motion. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Resuming debate. The 
hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, I tabled the motion, you read 
it and asked if we approved the motion. Some hon. members 
shouted ``yes'', others ``no''. I do not understand what happened 
after that. Can you tell me?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I asked if it was the 
pleasure of the House to adopt the motion. The answer was 
``no''. So, we are resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> No, Madam Speaker. We answered ``yes''.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu): </B>I will get back to you on 
this matter in two or three minutes, after taking advice. You may 
be right, but I would like to wait for further advice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Normally, Madam Speaker, one would expect 
the Chair, after putting the question to the House as a whole, to 
ask us to vote ``yea'' or ``nay'' and then, if you declared that the 
motion was negatived, we would have stood up. But we were 
waiting for this cue to stand up.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I will get back to you in 
a moment.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Order. Resuming debate on the motion of the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, pursuant to Standing Order 67(1).
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it saddens me that we have to debate Bill C-76 
today. This bill implements laws allowing the government to put 
Canadians another $32.7 billion in debt. It saddens me even 
more that the government feels this is acceptable. It is not 
acceptable. It is a deplorable act of financial incompetence of a 
weak kneed government.
<P>
	The government borrowed a few pages from Reform's 
taxpayers budget in order to cut spending in some areas. The 
Liberals only did half the job, however. They would have been 
much better off following all of our suggestions, not just a few 
select pages. A lot of the rhetoric was right, but a lot of the 
numbers were wrong.
<P>
	Because of the Liberal's failure to make all of the necessary 
cuts to get Canada back on track to financial good health, we 
continue on the debt treadmill. The budget is the minimum 
possible budget. The Liberals cut only enough to compensate for 
the additional interest charges their over spending has created.
<P>
	The net effect of the bill which implements a budget that 
creates a greater indebtedness is before us, and deficit financing 
continues into the future. The only reason the deficit goes down 
at all is that the Liberals plan to take over $10 million more out 
of the economy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11267"> 11267 </A></B>
<P>
	Even if everything goes their way, they will still have a $25 
billion deficit which is unacceptably high. The finance minister 
and the Liberals do not get it. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development seems to think the role of government is to 
continually come up with new and exciting forms of taxation. 
The Minister of Finance hesitated to rule out the Tobin tax or 
any other new taxes. This is the best way to bankrupt a country. 
The government simply cannot solve the nation's financial 
mess by taking more out of the economy through taxation.
<P>
	No nation has ever spent and borrowed its way to prosperity. 
Quite the opposite is true. Many great nations and empires have 
fallen because of the growth of government and taxation. 
Perhaps the most prominent among them is the Roman Empire. 
When faced with the oncoming barbarian hordes, many of the 
outlying states decided to throw their lot in with the barbarians, 
saying: ``Better the barbarians we do not know than the taxes we 
do know''.
<P>
	Not only some in Quebec but some folks in the western 
provinces are using the huge debt and growing taxation as a 
platform for seceding from the federation. For the sake of 
national unity we need to eliminate the deficit quickly.
<P>
	As well, the only way the Liberals will ever be in a position to 
bring taxes down is to completely eliminate the deficit. We 
know they will not do it by 1996-97. If the Liberals have a plan 
to do it after that, they will not share it with Canadians. This is 
bad news for the Deputy Prime Minister. She made quite a 
performance out of announcing that she would resign if the GST 
were not gone within a year. They cannot bring down taxes while 
running a deficit, so I suppose her career is over. That is a 
shame. I am sure the House will miss her shrill voice and her 
partisan, illogical grandstanding. She has looked after herself, 
however, with a generous two tiered MP pension plan.
<P>
	As well as being a bad budget for the Liberal Party it is also a 
very bad budget for Canada. That is the important matter I want 
to deal with this morning. Apart from the negative impact of 
continued debt and taxation, the budget creates some inequities 
in the country.
<P>
	The cuts made by the government have a very lopsided 
impact. For instance, the agricultural industry in western 
Canada is hit harder than any other industry. The loss of the 
Crow benefit will have obvious long term effects on the 
industry. The gasoline tax will hit farmers particularly hard. 
Farming is a very fuel intensive industry and travel is a necessity 
in rural areas. The government has increased the input costs for 
farmers, increased the cost of getting the product to market and 
offered no hope of tax reduction in the future.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	Farmers realize many of these things are necessary in order to 
save the country from financial collapse. What angers farmers is 
that so many others got off so easily in  the budget. If everyone 
had been hit as hard as agriculture, the budget would have been 
balanced. We would have had something to show for our effort.
<P>
	For years farmers have been saying they do not mind doing 
their share and losing the rail subsidy if other subsidized 
agencies do the same. Farmers have been hit with a 30 per cent 
loss to their safety net programs and the entire loss of their 
transportation subsidy in the west.
<P>
	At the same time the CBC only gets kicked with a 4 per cent 
reduction in its subsidy. Does the government feel that a 4 per 
cent cut to the CBC is comparable to a 100 per cent cut to grain 
transportation?
<P>
	The removal of the Crow subsidy appears to have been a last 
minute decision. It appears pressure was put on the minister of 
agriculture to find more savings and so he axed the Crow 
without thinking through and planning for the implications. The 
minister of agriculture calls it a buy out, but the value of the 
WGTA is much higher. Some suggest it is more like $7 billion 
rather than $1.6 billion. He should have more accurately called a 
Crow buy off at fire sale prices because the federal purse has 
been mismanaged for so many years by Liberal and 
Conservative finance ministers they simply do not have the 
money for a real buy out.
<P>
	For years the Reform Party has been calling for a long term 
plan for moving the agriculture industry toward a market 
system. The government has had a year and a half in office to 
plan for this transition but it has done nothing.
<P>
	The government waited until the last moment and then sprung 
this crow buy off on farmers with almost no warning and no plan 
for implementation. To date the minister of agriculture has not 
been clear on who the buy out money is to be paid to, how the 
amount will be calculated, what the tax implications of the pay 
out will be for farmers or any of the other dozens of questions 
that my constituents and farmers across the west are asking.
<P>
	I am starting to believe the minister's offices cannot answer 
these questions because it has not even thought through many of 
these problems yet. The elimination of the Crow benefit has 
been poorly designed, very ad hoc and in a desperate manner. 
The minister of agriculture campaigned on the red book 
promises to develop a long term plan for agriculture.
<P>
	I want to take a few minutes to look at what the Liberal red 
book says and what the minister of agriculture has been saying 
to Canadians. In the red book the Liberal government promised 
to develop an overall policy for the agri-food sector which will 
build upon three component strategies: developing new 
domestic and international markets for Canadian food products; 
reducing input costs to make farming more viable; introducing a 
new whole farm income stabilization program that assists farm 
families to secure their long term future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11268"> 11268 </A></B>
<P>
	The one that jumped off the page when I looked at it was 
reducing input costs to producers. The government is increasing 
the input costs to producers. It is doing it through taxation on 
fuel and by its continued borrowing of money that has to be 
paid back through both interest charges and principal 
eventually; farmers have to play a role as they are generators 
of the GNP.
<P>
	The red book went on to say that it would preserve policies 
and programs such as supply management. As soon as the 
Liberals were elected they were forced to change the nature of 
supply management as a result of the GATT agreement. 
Reformers knew this was coming. The whole world knew it was 
coming. The only people who seemed to think it was not coming 
were the Liberals. They campaigned they would preserve supply 
management in the state it was in before the GATT agreement. 
That was absolutely misinformation to give to the Canadian 
public. It is unfortunate they would perpetuate this type of 
propaganda in their election campaign.
<P>
	They also said they would craft stabilization programs to 
minimize the impact of market price fluctuations; government 
support in developing new commercial markets for 
commodities in which the agri-food industry has a competitive 
advantage; sustainable agriculture practices to maintain and 
improve the quality of land and water; emission oriented 
research to increase productivity and create quality products to 
meet market demand.
<P>
	They are very nice words but where is the beef? We have not 
seen anything yet from the minister of agriculture and there is 
certainly nothing in the implementation of the budget that would 
indicate that any of these promises in the red book are about to 
be fulfilled.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	In the first throne speech agriculture was not even mentioned. 
It certainly does not seem to be a very high priority with the 
government.
<P>
	Actions speak louder than words. Let us look at the record of 
the agriculture minister and the government since they came 
into power. As far as agriculture was concerned, 1994 was a year 
of indecision and inaction. It will be remembered by most as a 
year comprised of consultation and study groups that were not 
intended to be genuine but rather as a way of avoiding making 
tough decisions.
<P>
	Issues that were pursued through legislation in the House 
were rather insignificant and inconsequential such as Bill C-49, 
the department of agriculture reorganization bill, Bill C-50, the 
Canadian Wheat Board research check-off act, Bill C-51, 
amendments to the Canada Grains Act, certainly not of any 
consequence to the industry.
<P>
	Outside the House of Commons the minister of agriculture 
was heavily criticized over his handling of the durum wheat 
dispute with the Americans. After months of posturing the 
federal government caved into the American demands that 
Canada place self-imposed caps on shipments of wheat to the 
United States.
<P>
	The minister also reneged on the promise he and the Prime 
Minister made during the election campaign. They made the 
promise they would hold a referendum on the future of the 
Canadian Wheat Board and barley marketing. They did not carry 
out that promise.
<P>
	For 1995 the minister of agriculture is again making some 
promises and we will be watching to see whether he carries them 
out. He said in the <I>Western Producer</I> of January 5, 1995: ``It is a 
year when we can really see the turning of a corner on a lot of 
issues. I think 1995 will be a very active and vigorous year in 
which a number of these issues will come to a head and be dealt 
with''.
<P>
	We are well into 1995 and to this point we have not seen very 
much positive by way of performance by the minister of 
agriculture. There certainly does not seem to be much in the 
budget to get excited about.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture in 1994 delayed introducing 
legislation that would end the backtracking of grain from 
Thunder Bay to the west. It is a very costly and terrible practice 
which he had the power to correct. He said he would but then 
delayed the implementation of the act which would correct this 
problem and cost producers more money.
<P>
	From the <I>Western Producer</I> on November 17, 1994 the 
minister said: ``I cannot tell you what the amount of the Crow 
benefit will be. I have to tell you in all candour and honesty that I 
will expect the number to be somewhat lower and that is a 
product of the harsh fiscal reality we are living in at this time''.
<P>
	The minister was still giving farmers some indication the 
Crow benefit would be with us. When this budget came down, 
which we are implementing through Bill C-56, the Crow was 
gone. Why was the minister indicating payment would only be 
reduced when it would be eliminated? These were not the 
signals farmers needed to make decisions over the winter 
months as to how they would operate their farms in the current 
crop year.
<P>
	Another very interesting issue important to agriculture 
producers goes far beyond the agricultural industry; it affects all 
exporters, transportation of our product to port.
<P>
	I again quote the minister of agriculture from the <I>Western 
Producer</I>, March 10, 1994: ``I do not want to jump to 
conclusions about what is needed''. This was with regard to 
labour problems that plague the grain transportation system: ``I 
do not want to jump to conclusions about what is needed but I 
merely observe that it is important that all the players work on a 
way to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11269"> 11269 </A></B>
<P>
avoid this ever happening again in the future. The situation 
where losses occur for the grain industry  because of a dispute 
outside their control is not acceptable''.
<P>
	That was a little over a year ago. He said it was not acceptable, 
that we had to deal with the west coast port labour dispute and 
lockout. As we very well know, we had to deal with the issue of 
the west coast ports again and the rail strike.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	When the minister said it was not acceptable, the problem is 
he realized it was not acceptable but he did not do anything 
about it. What is really sad is that he had the opportunity to do 
something about it. He could have supported the hon. member 
for Lethbridge when he introduced Bill C-262 in the House. It 
was a votable motion. The Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food could have supported it. It would have legislated 
final offer arbitration for essential services such as the transport 
of grain to tidewater from the farm gate. The minister of 
agriculture recognized the problem was unacceptable. He had 
the opportunity to do something about it and he failed to do it. 
That is unacceptable to western grain producers.
<P>
	With respect to research for agriculture, the minister of 
agriculture said it is fundamental and needs to rank very high in 
what we do in the future:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have not yet had the tough conversation I expect I will have at some point 
with the Minister of Finance. If you are inconsistent in your research objectives 
or your research funding you can do a lot of long term damage. I would like to 
be able to reallocate resources within the department of agriculture should that 
prove necessary, to make sure that vital things like research do not get 
fundamentally undermined in the process of reworking the budget. I actually 
would like to see the situation (funding levels) improved. That may be a bit 
ambitious in the short run in the face of necessary restraint but the fundamental 
objective for the long term has to be to increase research and development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is from the <I>Western Producer</I> of January 27, 1994.
<P>
	In the budget the minister did not follow through on his 
commitment. The way I would interpret it is that he was saying: 
``I do not think I can increase funding for research. I will going 
have a tough conversation with the Minister of Finance. 
Certainly we are not going to reduce it''.
<P>
	What the finance minister did in the last budget was cut 
funding to agriculture research. He is asking the private sector 
to make up the difference. Perhaps that is a fair request. We 
could debate that in the House. The problem is the minister of 
agriculture said something else. He did not follow through on 
what he said. Not only did he cut funding for research, he also 
cut seven research station facilities across Canada.
<P>
	He also said research for the smaller sectors of agriculture 
would be those hardest hit. What if that had been our policy in 
the past? There would have been no research to develop canola, 
one of the greatest assets in the western regions. Perhaps we 
would not have developed the lentil market we have had we 
followed the agriculture minister's policy. Perhaps because of 
his policy we will not develop the herbs and spices market to its 
full potential. That is a step which would harm diversification 
rather than assist it. The minister said he is committed to 
diversification and a broadening of the scope of agriculture. The 
agriculture minister's actions and his words do not line up.
<P>
	I would like to return to the situation of supply management. 
What has happened is very unfortunate. Specifically on on 
article XI the minister of agriculture stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is no secret that there is not a great deal of support for our position among the 
other GATT members. But we will continue to fight for that position. Our bottom 
line is that we will do what we have to to protect supply management.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It was obvious to the whole world, surely it was obvious to the 
finance minister, that Canada stood alone in its defence of 
article XI and that there were to be changes. The agriculture 
minister should have done the responsible thing and 
communicated the reality of the situation to agriculture 
producers. He should have done that before the election rather 
than waiting until after the election. Now their support is so slim 
they can do nothing whatsoever and they will have to go along 
with the changes proposed in the GATT agreement in 1994.
<P>
	With respect to international trade, in campaign ads in his 
attempt to win the Liberal nomination in Regina-Wascana in 
1988, his material contained the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This election will be the most crucial in our lifetime. It demands strong, 
decisive action to stop the bad Mulroney trade deal which threatens our future 
and our very way of life.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is from the <I>Leader-Post</I> of September 15, 1988.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	As the whole world knows, we need trade agreements. More 
of them are being put in place every day. We also know the 
Liberal government, including the minister of agriculture, 
campaigned against the free trade agreement. However, once the 
Liberals got into power they did nothing to change it although 
they said they would change it. They said they had wonderful 
changes planned for the North American free trade agreement. 
Once they got into power they made no changes whatsoever. 
Again, what the agriculture minister said and his actions were 
two separate things.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11270"> 11270 </A></B>
<P>
	During the 1988 free trade debate the agriculture minister 
said that the current Minister of Finance and he stood strongly 
against the trade deal. He said it was not a fair deal but a sellout 
of our nation. How could it be a sellout in 1988 and then 
supported in 1993?
<P>
	There are some real positive aspects to the North American 
free trade deal. Certainly it is not the perfect deal. Maybe there 
is no such perfect deal. The problem is that the minister of 
agriculture and the Liberal government flip-flopped on the 
issue. They did not keep their word. It is very unfortunate that 
we do not know what direction we can take from the words of the 
agriculture minister and his colleagues.
<P>
	I would like to read one more quote with regard to the durum 
wheat dispute last year with the Americans. The agriculture 
minister said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Those on the other side of the border who might think that action can be taken 
against Canada with no consequences, should think again. There will be 
consequences-I want our American trading partners to know that Canada is 
not going to roll over and play dead-For every action there will be a reaction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
That is a quote from the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> dated March 30, 1994.
<P>
	In the newspaper <I>The Western Producer</I> the minister said: 
``No deal is better than a bad deal''. That was April 16, 1994. As 
we know, the minister of agriculture caved into the Americans 
and agreed to export restrictions of 50 per cent of previous 
exports to the United States of Canadian durum. Again that is 
very regrettable. Again the minister of agriculture did not match 
his actions and his words.
<P>
	I want to read one final quote regarding the agriculture 
minister because the Canadian people need to be aware of this. It 
is with regard to deficit reduction. As members know, for some 
time Reformers have called for the government to come to grips 
with the deficit. I have a very interesting statement made by the 
minister of agriculture in the past with regard to the deficit. He 
said it is more than irresponsible, it is immoral. Those are the 
words of the agriculture minister.
<P>
	I agree with the minister of agriculture. It is immoral to pass 
on the deficit and debt to future generations. However, the 
agriculture minister is part of a government that is adding 
billions of dollars to the debt by annual deficits, last year, in the 
current budget and in the one that is projected for next year.
<P>
	I have three primary criticisms of the Crow buy-off in the 
Liberal budget. I would like to put those on record. First, the 
government's action on the Crow benefit comes as too little, too 
late. Three years ago Reformers suggested that the funds for the 
transportation subsidy for grain should be rolled over into a 
trade distortion adjustment program that would protect 
producers from damage received as a result of the grain trade 
wars. We did not hide this information. It was very public. The 
Liberals had access to it when they came to power. They 
determined that they would stick with the old Crow until  they 
could bargain it away in the GATT negotiations when they had 
no cards left to play in the deck.
<P>
	Second, the government should have designed and introduced 
a transition plan prior to the discontinuance of the Crow benefit, 
not a year or more after it ends. It seems incomprehensible that 
the federal government would end the Crow benefit on July 31, 
1995 and then say it is going to introduce a transition program in 
the 1996-97 fiscal year. That is really putting the cart before the 
horse. The Liberals are going to eliminate something and then 
not have any idea what they are going to put in place for 
transition. I cannot fathom that thinking.
<P>
	Third, the government is justified in reducing support to 
agriculture if, and only if, it reduces spending in other 
departments and programs by equal amounts so that farmers do 
not carry an unfair portion of the pain caused by fiscal restraint. 
This has not happened. In many cases, which I will mention in a 
few minutes, the federal government has actually increased 
spending. This is unacceptable. The minister of agriculture has 
obviously not considered those most vulnerable to the loss of the 
Crow, namely young renters. I have had many calls from young 
farmers in my constituency who are renters. They will lose at 
both ends with the Crow buy-off. First, they are not recipients of 
the $1.6 billion buyout. Second, they will bear the cost for the 
additional transportation with the ending of the subsidy. This is 
truly regrettable because often these young farmers have a 
pretty tight cash flow situation and low equity. They are not able 
to go to their banker and command the same infusion of cash for 
their operations. It is very difficult for them to plan to farm 
again this year.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	I want to really stress this. I am not complaining about the 
cuts in support to agriculture. I will say it again so that it is clear 
to the House. I am not complaining about the cuts in support to 
agriculture. Probably Reform would have done some of the 
cutting differently and I think better.
<P>
	I want to point an accusing finger at the government because it 
did not level with Canadians about the way cuts would be made. 
It did not level with farmers about how cuts would be made. 
Particularly it did not level with the western grain farmers about 
how cuts would be made. It did not level with supply 
management about how it would deal with that industry. It failed 
to fulfil its promises. That is truly regrettable.
<P>
	While farmers took a triple whammy in the budget, the 
government continues to subsidize special interest and 
advocacy groups such as the National Action Committee on the 
Status of Women and others. It continues to provide huge tax 
breaks and subsidies to big business and doles out millions to 
western economic diversification and other regional agencies. 
The Lib-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11271"> 11271 </A></B>
<P>
erals are still planning on sending billions of dollars overseas 
while cutting programs for Canadians.
<P>
	I thought it would be interesting to go through the budget and 
the estimates for this year and take a look at the areas where 
spending is actually rising. The result is quite interesting and I 
would like to share my findings with the House.
<P>
	Spending by the Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation will rise 
by about 70 per cent from last year to $17.5 million. The 
Canadian Museum of Civilization will receive 22 per cent more, 
bringing the total to $46.2 million. The Canadian Museum of 
Nature's budget goes up by 33 per cent to almost $25 million. 
The National Gallery of Canada gets a 23 per cent increase to 
bring its budget to over $33 million. The list continues. The 
National Museum of Science and Technology gets a 25 per cent 
increase to $20.5 million. The Status of Women Co-ordinator 
gets a-wow-322 per cent increase to $15.2 million. I know 
that farm women do not support that increase to the budget for 
the status of women.
<P>
	The increase to the Immigration and Refugee Board, $11 
million. Perhaps it is to install more hidden cameras. This is 
very interesting. The finance department gets a $9.7 billion 
increase. With a bigger deficit and a bigger debt comes a bigger 
finance department. That is a real reward for incompetence.
<P>
	The Canadian International Trade Tribunal receives a $500 
million increase. The Federal Office Regional Development 
Quebec, $34 million; the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions, $38,000; the Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans, 
$121 million. Maybe he will be able to buy some more 
extravagant furniture with the increase in his budget.
<P>
	National Health and Welfare is receiving an extra $321 
million. It is spending more money while services are eroding. 
The Medical Research Council, $2 million; Statistics Canada, 
$5.5 million; the justice department $500,000; Indian and 
northern affairs, $285 million. That one year's increase is equal 
to a six-year Crow transition fund. It is just appalling. The 
Federal Judicial Affairs Commissioner, $1 million; the Tax 
Court of Canada, $180,000; the Atomic Energy Control Board, 
$165,000.
<P>
	The Senate of Canada, $1,000. It actually gets an increase and 
its members do not even show up for work most days. The Privy 
Council Department, $4.5 million. More money for the people 
who brought us the Fowler-Doyle affair. The Canadian 
Intergovernmental Secretariat, $250,000; the National Round 
Table on Environment and the Economy is a new agency and its 
entire $3.3 million budget is new spending. The security 
intelligence review committee, $6,000, more money to reward 
recent poor performance; the correctional service, $50 million; 
the RCMP, $10 million; the RCMP external review committee, 
$91,000; civil aviation tribunal, an extra $15,000; Treasury 
Board Secretariat, an extra $32 million; western economic 
diversification, an extra $26 million.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	All of this is new spending. Those departments and agencies 
are all having their budgets increased while farmers are taking it 
in the neck. It is not fair.
<P>
	Overall government spending has moved up since the Liberals 
took power. In 1993-94 total government spending was $158 
billion. The Liberals came to power. In 1994-95 it was $160.3 
billion. That is an increase. This year in the budget it is projected 
to be $163.5 billion. Spending is increasing. It is not decreasing 
despite some of the spin doctor campaigns that the Liberals are 
promoting to say that they are reducing the deficit and cutting 
spending. They are actually increasing spending.
<P>
	The government has sent a clear message that it feels special 
interest groups, business subsidies, regional patronage handouts 
and foreign aid are all more important than the agriculture 
sector. The budget is nothing more than a raid on the income of 
hard working Canadians so the Liberals can continue to fund 
their pet projects with $1 billion of additional tax revenues to 
help them along.
<P>
	The budget is a failure. It fails to get Canada off the debt 
treadmill. It fails to demonstrate that we can avoid hitting the 
wall. We are already seeing the ill effects of the budget in the 
value of our currency. The U.S. dollar is plummeting versus 
other international currencies and our dollar is losing ground to 
the Americans. The Canadian peso, as it is becoming known, is 
at constant risk and interest rates may rise because of the weak 
budget.
<P>
	It is interesting that the minister of public works is planning to 
issue a $2 coin. It indicates how little value our currency holds. 
Soon a coke machine will require a two buck piece for a can of 
the real thing. The coke will know doubt be more real than the 
money we use to buy it.
<P>
	In an effort to prevent a rout on the Canadian dollar and a 
decrease in our credit rating, the Minister of Finance, the Prime 
Minister and other members of cabinet have been trotting 
around the world trying to convince our creditors that we are 
still a good credit risk. The very fact that our status is in question 
demonstrates the seriousness of the problem caused by the 
government and its Liberal and Conservative predecessors.
<P>
	The best way to sum up the budget is to read a poem written by 
Dr. John Robson. The poem is based on <I>Casey at the Bat</I> by 
Earnest Lawrence Thayer. Dr. Robson apologizes to Mr. Thayer 
for sullying his poem by including Liberals in it. I would like to 
read the poem to the House. It is called <I>Marty at the Bat</I>:

<BLOCKQUOTE> It looked extremely rocky for Canadians that day;<BR>
 The deficit was growing; how short time was none could say.<BR>
 So when Wilson died on OAS, and The Maz did the same,<BR>
 A pallor wreathed the features of the patrons of the game.<BR>
 A straggling few then went off shore, leaving there the rest,<BR>
 With that hope which springs eternal within the human breast.<BR>
 For they thought: ``If only Marty could get a whack at that,''<BR>
 They'd put even money now, with Marty at the bat.<BR>
 But the PM controlled Marty, and Coppsie always sounding off,<BR>
 And the former was a pudd'n, the latter face down in the trough.<BR>
 So on that stricken multitude a deathlike silence sat;<BR>
 For there seemed but little chance of Marty's getting to the bat.<BR>
 But the PM gave him Finance, to the wonderment of all.<BR>
 And the much-despised Coppsie saw her influence free-fall.<BR>
 And when the dust had lifted, and they saw what had occurred,<BR>
 The HRD man had folded, and Marty could ride herd.<BR>
 Then from the gladdened multitude went up a joyous yell-<BR>
 It rumbled in the mountaintops, it rattled in the dell;<BR>
 It struck upon the hillside and rebounded on the flat;<BR>
 For Marty, mighty Marty, was advancing to the bat.<BR>
 There was ease in Marty's manner as he stepped into his place,<BR>
 There was pride in Marty's bearing and a smile on Marty's face;<BR>

 Ten million eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with ink,<BR>
 Five million tongues applauded when he sat him down to think;<BR>
 Then when the writhing Moody's ground the rating in its hip,<BR>
 Defiance glanced in Marty's eye, a sneer curled Marty's lip.<BR>
 And now the budget '94 came hurtling through the air,<BR>
 And Marty stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.<BR>
 Close by the sturdy batsman the deficit unheeded sped;<BR>
 `No need for haste,' said Marty; `Strike one,' the markets said.<BR>
 From the benches, black with Lib'rals, went up a muffled roar,<BR>
 Like the beating of vast spending when the tax can rise no more.<BR>
 `Kill him! Kill the lender!' shouted someone in the stand;<BR>
 And they might well have defaulted, had not Marty raised his hand.<BR>
 With a smile of Liberal charity, great Marty's visage shone;<BR>
 He stilled the rising tumult, he made the game go on;<BR>
 He produced no mini-budget, and once more tax dollars flew;<BR>
 But Marty still ignored it, and the markets said, `Strike two.'<BR>
 `Fraud!' cried the maddened Lib'rals, and the echo answered, `Fraud!'<BR>
 But one scornful look from Marty and the audience was awed;<BR>
 They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,<BR>
 And they knew their Marty wouldn't let his chance go by again.<BR>
 The sneer is gone from Marty's lips, his spreadsheet's clenched in hate,<BR>
 He swears he'll cut most drastically, before it is too late;<BR>
 It comes to budget time again, the deficit still high;<BR>
 And Marty swings beneath the ball, and hits an infield fly.<BR>
 Oh, somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright,<BR>

<P>
	This budget implemented by Bill C-76 raises taxes. It 
increases the debt by over $100 billion over three years. It offers 
no hope of tax relief to Canadians. No member of this House 
who has any concern for the welfare of their children and 
grandchildren can support a bill that enables the government to 
increase the debt load and therefore the future tax load we are 
leaving for them.
<P>
	I call on all members of this House to join with my Reform 
colleagues and me to defeat this budget implementation act. 
Canada and Canadians deserve better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my colleague, the hon. 
member for Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe.
<P>
	It might have been quicker if the hon. member had read <I>War 
and Peace</I> into the record, but if brevity is the soul of wit, then 
the poem was neither brief nor perhaps particularly witty.
<P>
	It has been said by another poet that nothing is either good or 
bad, but thinking makes it so. That poet was speaking to attitude. 
We just had a very good portrayal by the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster of the Reform Party attitude about 
the budget.
<P>
	He was very effective as a prophet of doom and gloom in 
speaking about the budget. Quite frankly, as most Canadians 
know and indeed as the previous speaker well knows, perhaps to 
his chagrin, the budget is being very well received by 
Canadians. Although every decision perhaps is not what 
Canadians would have liked, in general the budget is being very 
well received and for some very good reasons.
<P>
	I would like to speak first to the process the hon. Minister of 
Finance followed in this budget and indeed in his first budget. 
There has never been a more open and transparent process which 
has taken place by a finance minister. There has never been a 
greater opportunity for Canadians right across this land to have 
input into the budget.
<P>
	There is very good evidence of that in my riding and in the city 
of London, Ontario where I live and part of which I represent. 
The finance minister was in our city for an open forum with a 
cross-section of groups from London and the surrounding area 
and other individual Londoners. He received tremendous input 
during that evening.
<P>
	All members of Parliament have the opportunity to hold 
special meetings. I know that most of the members on this side 
of the House held special prebudget consultations with their 
constituents.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	With the encouragement of the hon. minister, Canadians have 
never had a better opportunity for input into the budget. Whether 
one accepts and likes every single budget decision or not, 
universally the process very correctly is being praised.
<P>
	It is my view that the budget is both balanced and fair. Now we 
come to what I said in terms of attitude. We can adopt the 
philosophy of the Reform Party and the attitude of doom and 
gloom and that everything is negative, or we can face the fact 
that yes, there were significant cuts which had to be made. They 
were  necessary. In some cases I would say they were regrettable 
but necessary.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11273"> 11273 </A></B>
<P>
	It is quite clear that Canadians expect us to come up with a 
more efficient, more effective, leaner but not meaner 
government in this country. To cut, slash and burn at a more 
hectic pace, which is what is being suggested by the Reform 
Party, would produce a much meaner government and a much 
meaner society which is something I reject as a Canadian and 
Canadians generally reject.
<P>
	We had very good evidence of that on October 25, 1993. 
Canadians were given a clear choice between a gradual, 
common sense, determined approach to reducing the deficit and 
debt in this country as outlined in the Liberal red book, and a 
much more dramatic and draconian approach to the deficit and 
debt problems put forth by the Reform Party. Canadians spoke 
very clearly in October 1993 about what choice they preferred. 
Indeed, they have endorsed that choice again with the reaction 
we have seen to the budget in the weeks since it was brought 
down.
<P>
	Why is that? In my view it is because Canadians understand 
that if private sector businesses are facing the situation where 
they must downsize and become more efficient and effective, 
then so too must governments. It is not incumbent on any 
government more than the federal government to show by 
example that this must be done.
<P>
	I heard repeatedly from my constituents the phrase to just 
share the pain equally and all Canadians will support it. Just 
make sure we are spreading it out equally. That is exactly what 
my constituents have told me. Urban constituents, rural 
constituents, people in business and in farming, all of whom I 
represent, have told me they are content with the budget and 
they think we are on the right track.
<P>
	One of the best indicators of the budget being very fair and 
balanced is the fact that we are now up to eight provinces out of 
10 that have claimed to have been the hardest hit by this budget. 
That is one of the clearest signs that the budget is fair and is 
trying to treat all provinces as equally as possible.
<P>
	Critics from the left are saying the budget was much too 
tough. Critics from the right are saying that the budget was not 
tough enough. Perhaps the surest way we Liberals have of 
knowing we have reached the right, common sense, balanced 
decision is just to acknowledge the fact that at the same time on 
the same decision on this budget we were getting criticism from 
the right that it was not tough enough and from the left that it 
was much too tough.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> We must be right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> That is right. As my colleague says, that must 
obviously give us some evidence that we must be right. 
Canadians certainly feel that we have reached a balanced 
position in the budget.
<P>
	We have met our targets. For the first time in over 10 years a 
finance minister has announced deficit targets and has actually 
held and met those targets. He has exceeded those targets. In just 
a year and a half this minister has produced two budgets both of 
which have cut spending and have begun the important 
government restructuring which must take place as we move 
toward the 21st century.
<P>
	In the next three years over $29 billion in savings will be 
realized. I remind members that there are $7 in cuts for every $1 
in revenue in this budget. It is quite clear to Canadians that this 
budget turns the corner. It puts us on a national diet, if you will. 
It indicates the way in which we must start to seriously attack 
this deficit problem with the view to totally eliminating it when 
that is possible.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister's two year rolling target is a sensible determined 
way to go about this. No, it is not endorsed by the Reform Party, 
which wants to be much more slash and burn in its approach, but 
then again Canadians do not generally endorse that view.
<P>
	The reaction I have had in my riding to this budget has been 
quite favourable. My constituents are pleased. Canadians from 
coast to coast to coast have indicated repeatedly that they are 
pleased. No, not with every single decision in the budget but 
they are pleased in general that the minister and the government 
are on the right track.
<P>
	In my riding I have formed an agricultural advisory 
committee. The previous speaker from the Reform Party pretty 
much solely addressed large parts of his comments to 
agriculture. The farmers I represent have made it clear that yes, 
they took a hit, but they acknowledge that business subsidies 
were cut by 60 per cent. The farmers I represent feel that the 
finance minister got it about right.
<P>
	It would seem that except for Bob Rae who has an election 
coming up pretty soon which he would like to duck and some of 
his colleagues in the NDP-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Bob who?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes, it will soon be Bob who? Except for those 
people on the left and the Reform Party-I prefer to call it the 
excessive conservative party-except for those two parties on 
the extremes in this country, most Canadians have reacted 
favourably to the budget. That is the reality. That is the fact. I 
know it is not popular to members on the other side but then 
again, that is life.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest as the member opposite was 
going through some Olympian hurdles and patting himself on 
the back for the marvellous job they did.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11274"> 11274 </A></B>
<P>
	Reference to the Olympics would be fair and accurate 
because the Liberals do have this new Olympic sport. It is 
called low hurdles. No matter how tough it is, you can only 
bruise your shins going over the Olympic low hurdles of the 
Liberals.
<P>
	We know we have to take some serious hits and Canadians by 
and large are prepared for it. They are anticipating it and want to 
do it. We do not want to leave a bankrupt country to our 
grandchildren. The essence is that it must be fair. If it is not fair, 
it will not meet with public acceptance on a broad base.
<P>
	My specific question has to do with the fairness of the budget. 
It has to do with the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act. 
How is it that this affects one province disproportionately, the 
province of Alberta? It affects Nova Scotia and Alberta, no other 
province in Canada.
<P>
	The hon. parliamentary secretary said that the reason it is 
being cut is that it is not being passed along from the province to 
the individual taxpayer. Does it matter? Is it any business of the 
federal government what the provincial governments do with 
that money? It does not belong to the federal government; it 
belongs to the province.
<P>
	The idea behind that tax was to ensure that all utilities were 
treated fairly. An enterprise that establishes itself in Nova 
Scotia or in Alberta has relatively the same base of taxes for its 
utility demands.
<P>
	The hon. member's arm must now be relaxed after all that 
patting himself on the back. Would he speak to the fairness of 
two provinces, Nova Scotia and Alberta, being singled out for 
this punitive tax measure, which is $70 for every single 
homeowner in either province?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question from 
my colleague.
<P>
	I recall for him that I applauded the efforts of the finance 
minister. Then again, I just joined the vast majority of 
Canadians who are neither in the Reform Party nor perhaps 
Reform Party supporters in applauding the minister for a job 
very well done.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	As to the specific question, it is interesting that my colleague 
singled out Alberta. I would not say he was whining, but I am 
tempted to think that it sounded a bit like a NIMBY type 
complaint. Then he corrected himself because he heard 
information from this side of the House that Nova Scotia was 
being hit by the same measure.
<P>
	It was not something that was aimed at the province of 
Alberta. My colleague had to correct himself in asking his 
question. The government felt there was no good reason for the 
measure in that it had to be reformed and it was not aimed at one 
particular province.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. If his 
constituents are so pleased, is it not because the government is 
hiding the truth? Did the hon. member tell his constituents that 
the federal government was not making any effort to recover the 
$6.6 billion in unpaid taxes? Did he tell his constituents that 
they are the ones who will end up paying for the cuts of over $7 
billion in federal transfers to the provinces, because the 
Minister of Finance lacked the courage to put his own fiscal 
house in order, and chose instead to dump his deficit problems 
on the provinces?
<P>
	Did he also tell his constituents that 70,000 companies did not 
pay taxes, including CN, which made profits of $400 million and 
did not pay one cent? Mr. Tellier is certainly privileged. Does 
the hon. member tell the truth to his constituents?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, I ask for the indulgence of my 
colleague to give me the gist of the question again. I had to step 
outside as he began his remarks.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Could the hon. member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot repeat his question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, this is ridiculous. I am not 
going to repeat all that I said.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Fine. I was not sure if 
you were expecting an answer or not.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise to speak on Bill C-76, an act to implement certain 
provisions of the budget. I am reminded of how different one 
year in the life of a government can be. A year ago following our 
first budget we were roundly scolded by both the media and our 
constituents that we needed to do more to cut the size of 
government to address the deficit.
<P>
	One year later we have listened, consulted and acted. Not 
surprisingly we have a budget that has been roundly praised by 
the media and our constituents as being pragmatic and realistic, 
a budget for our times.
<P>
	There are times when fundamental changes must be faced. For 
Canadians 1995 is a time when choices and change are still 
possible without destroying the ideals or the principles we as 
Canadians hold dear.
<P>
	The government came into office because it believed that jobs 
and growth must be the nation's top priority if we are to create a 
climate of economic well-being for all Canadians. To achieve 
our goal we must act now to restore the nation's fiscal health.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11275"> 11275 </A></B>
<P>
	Over the next three years the actions in the budget will 
deliver upward of $7 or spending cuts for every $1 of new tax 
revenue. By 1997-98 the deficit could be brought below $19 
billion if interest rates and income growth conform with the 
average private sector forecast rather than with our cautious 
assumptions.
<P>
	After extensive review the budget overhauls how government 
works and what government does. We must redesign the role of 
government in the economy. We can no longer design programs 
with one hand in the taxpayer's pocket. The role of government 
should extend only to those things that government can do best, 
leaving the rest to those who can do it better.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	The budget puts our priorities into action. Between this fiscal 
year and 1997-98 annual spending will have decreased by $25.3 
billion in expenditure cuts. For example, annual spending will 
decrease by $1.6 billion in defence, $550 million in foreign 
assistance, $1.4 billion in transport, $600 million in natural 
resources, upward to $900 million in human resources 
development, approximately $200 million in fisheries, $900 
million within industry, and almost $450 million in agriculture.
<P>
	As a result of the cutback and reform of programs the public 
service will be reduced by 45,000 positions over the next three 
years, representing approximately 20 per cent of the total 
government workforce. This is not downsizing government. In 
my opinion it is right sizing government.
<P>
	As mentioned, a key principle of the 1995 budget is to 
redesign the role of government in the economy. The decision to 
dramatically reduce subsidies to business shows that principle 
at work. The simple fact is that the subsidies often did more 
harm to businesses than help them as they fostered a relationship 
of dependence that had nothing to do with good business 
practices. That is why the budget cuts business subsidies by 60 
per cent, from $3.8 billion last year to $1.5 billion by 1997-98.
<P>
	Areas where subsidies will drop sharply include agriculture 
and transportation. We can no longer afford subsidies designed 
decades ago which today are actually restricting and restraining 
adaptation, diversification and competitiveness.
<P>
	Western Grain Transportation Act subsidies are being 
eliminated for a savings of $2.6 billion over five years. However 
there will be transition measures. We will make a one-time $1.6 
billion payment to prairie landowners and invest a further $300 
million to help establish a more efficient grain handling and 
transportation system. As well we will co-operate with 
provincial agriculture ministers to develop a national whole 
farm package. It will encourage innovation and diversification 
while producing a 30 per cent reduction in federal contributions 
to agricultural safety nets.
<P>
	The Atlantic freight subsidies are also being eliminated for a 
five-year savings of $500 million. This will be balanced by a 
five-year transition program, including help to modernize the 
highway system in Atlantic Canada and eastern Quebec.
<P>
	Our cuts to subsidies extend far beyond the agriculture and 
transportation sectors. At Industry Canada subsidies will be cut 
in half, from $525 million in 1994-95 to $264 million in 
1997-98. The remaining spending will focus on initiatives in 
high growth sectors in partnership with the private sector.
<P>
	A new role for regional development agencies will see them 
focusing on small and medium size enterprises. However the 
assistance will rely on loans and repayable contributions rather 
than on direct subsidies. As a result subsidies from these 
agencies will drop from $700 million to $234 million over three 
years.
<P>
	Subsidies to cultural industries are also being reduced, 
including an 8 per cent reduction to the postal subsidy. As well 
we are eliminating the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act 
which returns to the provinces the taxes paid by privately owned 
utilities. As a result major energy subsidies will virtually 
disappear, dropping from $410 million to $8 million.
<P>
	These subsidy cuts are vital components in restoring Canada's 
fiscal health. We also recognize that there are times and places 
where government can and should assist the private sector in 
today's fast changing global environment.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	Nowhere is this more evident than in agriculture and 
agri-food where the government is committed to a growing, 
competitive market oriented industry that is profitable and 
responds to the changing food and non-food needs of domestic 
and international customers.
<P>
	In support of its vision for Canada's agriculture and agri-food 
sector the government will, besides the changes already noted, 
provide $1 billion in credit guarantees for the export of grains 
and other agri-food products. The government will enhance 
trade and market development programs to support exporters 
and potential exporters through the creation of a new agri-food 
service, including the agri-food trade network, a new agri-food 
2000 program, and the establishment of the agri-food marketing 
council.
<P>
	As well it will streamline our research infrastructure and 
reallocate resources to matching investment initiatives up to 
$70 million per year by the end of the decade. That is $35 
million from government and $35 million from industry, a 
dollar for dollar match. The government will allocate $60 
million per year to enhance the sector's ability to respond 
effectively to an environment of new market opportunities and 
fewer subsidies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11276"> 11276 </A></B>
<P>
	The program will support better access to capital, new 
management skills and better infrastructure including improved 
access to information and technology.
<P>
	It will reduce dairy subsidies and undertake consultation with 
industry on the use of remaining moneys to enhance the 
industry's competitiveness. Additionally it will eliminate the 
feed freight assistance subsidy in 1995 and redirect 
approximately $60 million over the next 10 years to encourage 
agriculture and agri-food development in Atlantic Canada, 
eastern Quebec, northern Ontario, British Columbia, Northwest 
Territories and Yukon.
<P>
	Under the Farm Improvements and Marketing Co-Operative 
Loans Act the government is proposing to increase the amount 
of loan guarantees from $1.5 billion to $3 billion to assist in the 
process of adaptation and change.
<P>
	The government's proposals in the agriculture and agri-food 
sector represent significantly the necessary change. With the 
current fiscal situation we must shift to activities that enhance 
the industry's ability to compete and succeed in the 
marketplace.
<P>
	In conclusion, for too long governments have known the need 
for change, the need for renewal, but have lacked the will. The 
government has consulted with the people of Canada, including 
the agriculture community. I urge members to pass the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to ask a question 
of the member who during his remarks placed a considerable 
amount of emphasis on agricultural issues, particularly the 
elimination of the grain freight subsidy which the budget and the 
bill bring forward.
<P>
	The single most devastating element of the budget is the 
elimination of the Crow benefit, the transportation obligation of 
the government with respect to ensuring that we have 
agricultural exports of grain.
<P>
	The member and the government are aware that regardless of 
what diversification occurs on the prairies and regardless of 
what value added industries are in place, anywhere from 60 per 
cent to 80 per cent of grains grown on the prairies will remain for 
export. As a result the increase in costs for freight will be 
substantial and the reduction of income for farmers and the 
communities they support will be substantial.
<P>
	I know the government has spent some time in calculating 
how it would eliminate the subsidy and save the departments of 
transport and agriculture some money. I wonder if the member 
has seen any analysis or evaluation that points to or 
substantiates the evidence the government says is available 
concerning the long term implications of the withdrawal of the 
Crown benefit from the prairie economy. Has the member seen 
any analysis, evaluation or study regarding what the elimination 
of the subsidy will mean to the prairie economy?
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to respond to the 
hon. member, that I have not seen a report that means to say 
these studies have been completed. This is an ongoing procedure 
right now. We have come up with $1.6 billion to anticipate any 
property loss that will be experienced by prairie land owners and 
there is a $300 million program there to soften the blow also.
<P>
	The issue we really have to look at is the commodity of 
moving potash in the prairie provinces and moving the 
commodity of wheat. The transportation costs for the two by the 
railways has to be the same. The farmer cannot carry the extra 
cost of having his wheat be more expensive to move and still be 
competitive on the world markets.
<P>
	That tells me there has to be a unified front of all the industry 
players. Everybody has to come up with the most efficient, 
effective way of moving grain for the international markets. 
That is the process going on right now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, since the hon. member is so fond of figures, I want to 
ask him if he realizes that the February 28 budget does nothing 
to improve the medium term indebtedness of the federal 
government.
<P>
	If the hon. member did examine the figures and the 
assumptions contained in the budget, I want to ask him the 
following questions: What will be the average annual growth 
rate of tax revenues, for the next three years, based on the 
Minister of Finance's budget? What is the average growth rate 
of operating and program expenditures anticipated in the 
Minister of Finance's budget? Finally, what is the expected 
indebtedness level of the federal government in 1997-98, 
according to the Minister of Finance's budget?
<P>
	If the hon. member looked at the real consequences of the 
budget of his colleague, it might be a good idea for him to 
answer these three questions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Madam Speaker, if I could give the hon. member 
answers to question like that, I would be a millionaire in the 
stock markets.
<P>
	We have listened to the forecast from the private sector as to 
what the anticipated growth will be for this year and next year. 
Our assumptions have been lower than that.
<P>
	I will crunch some figures. We started 1994-95 setting our 
budget figures at $39.7 billion. That was to be the deficit. By 
1996-97 the figure is being set at around $24.3 billion. That is a 
$15.4 billion cut over two years. We know we are adding to the 
accumulated public debt which is also costing us.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first of all, I am delighted with this opportunity to speak to the 
amendment moved by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.
<P>
	Since we first came to the House of Commons on October 25, 
1993, you have come to recognize the spirited style of the hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot. Although style is not 
necessarily a guarantee of competence, I think the hon. member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot passes the test. He is both spirited 
and competent, and I want to commend him on the way he 
defends the interests of our party and the interests of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	This motion, and I will read it quickly, says that the hon. 
member moved, seconded by the hon. member for Châteauguay,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' 
and substituting the following therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Bill C-76, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 27, 1995, be not now read a second time but that it be 
read a second time this day six months hence.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I must say that I do not claim to be as competent as the hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot in this particular area, so I 
asked him to explain the purpose of this amendment. For the 
benefit of our listeners, not necessarily in this House but outside 
the House, I would say that the purpose of this amendment is to 
let the Minister of Finance go back to the drawing board, to ask 
him to go back and do his homework.
<P>
	I have a 16-year old son in high school, and when he shows 
my wife and me some work that is not up to par, we tell him to go 
back and do his homework. That is the purpose of the 
amendment: to ask the Minister of Finance to go back and do his 
homework.
<P>
	Why? Because there are a number of questions worth asking 
Canadians and Quebecers who are listening. Is this budget 
realistic when fails to mention $6.6 billion in unpaid taxes 
which are not recovered? Is this budget realistic when it is so 
reluctant to tax Canada's big corporations? According to the 
statistics, between 62,000 and 70,000 companies in Canada 
make a profit and do not pay a cent in taxes. Is that normal? 
Should a democratic society like ours accept this double 
standard, when the middle class and the poor are getting poorer 
and the rich and the big corporations get richer at their expense?
<P>
	Is this normal? Is this acceptable from a social point of view? 
I am convinced that all these people who are having lunch in 
their kitchens, every time they get the mail and see their bills 
piling up and interest rates go up, all these people wonder 
whether they will be able to afford a new car two or three years 
from now. Will this young couple be able to afford a house two 
or three years  from now, a roof over their heads? Will they be 
doomed to live in poverty? Will our prospects seem better two or 
three years from now, or are we going to go back into a 
recession? These are considerations that this legislation totally 
ignores.
<P>
	Something else. Are these tax loopholes normal? Is it normal 
to see millionaires who do not pay taxes and, in some cases, 
draw unemployment insurance benefits? That takes some doing. 
In any case, on the Île d'Orléans and the Beaupré flats, people 
say: ``C'est le bout'', which means adding insult to injury.
<P>
	Family trusts. When he brought down his budget on February 
27, the Minister of Finance announced that the family trust 
system would be abolished. He forgot to point out it would be 
abolished in 1999.
<P>
	This means, if I am a very rich family that has a family trust, I 
have until 1999 to adjust to the new rules and to find other tax 
loopholes, other investment vehicles so that I can continue to 
shelter these amounts. So the question is whether all this, 
whether this budget is normal, acceptable and realistic in the 
Canada and Quebec of 1995.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	When I go back to my riding on Fridays and on the weekends, 
people often stop me at the corner store or at the shopping centre 
to tell me that it did not hurt as much as they expected. This may 
be true, but we have to look beyond the words to see how vicious 
the budget was. I tell these people to wait for the Quebec 
government to bring down its own budget to see how the federal 
budget will affect them.
<P>
	And if I was talking to the people of Ontario, I would tell them 
to wait and see what kind of problems the Ontario government 
will have. The budget includes a decentralizing measure whose 
only aim is to offload part of the deficit onto the provinces and 
make them pay for something else. We will see how much 
Ontario and Quebec have been affected, when they bring down 
their budgets. The finance ministers of the two provinces have 
already mentioned this, in any case.
<P>
	It is almost a truism to say that the real budget promised this 
year will be carried over to next year, once again. Why is the 
federal government waiting until next year, we might ask? Is it 
expecting the Quebec referendum to be held in May or June and 
therefore putting off the offensive cuts in health care, education 
and social assistance until afterward? I ask you. Is this not the 
case?
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, however, 
promised the introduction of flexible federalism. Is this flexible 
federalism? Now we have a real idea of the cost of the status quo 
and of a no vote in the upcoming referendum.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11278"> 11278 </A></B>
<P>
	Coming back to transportation, which is the field with which, 
as my party's critic, I am most familiar. I said, in reaction to 
this budget, that the federal government had decided to hold 
a garage sale with Transport Canada. Why would I say such a 
thing?
<P>
	I said it because the Martin budget announced program review 
cuts of $1.1 billion, or 50.8 per cent of expenditures between 
1995 and 1998. If we include the cuts from the preceding budget, 
Department of Transport spending will be reduced by $1.4 
billion between 1994 and 1998. In fact, the measures in the 
Martin budget will allow the government to save $2.6 billion in 
the Department of Transport over three years as a result of the 
program review.
<P>
	We should look at what makes us think that the government is 
getting out of transportation. Well, there are the moves to 
privatize announced in this budget, the planned 
commercialization of the air navigation system. First of all, let 
us be clear that most of the employees affected by 
rationalization in the government will be transferred to the 
private sector. A non-profit corporation will be set up, looking 
after the 5,800 employees now working for the air navigation 
system.
<P>
	I would remind the hon. members that our party is not 
necessarily opposed in principle to the creation of a non-profit 
corporation in the move to commercialize the air navigation 
service. However, I and my party still have questions about this 
plan that we would like answered. Among other things, what 
would be the value of the assets transferred and what would the 
transfer cost? Before giving our full blessing, we will need 
answers to the questions that we will be asking at the appropriate 
time.
<P>
	The second sector in which the government has announced 
plans to privatize is Canadian National. It will be recalled that 
the report of the government group, composed entirely of 
Liberal members-no members of the official opposition or the 
Reform Party were included-recommended that before CN 
could be put up for sale, its debt should be reduced, its profits 
increased and the network rationalized, among other things.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Again, it should be pointed out that CP's offer to buy CN for 
$1.4 billion was totally unacceptable. This point was debated, 
and we had the opportunity to agree with the government that 
offering $1.4 billion for CN's assets was totally unacceptable. 
We do agree on that.
<P>
	It remains to be seen, however, how much CN's privatization 
will actually bring in. Let us not forget that CN is the property of 
Canadian and Quebec taxpayers. So, it should not be sold at 
bargain price to friends of the regime or those who make 
donations to the Liberal campaign fund. In that regard, the 
official opposition will play its role as a watchdog, to see if CN's 
purchase price reflects its true value.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is now the only party defending the rights 
of the workers, including the right to strike in Canada, as 
evidenced by the NDP's failure to show up last weekend, when 
special legislation was passed to force resumption of operations 
in the railway industry. So, we will have to make sure that the 
rights of CN workers are not trampled in the privatization 
process, that their rights will be maintained. We will certainly 
get to talk about this issue again.
<P>
	Also contemplated in this budget as part of the privatization 
effort is the commercialization of operations under the national 
airports policy. A task force was appointed by the Government 
of Quebec to provide assistance to those municipalities and 
local groups who wish to undertake negotiations with Ottawa on 
this subject.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Quebec's 
labour minister, Jacques Léonard, on taking a very worthwhile 
initiative in support of municipalities which may be facing 
airport privatization or even closure, because the problem has 
not been resolved. Considering that the airport in Sept-Îles lost 
$1.9 million and the one in Baie-Comeau, $1.2 million, while in 
Val-d'Or the airport is also running on a deficit, we have to ask 
ourselves if municipal taxpayers will be able to absorb these 
deficits?
<P>
	It is important to bear in mind, when the federal government 
invests in our regions, these funds are not gifts to us. As a matter 
of fact, it is our money because, as far as I know, Sept-Îles 
residents receiving services from the federal government which 
is building an airport pay federal taxes through automatic 
payroll deductions or, in the case of professionals, make tax 
payments, so they are entitled to receive services from the 
federal government.
<P>
	A fourth target for privatization in this budget is the motor 
vehicle testing centre in Blainville, which should remain in the 
hands of the government but whose operation will be handed 
over to the private sector in the course of this year. Negotiations 
are apparently under way. On this particular subject, we reserve 
comment as we have received information regarding some 
goings-on that are not very-I do not want to make a religious 
comment, but my colleague from Chicoutimi is suggesting that I 
should say not very kosher.
<P>
	It is true that, like the hon. member, I come from the 
Saguenay. There seem to be some dubious goings-on with 
regard to this operation, but I cannot go any further because I 
want to save this for questioning the Minister of Transport in 
due course.
<P>
	This budget provides for the revocation of the Western Grain 
Transportation Act and the elimination of a $560 million 
subsidy. This subsidy created, once again, a double standard in 
Canada, especially in the railway sector.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11279"> 11279 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	We realized that in the railway sector-and this comment 
does not apply only to Quebec-, there are two different criteria 
to determine the profitability of rail lines in Canada: everything 
east of Winnipeg had to be profitable in order to survive and 
continue operating, while everything west of Winnipeg was 
considered to be a subsidized service. This in turn led to some 
very strange things. They even discovered that some trainloads 
of grain were shipped to Vancouver via the port in Thunder Bay 
just to qualify for the subsidy.
<P>
	I remember when we were kids and we used to play 
Monopoly. After going around the board, we would pass ``Go'' 
and claim $200 before continuing to circle around. This truly 
reminds me of a game of Monopoly.
<P>
	By eliminating this subsidy, the government will put an end to 
this game of Monopoly. We would like to be supportive and say 
that this is a good measure, but there is always an unfortunate 
aspect. In this case, it is the fact that the budget provides 
compensation-and I hope that farmers of Île d'Orléans and the 
Beaupré shore will not choke when they hear this-to the tune of 
$2.9 billion to western agricultural producers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Untaxed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Untaxed, the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot just pointed out.
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves whether it is normal or acceptable, 
in 1995, for a democratic society to implement such provisions. 
This is why westerners have not been too vocal. They do not 
complain too much about the fact that the Western Grain 
Transportation Act will be repealed, because they know that 
they will get $2.9 billion in compensation.
<P>
	I say to Quebec agricultural producers: ``Put on a smile, the 
federal taxes you pay will help your competition''. These 
subsidies will help western producers to change their 
production, and who is to say that they will not replace their 
grain production with meat, poultry or dairy products. And they 
will do it all with your federal taxes. This is incredible.
<P>
	The bill also repeals the Atlantic Region Freight Assistance 
Act. Subsidies totalling some $99 million, and perhaps as much 
as $108 million, depending which of the two figures I have is 
accurate, are provided for the region located east of an 
imaginary line called the Jackman line, in the Beauce region, 
including the Gaspé peninsula and all of Atlantic Canada. 
Again, we are talking about subsidies totalling some $100 
million.
<P>
	This program will be eliminated. As a transitory measure, the 
budget provides for a five year, $326 million transportation 
adjustment program. Bloc Quebecois members representing 
eastern Quebec will probably express their views on this issue, 
since their region will be eligible for the moneys which will be 
made available to either improve the highway system or support 
programs for secondary or tertiary processing.
<P>
	In any case, I represent the riding of 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans and I am not directly 
concerned by this issue. However, I think that the residents of 
eastern Quebec, the lower St. Lawrence region, the Gaspé 
peninsula and the riding of Bellechasse are in a good position to 
know how this adjustment fund could be used.
<P>
	I did meet business owners from that region who told me that, 
sometimes, this subsidy was ineffective-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member, but the period for debate is over. We now move 
on to questions and comments.
<P>
	Since there are no questions, we resume debate. The hon. 
member for Egmont.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Algoma. I am happy 
to have the opportunity to speak in support of Bill C-76, an act 
to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 27.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	I speak in support of the bill. I commend the Minister of 
Finance for the excellent job he has done in developing a budget 
that has been embraced by an overwhelming majority of 
Canadian people and international money markets.
<P>
	On the one hand there have been complaints, as we heard from 
the Bloc Quebecois, that the minister went too far. On the other 
hand the consensus of the Reform Party is that we did not go far 
enough. However, the general consensus of Canadians is that the 
budget was a reasonable and fair effort to address the problems 
faced by the nation.
<P>
	The people of Canada indicated very loudly and clearly that 
they wanted the minister to move decisively to address the 
problems of the debt and the deficit. They wanted to see a 
definitive plan by which the country could be moving toward a 
balanced budget and beyond to a surplus budget. Canadians also 
indicated that they did not want any increases in personal 
income tax, and there was none.
<P>
	I am happy to say that the fundamental thrust of the budget 
addresses in a fair, equitable and balanced fashion the demands 
of the Canadian people. The budget responds to the need to put 
Canada's fiscal house in order. Granted, there will be some pain 
but I believe that the burden of deficit reduction has been 
distributed fairly. The confidence of the Canadian people is 
being restored as they realize spending is tightening up and that 
they will be getting better value for their tax dollar.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11280"> 11280 </A></B>
<P>
	Many of the provisions in the budget have already been dealt 
with. Those remaining are being handled today with Bill C-76. 
However the message is clear and the message is consistent. 
The government is getting its own house in order. It is 
downsizing. It is focusing on cutting expenditures and not on 
raising taxes.
<P>
	The targets set by the Minister of Finance indicate that we are 
moving toward the much desired position of a balanced budget. 
It is reassuring that we are moving in this direction in a fair and 
humane fashion. We must never lose sight of the fact, though, 
that some parts of the country are not as economically 
advantaged as others.
<P>
	The principles upon which the country was founded require 
that the federal government maintain a program of 
redistribution of wealth so that no Canadian should have to 
endure diminished social security simply because he or she lives 
in one province as opposed to another. One of the main standards 
by which we are measured against other countries is the degree 
of caring and compassion we show to one another. Less 
fortunate Canadians must be protected.
<P>
	I realize the system of federal transfers must be reformed. It 
must become more efficient, more effective and more 
sustainable. Without this kind of change our capacity to fund 
would be seriously constrained, maybe even terminated. Some 
critics say that the proposed changes which consolidate the EPF 
and CAP into the Canadian social transfer put some social 
programs at risk. I suggest that without a sustained effort to 
address our deficit and debt problem the same social programs 
will be put at even greater risk.
<P>
	However, in my province of Prince Edward Island there is 
considerable concern about the possible effects of the new CST. 
I am sure the Minister of Finance understands that the fact a 
province has more flexibility and more capacity to be innovative 
is of minimal value if the resources, the dollars, are not 
available to work with.
<P>
	When the minister is negotiating with the provinces I am sure 
he will keep this in mind. Though the budget document indicates 
that national standards especially under the Canada Health Act 
will be maintained, there is still concern in economically 
disadvantaged areas that there could be some difficulties 
encountered. It is encouraging that included in the process of 
change is a commitment to a co-operative approach whereby a 
new federal-provincial fiscal relationship will be established.
<P>
	One area about which Canadians were quite vocal was 
taxation. They wanted no increase in personal income taxes, and 
there was none. They wanted no changes to RRSPs, and there 
was virtually none. They wanted health and dental plans left 
alone, and they were left alone. They wanted big business to pay 
a fairer share. This has happened with increased taxes on large 
corporations, a surtax on corporate profits, and a tax on deposit 
taking institutions.
<P>
	The public got hit with a small tax it did not particularly want, 
but I have not heard many complaints about it. That was the 1.5 
cent per litre tax on gasoline.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	Overall, for every $1 in new revenue the government cuts $7 
in spending. That ratio is a fair and balanced way to approach 
our deficit and debt problem. It is also reflective of the 
sentiments of the vast majority of the Canadian people.
<P>
	One of the areas of budget cuts that did impact negatively on 
P.E.I. involved the transportation subsidies. The cuts to the 
freight subsidies will be supplemented for a number of years 
with transitional funding in the amount of $326 million. There 
were cuts to the dairy industry. The dairy people did expect 
some cuts there, especially when they saw the Western Grain 
Transportation Act being abolished.
<P>
	One thing not counted on in the budget was the hit from 
Human Resources Development Canada whereby the farmers 
will suffer the loss in the agriculture employment program. 
Hopefully over the next few weeks we can develop a program 
which will ease the burden on the farmers as they ease out of this 
well used program.
<P>
	Atlantic Canada is sharing in the pain of deficit reduction. 
Two items in the budget which had relatively cosmetic 
treatment, which would seem to be due for major surgery over 
the next year, are seniors benefits and UI. I am pleased the 
government is renewing its commitment to seniors so they will 
have a system of protection that is fair and reliable.
<P>
	In order to do that the CPP, OAS and GIS must be sustainable. 
In making the changes that will make it sustainable I asked the 
Minister of Finance to keep in mind concerns such as those 
expressed by John G. Bates of Etobicoke. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I'd gladly trade all the benefits that I'm supposed to be getting as a senior for 
a return to a level playing field for those over and under age 65. -return my 
right to work beyond age 65-allow me to be eligible for employer paid health 
and dental plans-allow me to get tax breaks allowed others through RRSPs and 
work related deductions and credits.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Discrimination because of advancing age is the last bastion of the bigot.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would caution the Minister of Finance and the Minister of 
Human Resources Development that frequent UI users are not 
automatically abusers. In my riding the main industries are 
fisheries, agriculture, tourism and forestry. They are all 
seasonal. Workers in these industries are needed every year. 
Some of them cannot simply be retrained or shipped out to 
higher employment areas.
<P>
	I want to use a quote from the columnist Peter H. Nicol in the 
<I>Ottawa-Carleton Review</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most significant word to come out of the federal budget speech is the 
word change. Not the millions of dollars slashed here, the millions of dollars 
promised there, numbers which are virtually meaningless to those of us who 
can't balance our cheque  books. The word change was the crux of the matter, 
for it was the first indication that the federal government was prepared to face an 
issue that the public had been aware of for some time; that is to say that if 
Canada is going to survive in either the financial or political sense we must 
make fundamental changes both in our political structures and in our personal 
lives.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	The change the Minister of Finance talked about was not so 
much in terms of dollars, although they will play a role, but 
more in the philosophy of government. The minister asked what 
role the government should play in the lives of the people of the 
country and the answer he received was less.
<P>
	Paternalistic government seems to becoming a thing of the 
past with the government once again becoming a tool instead of 
a solution. That is no bad thing.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the hon. member's speech. He started off by 
saying that one of the objectives of this budget was to put the 
government's fiscal house in order, in a way that is fair and 
equitable.
<P>
	I wonder what he means by fair. Does he realize who is going 
to bear the brunt of all these budget cuts? The provinces, which 
will be stuck with billions of dollars they will have to raise 
themselves.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Young people will be affected by cuts in a number of 
employment programs and in the money required for 
post-secondary education. Cuts will also affect the public 
service, but only the base, not the higher-ups in their ivory 
towers, with the biggest paychecks and the biggest expense 
accounts. This morning we heard about the trips these officials 
make. Not the people who work at the bottom but those who are 
up there in their ivory towers in each department, the generals 
who are chauffeured around in their limos. They are not affected 
by the budget.
<P>
	I am also thinking of farmers. The hon. member said a few 
words about them in his speech. Yes, farmers will be affected by 
cuts to employment and other programs.
<P>
	I am also thinking of the unemployed. This has almost 
become a dirty word to members opposite, because to them, the 
unemployed are just a lazy bunch of beer drinkers. Since last 
week, they are cheaters as well, and an army of public servants 
has been recruited to try and recover negligible amounts, while 
we do not even bother to recover $6.6 billion in taxes 
outstanding. Most of this amount is owed by large corporations.
<P>
	When the hon. member talks about everything being fair and 
equitable, I wonder at whose expense. What is so equitable 
about it, if everybody can use family trusts and tax loopholes to 
shelter their money?
<P>
	Not once did the hon. member mention job creation. What job 
creation programs has this budget proposed, especially for 
young people?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McGuire:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.
<P>
	As we read the newspapers over this past month and a half we 
saw provincial government after provincial government, New 
Brunswick, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and 
probably tomorrow Prince Edward Island, coming in with 
balanced budgets.
<P>
	The hon. member says we are offloading to the provinces. Is it 
fair for the provinces to expect the federal government to 
subsidize the provincial balanced budgets and not address our 
own budget problems? If he answered that honestly he would 
say no. We have a major budget problem, not only an 
accumulated debt but in our annual deficits.
<P>
	We see provinces balancing their budgets. We know most of 
the provinces receive transfer payments of one sort or another. 
They are looking very good in front of their people and getting 
all kinds of support and applause for doing so. A lot of the 
money to those provincial governments is coming from the 
federal government.
<P>
	I do not think any fair minded provincial premier would say 
we should not address our budget deficits at all; that we should 
continue sending money to the provinces and to individuals that 
we do not have and have to borrow year after year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to follow my colleague, the member for Egmont, in 
participating in the debate on our most recent federal budget, a 
budget which speaks to a whole new attitude toward governance, 
a new attitude by the people of Canada because they see good 
leadership.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	After many years, finally again they are seeing good 
leadership in their government; the kind of leadership that 
breeds confidence. Even though Canadians are having to accept 
a share in the national effort to reduce our annual deficit and 
ultimately the debt, they recognize it is a small price for putting 
the country back on track.
<P>
	Some of our critics take issue with jobs and say we have not 
addressed that. Fundamentally the budget is about jobs. We 
cannot properly take our place on the world stage if our financial 
house is not in order.
<P>
	When our finance minister was faced with the challenge of 
creating a budget, he had to deal with the view of our nation 
from outside and from within its borders. The view from outside 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11282"> 11282 </A></B>
<P>
was we had to deal specifically with the problem of our deficit 
and debt. If we did not we would pay the price over the short, 
middle and long run with higher interest rates, more instability 
with respect to exchange rates, more uncertainty with respect to 
inflation.
<P>
	The international marketplace, whether we like it or not, does 
influence the domestic marketplace. Our finance 
minister-great credit due to him-has found that delicate 
balancing point between dealing with the need of the 
international marketplace to have confidence in the future of our 
economy while at the same time respecting the need of 
individual Canadians and their communities to have confidence 
in their government, to know their federal government is there 
standing behind them even though we have had to take difficult 
measures at this time.
<P>
	No doubt we face more challenging budgets in the years 
ahead. I can refer to a recent Angus Reid poll that indicated 
some two-thirds of Canadians who were polled support the 
budget.
<P>
	They have concerns. My constituents of Algoma are like other 
Canadians. They support the budget but they know they will feel 
the effects one way or another. The budget was fair because 
Canadians will feel it but they will also know and feel those 
efforts are worth the trouble.
<P>
	Our finance minister in finding that balance has created a 
situation in which the cuts are as evenly spread across the 
country as possible without hurting the most disadvantaged. As 
the member for Egmont emphasized, he did it without 
increasing personal income taxes. That is of great credit to him. 
He listened to Canadians. He listened to the finance committee, 
which held prebudget consultations last fall.
<P>
	I am honoured to be a member of that committee. When we 
listened to Canadians last fall from all areas, they told us in no 
uncertain terms we have to do something with the deficit.
<P>
	The absence of whining among the witnesses was remarkable. 
The absence of whining after the budget is remarkable. 
Canadians understand something had to be done. It is testimony 
to the quality of leadership that the budget met the objectives of 
the international community and the objectives of most 
Canadians.
<P>
	The finance minister had to respect the traditions of the 
country. One of the most fundamental traditions is the network 
that is our social safety net. It is one of the features of our 
country that sets us apart in this world. It is one of the features of 
this country that makes us one of the most desirable nations in 
which to live.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	All of us are aware the safety net is under review and we are 
expecting legislation later this year. The best way to secure the 
safety net is to have a strong and vibrant economy. The 
government and our finance minister have done just that.
<P>
	I want to address some of the things my constituents will have 
to face. We have a transparent government. We consult with 
people and we share with them what needs to be done.
<P>
	For some, their deepest worries are about pensions. They need 
not worry because the minister has done nothing to create 
concern in that area. In fact, he virtually has not touched the 
whole issue of RRSPs.
<P>
	My constituents will have to share with Canadians 
everywhere as we cut expenditures. Some of those areas include 
the string of several dozens of small craft harbours in my riding 
of Algoma in northern Ontario. These are small recreational 
harbours and some not so small. They have developed over the 
last 20 or so years in support of tourism in the marine industry.
<P>
	This government is not throwing out the baby with the bath 
water. What this government is saying to the provinces and in 
my case to the local governments: ``Work with us, let us find a 
way to continue these local facilities. Let us do it in a way that 
gives you more local control over these facilities''.
<P>
	I have spoken to a number of municipal leaders in my riding. 
The response has been very positive to this government's 
initiative to say: ``Let us partner with you. Let us preserve these 
facilities. Let us work with you so the local governments can 
take these over and manage them themselves, instead of having 
management from Toronto, Ottawa or elsewhere''.
<P>
	Many of my constituents had concerns about the federal 
RRAP program, which is a CMHC program that assists lower 
income people with needed home repairs. To the credit of this 
government the program has not been cut. I want to assure my 
constituents in that regard. The funding for the rural residential 
assistance program which was committed in the 1993 campaign 
is still there. Unfortunately there was a large backlog created in 
that program because the previous government cut the program. 
Now many people are lined up who need important work done on 
their homes so they can safely and healthily live in them.
<P>
	There is a federal mining research laboratory in Elliot Lake. It 
is a CANMET lab. Likewise with this lab, the federal 
government did not say: ``We are closing the doors. This 
laboratory has to be closed because the mining industry in the 
community is on the verge of total closure''. Instead, the federal 
government has said to the community: ``Let us partner. Let us 
find a way to attract other research into this facility so we can 
make a more viable research effort in this community. Let us 
partner with the province; let us partner with the private sector 
and others to create a viable situation for mine related research 
and other kinds of research in this community''.
<P>
	The government did not take the old hatchet to programs like 
we have seen previous governments do, when they had the nerve 
to even try. When they did do it, it was done without thinking. 
This government did not and does not do that. A tremendous  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11283"> 11283 </A></B>
<P>
amount of forethought has gone into the planning of the required 
adjustments needed to the finances of this country.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	The budget sets us on the road. It is a complement to last 
year's budget which I believe will lead to a balanced budget in a 
few years time. It will cause investment, jobs and all the other 
fruits of economic growth and strength this country and the 
people of Canada deserve.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate you on your splendid work in the chair. I listened 
attentively to my colleague and was surprised by his statement 
that Canadians across the country expressed confidence in this 
budget.
<P>
	I am sure my colleague has not visited Quebec in a very long 
time, because he would have heard for himself what Quebecers 
think of the budget. It is easy, of course, to say that we will all 
have to make small sacrifices, but, it will be those already most 
disadvantaged, such as the seniors, who will be making most of 
them.
<P>
	You know, in a region such as mine, the Saguenay-Lac 
Saint-Jean region, where unemployment is very high, young 
people are forced to go elsewhere just to try to find 
work-unsuccessfully. When we see this happening in pretty 
well all the regions of Canada and cuts being made to transfers 
to the provinces, we have to assume that the government does 
not care about educating young people.
<P>
	My question concerns these transfers. Does my colleague 
realize that most of the budget cuts to transfer payments for 
health care and post-secondary education will be made in 1996, 
1997 and 1998? This year's cuts, even though they will hurt, will 
be smaller than the ones in the years to come.
<P>
	What is the government's strategy here? Instead of creating 
jobs, it is pursuing a strategy of showing Quebecers that 
federalism is effective, which is not true. It is trying to delay the 
effects of the budget until as long as possible after the 
referendum.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi for his comments and question.
<P>
	I visit Quebec often. When I am in Ottawa I live in Quebec. 
That should put his concern in that area to rest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Where?
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Near Wakefield in the beautiful Gatineau hills.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about the transfers and what the 
federal government is allegedly doing to impair the ability of the 
provinces to do their job. To spend $63 million and counting on a 
referendum campaign is not exactly the wisest use of money. I 
submit to him that Quebecers would like the provincial 
government to focus its attention on economic issues and not so 
much on the sovereignty campaign. His message and his 
question should more fairly be put to his provincial counterparts 
but nonetheless, I will answer his question.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	The strategy is quite transparent. Through the proposed CST, 
the Canadian social transfer, it is proposed through block 
funding to give the provinces more jurisdiction over health, 
post-secondary education and social services within a 
framework of some form of national standards to be agreed on 
with the provinces.
<P>
	There is a strategy. It is transparent. It is obvious. I submit 
that the member for Chicoutimi should really discuss this with 
his provincial colleagues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in rising to speak to Bill C-76, the budget 
implementation act, I want to make it clear from the outset that 
the Reform Party will oppose this bill as a whole.
<P>
	This bill in some ways is like Bill C-68, the gun control 
legislation in that it is a bill with more than one part. Some of it 
is wholly unacceptable, but other parts with some minor changes 
would be acceptable to the Reform Party of Canada and to me.
<P>
	Reform currently has a motion before the House to separate 
the gun control bill into two parts so that we could examine each 
main idea on its own merits. I wish we could do that with this bill 
as well. Bill C-76 is an omnibus bill dealing with more than one 
subject at once. There are public service issues. There are 
transportation and federal-provincial transfer issues and so on.
<P>
	Since I am fortunate enough to be critic for renewal in the 
public service, we have examined the areas which deal with the 
public service. I have found some things I like and some things I 
do not like one bit. I am here to say what we like and what we do 
not like about the public service portion of this bill. I want to 
expose some very serious shortcomings indeed.
<P>
	I want to go through the first 10 clauses of the bill. I will give 
my comments on each of the important clauses and then draw 
some conclusions from what we have found.
<P>
	Section 39 of the Public Service Employment Act allows 
public servants who work in a minister's office for more than 
three years to bump other public servants, to be appointed in 
essence without competition. This is unfair in some cases. I am 
pleased to report that public servants declared surplus will not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11284"> 11284 </A></B>
<P>
be able to be bumped by the staff of the ministers. Those 
declared surplus in  this act will move to the top of the priority 
list for job offers. That is a fair and reasonable thing to do.
<P>
	I have been disturbed by other parts of the act. Allow me to 
quote from a letter written by the President of the Treasury 
Board to the Professional Institute of the Public Service last 
July. He was writing about the work force adjustment directive 
which is an umbrella agreement between Treasury Board and the 
unions that represent indeterminate or regular full time 
employees of the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Members opposite should listen very closely to what the 
President of the Treasury Board wrote on July 22, 1994: ``This 
government has stated in the past and remains committed to the 
principle that the employment protection provisions in the work 
force adjustment directive will only be changed through 
negotiations''.
<P>
	To me this promise does not speak of unilateral action; it 
speaks of a process of consensus. What is the main purpose of 
the first 10 clauses of Bill C-76? The main object is to break a 
promise. This bill unilaterally without negotiation changes the 
provisions of the directive.
<P>
	The government tried to negotiate. It took a long time but not 
all unions would agree to change the directive. Therefore the 
government went ahead and broke its promise. Why is this little 
broken promise so important? I will be glad to tell you why this 
is so important and every public servant in the federal 
government should be listening right now.
<P>
	The government made all sorts of promises during the last 
election campaign. The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> reported a few days ago 
the contents of a brochure sent out during the campaign under 
the name of a man who today is the minister for renewal in the 
public service.
<P>
	The brochure read: ``Public servants, enough is enough. The 
Conservatives have used public servants as scapegoats and 
treated them with contempt. I pledge to protect public servants 
against job loss''. He is the minister who is sitting in the House 
now. That is another wonderful promise from the government, 
but today that promise lies in shreds along with 45,000 public 
service jobs.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	It is ironic that the Liberals in the last election campaign tried 
to stir up fear among the public servants about what the Reform 
Party might do to their job security in the days ahead. Many of 
them put their trust in the Liberal Party, hoping that nothing 
would be changed, that the words of the minister would hold 
true. The Liberals were happy, of course, to promise the moon as 
long as they could get the public service vote.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board was happy to promise 
that the workforce adjustment directive would only be changed 
through negotiation. It was easy to promise that. If he was not 
sure he could deliver on that promise, he never should have 
made it in the first place. All public servants should beware 
Liberal promises. They  have proven today with this bill that 
their promises are not worth the paper on which they are written.
<P>
	As the financial situation of the government becomes more 
and more serious, more and more promises will have to be 
broken. In just two years the interest alone on the national debt 
will be $51 billion. Total program spending will be barely 
double that, just $108 billion. Social programs and the public 
service will be reduced to a shell because the Liberal 
government feels free to make promises but does not intend to 
lay the fiscal groundwork in order to be able to keep them.
<P>
	This bears repeating. The threat to social programs and the 
threat to our public service does not come from fiscally 
conservative people such as myself. The threat to the public 
service and social programs comes from people who will not and 
do not have a plan to balance the budget and bring the deficit to 
zero. That is where the threat comes from and the budget does 
not address that.
<P>
	Further to this concern, I want to say a word about fiscal 
responsibility. I received an anonymous letter today from a 
public servant who talks about the air navigation system of the 
Department of Transport. There are 6,600 employees in this part 
of the department and the public servant alleges in this letter: 
``Transport Canada employees expect to be terminated with full 
severance and cash out packages and immediately be offered the 
same jobs in a new commercialized air navigation services 
organization with no interruption. Some retiring people can be 
expected to be hired back on contract as they are now''. That 
would be a real travesty.
<P>
	We need assurances from the minister that this will not 
happen, that it will not be allowed to happen. The public servant 
who wrote this letter suggests that this boondoggle could cost 
the taxpayer in excess of $200 million.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party of Canada will watch the Liberals. We 
will hold their feet to the fire to make sure that they are not going 
to merely transfer from the public service an equally expensive 
and maybe even a more expensive contracted service in another 
sector, just for the sake of saying they met a bottom line on the 
job count. That is something that must be watched because the 
key is fiscal responsibility and economic savings to the 
government. If it cannot show that, if it cannot prove that, then it 
should not be axing the jobs to begin with.
<P>
	With tongue firmly in cheek, I would suggest perhaps that the 
Reform Party is not as sophisticated as the Liberal Party. The 
Reform Party sticks to the economic, bald faced facts and offers 
the unvarnished truth. It is not prepared to promise the world to 
the public service or to anyone else. Reformers are willing to 
face the situation as it is and be responsible with taxpayers' 
dollars. All we promise to do is to act immediately to preserve 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11285"> 11285 </A></B>
<P>
what remains of our social programs and what remains of our 
public service over the long run.
<P>
	Reform promised the opposite of the Liberals in the last 
campaign. We promised a smaller government. We promised 
spending cutbacks. Ironically, the cutbacks that the public 
service has experienced since the Liberals took power are 
already and will be in the long run far, far more than what the 
Reform Party promised under our zero in three plan of the last 
election.
<P>
	If Reform had been elected government, the public service 
cutbacks would have been accomplished a year ago. We would 
be within one year of balancing our budget. All the worse would 
be behind us. Interest rates would be lower. Our economy would 
be growing by leaps and bounds. We would be in a good position 
to keep our most valuable social programs and the core of our 
civil service permanently intact. Because of Liberal inaction 
and because it took 18 months to get the first serious budget on 
to the table, all public servants will continue to suffer year after 
year. The government will continue to whittle away at the public 
service until it is reduced to a shell and no negotiated 
settlements, no agreements, no three-year suspensions, no 
promises will mean anything when that happens.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The government has set itself up for another promise. It has 
only suspended the workforce adjustment directive for three 
years. Conveniently, this is just beyond the next election. We 
know what kind of a carrot the government will dangle in front 
of public servants at that time, don't we?
<P>
	The government will be expansive. It will be benevolent. 
During the next election campaign, if the economy is still doing 
well, it will play to the public service vote. It will promise that 
the freeze is almost over and the workforce adjustment directive 
will return. Trust us again, government members will say. 
However, if the economy is doing poorly the government will 
play to the taxpayer. It will say that it had to suspend the 
workforce adjustment directive.
<P>
	No matter what is done, the government plays to the audience 
of the day. It is enough to make one a permanent political cynic 
watching the government flip-flop on its promises.
<P>
	Public servants will remember the President of the Treasury 
Board when they are declared surplus under the authority of the 
bill. They will remember the minister for renewal in the public 
service and his boastful words during the election campaign. He 
said: ``Public servants, enough is enough. I pledge to protect 
public servants against job loss''. That is a good promise. 
However, 45,000 jobs later it is a pretty empty promise. He knew 
it at the time. Yet government members continued to make the 
promise during the election campaign, knowing full well that 
when they were on the government side of the House they would 
not be kept.
<P>
	I will address another subject, term employees. The 
incentives, job offers, notice periods and other things which are 
offered under this bill do not apply to term employees, as 
opposed to indeterminate or permanent employees. Term 
employees have no status whatsoever under the workforce 
adjustment directive. Some of them have worked in government 
for years, but they have no status.
<P>
	The 45,000 positions spoken of in the budget are all 
indeterminate positions. That could mean, for example, that the 
24,000 term employees could be laid off at any time, in addition 
to the 45,000, with absolutely no incentive programs, no 
retirement packages, no appeal, nothing. I call on the 
government to treat term employees with fairness and not to lay 
them off in order to be able to afford more handsome payoffs for 
some of their own friends in the system.
<P>
	My concern is with clause 3 of the bill. It lays out a plan for 
public servants. It empowers the cabinet to offer an early 
departure incentive and then it gives public servants a choice. 
They will have 60 days to choose whether to take the offer and 
go, or to refuse the offer, sit tight and hope for another job. They 
will remain on staff for a period of six months and then move on 
to unpaid surplus status for an additional 18 months. If there is 
no job offer after 18 months, they can be laid off.
<P>
	The minister's officials have already admitted that a lot of 
jobs are going to be declared surplus. There will not necessarily 
be work for the surplus public servant to do when his or her job 
disappears. Yet under the bill the surplus worker will receive six 
months' pay regardless, in some cases for doing nothing at all.
<P>
	All members of the House will remember that the President of 
the Treasury Board promised just a few weeks ago that no 
employee would be paid if he or she was not working. This was a 
fundamental, unbreakable, unshakeable promise on behalf of 
the President of the Treasury Board; that no one would be paid if 
there was no work to be done. Yet like so many other promises, 
this one too has been laid aside by this bill.
<P>
	I would like to move on to clause 9 of the bill which mandates 
a change to the Financial Administration Act. Section 7 deals 
with the delegation of authority. I have real accountability 
concerns on this one because it says that Treasury Board may 
authorize any person who is part of the public service of Canada 
to perform functions or powers that it is able to delegate. That 
clause reads differently in the Financial Administration Act. 
The way it currently reads is actually safer, it is more restrictive. 
It says that anyone authorized under the Treasury Board may 
under the current regulations ``authorize one or more persons 
under his jurisdiction to exercise or perform any such power or 
function''.

<P>
	It may be a small thing but it is a dangerous concept. No 
longer do we have separate jurisdictions. We collapse them all 
into one. It is a dangerous dilution of accountability and an 
unwise splitting of ministerial authority.
<P>
	A deputy minister of Environment Canada could delegate 
some of his power to an official from National Defence. To 
which minister would the civil servants then be accountable? In 
the case of conflict whose orders do they follow? Both ministers 
would have a valid claim on their services and their actions and 
indeed both ministers could be held accountable for what they 
did.
<P>
	In the end what would happen is a public servant would do 
something wrong and one minister could say it was really not his 
department, it was the other minister's department and vice 
versa, back and forth. Any accountability will be lost. This is a 
move in the wrong direction.
<P>
	In the end no one would be accountable for the actions of that 
type of public servant. I sincerely hope that this clause will 
never see the light of day. I hope our members will be able to 
address it more fully in committee.
<P>
	I want to dwell on clause 8 which gives tremendous power to 
the Public Service Commission, a power which should not be 
given to it. I want to talk about the competitive process of job 
applications for a moment.
<P>
	Western democracies have always depended on checks and 
balances. This is born out of a basic mistrust of government, I 
think a valid mistrust of government. It is an attitude which 
says: ``We think you are doing okay right now, but we don't 
know what you would do if the checks and balances were not in 
place''. That is why we have opposition parties in the House of 
Commons. That is why we have opposition parties in 
committees and so on. It is in order to scrutinize the actions of 
the government.
<P>
	Checks and balances are very important. They are vital for the 
health of a western democracy. When we see that an opposition 
party, for example, in some third world country is getting 
mistreated by the government we see that democracy, and that 
country in general, is in trouble. There are checks and balances 
right through our system.
<P>
	One check against nepotism, bribery and other forms of 
corruption in government is the competitive process. This 
means that people get jobs through merit and not because they 
are someone's friend. That process is open to scrutiny. It is fair. 
It means that we get the best person for the job.
<P>
	The selection process within the federal government is really 
quite fair. All the checks and balances are in place to make sure 
nepotism does not take place.
<P>
	That is why I feel such concern when I read clause 8 of Bill 
C-76. We are in a period of flux right now, a flurry of activity, 
where the departments are downsizing and there is a certain 
amount of chaos in a big reorganization of government. During 
this time there is a chance that the vigilance and the controls are 
not going to be as strong as they have been in the past and as they 
usually are.
<P>
	Clause 8 empowers the Public Service Commission during 
this chaotic and stormy time to appoint an employee without 
competition to another position within the jurisdiction of the 
deputy head for which in the opinion of the commission the 
employee is qualified. This is a dangerous departure from the 
merit principle.
<P>
	Reformers believe that a system of checks and balances is the 
only way to ensure that corruption is weeded out of the system, 
and the competitive process is the check on the public service 
that is missing under this clause of the bill.
<P>
	All sorts of irrelevant qualifications could be used here, 
anything from ``I'm a good friend of the decision maker'', to 
``I'm a relative of somebody else you know'', to the pressure 
that sometimes can be imposed from the outside. That departure 
from the merit principle is a serious departure that public 
servants should be very alarmed about. At any rate, people can 
be appointed without consideration of merit using this clause.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	I agree with the idea the commissioner should be able to 
appoint surplus people to different departments. However, again 
the merit principle in the competition should continue in that 
process.
<P>
	If merit does not need to be a factor in this clause and if the 
competitive process can fall by the wayside without a backward 
glance in this clause, the government can use it for other 
purposes as well. Even under the current regulations of the 
Public Service Employment Act there is already in place a 
system under the employment equity plan by which a member of 
an employment equity group can be appointed to a position in 
accordance with an employment equity program excluding 
merit, discrimination and geographic area with no right of 
appeal. That is a serious departure from the merit principle and 
something the government should not be delving into. I rest my 
case.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I did enjoy the hon. member Fraser Valley 
East's speech on the budget. However, I would like to ask him if 
he has given consideration to the fact the deficit and debt did not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11287"> 11287 </A></B>
<P>
happen overnight. It has accumulated over a period of time. 
With respect to the budget, we are taking a planned period of 
time to deal with it very prudently and efficiently.
<P>
	When the hon. member says we have no plan, we did have a 
plan and we made promises according to the plan to reduce the 
deficit. That is the number one priority on Canadians' minds 
today.
<P>
	If the member feels the budget is something he cannot vote 
for, as he has indicated, why was the budget presented a few 
weeks ago by the Reform Party so heartily rejected by all 
Canadians and this budget so readily accepted?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
intervention. It may be jumping to a conclusion to say the 
Reform Party's alternative budget was not well accepted. When 
I read editorial comments from the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, when I read 
the <I>Financial Post</I>, when I read comments from other people 
who have looked at the substance of our alternative budget, 
there is widespread acceptance that we must have a balanced 
budget. Although we may quibble about some details or some 
finer points, the essence of the argument remains sound that we 
must have a plan to balance the budget. The Liberal budget has 
no such plan. In the Liberal budget the hope is to get it down to 3 
per cent of GDP, twenty billion or twenty-five billion dollars.
<P>
	The irony of it is although they can say this may be kinder and 
gentler because they will not take as many steps as the Reform 
Party, in essence what they are saying is that with the cuts we see 
now, we ain't seen nothing yet. To get it from $20 billion down 
to zero, they will have to make significant, serious cuts.
<P>
	The interest component of their budget is going from $38 
billion to $51 billion in three short years. How can that be a good 
thing for the Canadian economy? How can that help to preserve 
social programs? How can that help to preserve the core of the 
public service? How can they hope to meet the legitimate needs 
and the legitimate concerns of the needy people when they are 
promising them that within three years they will spend an 
additional $13 billion on the interest component of the budget?
<P>
	There is no compassion in a budget that says there is no plan to 
balance. The compassion lies in having a plan to balance. When 
it is balanced we can offer security of social programs, tax relief 
and some assurance about where we heading into the future. 
Unless they can offer that, Moody's and the rest of the economic 
fiscal world will say the budget the Liberals are presenting is not 
good enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
wanted to ask my colleague two questions. How would my 
colleague explain the fact that Canadians generally and the 
business community in particular have been extremely 
supportive of the budget and have also supported the initiative 
of reducing the deficit at 3 per cent of GDP?
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	I heard some comments that were not supportive of the 
government's initiatives with respect to the civil service. Could 
my colleague tell the House what the Reform Party's options are 
in reducing the civil service?
<P>
	Would it provide an early departure initiative, an early 
retirement initiative? Would it permit counselling? Would it 
provide other types of assistance such as working with 
communities for the creation of jobs?
<P>
	If it is yes, how can he be critical? He should jump up and 
applaud.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for those 
questions. They allow me to clarify both the weakness of the 
Liberal budget and the soundness of the only alternate budget we 
have seen that will balance the budget in the short term to offer 
the security I am talking about in the long term.
<P>
	What the budget does, to give credit, is signify a change in 
attitude in government spending. For the first time ever we see a 
government that has actually seen the light and has turned the 
corner. It has gone from what is a hopeless situation of 
increasing deficits to one of modest deficits.
<P>
	The trouble is-this gets down to the security of the public 
service-there is no security in offering continued deficit 
budgets. What possible security is there when someone is 
loosing their house and not making their mortgage payment?
<P>
	Why does one see cutbacks in health care transfers from the 
government? Why does one see cutbacks in welfare transfers? 
Why does one see cutbacks in training, cutbacks in the military, 
cutbacks of 45,000 in the public service? One sees it because the 
government cannot balance the budget. Until it can balance the 
budget there is no security in any of those programs.
<P>
	When we brought forward our zero in three plan three years 
ago we proposed a cutback of 15 per cent in the public service 
because we were up front and honest. A cutback of 15 per cent 
would have been a cutback of around 30,000 or 35,000 public 
servants. We were up front about that.
<P>
	The government went through the election promising no job 
losses by the minister of public service renewal. He promised 
something he could not deliver on. We would have had our 
program in place. The budget would be within one year of being 
balanced.
<P>
	There would have been certainly a job loss of 35,000 public 
servants but already 45,000 public servants are laid off under the 
budget. We are not done yet. There will be more contracting out. 
There will be more private and not for profit agencies. There 
will be more initiatives by the government in years to come to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11288"> 11288 </A></B>
<P>
make sure public servants pay more than their adequate share of 
pain for the government's inability to balance the budget.
<P>
	Come to grips with the fact that the best security one can offer 
the public service is a balanced budget soon so that there is not 
the continual whittling away year after year the security the 
public service deserves.
<P>
	That is what is happening on that side by failing to address the 
debt and deficit problem.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to tell the Chair that I will be splitting my 
time with the hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester. On 
behalf of the constituents of Brome-Missisquoi, I would like to 
congratulate the Minister of Finance, who lives in my riding, for 
the courageous budget he tabled on February 27, 1995, five days 
after I was sworn in and became an official member of the 
House.
<P>
	In the February 13 byelection, one of the mandates I was 
given was to ensure the good management of public finances. 
That is what we in the Liberal Party are currently doing. Canada 
is on the right track. We kept on having visions of a deficit out of 
control. We absolutely had to review the federal government's 
activities. The result was that we introduced a series of cuts, and 
I believe that the government made wise choices. The thousands 
of people I met during the election campaign told me that the 
government should trim the fat, not increase income taxes for 
individuals.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	That was what it did in the budget. The support that people 
have given to the Minister of Finance's budget proves that 
Canadians want to eliminate the deficit as quickly as possible 
and that the remedies he is using are fair.
<P>
	The Liberal government set realistic and firm objectives for 
itself during the election campaign, which we are now in the 
process of attaining. It is important to keep the momentum 
going. We will reduce the deficit to $32.7 billion in 1995-96 and 
then to $24.3 billion. By 1996-97, the deficit will have sunk to 
its lowest level since 1974-75.
<P>
	The measures in the budget will fundamentally change the 
size and structure of the government machine. Program 
spending will be reduced from the level in last year's budget, 
$120 billion, to close to $108 billion in 1996-97. The size of 
government will be substantially reduced over the next three 
years. Compared to 1994-95 amounts, departmental budgets 
will be reduced by close to 19 per cent. The budgets of some 
departments will even be cut in half. All told, these measures 
will create savings of approximately $17 billion over three 
years. As a result of this vast reform of federal programs, 45,000 
jobs in the public service will be cut over the next three years.
<P>
	Of course, it would have been unreasonable to cut program 
spending without trimming the public service. We will never rid 
ourselves of the deficit unless we trim the fat in government and 
improve management and efficiency.
<P>
	These are but a few of the specific measures in the 1995 
budget allaying the concerns of my constituents and all 
Canadians. The role of regional organizations, for example the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, will change, 
as they will be called on to help small and medium size 
businesses by means of loans and repayable contributions, not 
grants. My constituents will be happy to know that they will still 
be able to count on their MP and the federal government when it 
comes time to open up a small or medium size business.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member will have another chance to 
speak shortly after question period, he still has some time 
remaining. However, since it is 2 o'clock, we now proceed to 
statements by members.

	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to join with the member for Brant in drawing to the 
House's attention the issue of land mines.
<P>
	The International Red Cross estimates that every 15 minutes 
someone is killed or maimed by a land mine. Before question 
period ends today three more people will become innocent 
victims.
<P>
	In our world there is no place for such indiscriminate, 
anti-personnel weapons. Every year some 10,000 people are 
killed by these devices and many more are injured. There are an 
estimated 65 million to 110 million uncleared land mines in the 
world and an additional 10 million to 30 million new land mines 
being produced every year.
<P>
	I am proud to say that Canada does not take part in the 
deployment of these devices and that the government has 
endorsed the UN's convention on inhumane weapons.
<P>
	I sincerely hope that during the United Nations review 
conference in June the government will strengthen Canada's 
position and place a complete moratorium on the deployment of 
these weapons.
<P>
	Let us not forget that today's theatre of conflict is tomorrow's 
farmland or refugee camp. Innocent men, women and children 
<P>

are dying. Since 1975 land mines have claimed an estimated one 
million victims, mostly in the developing world.

	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, although 
the situation in Burundi is getting critical, and ethnic massacres 
might start any day now, all the United Nations Security Council 
is doing on the matter is considering appropriate measures to 
bring to court people who might commit actions which could be 
construed as genocide.
<P>
	It is astounding to realize how fast the international 
community has forgotten what happened in Rwanda. Rather than 
trying diplomatic means to defuse the situation and planning for 
the quick deployment of multinational forces should the conflict 
degenerate, the UN is preparing for a post-genocide period.
<P>
	Canada's attitude toward this partner state in the 
Francophonie is just as disappointing as the attitude of the 
Security Council, and it shows a total lack of leadership.

the Canadian taxpayer will be appalled to know that $200,000 
has already been spent to purchase one-half of the AZT exhibit 
at the National Gallery of Canada. I think they will be even more 
outraged to realize the National Gallery intends to spend more 
money to purchase the other half of the exhibit which is 
currently on loan and on display.
<P>
	AIDS is a largely preventable disease. I am sure most 
Canadians will agree with me that the money would be better 
spent educating our young people on the dangers of promiscuity

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
greatly concerned about the recent announcement concerning 
changes to the Canadian forces recruitment operation in New 
Brunswick.
<P>
	According to the Minister of National Defence he has decided 
to close the Canadian forces recruitment operations in Moncton, 
reduce the detachment in Bathurst, and move the main 
recruitment centre from Saint John to Fredericton.
<P>
	The province of New Brunswick once again is being hit 
extremely hard by these closures, especially from the closure 
and moving of the main recruitment centre from Saint John to 
Fredericton.
<P>
	The minister has stated that the move will save $180,000. 
However, does the minister realize that the move will remove an 
annual payroll of $1 million from Saint John? These jobs are 
permanent jobs that have a positive impact on the economy of 
Saint John, Moncton and Bathurst.
<P>
	I ask the minister and the Liberal government to please stop. 
New Brunswick has already had its fair share of cuts in the

big hearts.
<P>
	Statistics Canada has declared that Randolph, a small 
community near Steinbach of only 130 residents, has the most 
charitable citizens in all of Manitoba. Despite its size it is truly 
large when it comes to donating to charity. According to 
Statistics Canada the median donation given by people in 
Randolph was $1,890, which means that 50 per cent of the 
population gave more than $1,890.
<P>
	Last year it was Blumenort, another Mennonite community in 
my riding of Provencher, that was reported by Statistics Canada 
as having the median, again in Manitoba.
<P>

proposed an amendment to the conference's platform for action 
that discrimination based on sexual orientation be recognized as 
a barrier to women.

part non-elected officials and bureaucrats, with Europe, the 
British House of Lords has now spoken out.
<P>
	The Lords have rebuked the British government for 
supporting a country, Spain, that has been shown to be a fish 
pirate nation which has depredated stocks everywhere in the 
world, including the North Sea.
<P>
	The Lords have praised Canada for an appropriate action to 
enforce the principles of the Law of the Sea laid down years ago. 
They have asked Canada to lend them our minister of fisheries 
so that they would have somebody in Brussels who would stand 
up for British fishermen.
<P>
	To the European Union fisheries commissioner who seems 
rather light in the knowledge of fisheries and of contemporary 
international law, the Lords invoke the words of Queen 
Elizabeth I:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have the heart and stomach of a King-and pour foul scorn (on you)-or 
(all the princes of the Commission who) dare to invade the borders of my realm.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	Thank you to the British House of Lords for having a sense of 
humour and for reminding us that the International Law of the 
Sea no longer licenses predatory overfishing and spoliation of 
the earth's dwindling fish stocks.

(Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Quebecers are realizing that independence is not the best way to 
meet the real needs of the outlying regions.
<P>
	During the hearings held by the regional commission on 
Quebec's future, the PQ vice-president, Mrs. Monique Simard, 
warned her party not to enshrine in a new constitution the 
powers of the regions. Instead, she said that it might be wiser to 
deal with decentralization through legislation, adding: ``You 
cannot amend the Constitution at the drop of a hat''.
<P>
	Our government agrees with Quebecers that we can achieve 
much more through administrative agreements than with 
another constitutional debate; we can only hope that the Parti 
Quebecois will eventually discover this virtue of federalism. Let 
us hope that the Parizeau government will decide to co-operate 
with the Canadian government, because this is what the vast 
majority of Quebecers want.

against the status quo. They fear that, should the no side win, 
Ottawa might play a dirty fiscal trick on Quebec, shutting the 
province out of international money markets.
<P>
	It would appear that the drastic cuts made by the last budget to 
transfer payments to the provinces are only a beginning. This is 
not surprising. Indeed, transfer payments to Quebec were cut by 
more than $14 billion between 1982 and 1995.
<P>
	After the failure of the 1980 referendum, Quebecers were 
played a dirty constitutional trick. Should they choose the status 
quo this time, the federal government might play a dirty fiscal 
trick on them. It must be said that the Prime Minister sure knows 
how to play dirty tricks on Quebec.

<P>

sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination and

<P>
	At this conference Canada will propose a paragraph for the

<P>
	Some have resisted inclusion of this paragraph in the final

domestic situation in Canada where the human rights codes of

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, during a special debate called on very 
short notice, the Minister of National Defence mentioned 
several scenarios which included maintaining our peacekeeping 
force in Croatia and Bosnia or concentrating our efforts in 
Croatia, the final decision being left up to the UN. Although he 
emphasized the need to continue the rotation of the troops, he 
also indicated 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11293"> 11293 </A></B>
<P>
that Canada's participation in these peacekeeping missions 
could not last indefinitely.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Could he 
indicate the government's official position on the presence of 
Canadian peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia, considering 
that the stance he adopted during the debate yesterday was 
ambiguous, to say the least?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government has decided to maintain Canada's 
troops in the former Yugoslavia in the same configuration in 
which they are now. Every time changes occur, either in Bosnia 
or Croatia, there may be changes in troop deployment, and that 
is what the minister pointed out. However, Canada's presence in 
the former Yugoslavia will be maintained for the next six 
months.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, less than 24 hours before the current mandate of 
the peacekeepers in Croatia expires, could the minister or the 
Prime Minister tell us what has transpired from negotiations 
between UN officials and the Croatian government?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are over there under UN supervision, and we 
regularly discuss with UN leaders to determine where our troops 
should be deployed. These discussions are going on all the time. 
The troops are now in two locations. For the time being we will 
stay there, but, as the minister said, we may be asked to move 
and replace troops at another location. We have had similar 
rotations in the past, and as the minister pointed out yesterday, 
there may be more in the future.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I trust that the UN's supervision is not absolute and 
that we still have some say in the conditions under which we 
operate. I have the following question for the minister.
<P>
	I ask the Minister: Instead of inviting parliamentarians to take 
part in piecemeal debates, as he did yesterday, would he commit 
himself to a debate on a general definition of the terms and 
criteria for Canada's future participation in peacekeeping 
missions that exceed the narrow parameters of his bill?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has been very accommodating over the last year and 
a half in terms of having these debates.
<P>
	The debate last night was not a restricted one. The hon. 
member spoke rather eloquently and we appreciate support for 
the continuation of our troops in Bosnia and Croatia.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not think he can fault the government for providing 
opportunities for these kinds of debates. He also has the vehicle 
of opposition days if he wants to get into it in greater detail.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of National Defence. Yesterday, 
the minister offhandedly minimized the importance of the many 
cases of suicide within the Canadian Forces, particularly among 
soldiers returning from peacekeeping missions, including those 
in the former Yugoslavia. The minister's attitude is surprising, 
to say the least.
<P>
	How does the Minister of National Defence explain the fact 
that members of the military are more inclined to turn to outside 
help rather than use military resources in order to overcome 
their difficulties and adjustment problems upon returning from a 
mission?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not 
say what the hon. member said I did. I was asked yesterday by 
one of the members of the Reform Party about an apparent 
increase in suicides, which is of great concern to us, at the base 
in Valcartier.
<P>
	While it is true the suicide rate in the armed forces is lower 
than that of the population as a whole, there is no question that in 
the last year there has been a slight increase in suicides at the 
base in Valcartier.
<P>
	Some preliminary work has been done on that to see whether 
there is any cause and effect. A Reform member yesterday 
asserted this had something to do with deployment in Bosnia and 
Croatia.
<P>
	We cannot make that statement because there does not seem to 
be that tie in. Most of the suicides that occur, including these, 
deal with domestic reasons, family matters. We want to get more 
information, more analysis. That will require more extensive 
interviews. We will try to get full information for hon. members 
so they can have their fears allayed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would just like to point out to the minister that the suicide rate at 
the base in Valcartier alone is higher than in the population as a 
whole.
<P>
	Does the minister not recognize that if Canadian soldiers 
returning from peacekeeping missions refuse to rely on the 
in-house resources available at the Department of National 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11294"> 11294 </A></B>
<P>
Defence, it is because they are afraid of compromising their 
careers within the Canadian Forces?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
have been increased programs that the departments have put in 
place in the last year or two at the various bases to deal with the 
stress of members, especially those who have been serving in 
peacekeeping.
<P>
	If we look at the last seven or eight years, when Canada has 
been quite involved in peacekeeping assignments, the suicide 
rate has not increased abnormally and there is no established 
link between service overseas and suicide.
<P>
	As I said yesterday, even one death is of concern to all of us 
and we will try to get more facts so that all hon. members can 
appreciate the true nature of the situation. If there is cause and 
effect, we will have to do something about it. I cannot 
categorically state that today, but we will get the information.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with respect to peacekeeping in Croatia and Bosnia, it 
has been the Reform Party's position that the government should 
develop clear criteria to determine whether Canada should 
involve itself in such situations, how long we should stay and 
when we should get out. Last December we proposed four 
minimal conditions for continuing our presence in Bosnia, only 
one of which has been met, which is why we counsel withdrawal.
<P>
	Will the Minister of National Defence outline the minimal 
conditions which he feels must be met in order to justify keeping 
our peacekeepers in Croatia and Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, every 
mission has to be viewed on its own merits. Obviously the 
criteria are somewhat subjective. It depends on the hostilities in 
question. It depends on the threat and the requirement made by 
the United Nations.
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. leader of the Reform Party that 
the special joint committee looked into this matter last year and 
made some very useful recommendations about peacekeeping in 
general, some of which have been adopted by the government.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	It is important that we make sure before we go into any 
situation we understand the strategic reason for entering an 
engagement, the costs and the likelihood of success.
<P>
	That is why when we engaged in Rwanda last year for six 
months we extended it by a few months. We have engaged in 
Haiti for six months.
<P>
	I want to remind the hon. member the original commitment to 
Bosnia and Croatia was made by the previous government. I 
understand why it felt pressure to take part in that engagement. 
We have a difficult situation, one that is difficult to extract the 
United Nations from. It is a commitment we are prepared to 
continue indefinitely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the minister said one of his criterion was not 
wanting to let the UN down. Surely a more important criterion is 
not wanting to let Canadian peacekeepers down.
<P>
	Our peacekeepers are not adequately equipped to do the job. 
They are not getting the leadership they deserve from the 
minister and the government, and morale is at an all time low. 
There have been six suicides in six months in the royal 22nd 
regiment, the same regiment that will be returning later this 
month.
<P>
	What concrete steps is the minister taking to remedy the 
morale problems and the equipment deficiencies being 
experienced by our peacekeepers in Croatia and Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what a 
sad situation when the leader of one of Canada's political parties 
on the eve of re-engagement in Croatia and Bosnia, for which up 
to 2,000 people will be leaving their base in Valcartier, makes 
unfounded allegations about the nature of equipment and 
morale. I totally reject these assertions.
<P>
	My parliamentary secretary has very kindly given me a copy 
of the special joint committee report. On page 29 there are 
certain criteria outlined adopted by the committee. His members 
signed on to that report. These criteria are followed by the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we simply asked the minister what he was doing to 
bolster the position of our people in Croatia and Bosnia. That is 
hardly undermining their position.
<P>
	All Canadians share a concern that a withdrawal of 
peacekeepers from Croatia and Bosnia without adequate 
replacement could result in wholesale tragedy for innocent 
victims. If that is our priority concern, should the government 
not have been doing a great deal more to mobilize world opinion 
against atrocities being committed there, particularly to 
mobilize European support for peacekeeping?
<P>
	What is the government doing to mobilize world opinion 
against atrocities in former Yugoslavia and to pressure our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11295"> 11295 </A></B>
<P>
European allies in whose backyard this is occurring to play a 
bigger role in the peacekeeping and humanitarian mission there?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
surprised at the hon. member's comments. I believe 40 per cent 
of the troops now in Yugoslavia are from European nations. I 
would like him to make that statement to the ministers of 
defence and foreign affairs from Britain, France, Holland, Spain 
and other countries in Europe discharging their duties very 
effectively in that theatre.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	Yesterday, Canadian authorities apprehended Tsara Rahmani, 
a 30-year old Algerian student, upon his arrival at Mirabel 
airport. French authorities had expelled him because they 
suspected him of belonging to the radical wing of the Islamic 
Salvation Front.
<P>
	Since this individual is strongly suspected of terrorist 
activities, does the minister intend to take immediate action by 
launching an investigation and, if need be, deporting him 
quickly from this country?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true the person in 
question was apprehended by our officials at Mirabel airport at 
approximately eight o'clock last night. He was questioned 
immediately by immigration and CSIS officials. Those officials 
have also been in touch with European agents. We have detained 
him overnight. The questioning continues.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	I certainly appreciate the kind of support the member is 
offering. Obviously this country should not harbour individuals 
who have ill motives. Once we establish the facts, we will move 
accordingly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
complete contrast to Mr. Rahmani's case, a thousand Algerians 
already in Canada are claiming refugee status because they fear 
falling victim to the surge in fundamentalist violence if they are 
deported to Algeria. Does the minister intend to give special 
consideration to their fate?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is something we are closely 
monitoring. Certainly in terms of the inland determination 
system, it is true that a number of Algerians have sought refugee 
status. They are moving through the province of Quebec 
particularly and are going through the Immigration and Refugee 
Board.
<P>
	We are also in concert with the UNHCR, the prime 
international vehicle for overseas resettlement. I have had 
occasion to discuss this with the Minister of Foreign Affairs as 
well as the Prime Minister in the last number of months. We 
certainly are prepared to be part of an international movement in 
terms of facilitating those in greatest need. However, we should 
distinguish that from the case we are currently looking at.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday in response to my question on the tragic 
suicides reported at Valcartier the minister stated: ``The rate of 
suicides is lower in the armed forces than it is in the population 
as a whole''.
<P>
	However a review of relevant Statistics Canada data shows a 
suicide rate of .02 per cent, whereas the rate at Valcartier for the 
past year is .12 per cent, or six times higher. It should also be 
noted that the suicide rate at Valcartier among peacekeeping 
forces sent to the former Yugoslavia is still three times higher 
than in the population at large.
<P>
	Given these facts, will the minister not agree this issue must 
be addressed before more troops are sent to Bosnia and Croatia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member of the Reform Party is distorting what I said. I said 
yesterday that the suicide rate in the Canadian Armed Forces 
was lower than the suicide rate generally in the population of 
Canada and that is absolutely true.
<P>
	I have acknowledged that there has been an increase in 
suicides specifically at that one military base. In response to my 
colleague from Charlevoix I gave the assurance to the House 
that we will try to get more information to see what causes are 
related to these specific suicides and the increase in suicides in 
the last 12 months.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> I am 
encouraged by part of the minister's response that we will get 
more information.
<P>
	The deployment regulations state that personnel must have 18 
months between peacekeeping rotations, yet since 1992 
Valcartier has sent 5,000 troops to the former Yugoslavia. Given 
the manpower situation at the base, it is clear this regulation is 
being disregarded.
<P>
	Given the tragic consequences this appears to be having on the 
troops, will the minister explain why deployment regulations 
are being ignored?

yesterday, Kanesatake Mohawk leader Jerry Peltier said that he 
was still planning to go ahead with his plans for a casino in

negotiate the terms and conditions under which this casino can 
be opened with the Quebec government, but only with the

<P>

something that was very unfortunate and we regret it.
<P>
	We will make sure in choosing a replacement for Ms. Doyle 
that we will find someone of equal stature. We will be a little

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	Yesterday, just days before travelling to Berlin to attend the 
World Climate Conference, the Minister of the Environment 
finally admitted that her government will not be able to meet the 
commitments made in its red book with respect to reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	In the light of Canada's incapacity to control its greenhouse 
gas emissions, how can the Minister of the Environment content 
herself with presenting in Berlin a mere strategic plan, when 
what the 1992 Rio accord called for was a true action plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I said yesterday and I 
repeat today that we cannot be satisfied with stabilization only. 
The commitment agreed to in Rio was to achieve stabilization 
by the year 2000.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that, in developing our action 
plan at the federal level, we will go beyond federal stabilization 
commitments. That being said, when we table a master 
agreement like the one reached with the provinces, in spite of 
Quebec's absence, we must work together with all the provinces 
to ensure that their action plans also go beyond stabilization.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Quebec has done its homework in this area, but the minister 
made it clear in an interview given to <I>Le Devoir</I> yesterday that 
she had not done hers.
<P>
	Is the minister's proposal, which will almost certainly be 
rejected by the European Union, not in fact part of a plan to 
create a diversion to mask her incapacity to fulfil Canadian 
commitments?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is sad to see that, on 
an issue as vital as greenhouse gas emissions, the Bloc 
Quebecois would rather play politics than join in the search by 
developed and developing countries alike for a global solution 
to a global problem.
<P>
	We are confident. Brazil has accepted our Berlin proposal and 
we expect support not only from developing but also from 
industrialized countries in finding a global solution.

in the big world.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

today and are constructive. They focus primarily on the area 
singled out by the Prime Minister some two weeks ago as the 
matter of primary concern for Canada. That is the question of 
conservation and enforcement.
<P>

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Last November I asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs why 
his department was funding environmental groups whose main 
purpose was to actively discredit B.C. logging practices in 
North America and in Europe. Since 1990 the Western Canada 
Wilderness Committee has received over $754,000 from foreign 
affairs, environment, human resources development, heritage 
and natural resources.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11298"> 11298 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister support providing federal funding 
to groups whose main purpose is to undermine our number one 
industry in Canada, forestry?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, these groups have been helpful because most of the 
provinces have improved, quite dramatically, the way they 
harvest forests. It is helping make our case when we are abroad.
<P>
	We have to be careful. For example, we are asking people to 
help protect the fishing environment of the sea. We have to do 
the same thing in Canada. When we have groups in Canada that 
want to harvest trees in a proper fashion, they are not causing a 
disservice to Canada, they are helping us to do the right thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
some of us may recall seeing Stumpy, that large cedar tree stump 
from the Clayoquot in my riding on Vancouver Island, around 
Parliament Hill last fall.
<P>
	The Western Canada Wilderness Committee not only took this 
stump across Canada at taxpayers' expense, but is planning to 
take it to Berlin next month to discredit, again, the Canadian 
forest industry.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Will he act 
immediately to cancel all funds to this group, which has not only 
cost taxpayers $754,000 but continues to cost the Canadian 
economy millions in lost revenue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has 
underlined how important it is for Canada to have sustainable 
forestry practices. The work of organizations such as the 
Western Canada Wilderness Committee reinforces the notion 
for an international forest practices code where all countries can 
be judged on a level playing field.
<P>
	The member would be the first to criticize the government if it 
did not have a proactive international stance by which it shares 
Canada's sustainable forestry practices with those of other parts 
of the world. That is what we are attempting to do, working with 
environmental groups, rather than damning them all as the 
Reform Party would do.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
According to the monthly report published by Quebec's income 
security department, during the month of March, over 800,000 
Quebecers had to rely on social assistance. In spite of the 
recovery, this increase is a source of real concern, particularly 
since the under-25 group accounts for 40 per cent of the new 
welfare recipients.
<P>
	Will the minister finally recognize that this increase in the 
number of young welfare recipients is the direct result of his UI 
reform, which excludes young people from the program, and 
will he admit that these young people are the first victims of UI 
cuts?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the best way to answer the 
hon. member's question is to cite some useful facts and figures 
which she will be interested in knowing.
<P>
	The employment gains which took place during 1994 mean 
that we have been able to reduce UI claims by some 10 per cent 
over 1993 and helped more than 200,000 Canadians get back to 
work without exhausting their benefits. In fact, if we look at the 
figures more closely we find that the exhaustion rate was down 
by 25 per cent in 1993-94 over 1992-93.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	It shows what is contributing to the reduction in the 
unemployment benefit rate, which is that far more Canadians 
are going back to work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister cannot ignore the fact that a StatsCan report indicates 
that the proportion of unemployed covered by the UI program 
went from 77 per cent, in 1990, down to 53 per cent, in 1994. 
There are fewer recipients, even though more people are out of 
work.
<P>
	Will the minister finally recognize that, if the number of UI 
recipients decreased so drastically, it is not because the number 
of jobless dropped significantly, but because more and more of 
them are excluded from the UI program and have to join the 
welfare ranks?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the StatsCanada report 
shows that one of the distressing areas of concern that we should 
all share is the fact that numbers of Canadians are unemployed 
for longer periods of time. It is one of the really disturbing 
phenomena taking place in labour markets. We are not alone. It 
is taking place around the world.
<P>
	Rather than admitting to some great guilt, we should be 
coming together to work to find solutions to the problem. That is 
one reason why we are looking seriously, as the hon. member 
knows, at developing more active employment programs.
<P>
	To give one example, we have just initiated and will be 
starting on April 1 some 20 pilot projects across the country 
using wage supplements to help those long term unemployed to 
get back into the job market.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	On January 1, 1995 the CRTC launched an innovative tax grab 
on Canadian cable subscribers. It ignored its previous decision 
to issue a rebate to consumers which would have caused cable 
rates to decrease. Instead, half of the money will go to line the 
pockets of cable giants such as Rogers.
<P>
	Why will the Prime Minister not protect the interests of 
Canadian consumers by getting rid of this hidden tax?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would suggest that the country and the government over time 
has been very grateful to the CRTC. It has been able to protect 
the Canadian cultural content of the delivery system through its 
broadcast system.
<P>
	The growth of Canadian arts, culture and performers has been 
a vital part of the responsibilities administered by the CRTC 
through its vigilance and its application of the rules of the will of 
the House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question was very specific. It was specifically focused on the 
CRTC and the issue of the current innovative tax grab, as I say. 
However I appreciate the eloquence of the hon. member.
<P>
	The CRTC has flip-flopped on the consumer rebate. It has not 
only imposed an information highway tax but it has also 
required these companies to pay into a Canadian program 
production fund. This is nothing more than a tax to subsidize 
Canadian content. Consumers will no longer stand for this 
behaviour from the CRTC.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister justify this tax without having 
consulted the Canadian consumer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member should think through the outcome of her

globe to address this very critical problem, we will see a 
situation by the year 2050 where the island of Prince Edward 
Island will be completely under water, where the lower 
mainland of British Columbia will suffer massive flooding and

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

where Quebec does settlement very well.
<P>
	In other provinces, in talking to the Alberta minister 
responsible for immigration, it is not simply a case where 
everyone wants the same kind of agreement as Quebec or 
Ontario. There needs to be some flexibility under the guise of a

	I want to get back to spending. Expenditures at National 
Defence will also be drastically reduced. Business subsidies 
have been cut by 60 per cent. Because of the deficit and our 
current financial situation, we can no longer afford to maintain 
subsidies introduced ten years ago, which are now eroding our 
capacity to adapt, to diversify and to remain competitive.
<P>
	We will also transfer certain programs to other levels of 
government and privatize some of our operations. For example, 
airports and marinas will be transferred to local authorities and 
CN will be privatized this year. Moreover, and this is very 
important, departments will have to prepare three-year business 
plans, which will be subject to parliamentary and public 
scrutiny.
<P>

to review their programs also.
<P>
	Speaking of cleaning up, I urge the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot to do some cleaning-up in his own 
mind. During his remarks this morning, I heard him criticize the 
way some Quebec members have voted. This is the budget of a

Does the Bloc know where it is going? They are preparing to 
hold a referendum so that they do not have to sit here anymore,

they want to stay or do they want to leave?

	I believe in a flexible federalism, a federalism based on 
dialogue and consensus, not on hypocrisy. Members of the Bloc 
know full well that it takes a constitutional amendment to 
change the rules of the game between the various levels of 
government, but they are still trying not only to confuse people, 
but to provoke them. We had an opportunity to see, when the 
vote on the Bloc's motion was taken, the kind of contempt that 
members of the Bloc feel toward those who do not share their 
views. It bodes well for the referendum. The remarks made 
today by the member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot show once 
again that, for the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois, it is 
just «believe it or die».
<P>
	The constitution of our country, Canada, guarantees a 
minimum of 75 seats for Quebec. I hope that Bloc members, 
after their defeat in the referendum, will have the decency to 
separate themselves from this House and go back to Quebec to 
work real hard at helping Quebec population grow. I might 
indicate to them that there are many ways to go about it, one of 
which is certainly not to maintain a political and economic 
climate contaminated by the Bloc, but rather to foster job 
creation in a strong economy. Then, Quebec will be strong in the 
true sense for Canada and within Canada, and we will no longer 
remember the hypocritical tactics devised by the Bloc members 
and their cousins in the PQ.
<P>
	To get back to the budget, there is also the new Canadian 
social transfer. Globally, the major transfers, including 
equalization payments-which, for that matter, are not affected 
by this budget-will be 4.4 per cent lower than what they are 
now. At the same time, the other spending reductions the federal 
government is imposing on itself will reach 7.3 per cent, almost 
twice as much.
<P>
	To summarize the budget, it proposes to reduce spending by 
$7 for every $1 increase in revenue. The in-depth reorganization 
of the machinery of government announced in the budget 
confirms the faith of the people of Brome-Missisquoi in a 
flexible federalism evolving in a secure environment for all the 
classes of citizens, young people, students, families and seniors, 
and also in a secure environment with regard to our political and 
trade relationships with all our neighbours, who are well aware 
of the rules of the game here in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the new 
member for Brome-Missisquoi has adjusted quickly to the 
House of Commons. We can see this from the gratuitous insults 
he is flinging at the Bloc Quebecois. This member who, during 
the election campaign in Brome-Missisquoi, carefully avoided 
all the debates with his adversaries, is using some rather 
aggressive language for a new member, now that he is elected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11302"> 11302 </A></B>
<P>
	He prompts me to ask the following question when he says 
that the federal government has put its house in order in its 
budget and that the provincial governments should do the same. 
I would like to hear his comments on this matter. Of course we 
want to see the federal government put its house in order; that 
is what we have been asking it to do since we were elected.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to comment on the reduced 
transfer payments under the new Canada social transfer, with 
cuts of $2.5 billion next year and $4.5 billion every year 
thereafter. Does the member think that that it is a good way to 
reduce spending if, in the end, it costs the provinces more to 
maintain the services which their money was already used to 
provide?
<P>
	I would say that yes, the federal government has been putting 
its house in order, but only by dumping problems in somebody 
else's backyard. Is this what it calls flexible federalism, the 
brand of federalism it prefers? I would like to hear the member's 
comments on this subject.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paradis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. First, I must say I have just been through an election 
campaign in Brome-Missisquoi where I met many citizens. 
The citizens of Brome-Missisquoi, as those of other regions in 
Quebec, have asked for a budget that would not increase 
personal income taxes and that would trim the fat.
<P>
	This is exactly the kind of budget that minister Martin 
presented. When we speak about putting our financial house in 
order, and that is what trimming the fat is all about, I think that 
Mr. Martin's budget does just that. The other part of the 
member's question deals with the new Canadian social transfer 
program.
<P>
	The minister announced that this new transfer program would 
be implemented only a year from now in order to give the 
provinces the opportunity to adapt to the new realities. This new 
Canadian social transfer program gives Quebec a global 
envelope where budgets for universities, health and social 
programs will be consolidated and the province will be free to 
manage them as it pleases. This is what we mean by new, 
progressive, flexible federalism.
<P>
	As for the amounts mentioned by my colleague, I must say 
that the global cuts in federal programs account for a decrease of 
7.3 per cent for all federal programs here in Ottawa.
<P>
	But, for a year, the cuts in provincial programs will mean a 
reduction of 4.4 per cent only. The federal government is much 
more severe with its own programs than with the provinces and 
this is very important. It would be important also that Bloc 
members go back to their ridings and meet with their 
constituents. They would see that this is the type of federalism 
they want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member says that during a recent election 
campaign his constituents told him certain things. There must be 
farmers in Brome-Missisquoi and I  would like to know whether 
they told him they would like to see a 30 per cent cut in the dairy 
credit.
<P>
	This will drive up milk prices and penalize low-income 
families. Did anyone tell him that when he was seeking the votes 
of farmers in Brome-Missisquoi?
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paradis:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I reply to 
my colleague. During the election campaign, farming was, of 
course, one of the topics, particularly in a riding such as ours, 
which borders the United States. Given its location, the new 
GATT and NAFTA international trade rules are important at this 
time.
<P>
	I am on the point of creating a sort of advisory committee with 
all the farmers in Brome-Missisquoi to look at how we can 
adapt as quickly as possible to the new international trade rules, 
including those of NAFTA. The State of Vermont is across the 
border from the riding of Brome-Missisquoi and I think that 
together with the farmers not just in my riding but throughout 
Quebec we will find ways of adapting to the rules of the new 
world economy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in this House to address 
second reading of Bill C-76.
<P>
	As I have stated previously, this budget may be viewed by 
future historians as a watershed budget. It is a very definite 
turning point in the history of this government, in the 
government of the day, when it had the courage to make the 
really tough decisions, to make the necessary cuts in spending in 
accordance with responsible financial management.
<P>
	The budget redesigns the very role and the structure of 
government. It is a budget which achieves large savings to reach 
the deficit reduction targets set out in our red book plan. This 
budget is the cornerstone of the foundation of sustainable 
finances, sustainable social policy and sustainable economic 
policy for the future of Canadians. The budget is about nation 
building. It is about values and principles rooted in fairness 
among the regions, compassion, and above all, economic and 
financial leadership.
<P>
	The future of the country is at stake with a debt of $550 billion 
and annual deficit budgets for more than a decade now. Because 
of this, a huge portion of government revenues are consumed by 
the cost of servicing this deficit and debt, money that could 
otherwise provide services and programs for Canadians or better 
still, reduce the amount of taxes we pay. The unexpected 
increase in these rates since last year's budget has put 
tremendous pressure on deficit targets. Meeting our targets is 
essential to strengthen confidence and bring interest rates down. 
This in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11303"> 11303 </A></B>
<P>
turn is essential for job growth and more job creation for 
Canadians.
<P>
	Over $13 billion in savings will be realized through spending 
cuts and there will be no increase in personal income tax rates. 
Going beyond to 1997-98, our reforms will deliver a further $13 
billion in savings for a three year total of $29 billion. This is the 
largest set of actions in any budget since the war years in the 
1940s.
<P>
	We are also taking firm steps to increase tax fairness and close 
loopholes. The budget delivers almost $7 in spending cuts for 
every dollar of new tax revenue. That is very significant, a 7:1 
ratio of spending cuts to taxes.
<P>
	The government accepted the challenge not only with this 
budget, but with several budgets to come, to work toward a 
balanced budget. This is not politically expedient, but it is the 
right thing to do.
<P>
	The measures taken in the budget will ensure that Canadians 
can face the economic challenge of international competition 
and that we will be able to do so with growth and confidence. 
This budget is about restoring confidence in government and 
confidence in Canadians.
<P>
	Measures which were taken last year in the first budget of this 
government showed positive results in our economy. Economic 
growth is at 4.5 per cent which is the strongest of the G-7 
nations. 1994 was the most impressive year ever in Canadian 
exports. We showed a massive trade surplus with the United 
States and inflation was at its lowest in three decades. There 
were improved business profits and some 433,000 more full 
time jobs.
<P>
	A snapshot of our growth is found in Statistics Canada's 
report on railway car loadings. It showed that in a seven day 
period ending February 21, 1995, just a few weeks ago, the 
number of railway cars loaded in Canada increased 3.7 per cent 
from the same period a year earlier. Revenue freight loaded 
increased 6.9 per cent to 4.6 million tonnes. Piggyback traffic 
tonnage which is included in total carload traffic increased 9.5 
per cent during the same period. Tonnage of revenue freight 
loaded as of February 21, 1995 increased 19.8 per cent from the 
previous year.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	That is growth. Growth in freight means growth in GDP where 
it should be and not growth in government.
<P>
	Cuts in government spending mean pain. The budget is about 
pain. However, the pain was spread fairly to all regions. In the 
west, grain transportation subsidies were eliminated, while in 
the east the Atlantic region freight assistance program was 
abolished. However, both the west and the east, including 
Quebec, will receive transitional funding helping to alleviate 
shipper hardship and upgrade transportation infrastructure.
<P>
	The bill also proposes the elimination of the Atlantic freight 
subsidies under the Atlantic Region Freight Assistance Act and 
the Maritime Freight Rates Act. This measure will take effect in 
December of this year. It will save nearly $100 million.
<P>
	The MFRA and the later ARFAA subsidies derive from 
recommendations of the 1927 report of the royal commission on 
maritime claims, the Duncan commission. The report noted that 
the BNA Act had guaranteed construction of the Intercolonial 
Railway, an obligation long met at the time the Duncan 
commission was appointed. The commission concluded 
however that there was a particular intention behind the 
enactment of this guarantee and on its interpretation of this 
intention recommended a reduction in freight rates.
<P>
	Therefore, we had the Atlantic freight subsidies program. 
However, it has proven inefficient in reducing shipper costs. 
Moreover, it has encouraged companies to structure their 
investments and organizations to meet regulatory criteria rather 
than for sound business reasons. The subsidies are of marginal 
and declining importance to regional economic activity, since 
transportation services in the region are now more competitive 
than they once were.
<P>
	To help ensure that elimination of the subsidy contributes to a 
better transportation system, the budget announced a five year 
$326 million transportation adjustment program. Provinces will 
be able to target assistance under the program to meet local 
shippers' needs and upgrade infrastructure. Among other things, 
this should help to modernize the highway system in Atlantic 
Canada and eastern Quebec.
<P>
	The people of Nova Scotia know that the backbone of the 
economy is small business and that Atlantic Canada ended 1994 
with the highest rate of growth per capita. Our region grew by 
2.7 per cent. This was followed by the prairie region.
<P>
	One of the most important elements of the bill is the 
reformation of transfers to the provinces. This represents new 
federalism. The federal government wants to create a transfer 
system that functions better and is more fiscally sustainable.
<P>
	The centrepiece of this reform is the replacement beginning in 
1996-97 of established programs financing for health and 
post-secondary education and the Canada assistance plan with a 
single consolidated block transfer, the Canada health and social 
transfer.
<P>
	The Canada health and social transfer represents a new 
approach to federal-provincial relations. This new approach is 
marked by greater flexibility for provincial governments and 
more sustainable financing arrangements. It continues the 
evolution toward more mature fiscal responsibility.
<P>
	The Liberal government approach to provincial transfers 
passes three important tests. First, the federal government has 
hit itself harder through cuts. Second, we have given the 
provinces ample time, that is, one year  notice of our intentions. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11304"> 11304 </A></B>
<P>
Third, the reduction in transfer payments is equitable. This is 
where the fairness comes in again.
<P>
	Under the previous government the 1980s were a time of 
greed, a time of surplus and a time of waste. The 1990s under the 
present government are a time of basic need, not greed, a time of 
high efficiency and productivity, and a time of sustainability, 
not waste. It is a time to sustain our finances as well as our 
environment, our resources and as we all know, our fish stocks.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	We made a commitment to the men and women of Canada to 
reduce the deficit while restructuring social policy. We take that 
commitment very seriously.
<P>
	The budget of February 1995 is more than a bunch of 
numbers. It is one part of a very large social plan, an economic 
plan, as well as a financial plan. It maps out a very prudent and 
courageous incredible path, not only for our generation but more 
important, for the next generation of young Canadians to come. I 
urge all hon. members to support this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Cumberland-Colchester spoke about the changes to freight 
subsidies in eastern Canada. The way she presented it, in a very 
positive manner, is of course self-interested. However, I must 
say that this measure changes the whole picture.
<P>
	Last week, there was a debate on railways. Now, they want to 
change the shipping assistance program and focus more on road 
transportation of goods. We must realize that in the past, many 
businesses had their goods shipped by rail. What did this mean? 
It meant that they avoided making abusive use of road 
transportation which, we know, is bad for roads at certain times.
<P>
	It is all very well to talk about a form of flexible federalism 
because money is transferred to the provinces so that they can 
carry out public infrastructure projects. However after a few 
years, when the roads are a mess, everyone knows that it will be 
up to the provinces to repair and maintain them with their own 
funds. I would like to hear her comments on this. She can 
contradict me if she can. I believe that it is a short sighted view. 
It harms rail transportation which was appreciated by many.
<P>
	The need to build a railway was even the pretext used to create 
the Canadian confederation and what do we have? All of a 
sudden, in order to control its expenditures, the federal 
government transfers an equivalent amount on the short term 
from the railways to road transportation or to businesses. I 
would like to hear what the member has to say about this transfer 
and about offloading such expenditures onto the provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Lévis for his comments. We have enjoyed a valuable asset in the 
rail system in building this country.
<P>
	Many times I have gone through the province of Quebec, 
growing up in New Brunswick and living in Nova Scotia. It is 
part of our whole eastern heritage, part of our whole country.
<P>
	These assistance programs are antiquated. They have come 
through the British North America Act in 1920, 1930, 1940. I 
say again that they are antiquated. It is important that we update 
and modernize. Our manufacturers, our grain growers, our 
furnace makers in Nova Scotia, our farmers, wherever they are, 
in Quebec or Nova Scotia have the same needs: to move 
products to the marketplace.
<P>
	I cited some statistics taken by StatsCanada four weeks ago. 
Trains have increased some 19 per cent in freight in this country. 
If time permitted, I could address the question of railways, how 
a line in Nova Scotia from Sydney to Truro, my hometown was 
sold. It has become privatized. It was losing a million dollars a 
year and now it is making several million dollars a year. The 
amount of freight moving through those lines has increased. 
This is happening with short lines across the country. They are 
becoming profitable.
<P>
	By taking the subsidies away we are allowing our 
manufacturers and farmers to have more flexibility. We are 
allowing them to be more efficient in the 21st century, to 
modernize and to look at creativity under a world trade 
organization as well. The transitional funding allows us to get to 
that point and to upgrade the highways.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Lévis knows as well as I from 
Cumberland-Colchester that the highways between Quebec 
and Nova Scotia certainly need upgrading so that we can share in 
trade wealth a lot better between each other.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank you for allowing me to speak in this House on Bill C-76, 
an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 27, 1995.
<P>
	In its budget, the government announced a series of measures 
that jeopardize our social programs. Bill C-76 confirms what we 
feared most and shows the extent of the damage done to Quebec 
and to the provinces by the federal budget. Cuts in transfers to 
provinces amount to $7 billion. That is $7 billion of the federal 
deficit reduction taken off the back of provinces. These new cuts 
in transfers to provinces come on top of all the unilateral cuts 
made in the few last years that were so stridently criticized by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11305"> 11305 </A></B>
<P>
the government members who were then sitting in the official 
opposition.
<P>
	We must recall that, between 1977 and 1994, the federal 
government's share of social program financing, that is for 
health, education and welfare, dropped from 47.6 per cent to 
37.8 per cent. Bill C-76 is the confirmation of a sharp drop in 
federal funds, which is supposed to reach 28.5 per cent within 
two years, by 1997-98.
<P>
	After so many years of offloading its responsibilities onto the 
provinces, the federal government still does not understand that 
reducing transfers does not solve in any way the fiscal problem 
that all Canadian governments experience. By imposing dual 
jurisdictions in fields that are not federal according to the 
Constitution, the federal government is preventing any real 
solution to the crisis in Canada's public finances, whether at the 
federal or the provincial level. In the end, the real losers are the 
taxpayers we are here to represent.
<P>
	I said earlier that this budget would be the end of our social 
programs as we know them. We all know that Quebec and the 
provinces are facing a breathtaking rise in medicare costs. This 
raise is mainly due to factors such as an aging population, new 
and more expensive medical technologies and significant cost 
increases in pharmaceutical products.
<P>
	In the last budget, as was the case in previous budgets which 
froze transfer payments, the government announced substantial 
cuts in transfers to Quebec and to the other provinces for health 
care. It does not matter that, under Bill C-76, transfers for this 
program will be lumped in with other program funding in one 
transfer, the Canada social transfer. The result will be the same. 
Less money will be available for health care, and in this way, the 
government has chipped away at one of the foundations of our 
health care system.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance should be honest and open with 
Quebecers and Canadians. He should admit to them that such 
cuts in transfer payments will put an end to the health care 
system as we know it, because that is what is at stake here.
<P>
	The claim that all of these cuts will have no impact on the 
health of Quebecers and of Canadians and on the health care 
system itself is false. I cite as proof the recent statements made 
by the Prime Minister, when he quietly and furtively introduced 
the new concept of guaranteed fundamental or basic health care 
services for Canadians. By even talking about minimum 
standards, which have not been specified or determined, as 
being essential, the Prime Minister only draws more attention to 
a cross-Canada phenomenon: a two-tiered and two-speed 
health care system.
<P>
	The two-tiered health care system is gathering steam from the 
well established tendency in the system which, unless there is a 
spectacular about-face, will become the norm. On the one hand, 
a normal or basic service will be covered by health insurance 
and, on the other, a fully loaded, specialized service will also be 
available for those  who can afford to pay the user fees, to buy 
private insurance or to finance their health care in another way.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	As for the two-speed health care system, it is well entrenched 
throughout Canada: slow public services for those who cannot 
afford to pay and fast private services for those who cannot 
afford to wait but can afford to pay.
<P>
	No one in this House can deny that our health care system as 
we knew it has undergone radical changes across Canada. The 
two-level and two-speed system is no longer a 
doom-and-gloom scenario but a reality.
<P>
	In his budget speech, the Minister of Finance solemnly 
declared, and I quote: ``The conditions of the Canada Health Act 
will be maintained. For this government, those are 
fundamental''.
<P>
	Bill C-76 reimposes these national standards while, at the 
same time, cutting the financial resources needed to maintain 
them. It is pitiful double talk: although we want a Cadillac, we 
will only make payments for a bicycle.
<P>
	They are saying that the provinces should find ways to make 
up the difference and trying to pass this off as an example of 
flexible federalism. How can the Minister of Finance still think 
and maintain that Quebec and the provinces will manage to 
provide the same health services to the population? How can 
Quebec and the provinces manage to maintain all five 
conditions of the Canada Health Act imposed by Ottawa, when 
the Minister of Finance is offloading onto them a deficit in the 
billions of dollars through cuts in social programs?
<P>
	The Minister of Finance should have shown some courage and 
should have been straight with his fellow citizens by telling 
them: ``Unfortunately, because of our past mistakes, in 
particular at the time of the Chrétien and Lalonde budgets, we 
can no longer afford to maintain our health care system as we 
know it today''. The Minister of Finance is dodging his 
responsibilities instead of facing up to them. This government is 
dodging its responsibilities by transferring its deficit to Quebec 
and the provinces. This government is misleading the people by 
hiding the fact that the health care programs are about to sink as 
a result of the budget.
<P>
	Bill C-76 takes out two heavy mortgages on the Canadian 
health care system. On the sole basis of the obscene interest 
rates resulting from the federal government's inability to bring 
under control the public finance crisis it has created, the health 
of our patient, the taxpayer, is not about to get better.
<P>
	The Martin budget and Bill C-76 implementing it take out a 
first mortgage on the general state of health of our fellow 
citizens. All studies conducted here and elsewhere clearly show 
the cause-and-effect relationship between poverty and the state 
of health of the population. By making cuts to social housing 
and unemployment insurance, attacking the unemployed rather 
than unemployment itself and reducing transfers to the Canada 
Assistance Plan, the government is launching a  full-scale 
attack against the most disadvantaged in our society. For the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11306"> 11306 </A></B>
<P>
second year in a row, the unemployed and the working poor will 
be the budget cuts' main victims, while large corporations and 
financial institutions will be spared for all practical purposes.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance announces further cuts to the 
Unemployment Insurance Program but only a temporary tax on 
the capital of large banking institutions. The minister will beg 
for a mere $100 million from banking institutions, when the 
Royal Bank alone made over $1.2 billion in profits last year.
<P>
	In addition, this government turned a deaf ear to requests 
from all sides, from the Bloc and the Conseil du patronat alike, 
to eliminate all business subsidies. Instead, the Minister of 
Finance chose to make cuts of more than $300 million in social 
housing rather than going for the remaining $1.5 billion in 
business subsidies. That is the federal approach.
<P>
	Large corporations and banks can sleep in peace. The Minister 
of Finance clearly indicated in his budget that, once again, the 
unemployed and the disadvantaged will bear the brunt of the 
financial problems of this inefficient federal system, while at 
the same time ensuring that wealthy Canadians may continue, 
until the end of the century, to benefit from the advantages that 
flow from the establishment of family trusts.
<P>
	So, this is one way Bill C-76 attacks the health of Canadians. 
In time, sparing the rich by squeezing more and more money out 
of the disadvantaged, the government is, in fact, taxing the 
health of the latter.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	In this land of renewed and flexible federalism, the idea is to 
be rich and healthy not poor and in ill health. The second attack 
of Bill C-76 on the health area is a direct attack on the 
provinces' capacity to meet national standards in health care at a 
time when the federal government is substantially reducing its 
transfer payments. There is a certain irony in this way of 
proceeding. The federal government is cutting its transfer 
payments to Quebec by 27 per cent while at the same time 
developing national standards like those arising from the 
Canada Health Act and imposing them upon Quebec.
<P>
	Quebec is expected to absorb a large portion of Canada's 
deficit, while the federal government continues to interfere in 
Quebec's jurisdiction. Quebecers will continue to pay for the 
duplication imposed by the federal system. There will still be 
two health departments, two human resources departments, two 
environment departments, and so on.
<P>
	As for the health sector, if the federal government can no 
longer afford to meddle in this field of provincial jurisdiction, it 
should get out completely and leave it to the provinces, with the 
appropriate means of financing. This way, the federal 
government would at least save all the administrative costs 
related to its programs, which duplicate those of the provinces. 
One example is the pre-natal program established last year by 
the health minister, which is identical to the Quebec OLO 
program. Both the federal government and the provinces would 
gain and, in the end, the public would get more for the same 
money.
<P>
	In Quebec, as in the rest of the country, people now realize 
that they can no longer get deeper into debt if they do not have 
the means to pay. Canadians and Quebecers balance their budget 
by reducing waste and frivolous spending. In every household, 
people consult each other to avoid buying the same item twice. 
By taking on two major financial commitments in the health 
sector, the federal government clearly shows that it still does not 
realize the seriousness of its financial situation. The only 
appropriate remedy would be to stop spending, in fields which 
do not fall under its jurisdiction, just for the sake of satisfying 
its compulsive need to centralize.
<P>
	Canadian finances suffer from an acute case of federalism. In 
order to centralize everything, federal initiatives duplicate and 
overlap with provincial ones, regardless of the costs, or net 
results in terms of services to taxpayers. I draw the attention of 
this House to the eloquent silence of the health minister 
regarding the negative but foreseeable effects which this bill 
will have on health care services in Quebec and in Canada. If the 
minister is at all receptive to what goes on in her department, she 
must be aware of the serious impact of this bill on our health 
system.
<P>
	She must see the flaws of a system which is obviously and 
quickly leading us to a two-level program. Since the hon. 
member assumed her functions as Minister of Health, she keeps 
on repeating that Canada's system is the best in the world and 
that she cares so much about Canadians' health that she will 
never sacrifice the five major principles underlying the Canada 
Health Act.
<P>
	But the facts do not bear this out. If the minister will not 
sacrifice, as she claims, these major principles, her colleague, 
the Minister of Finance, has no scruples about doing it, although 
not directly, since that would require a good dose of 
straightforwardness, but indirectly. Principles or not, the 
Minister of Finance slashes the established programs financing, 
thus making deep cuts into the health care system.
<P>
	The minister may claim over and over her attachment to the 
principles underlying the legislation, but what happens if the 
necessary financial support is not provided? The principles 
gradually but surely fall into oblivion. Those are the facts of the 
matter, and they are becoming more and more obvious to 
Quebecers. Canadians all over the country would not rush to 
private  clinics the way they are doing if the attachment of the 
health minister to the principles of the Canada Health Act was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11307"> 11307 </A></B>
<P>
shared by all, and particularly the Minister of Finance, who is 
showing just the opposite with Bill C-76.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	I realize that the Minister of Health cherishes the principles 
which, at the time, were instrumental in establishing what she 
invariably refers to as the best health care system in the world. 
However, I do not think that, cherished though they may be, 
these principles had any impact on the government's budgetary 
decisions. It is clear that the minister failed miserably in her 
attempt to obtain the appropriate financing for our health care 
system.
<P>
	Perhaps I may recall for the benefit of hon. members what the 
Minister of Health had to say about the impact of the cuts and 
freezes imposed at the time by the Conservative government on 
transfers to the provinces for health care programs.
<P>
	The minister said in 1992, and I quote: ``Cutting back on the 
transfers in these areas has not contributed to better 
management of our health care system''. She went on to say: 
``We have literally forced our deficit on to the provinces and 
said to the provinces they have a choice: they can either increase 
their taxes or cut back on their services. What we have seen in 
many instances is a mix of the two''.
<P>
	Then, still in the same speech, the minister indicated the 
following: ``Cutting back on the transfers in these areas has not 
contributed to better management of our health care system. 
They have only contributed to the cutbacks and to the fear that 
we feel now across the nation as the middle income group, which 
is the largest group of Canadians, are frightened and afraid of 
what is going to happen to them in the future. Will there be a 
health care system for them, will they be able to get the drugs 
that they need at the prices they can afford to pay when they need 
them, when they get to be a certain age? There is this feeling that 
perhaps the federal government is letting go of its 
responsibilities in this matter''.
<P>
	So what does the Minister of Health have to say now about her 
government's responsibility for health care, when the bill before 
the House today offloads $7 billion of the deficit to the 
provinces by cutting transfer payments? Since she probably 
knows better than anyone else the serious consequences of these 
cutbacks, what did she do and what is she doing now to defend 
her position before the Minister of Finance?
<P>
	In fact, the Minister of Health has abdicated her 
responsibilities. When the last budget was brought down, she 
formally announced there would be a national forum on health, 
as promised in the red book, to be chaired by none other than the 
Prime Minister. We were told the health care system would be 
spared until the conclusions of the vast public forum were 
known.
<P>
	While the Minister of Health was unable to hold her forum, 
which was going to provide all the answers, her colleague, the 
Minister of Finance, wasted no time and spared no expense on a 
course of action. The national forum, the discussions and the 
reforms were all to be scuttled; blind, uniform and unilateral 
cuts were the answer.
<P>
	The Minister of Health who must see the same two-tiered 
two- speed system we see everywhere in Canada, should have 
the courage to rise in this House and denounce the unilateral 
decisions of her colleague, the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Bill C-76 proves to us that the Minister of Finance is not 
getting caught up in his colleagues' proposed reforms. In the 
case of the Axworthy reforms, he did not wait for either the 
report or the recommendations. The agenda for reform was so 
vague, there was no time to wait. This was the case also for the 
national forum on health. At the rate things are going, with the 
health department dragging its feet and finance charging away at 
a gallop, there will probably be no more money for transfers by 
the time the Minister of Finance gets a whiff of a 
recommendation from the national forum on health.
<P>
	In the final analysis, this bill is the antithesis of flexible 
federalism. Nothing in it, in the facts or in the measures 
announced alters the status quo in the slightest. On the contrary, 
it confirms the governments imperialist propensity to conduct 
its business with the provinces by presenting them with a fait 
accompli. It is true to its vision of ever more centralized 
federalism.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I conclude on this point. The bill conceals 
serious consequences for the future. It continues to widen the 
gap between the rich and the poor in our society and condemns 
many aspects of our social programs to certain death. The 
people of Canada have to know these things. More specifically, 
the people of Quebec have to know them before they make a 
final decision on the federal system, which is clearly not 
managing to solve its problems and is even less successful at 
changing to meet the expectations of Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
attentively to the speech by the hon. member for Drummond.
<P>
	Earlier on, she talked about our health care system and the 
negative effect that this budget would have on drug costs and on 
Canada's health care system. Yet, I did not hear the hon. member 
say a word about what really has an impact on the system, drug 
patents, which, interestingly enough, the Bloc Quebecois 
supports.
<P>
	My question is based on reality. The reality is that the health 
care system is falling into ruins because of an annual increase of 
12 per cent caused by the system that the previous government 
left behind. My question for the hon. member opposite will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11308"> 11308 </A></B>
<P>
simple: While things are so equal, with this being the truth, how 
can she say that this government, which is more committed to 
preserving  the health care system than any other preceding it, is 
destroying the system; how can she fail to tell the true story, fail 
to recognize the impact of drug patents, especially in the 
Province of Quebec, where people can no longer afford to buy 
drugs like they used to in previous years?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, the role of the federal Department 
of Health at the outset was to transfer sums of money for certain 
programs being established at the time, like the EPF which was 
calculated per capita. But, the government, because it holds the 
power to spend, decided to reduce its deficit by cutting and 
freezing transfer payments.
<P>
	The demand for health care in the provinces has increased and 
freezing transfer payments has reduced the provinces' ability to 
manage their health care system. Last year, the decision to 
extend the freeze meant that billions of dollars were not 
transferred to Quebec, and these billions of dollars which the 
Province of Quebec did not receive obliged it to reduce the 
services offered in hospitals. This year, transfer payments will 
be cut even more.
<P>
	That is not the role of the Department of Health. The 
department is supposed to transfer moneys owed to the 
provinces. Regardless of how it will come about, the result will 
be that funding for health care will be reduced and it is the 
provincial governments who will get the squeeze when the 
population or the costs of new technology and pharmaceutical 
products rise. And now, the provinces have to do the dirty work 
associated with the cuts in transfer payments for health care 
services. The government should limit itself to transferring the 
moneys it promised at the very beginning, in 1967, when it 
imposed standards, when it imposed the principles of the 
Canada Health Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since we did 
not have time to discuss it, and my colleague for Drummond is 
the health critic, I would like to ask her what she thinks of the 
absence of the provincial governments from the national forum 
on health.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it completely absurd, 
because the Liberals had promised a national forum on health 
during the election campaign with all the provinces being 
invited to review the system as a whole, since they are on the 
front line and are primarily concerned, as it is they that manage 
the health care system. And then the government ignored the 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	It probably invited people who are doubtless competent. But 
this is not their role. It is the role of the provinces. The ministers 
of health of each province have something to say. They know 
what they need.
<P>
	The situation is absurd. Millions more are being spent for 
what? We will end up with one more report on the shelf, and that 
will be the end of that. We will move on to another electoral 
program in which we will be promised a new national forum on 
health.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to be perfectly clear 
about the comments made by the member for Drummond. Once 
again the Bloc Quebecois demonstrates that it is not prepared to 
live up to the reality of why the health care system is in such bad 
shape and has badly deteriorated.
<P>
	The reality is that when drug prices increase by 12 per cent a 
year it affects the province of Quebec and every other province. 
They are undermining health care costs.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois demonstrates once again that it is 
prepared to play all sorts of sleight of hand and to use a good 
budget like the one presented by the Minister of Finance for 
another agenda. If the member is concerned about the health 
care system, will you and your party not agree that-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I remind members 
to direct their interventions through the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> I wish the member would respond adequately 
to the following question. How is it possible that the Bloc 
Quebecois and the member are interested in attacking the budget 
without dealing with the reality that drug prices are undermining 
the health care system and not the budget of the finance 
minister?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to my hon. 
colleague. I would like to know how his constituents react to 
being told that the Minister of Finance is cutting transfer 
payments to the provinces for health care. In Quebec, if there is 
a shortfall of $1.2 billion, who is going to suffer? Your 
taxpayers, sir.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I encourage 
members equally, and perhaps I should do it more forcefully, to 
direct their interventions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. I apologize.
<P>
	Taxpayers will be the ones to suffer. However, these are the 
very taxpayers who, along with Quebecers, provide $30 billion 
in taxes. Quebecers were promised that funds for health care 
would be returned to Quebec to cover the cost of administering 
their health care system, since its administration is a provincial 
and not a federal matter.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11309"> 11309 </A></B>
<P>
	Now we are talking about drugs. In the present budget, 
regardless of the method of transfer, there is not enough money. 
There is not enough money to manage our health care system 
and in fact to pay the cost of drugs, which is on the rise, and 
to pay for medicine for seniors.
<P>
	I reject this bill, which cuts health care and unemployment 
insurance once again on the backs of the most disadvantaged. 
This is what I object to.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do have my supporters; it is a great delight to hear 
their applause. It is probably because they basically know what 
topic I will deal with.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	It is a pleasure to rise in support of the budget because it 
breaks new ground in a way that has generally been overlooked 
by the media and by some members of the House. I am speaking 
of the fact that the budget, for the first time, declares that the 
government is going to put some restrictions on the funding of 
special interest groups. It will be setting out some guidelines to 
bring order to what has been over the years a very bad situation.
<P>
	For many years government funded advocacy groups have 
controlled the political agenda. The government, in calling to 
account special interest groups, will not only save a lot of 
money, it will also change the way in which politics are 
conducted.
<P>
	The innovation that the government has introduced requires 
all cabinet ministers to take personal care in the funding of 
special interest groups. It has given Treasury Board very 
specific guidelines. The Minister of Finance did not mention 
them in the budget so I will tell the House what the guidelines 
are.
<P>
	Basically when a minister is deciding whether a group should 
get government funding, the first question asked is how large the 
public benefit will be because of the activities of the group. If 
that group is going to do a great service and be of benefit to 
many people, then the guidelines dictate that it should get 
special attention for funding. However, if a group can raise the 
money itself then ministers are instructed to give it less 
attention for funding.
<P>
	If a group has a very narrow focus, then the guidelines suggest 
that it should probably find its own funding. That is a very 
important point. Many advocacy groups, single agenda groups, 
have a very narrow focus. Many Canadians believe that these 
groups should raise their own money to further their own causes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I must 
interrupt the hon. member.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MESSAGEFROMTHESENATE">MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE</A></H3>

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-76, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in Parliament on February 27, 1995, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have to say, being a critic of special interest groups, 
that I occasionally ruffle feathers. I have for a long time been 
expecting to hear knocks at my door. When royal assent 
happened it was a great pleasure to realize that it was not yet 
another special interest group but the Gentleman Usher of the 
Black Rod. I am deeply grateful for that.
<P>
	I was talking about special interest groups. I should like to 
take the opportunity to explain to the House a distinction that 
needs to be made in the context of my remarks. There are two 
basic types of special interest groups. There are those that 
provide services to the public. The government is very 
interested in seeing that happen. Many of them are charities and 
non-profit organizations. There is another category, the special 
interest group that is basically an advocacy group or a lobby 
group which pushes its own agenda.
<P>
	The development of guidelines for ministers to cut funding to 
special interest groups is a brave move on the part of the 
government. It will require considerable courage on the part of 
cabinet ministers. They will be reviewing organizations wherein 
it is sometimes difficult to discern the difference between a 
group that is providing an important service to society and group 
that advocates for a particular category of society. There will be 
reaction.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Many ministers who try to ensure that limited government 
funds go where they will be most effective will be subject to a lot 
of criticism. Politicians do not generally like criticism. This is 
one of the reasons preceding governments never tackled special 
interest groups. The government is prepared to take that 
criticism and do what is right. That is very important.
<P>
	Sometimes it is very difficult to know where best to cut 
funding to groups that provide services which may no longer be 
effective. Cabinet ministers will be confronted with the 
situation where occasionally they will issue orders, funds will 
be cut back by bureaucratic decree and some groups that deliver 
very important services to the community may be injured.
<P>
	This is where the individual member of Parliament comes in. 
We on all sides of the House should help the ministers to cut 
spending in interest group areas and ensure the spending is cut in 
such a way that the groups which are doing good work in society 
are preserved. Certainly MPs know better than the bureaucracy 
who is most deserving in their ridings. Basically that is the 
responsibility of an MP.
<P>
	I wish I could report that each ministry has issued a report or a 
description of its plans for cutting funding. This is not the case 
because the ministers are approaching a problem that has been in 
existence for a very long time. It will take a while to bring it 
under control. In some ministries it will be more difficult than 
others.
<P>
	For example, the industry minister has moved very swiftly. 
Within weeks of the budget coming down he produced a paper 
showing a great number of groups that had traditionally received 
Industry Canada money for community programs. They may be 
businesses but they are still community programs. He moved 
very swiftly and many of the programs are slated to be 
discontinued. I look down his list and empathize with the 
minister. It is very difficult to cut some programs. However it 
has to be done and we can see that the minister has done it wisely 
and well.
<P>
	Health Canada is a ministry with an enormous infrastructure 
for funding special interest groups of every sort, lobby groups, 
care groups, service groups: anything we would care to think of. 
It will take about three or four months before we really see what 
the health minister is doing in that regard. However I have good 
news. The health minister has moved to cut the funding of the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11311"> 11311 </A></B>
<P>
anti-smoking promotional campaign from $180 million to $64 
million.
<P>
	This is a fine example of a minister moving in the spirit of the 
budget. We are all in agreement that smoking is bad for our 
health. However we are not in a position any more where we can 
afford to fund essential promotional campaigns that are nothing 
more than advertising and propaganda exercises which may be 
better done by our schools. This will release millions of dollars 
in Health Canada for programs that deal directly with the health 
of Canadians. The health minister has shown courage, has done 
what is right and would get the support of most Canadians.
<P>
	Turning to foreign affairs, I cannot give details but I know that 
the minister is moving very responsibly on the program. We will 
see limited funds for foreign affairs, for helping the 
disadvantaged in other nations. We will see the funding being 
done with a great deal more care and a higher percentage of our 
taxpayers dollars going to people who can most benefit by them.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	I will comment on human resources development, one of the 
hardest ministries in terms of implementing this program. The 
minister understands the absolute necessity of ensuring that 
limited dollars get to Canadians who need them most, Canadians 
who are suffering and will directly benefit. We should watch the 
minister very carefully. I am confident we will see changes in 
the ministry that will result in a far better use of the taxpayers 
dollar.
<P>
	However, it will be difficult for the minister because he will 
come under a lot of criticism. We should get behind him and 
support him as best we can. It is a very difficult job. I do not 
envy what he has to do.
<P>
	This exercise is very worthwhile. Canadians have long 
perceived a large problem with respect to government funding 
of interest groups, be they advocacy groups or service groups. I 
regret to say there has not been the accountability that is 
necessary, particularly in a time when we do not have the money. 
It was all right maybe 15 years ago. Maybe governments felt 
they had much more to spend then, but right now we have to 
make sure that we spend wisely and well. This is a situation in 
which there has been very poor accountability.
<P>
	I could talk at great length about where special interest groups 
have used their money unwisely, but let me just deal with one 
particular area, the area of fundraising. I have done quite a bit of 
study on special interest groups. I have had to focus primarily on 
charities because non-profit organizations do not have to fill in 
a return that I can track and charities do. The charity information 
return will at least give some hard data on what particular 
special interest groups are doing with respect to accountability 
of public funds, be it money they received from government or 
money they raised from private donations.
<P>
	It is very instructive. I will just take members through a few of 
them. For example, the Canadian Council for Multicultural and 
Intercultural Education is an organization that is basically 
trying to get the message out with respect to race relations and 
ethnic relations. It calls itself an educational service. I am sure it 
is a very worthy cause.
<P>
	However, let us look at the council's charity information 
return which I have here. We would think the organization has 
the potential to attract funding from many groups in society, not 
just ethnic groups. We see that it received absolutely no private 
donations whatsoever in 1993. When we read its information 
form further we discover that it received $191,915 from 
government.
<P>
	This raises serious questions. Why cannot an organization 
like this one raise some of the money on its own? This is the type 
of thing the new guidelines are addressing and the type of 
question the guidelines raise. If it has a constituency why does it 
not get money from that constituency?
<P>
	Let us try another one. The Canadian Foundation for 
Children, Youth and the Law is an organization that raised some 
private donations. It raised $4,058, not a large sum. However 
from federal and provincial grants it received $420,874. The 
organization is promoting knowledge and appropriate 
implementation of laws affecting children. We would think such 
an organization could do better than raising $4,050 in private 
donations. Yet we see it is not there. I am not saying it is not a 
worthy organization but surely if it is that worthy, it ought to be 
able to get some funding from the public at large.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Moving right along, there is the well known charity Kids Help 
Phone. This charitable organization is designed for 24-hour 
phone counselling for teenagers, crisis lines. Backing it up is a 
foundation which is the fundraising arm of the charity. There are 
parallel charities, one an organizational charity and one a 
foundation. We have to combine the two.
<P>
	The total in donations this organization received from the 
public was $3,615,000. Then I look down and see in the forms 
which I have here that it spent $1.55 million on its actual 
charitable activities. In other words, of the private donations it 
raised, only 43 per cent actually went to its charitable activities. 
In other words, 57 per cent, $2,061,000 went to management, 
administration and fundraising. For every dollar people 
donated, 57 cents did not go to the actual charitable endeavour.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11312"> 11312 </A></B>
<P>
	This is a very good organization in its purpose. I do not want 
to indicate that I do not approve of what it is doing. However, 
Canadians demand a better fundraising effort on the part of the 
charities they are supporting than what we see here.
<P>
	When we start examining these things we can take quantum 
leaps. I will now take a quantum leap to look at another charity, 
Wildlife Habitat Canada. This charitable organization is 
dedicated to improving wildlife habitats anywhere in the 
country and even in Britain.
<P>
	This organization has managed to raise $9,601 in private 
donations. In provincial and federal government donations it 
received $2,711,000. It is important to keep these figures in 
mind: $9,000 in private donations and over $2 million in federal 
grants. It did raise funds, the $9,000, and in fundraising costs it 
spent $85,211. There is this incredible situation of an 
organization principally funded by government which spends 
$85,000 on fundraising and raises only $9,000. That is $8.75 
spent for every $1 raised.
<P>
	Canadians have good reason to question that type of activity. 
The average, ordinary taxpayer donated over $2 million to that 
charity which obviously has a fundraising problem of a very 
high order. And so it goes, unhappily.
<P>
	There is another one, the Canadian Ethnocultural Foundation. 
It actually spent $14.40 for every $1 it raised. It is not a very 
effective fundraiser either.
<P>
	I could go on at great length. I would not want to do so because 
it is late in the afternoon and I fear I would depress you, Mr. 
Speaker. There are many hundreds of organizations like these 
that have problems.
<P>
	Let me conclude my remarks by reading from a letter. This 
campaign is something I have taken a specific interest in and 
there has been a little news coverage from time to time. I have 
received over 250 letters from Canadians who agree that 
Parliament should be carefully examining how we fund all 
interest groups.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The spirit of that was captured in this one letter from an 
organization which states: ``We are a registered charity 
ourselves. However we do not accept funding from any level of 
government. This has meant that funding has been lean at times, 
particularly in 1991 to 1993. But if one is doing anything 
worthwhile there are always citizens and foundations willing to 
support your work. This is perhaps the truest test of the value of 
a non-profit body''.
<P>
	Nowhere along the line does this government, nor do I as an 
individual, propose cutting funding absolutely from all interest 
groups. Many interest groups have an important role to play. 
They can do things that government cannot do. They can reach 
out to people in society because they are out there in society. 
However we have to make sure that those groups we do support 
are the ones which can most effectively represent the interests of 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as always when the hon. member opposite is speaking 
the ears in this Chamber perk up. I say this quite sincerely 
because when my hon. colleague speaks, usually it is about 
something worthwhile and we can learn something if we listen. I 
would therefore most sincerely seek the counsel of the hon. 
member.
<P>
	If we are looking at special interest groups and the financing 
of special interest groups via the public purse, certainly we in 
this House are no different from or worse than anybody else in 
that donations to political parties or campaigns receive a tax 
credit. We get beneficial treatment under the Income Tax Act as 
compared with another charity.
<P>
	I would ask the member opposite to consider the following. If 
a private member's motion from the opposition were to come 
forward which would have the effect of ensuring that donations 
made to political parties would be subject to the same scrutiny 
and the same tax advantage as any other charitable donation, 
would the member opposite be supportive of such a move?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> I thank my colleague for the very good question. 
I never indicate how I will vote for legislation I have not seen 
beforehand. 
<P>
	I have great sympathy for what he is saying. The advantage in 
tax receipts political parties get versus charities is an area which 
needs to be reviewed. We have to philosophically ask ourselves 
whether it is really necessary that political parties enjoy that 
kind of advantage. There are some questions there as we would 
not want a situation to arise where politicians cannot support 
themselves.
<P>
	One thing on this whole issue of special interest groups is at 
least the politicians, the Reform Party, the Bloc-and I 
particularly mention the Bloc because it has some very strong 
ideas about ceilings on political donations. This matter is 
something that needs to be reviewed and examined 
philosophically. We do not want to make it difficult for 
politicians to raise money. On the other hand, we ought not to 
have an untoward advantage. Certainly I would agree absolutely 
that the books should be wide open on any donations any 
politician receives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard the hon. 
member for Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe talk about 
possible cuts to the funds given to what he calls interest groups. 
However, his list of organizations contained a large number of 
what I would call community groups, which the hon. member 
urged to put greater reliance on fundraising. I feel that he is very 
sincere and that is why I will ask the following question. At the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11313"> 11313 </A></B>
<P>
very end of his speech, he addressed the issue of political party 
financing.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	As you know, political parties in Quebec are currently 
financed only through individual donations, although in 
Canada, any corporation, union or group has the right to 
contribute to the financing of federal political parties. They 
make fairly large contributions. However, we in the Bloc 
Quebecois have decided not to rely on donations from 
corporations, businesses and special interest groups, because of 
Quebec's Bill 2 respecting political party financing as it was 
then called.
<P>
	To follow his reasoning, would the hon. member agree at 
some point to a review of the legislation regarding political 
party financing in Canada in order to restrict such financing to 
individuals?
<P>
	You also know that, at the federal level for example, unlike 
the situation in Quebec-I am not as familiar with the situation 
elsewhere-even individuals are allowed to claim tax credits of 
75 per cent, which means that the federal government gives $3 
for every dollar given by an individual to a political party. Does 
the hon. member think we could start with political party 
financing in order to set an example? We should at least restrict 
financing to individuals rather than to community interest 
groups which, hit by government funding cuts, also have to deal 
with reduced social services, leading to an increase in the 
number of clients.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to comment on the advisability 
of a law restricting political party financing to individuals in 
order to avoid the abuses that may exist at this time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that remark. I have 
examined the political donations from the last election 
campaign for the Liberals, the Reform Party and the Bloc 
Quebecois. I am aware of who put what money where. The 
member would find that by and large, corporations are not heavy 
spenders, at least during election campaigns.
<P>
	I did find what I thought was a major abuse that would interest 
my colleague opposite. The New Democratic Party during the 
1993 election received $1.5 million from the Canadian Labour 
Congress which in turn has been a major recipient of 
government funds for its labour education program.
<P>
	The member opposite, and I think all members would agree 
with me, I would be happy to see a law, if we could phrase one, 
that would forbid special interest groups that receive 
government funding from passing that government funding on 
to any political party at any level.
<P>
	If the member is looking for that kind of review, I would 
heartily endorse it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the comments of the government member surely 
cannot go unchallenged.
<P>
	The member expressed great concern about government 
revenues supporting labour education with the CLC. The 
member seems to be totally blind to the government largesse to 
the banks and vested interest groups through what is called tax 
expenditures that run into the billions of dollars.
<P>
	The member took great glee and satisfaction in denouncing 
Kids Help Phone which helps kids in emergency and suicide 
situations. Funds are being cut to this organization and that 
organization, many of which are staffed by volunteers who work 
hard at what the government should have been doing anyway. 
However government keeps cutting back and cutting back.
<P>
	The member took great pride in going after kids organizations 
and organizations which help the needy and poor. He did not say 
one word about the tremendous assistance this government and 
previous Liberal and Tory governments have given to the very 
wealthy and the very rich. Governments have allowed the Royal 
Bank of Canada to have millions and millions of dollars in profit 
and to pay zero amount in taxes. The government allows a teller 
with the Royal Bank of Canada to pay more dollars and cents in 
taxes than the bank does. Do we hear one word of protest about 
this inequity and the unfairness? The member enjoys going after 
kids and kids' organizations that help the poor, the weak, the 
sick and the elderly. He certainly does not go after those who are 
the powerful, his friends, that helped to elect him.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is well spoken by the member 
who represents the party-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know the question which 
the hon. member for Regina-Qu'Appelle raises is important 
and serious. I am also cognizant of the fact that the hon. member 
for Hamilton-Wentworth has been interrupted more often than 
not since four o'clock for various reasons. However, with one 
minute remaining, I wish the House would give the hon. member 
for Hamilton-Wentworth the opportunity to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, Elections Canada keeps a record of 
political donations. It is a legal record. We can search as much as 
we want and we will not see enormous funding from the Royal 
Bank or any other large corporation to any political party other 
than the $1.5 million the Canadian Labour Congress gave to the 
NDP, which is ten times the donation of any organization to any 
political party.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11314"> 11314 </A></B>
<P>
raised tonight at the time of  adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake-Medicare.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are a tough breed and it is a good thing. They will 
have to be tough to face what lies ahead.
<P>
	Bill C-76 provides for the legal implementation of the 
measures contained in the February 1995 budget. Among the 
initiatives contained in the bill is the new block funding plan 
which will alter the transfer of payments to provinces for health 
and education. The passage of Bill C-76 will, as well, facilitate 
the termination of the Public Utilities Income Transfer Tax Act.
<P>
	Let us get on with it. The House has wasted enough time and 
taxpayers' money debating measures which are secondary to the 
main problem in Canada. While the Liberal government directs 
its energies to useless mandatory gun registration, the national 
debt steadily rises.
<P>
	Today the debt stands at $547,758,477,000. That is 
approximately $39,000 per taxpayer and over $18,000 per 
capita. Canadians are worried about their future and they are 
depending on their elected representatives to straighten out this 
mess. We had evidence of that earlier in the year when the polls 
showed that Canadians were ready for a tough budget. They 
recognized that the debt was out of control and expected the 
Minister of Finance to bite the bullet. Instead, the finance 
minister's plans were torpedoed by his left leaning cabinet 
colleagues.
<P>
	He is not the first to have his plans watered down. In fact, for 
the last 20 years successive ministers of finance have declared 
war on the debt and we have not seen any results. One after 
another they have succumbed to the whims of political fortune. 
One by one they have shown disregard for the Canadian 
taxpayer. Now we are so far in debt that our legacy to our 
children will not be something to cherish. Their debt riddled 
inheritance will bring them a future full of fiscal instability.
<P>
	There was a short-lived budget back in 1979 that dared to be 
different. The new government of the day inherited the leftover 
Liberal debt and what was then the highest debt ratio among the 
major industrialized countries. Some things never change. 
Canadians saw what happened to that government. It started to 
put its fiscal house in order. The Liberals defeated that budget 
and the rest is history.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	In 1980 the Liberals regained power and allowed the debt to 
escalate. When they finally were defeated in 1984 the Tories, 
who learned their lesson in 1979, took a vow never to be so 
fiscally responsible that it would jeopardize their power.
<P>
	In the end, this philosophy helped to bring about not only their 
defeat but their unprecedented drop into oblivion. Today, even 
the Canadian economy is sinking faster than that 1979 budget. 
The Minister of Finance refuses to predict when his budget will 
be balanced. He  continues to talk about balancing the budget 
but he does not tell us when.
<P>
	Interest costs on the debt continue to grow. Inevitably this 
will result in a loss of security for Canadians, robbing them of an 
independent future. The minister made sure he could meet his 
deficit target by using what most economists consider to be 
conservative assumptions.
<P>
	He is instituting new rolling two-year targets, whatever that 
means. That way he can change the target as the interest rate 
fluctuates. He padded his budget with enough hidden taxes to 
ensure that there would be sufficient tax revenue growth over 
the next two decades to allow him room to meet his deficit 
targets.
<P>
	The bill, as I mentioned earlier, will terminate payments made 
under the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act. This is one 
of those hidden personal taxes found in the budget. It is a 
selective tax on the people of Alberta, Nova Scotia, 
Newfoundland and Yukon, but particularly Alberta.
<P>
	It is estimated that the average Albertan could lose $70 per 
year in disposable income as a result of this measure. The 
village of Warburg, which is in my constituency, estimates that 
the cost to the village will be $4,000. One might say that this is a 
rather insignificant amount but it is not. It is a 10 per cent 
increase. When one factors in the impact of the current belt 
tightening by other levels of government, it adds to the 
increased costs facing small municipalities in Alberta that are 
still the backbone of the rural areas.
<P>
	Why would the government single out these provinces for tax 
increases? How can one province be taxed and not another? Is 
this the Liberal version of fairness? Even though Alberta will 
bear the brunt of the tax, we can only assume that there was 
nothing untoward in the minister's decision. It is hard to 
convince residents of Alberta otherwise, especially after they 
have heard about the study conducted by the University of 
Calgary economist, which was reported by Canadian Press on 
Monday.
<P>
	That study not only confirmed that Quebec was the biggest net 
winner from Confederation but it also confirmed that Alberta 
was the biggest net financial loser. Between 1961 and 1992, 
Quebec received some $168 billion more from the federal 
treasury than it contributed in other revenues.
<P>
	Over the same period, the taxpayers of Alberta paid $139 
billion more into the federal treasury than they received, thanks 
in part to the national energy policy. It makes you wonder why 
we in Alberta want to stay and why they want to go.
<P>
	We would like to be treated equally but the government seems 
to have other ideas. It continues to seek out new ways to tax us. 
Even with the new creative method of deficit accounting and 
other moneys generated from the budget, the deficit target of 3 
per cent of GDP is still far from adequate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11315"> 11315 </A></B>
<P>
	While 3 per cent of GDP would be the lowest deficit in 20 
years, it is irrelevant when one considers that the net federal 
debt has risen to 73 per cent of GDP. Despite the federal 
reductions outlined in the budget, we cannot hide from the 
problem of increasing debt.
<P>
	A year from now the debt will be in excess of $600 billion and 
the interest on the debt is expected to go up by about $8 billion to 
top the $50 billion mark.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	When the Prime Minister boasts about the 3 per cent deficit 
target, all he is really saying is that the growth of the debt will be 
slowed. The debt may grow at a slower rate than it did in the 
past. That is not really anything to boast about when one 
considers that the $42 billion spent on interest payments is $4 
billion higher than a year ago.
<P>
	What is the reason for that jump? It is the $2.5 billion for 
interest on the new debt that has accumulated. Our past deficit 
now requires interest and it is the $1.5 billion for which higher 
interest rates are responsible. Program spending will only be 
reduced by some $12 billion over the next three years while the 
interest charges will grow by $13 billion. We are not gaining. We 
are paying more and getting less.
<P>
	The reality is that Canada has a debt problem, not just a deficit 
problem. The government was elected 16 months ago. How long 
do we have to wait before it gets on with tackling the problems 
of the 20th century? The debt clock is ticking and the Liberals 
are still fiddling. Someone should tell them that they do not have 
a lot of time left. Canadians know all too well that if a 
government does not address these sorts of problems in the first 
two years of its mandate, it is not likely to implement any 
difficult decisions in the face of an impending election or in the 
last half of its mandate.
<P>
	Canadians are demanding action. They want government and 
politicians to be accountable. If the government shunned 
traditional Liberal practice and did the right thing for 
Canadians, it would find those very Canadians willing to 
support it.
<P>
	The problem is that the Liberals do not have a plan to take 
Canadians to their ultimate goal of deficit elimination and tax 
reduction. They do not have a plan to solve the labour disputes 
over a long term. They do not have a long term plan to reform 
social programs. That is particularly obvious when one looks at 
the new Canada health and social transfer act. This is the much 
touted initiative that rolls established programs financing and 
the Canadian assistance plan into a new block funding 
arrangement.
<P>
	The idea may have some merit but it presents more than one 
dilemma for the provinces. There are no financial projections, 
for one thing, beyond 1997-98. How can provincial finance 
ministers make their fiscal projections for the future with any 
degree of accuracy if they do not know how much they can 
expect from the federal government?
<P>
	Canadians want to see some light at the end of the tunnel and 
they do not want it to be the headlight of an oncoming train. 
They want to know that the fiscal sacrifices that they have to 
make will not be done in vain.
<P>
	That is why the Reform Party took the unprecedented action 
of presenting a budget that explained how the deficit could be 
eliminated in three years. It is too bad for Canadians that they 
elected a government that lacks vision. The only solution the 
government can come up with is to drop everything on the 
provinces. We do not think that is fair. By transferring additional 
tax points to the provinces, our plan offers them a dependable, 
growing revenue base to fund health and education over the long 
run.
<P>
	As a farmer, I have come up with a way to explain the 
difference between the Reform Party and either the block 
funding proposal or the existing arrangement. This does not 
involve teaching a person to fish or giving him a fish. It involves 
a chicken and an egg.
<P>
	Under the existing arrangement, the federal government 
keeps the chicken and gives the provinces a dozen eggs. All the 
eggs have strings attached. That means the federal government 
can unilaterally make the decision to give less eggs to the 
provinces.
<P>
	The Canada social transfer involves giving the provinces a 
carton of eggs with one or two eggs missing and still with strings 
attached to the carton. The federal government continues to hold 
the chicken and can continue to remove the eggs from the carton 
it sends to the provinces.
<P>
	Neither of those situations sound like perfect situations. The 
Reform Party proposes to give the provinces the chicken.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	The government budget tells the provinces their transfers will 
be cut. We would work with provinces to develop national 
standards for health care and education. The Reform taxpayers 
budget showed with reasoned determination Canadians can 
emerge from the tunnel into the sunlight. The Reform budget 
offers Canadians hope for the future. Under our plan there will 
be enough money to support those who are unable to help 
themselves.
<P>
	The real threat to social programs is the failure of the Liberal 
government to control the deficit and the debt. The government 
will do and say anything to prevent Canadians from realizing 
this fact.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11316"> 11316 </A></B>
<P>
	Reform wants Canadians to know the real facts about the 
future. This is 1995 and the Liberals are still trying to come 
to grips with the 20th century while Reformers are planning for 
the 21st century.
<P>
	For instance, social security has always been provided only 
through the delivery of costly bureaucratic centralized 
government programs and agencies. If the government does not 
come to grips with this program now social programs will not 
survive this century.
<P>
	Reform's vision for the future of social programs contains 
ideas which will generate affordable, cost effective and people 
effective programs that will provide greater personal security 
and freedom from dependence on government for all Canadians.
<P>
	At the heart of Reform's new social vision for Canada is the 
concept that we can get more social security for dollars spent by 
changing the division of responsibility between Canadians and 
their governments. The Reform budget proposes to balance the 
budget in three years. The Minister of Finance continues to duck 
the issue. He knows at the rate he is going he will never bring in a 
balanced budget. A balanced budget is not simply an end in 
itself, but a means to an end. It is the first step in building a 
strong, vibrant economy for future generations.
<P>
	The Reform budget offers hope for the next generation and a 
chance to escape from the burden of debt. If quick and decisive 
action is taken sooner rather than later the impact on 
employment will be minimal and measures will lead to more 
permanent positive employment for Canadians than the red 
book plan of slow deficit reduction.
<P>
	It is inconceivable how the government could ask Canadians, 
who have the fastest growing personal tax burden in the 
industrialized world, to shoulder the burden of deficit reduction 
without first putting its own house in order.
<P>
	Last month the government announced an agreement had been 
reached among Liberal MPs to reform the gold plated MP 
pension plan. The only really good aspect about the plan was the 
opting out provision and that provision was intended to pit one 
Reformer against the other and split our caucus.
<P>
	I cannot deny that was the strategy but it did not work. It did 
not work and this Reformer cannot wait for a chance to opt out of 
that plan.
<P>
	The government made sure that senior Liberals and youthful 
cabinet ministers will be protected. At the end of their days here 
they will receive cash for life courtesy of the beleaguered 
Canadian taxpayer. The taxpayer can only dream of such 
financial security. The media charge of a double standard rings 
pretty true.
<P>
	Where is the hope? At the rate we are going none of us will 
live long enough for this mortgage burning ceremony. 
Canadians are beginning to realize this government is not any 
better than its predecessors. If the  government had any heart, 
any real concern for Canadians, it would deal with this debt now.
<P>
	In case there is any question, I will not be supporting the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I commend my colleague for a tremendous speech 
addressing the problems.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member a question since he is the 
labour critic. Every time we see our economy picking up and we 
see a glimmer of hope that we can increase our revenues, 
management and labour seem to have a fight and we disrupt the 
economy with strikes or lockouts or whatever. I have a feeling 
with our being involved in transportation if we do not settle this 
issue very soon our transportation system will not be even able 
to deliver eggs to the provinces, never mind the chicken.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	How would the member address this, because I think it has to 
be addressed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> The Reform Party has introduced in the House 
a private member's bill dealing with final offer arbitration. It 
has come to the point, particularly about the sort of disputes my 
colleague is talking about, at which labour and management 
have come to rely on back to work legislation. It has therefore 
become an impediment to the collective bargaining process 
rather than something that would enhance it.
<P>
	When the parties are this far apart for 25 months, as we have 
seen in this past dispute, it is a very good indication they are 
relying on back to work legislation. Labour knows it will not be 
out for eight months. It might be out for only eight or ten hours 
before Parliament starts to talk about back to work legislation. 
Management also has the same assurance.
<P>
	There is really no incentive for them to get their positions 
closer together in real down to earth bargaining. The bill 
soundly defeated in the House I would appreciate seeing come 
back from the government side. I hope the Minister of Labour 
would come up with some similar legislation as as a tool for both 
labour and management to get them to sharpen their pencils, get 
their positions as close together as possible. At any time one 
party or the other could ask an arbitrator to step in and select all 
of one position or all of the other position. That would 
encourage the two parties to get as close together as they could 
in their negotiations on their own.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise today to participate in 
this debate on Bill C-76, an act to implement certain provisions 
of the budget tabled on Parliament on February 27, 1995.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11317"> 11317 </A></B>
<P>
	In fact, many of the proposals contained in the excellent 
budget tabled by the Minister of Finance are reflected in this 
bill. We can see how the budget will be implemented as tabled 
and approved not only by the vast majority of the hon. members 
of this House, but also by a large proportion of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are dealing with the bill today but we are also dealing with 
a motion brought before the House. The bill today is to put in 
place the budget which has received widespread support from 
the Canadian public. If members want to know how widespread 
that support is, I will tell them.
<P>
	Gallup Canada says the budget is the most popular in all its 
years of budget polling. This is a record budget in terms of 
popularity. Roughly half of Canadians, 49 per cent, who are 
aware of the recent federal budget believe it will strengthen the 
economy according to a recent Gallup poll; 38 per cent believe it 
will not strengthen the economy. Almost 50 per cent more think 
the budget will create more jobs than those who think otherwise. 
This is the opinion of Canadians. This is a valid opinion.
<P>
	Let us listen to what many experts say. I do not mean members 
of the Reform Party, I mean real experts. Jason Myers of the 
Canadian Manufacturers' Association said: ``I am impressed. I 
applaud the Minister of Finance for what he has done''.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``This is a good budget'', said Ghislain Dufour, from the Conseil 
du patronat. My friend across the way will understand what I 
have just read.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Our two friends across the way will be 
delighted to hear that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> All our friends across the way will. I will not 
say how many, because that would point out to the presence or 
absence of members. That is why I will just say ``all our friends 
across the way'', out of respect for the authority of the Chair and 
all parliamentarians.
<P>
	Let me quote another distinguished Canadian: ``This is a real 
budget built on real measures'', said Michel Audet, the 
president of the Province of Quebec Chamber of Commerce.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Now let us hear more about what Canadians said about this 
budget. Sherry Cooper, economist at Nesbitt Burns, said it is a 
terrific budget, there is no smoke and mirrors. I am not quoting 
the Reform Party MPs here. I am quoting real, knowledgeable 
people. There is a difference.
<P>
	Lloyd Atkinson of MT Associates: ``This is one of the few 
budgets I have seen in a very long time where the promise was 
matched by the reality''.
<P>
	Stephen Van Houten of the Canadian Manufacturers' 
Association: ``This is really the first serious attempt at deficit 
reduction we have seen in this country in a long, long time''. 
Even Reform members could agree with that.
<P>
	John Bulloch of the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business said the Minister of Finance has the biggest job ever 
and he came through. Jeff Gundy, an economist at Wood Gundy, 
said the minister has more than met if not exceeded market's 
expectation.
<P>
	When does a budget get this kind or praise? Seldom if ever. 
This kind of praise has probably not been heard since the last 
time there was a Liberal government. It certainly was not heard 
when the Tories were in power.
<P>
	Let me tell members what the budget does and what we are 
striving to do with the bill. We are talking about deficit 
reduction. We are talking about reducing our deficit to 3 per cent 
of GDP as we promised in the red book and to further reduce it to 
1.7 per cent of GDP. We will continue in that line of progress 
because we as Liberals are committed to doing things right, and 
we will. We are committed to doing things fairly, and we will.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are also talking about spending cuts in this budget. We 
made a promise and, once again, we delivered the goods. We had 
promised to reduce the budget through expenditure restraint 
and, for every dollar in new tax revenue, there will be seven in 
reductions in this budget. Bill C-76 seeks to implement these 
reductions and implement this budget the Minister of Finance 
has given us.
<P>
	At the risk of displeasing certain hon. members opposite, I 
must say that this budget is very popular with the Canadian 
people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Notwithstanding the immense popularity of the budget, 
Canadians want us to move ahead to cut the costs and save 
taxpayers dollars in the way we on this side of the House want to.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	An amendment to the bill was just moved. It reads as follows: 
``That Bill C-76 not be read the second time now, but rather in 
six months time''. According to the hon. member opposite, a 
budget enjoying that much popularity should not be read the 
second time. It makes no difference to him that Canadians want 
this budget passed, the Bloc member does not want it. And 
because he does not want this budget, he is saying: ``Never mind 
that Canadians want this budget, they will not have it. Too bad''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11318"> 11318 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	This shows a lack of respect toward Canadian voters who want 
this budget to be implemented immediately, as the hon. member 
for the riding of Ontario said it so eloquently.
<P>
	Canadians want this budget passed by the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Earlier today an official from the Department of Finance was 
telling me it would cost millions of dollars a week if we did not 
have the bill passed by the end of June. Millions of dollars a 
week would not be saved. Millions of dollars a week which we 
promised Canadians we would save would not be realized if the 
House does not adopt the motion today.
<P>
	That is what the Bloc Quebecois is asking us to do, not to read 
the bill now and to do so six months hence; not to save the 
millions of dollars we want to save, not to have the cutbacks in 
expenditures we want to make and not to reduce the deficit in the 
way we are trying to do. That is what it wants. It does not want us 
to succeed. It wants us to fail.
<P>
	Why does it want us to fail? I do not understand. Why would 
any hon. member in the House not want the budget to go ahead? I 
cannot understand it at all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As for Reform Party members, they want the budget to 
include more cuts. As you know, they also wanted to eliminate 
old age pensions. You cannot trust these people. We, Liberal 
members, want a budget which is realistic, fair and equitable. It 
was not easy to draft this budget and it will not be easy to 
implement it either.
<P>
	However, Canadians realize that this budget is fair. They are 
saying: ``We may have to tighten our belt, but so will everyone 
else, including the government, the private sector and others. 
Since this is a joint effort for the good of our country, we are 
prepared to do it''. So, everyone is prepared to make a sacrifice, 
except Bloc Quebecois members, who want to table a motion to 
put the Minister of Finance's budget on the back burner.
<P>
	I say to the members of the Bloc: go to your ridings and ask 
your constituents if they oppose the budget tabled by the 
Minister of Finance in this House, on February 27. As I said 
earlier, the overwhelming majority of Canadians will tell you 
that this is a very good budget.
<P>
	Let me give you a few statistics about the budget. Again, this 
is from Gallup Canada. Just listen, you will see how positive the 
reaction was to this budget. ``In 1985-during the Mulroney 
years-28 per cent of Canadians felt that the budget would get 
the economy back on track, while 47 per cent did not think so''. 
In other words, Canadians opposed that year's budget in a 
proportion of two-to-one.
<P>
	Let us now go 1989, for example, when the Leader of the 
Opposition was a Conservative minister. In 1989, 26 per cent of 
Canadians felt that the budget of that year would get the 
economy back on track, while 53 per cent did not think so. Did 
the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean vote against that budget? 
Of course not. He supported it, even though more than half of all 
Canadians opposed it.
<P>
	Today, 49 per cent of Canadians feel that this budget will get 
the economy back on track, while 38 per cent do not think so. 
There are a lot more Canadians everywhere who think that this 
budget is good. It was well-received, even in the riding of the 
member opposite. Yet, what does the Bloc Quebecois propose 
today? It proposes a motion which, again, reads: ``That Bill 
C-76, an Act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in Parliament on February 27, 1995, be not read a second 
time but that it be read a second time this day six months 
hence''.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	It seems that some members of the Bloc Quebecois feel they 
should support a budget if the public is against it and condemn 
the budget if the public supports it. Does that make sense to you, 
Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	This is Bloc logic. They do everything in reverse. Just Bloc 
logic. Well, I think the hon. member should listen to what 
Canadians are saying, and I see there are more and more of them 
who seem to be interested in what is being said this afternoon. 
More and more people are showing an interest, not necessarily 
in what I am saying, but in the provisions of Bill C-76. I am 
willing to bet that many parliamentarians are here to find out 
why the motion presented by the finance critic for the Bloc 
Quebecois is wrong, and no doubt they are going to say why hon. 
member should vote with the government to obtain speedy 
passage of this bill.
<P>
	Let the finance critic for the Bloc Quebecois rise in his seat 
immediately to tell me if I am wrong. Mr. Speaker, as you can 
see, we have yet to hear from the hon. member, as I speak. 
Nothing. Complete silence on the other side of the House-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. We know the 
Chief Whip for the government is quick on his feet but I think he 
knows perfectly well that we cannot refer in this House to the 
absence of another member, even in jest.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Lévis has certainly raised a very important point regarding the 
customs and practices of this House, and I am sure that 
considering his experience, the Chief Whip is very familiar with 
this rule. He may proceed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would never mention the 
absence of a member, and I would certainly not belabour the 
point. I will now continue my comments, and I would urge hon. 
members to listen carefully, because as they probably know, the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11319"> 11319 </A></B>
<P>
vast majority of Canadians support this budget and the passage 
of Bill C-76.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The last thing Canadians want right now is for us to say 
collectively that we have a great idea, let us wait six months 
before passing the budget. Mr. Speaker, could you sell that in 
your riding? I do not think my constituents would be convinced, 
after telling them a month ago that we have a budget, if I said 
now we have changed our minds and we will not implement it 
for six months. That is what the Bloc Québecois wants us to do.
<P>
	I will wait to see how the Reform Party votes on Bill C-76. 
That will be interesting. Will its members vote to delay the cost 
cutting measures for six months, thereby further increasing the 
deficit? That will be an interesting. We will find out in a few 
days.
<P>
	Assuming the amendment of the Bloc Québecois is defeated, 
will Reform members vote against cost cutting, saving 
taxpayers dollars and trying to put the economy back on track, as 
we have been doing and will continue to do through Bill C-76? 
That is the challenge right now. I will bet there are some Reform 
members caucusing as we speak, discussing this important 
issue. If they are not caucusing because they are all here in the 
House, perhaps after we adjourn tonight they will caucus. 
Perhaps the leader of the Reform Party and other Reform 
members will have a caucus to discuss how they will vote on Bill 
C-76.
<P>
	I can give them advice. The so-called budget they presented 
to Canadians would have been a disaster. What they wanted to 
do was cancel pensions for virtually all seniors. That is not the 
way to go. The numbers which did not add up in their budget are 
not the way to go.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Where is your plan?
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Our plan was tabled in the House on February 
27. Our bill is right now before the Canadian public, Bill C-76.
<P>
	We know where the Liberals stand. We know the Liberals 
want to reduce the deficit, put the economy back on track, 
restore integrity in government, like we said we would do in the 
red book and like we are delivering.
<P>
	We want to know which side the Reform Party is on. How will 
it vote on the amendment not to have these cost cutting 
measures? Will it vote for the amendment, thereby depriving 
Canadians of these cost cutting measures? Will it support the 
Bloc Quebecois?
<P>
	On the other hand, once the amendment is disposed of will it 
vote with the Liberals as an effort to join all Canadians or at least 
the vast majority in terms of putting in place these budgetary 
measures? Will it again vote not to cut the deficit the way we 
want to do, presumably meaning it does not want for the deficit 
to be cut?
<P>
	I am proud to be voting for Bill C-76, although not because it 
is the sweetest of medicine. Some of the measures are not the 
sweetest of medicine. Some of the measures are strong but will 
make the patient, the Canadian economy, better in the short run 
and in the long run.
<P>
	If we can do that working together to make the economy 
better, we can provide jobs for a large number of Canadians. 
That is why we were sent here.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will try to explain, as requested by the hon. 
member in his speech, why our motion asks for a six-month's 
postponement for this bill.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians are starting to realize what this 
budget is about and to notice the very real impact of this budget 
and the severe cuts it contains. Let me give a few examples. I 
was told earlier that the people in my riding and other ridings in 
Quebec agreed with these cuts. So what are these people doing? 
They call us to ask questions about certain decisions. I intend to 
ask the hon. member about that.
<P>
	First, they decided to cut funding, without prior notice, to all 
agencies engaged in international co-operation, across Quebec 
and across Canada. No more money will be given to 
international co-operation agencies. Why did they do that? 
Because they want to keep them from making a connection 
between poverty in the South and poverty in the North and from 
realizing that they will have to develop some kind of solidarity 
between the two, because this government has no truck with 
solidarity. All it does is increase the gap between rich and poor, 
and that is what the members of an agency in my riding called 
CREM are starting to realize, and there are plenty of agencies 
like that across Canada.
<P>
	Another example. They decided to cut all experimental 
research on sheep. All ovine research in Canada, some of which 
was being done at the Experimental Farm in La Pocatière, for an 
industry that is developing rapidly, now that sheep growers are 
increasing market share in Canada. It is now 25 per cent. It has 
been going up for several years. They say that the funding freeze 
will save money in the short term. The result: no more research 
and development, which means that people in Quebec and 
Alberta who raise sheep will have to go it alone. It is no longer 
the government's business. And you call that useful cuts and the 
right thing to do? Maybe you should have taxed the banks first.
<P>
	I have another example, and I would appreciate your 
comments. The latest news is the decision to make cuts at 
Canada Employment Centres: terminals instead of people. Do 
you think that is a wise decision? Would you not agree that a 
six-month postponement is a good idea after all?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite ought 
to know that his colleague, the same one who a little earlier 
today, and I can see him, moved a motion  not to proceed with 
this bill, said many weeks ago that he wanted to cut what he 
called fat in government, a kind of shapeless mass, according to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11320"> 11320 </A></B>
<P>
the hon. member, as if there were this huge mountain of fat we 
could cut into.
<P>
	Government is not like that. I was a public servant for years, 
and that is not how things work. When cuts are made, it means 
something is taken out. There is no such thing as cuts that are not 
felt.
<P>
	Of course, if we try to save money, we have to cut services. 
What we have to do now is do our very best to put the economy 
back on track. We have made a good start: 421,000 new jobs 
since this government came to power, and this is only the 
beginning. Things are going to get better all the time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I may be allowed a 
personal opinion, I wish we could go on.
<P>
	It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business, as listed on 
today's Order Paper.
