<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CUSTOMSTARIFF">CUSTOMS TARIFF</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved 
that Bill C-5, an act to amend the customs tariff, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce for 
consideration by the House Bill C-5, an act to amend the 
customs tariff.
<P>
	The legislation I am introducing today seeks to extend the 
general preferential tariff, commonly referred to as the GPT, for 
another 10 years. The GPT is a tariff preference granted to 
developing countries for goods originating in those countries.
<P>
	Let me give some of the history of this preferential tariff. In 
the mid-1960s there was widespread recognition that special 
and differential tariff treatment for developing countries was a 
means of fostering growth and well-being of those nations. 
Consequently in 1968 it was agreed at the United Nations 
conference on trade and development that a system of trade 
preferences should be implemented for developing countries.
<P>
	In June 1971 this decision was accepted by Canada and other 
signatories to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
Members of the GATT agreed that developing countries would 
be permitted to award more favourable treatment to products 
imported from developing countries than to similar products 
from developed countries. It was also agreed that the 
preferential tariff would be generalized, non-discriminatory 
and non-reciprocal.
<P>
	Canada introduced its general preferential tariff scheme on 
July 1, 1974 for a 10-year period. The GPT was subsequently 
extended for another 10 years until June 30, 1994.
<P>
	With this history in mind I would like to outline for the benefit 
of the House some of the essential features of the GPT. The GPT 
provides for a reduction in tariffs of up to one-third of the most 
favoured nation rates on certain types of goods from developing 
countries.
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
	In the case of the least developed developing countries, that is 
the poorest countries known as the LDDCs, the tariff reduction 
is even larger. These countries are entitled to duty free treatment 
on all of their GPT eligible exports to Canada.
<P>
	In all, more than 180 countries and territories are entitled to 
zero or low tariffs on a wide range of products, primarily 
manufactured and semi-manufactured goods.
<P>
	In order for particular items to qualify for GPT they must 
comply with the rules of origin and other regulations. More 
particularly goods would only qualify for the GPT if at least 60 
per cent of the factory price of the goods exported to Canada 
originated from one or more GPT countries. In the case of the 
LDDCs, the poorest countries, the content requirement is 40 per 
cent.
<P>
	In order to ensure that GPT products do not have an adverse 
impact on Canadian producers, a safeguard system is authorized 
by the Minister of Finance to withdraw GPT treatment for 
particular goods.
<P>
	The question before us is simple: Should the GPT be 
extended? It is the government's view that the GPT should be 
continued. The legislation I have tabled proposes to extend the 
GPT for another 10 years to the year 2004. The government's 
decision to extend the GPT is being made at a time when most 
developed nations have already extended their preferential tariff 
schemes. In other words we are in the mainstream.
<P>
	The reasons which justified the introduction of the GPT 20 
years ago still remain. While the GPT has supported growth in 
the export sectors of many developing countries, they still have 
a long way to go. Indeed many developing countries still need 
preferential access to the markets of the developed world in 
order to improve their economic status. By allowing developing 
countries preferential access we continue Canada's tradition of 
assisting the developing world. Moreover, the massive weight of 
evidence from 50 years of trade liberalization supports the 
principle that export expansion contributes to general economic 
growth.
<P>
	The GPT does not only benefit developing countries. As a 
result of lower tariffs on goods from the developing world, 
Canadian consumers enjoy access to imported goods at 
competitive prices. Also Canadian producers who rely on goods 
from GPT countries as inputs also benefit from the reduced 
tariff. Accordingly the GPT contributed to the economic 
development 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1540"> 1540 </A></B>
<P>
of the  beneficiary countries while allowing Canadians to 
benefit as well.
<P>
	At the same time, and as noted earlier, in order to ensure that 
goods from GPT countries do not injure domestic producers, 
there exist legislative and quasi-judicial mechanisms for 
withdrawing GPT status to goods that are injurious to domestic 
producers. I wish to assure the House that where a reduced tariff 
injures Canadian producers, the government can move to 
disqualify such goods from the lower tariff. For example, rubber 
footwear and rubber inner tubes have for a number of years been 
excluded from the GPT scheme under temporary safeguard 
measures recommended by the Canadian International Trade 
Tribunal. The government has now decided to remove these 
products permanently from the scheme.
<P>
	Finally, in recent years we have seen considerable change in 
the international economic and trade situation. Many 
developing countries are now enjoying significant economic 
growth while others need more assistance because their 
economic situation has deteriorated over the past several years. 
We have recently ratified NAFTA and the Uruguay round of the 
GATT has just recently concluded. These trade arrangements 
will result in reduced tariffs on many products. These changes 
have significant implications for the GPT.
<P>
	I also wish to tell the House that the government is studying 
the ramifications of these developments with a view of making 
changes to the GPT tariff structure in the next year or so. The 
objective is to make the GPT an even better tool to assist the 
developing world. During this year consultations will be held 
with interested parties on possible expansion of GPT product 
coverage and reduction of GPT rates, particularly for the least 
developed countries. In addition, we will be examining the 
desirability of maintaining the GPT for those countries that have 
already achieved the high level of economic development.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	To conclude I call on all members of the House to support this 
bill. Such support will show Canada continues to contribute to 
economic growth within the developing world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps I 
may start by greeting my colleague, the Secretary of State for 
International Financial Institutions, who tabled this bill on 
January 31 on behalf of the Minister of Finance. Aside from the 
debate on the motion presented by the Reform Party last week, 
when I had the pleasure of making a presentation which dealt 
partly with international financial institutions, and in fact just 
before the secretary of state gave his speech, this is the first time 
he and I will have an opportunity to work together in the House.
<P>
	He will be pleased to hear that we are probably on the same 
wave length regarding the general implications of the bill before 
the House today, and I hope this will be only the first of many 
such occasions.
<P>
	I would now like to comment more directly on Bill C-5 which 
the House is being asked to consider and on the context that 
makes it so important, namely, export development assistance 
for developing countries.
<P>
	This is a very short bill. It contains only one section, whose 
purpose is to extend for ten years-until June 30, 2004-the 
expiry date for the general preferential tariff applied by Canada 
to developing countries. Since the various provisions of the GPT 
have already been explained in detail by the secretary of state, I 
do not think I have anything to add in that respect. The bill 
amends section 45 of the Customs Tariff, under which the GPT 
was to expire on June 30 this year.
<P>
	However, the government reserves the right to change 
subsequently, by order of the Governor in Council, the expiry 
date of the extension, the rate of duty provided under the GPT 
and the treatment given certain goods and certain countries.
<P>
	Although not impressive in size, Bill C-5 has a considerable 
impact through what it actually does.
<P>
	I may recall that in the early seventies Canada, like all 
industrialized countries, introduced preferential tariff treatment 
for developing countries. The purpose of this measure was to 
promote the economic growth of these countries by developing 
their trade with Canada.
<P>
	Every 10 years, parliamentarians are asked to consider 
another ten-year extension for a measure that costs little and 
provides a form of indirect aid to developing countries. In this 
respect, the Bloc Quebecois reiterates its support for measures 
that promote international development.
<P>
	The provisions of this bill ultimately provide an attractive 
market for the products of developing countries, removing the 
dependency that conventional development aid will sometimes 
create. This is positive aid that helps these countries develop 
goods for export and promotes their integration and 
participation in international trade, which is expected to 
intensify in the years to come. That is why the Official 
Opposition intends to support this bill.
<P>
	Canada has acquired an excellent reputation for development 
assistance, through the expertise and activities of 
non-governmental organizations dedicated to international 
development. We must continue this tradition, and I want to take 
this opportunity to say that a sovereign Quebec will be guided by 
the same concern for international equity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1541"> 1541 </A></B>
<P>
	All of us have been exposed, from time to time, to the usual 
series of statistics that point to wide gaps in economic 
development and in the availability of basic resources ensuring 
a minimum quality of life, which is the case in many countries 
on this planet. More than one billion people or one-fifth of the 
world's population earn less than one U.S. dollar per day, 
comparable to a wage level that existed in Europe and the 
United States at the end of the eighteenth century. In the 
eighties, the per capita income of developing countries in Latin 
America and Sub-Saharan Africa declined, in real terms.
<P>
	However, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and there are 
some indications that development programs can produce 
substantial positive results.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	The average per capita income in developing countries, for 
example, has doubled over the last three decades, which is a rate 
of growth higher than in Great Britain during the industrial 
revolution, or in the United States in the 19th century, or even in 
Japan between the two world wars. Turkey, for instance, 
doubled its per capita income over a period of 20 years, from 
1957 to 1977. Brazil made it in 18 years, from 1961 to 1979; 
South Korea in 11 years, from 1966 to 1977; and China in 10 
years, from 1977 to 1987.
<P>
	Infant mortality has been reduced by half and life expectancy 
has been pushed ahead 10 years on average. A child born in 
Shanghai is less likely to die before reaching one year of age and 
more likely to learn how to read and to live longer than a child 
born in New York.
<P>
	Despite these very encouraging statistics, major differences 
and unacceptable inequalities continue to exist and in some 
cases to increase. It is therefore necessary to maintain our 
efforts in order to promote development in the countries which 
do not enjoy the great conditions we have here.
<P>
	Clearly, magic formulas to achieve development in the Third 
World exist by the million.
<P>
	Just think of the drastic measures advocated by the World 
Bank or the International Monetary Fund in order to bring 
structural changes to the macro-economic policies of these 
countries, even though they are very often accompanied by a 
worsening of already serious social problems.
<P>
	Some experts insist on growth of local savings, while others 
favour a massive involvement of government in some sectors of 
the economy.
<P>
	Others advise a total or partial closing off of the country to 
imports, in order to generate economic growth from the inside.
<P>
	Finally, there are some who believe that opening the 
economies of developing countries to the world is, in the long 
run, the best way to achieve development. The abolition or 
reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers and the adoption of 
measures to promote exports would be some of the roads to 
development.
<P>
	Such measures would only ensure these countries do not 
remain mere observers of this tremendous phenomenon called 
market globalization. As for us, we must realize that we have 
everything to gain from a reduction of the dependence of these 
countries and from their involvement in, and contribution to the 
increasing world trade.
<P>
	Therefore, I believe that one of the ways we have to encourage 
development in these countries is to open up our markets to their 
goods and services. This is why, in my opinion, Bill C-5 is a 
valid contribution to developing countries.
<P>
	Some of these countries have already made the strategic 
choice of promoting export growth to improve their economic 
development. Results have been outstanding in most cases.
<P>
	This strategic choice was made in the sixties by South Korea 
and Taiwan, and in the seventies by Thailand. These countries 
are living proof of the value of such a strategy.
<P>
	Originally, the three countries had the social and economic 
characteristics we observe in several developing countries and 
those are a large and growing population, a low level of 
investment and an economy largely based on agriculture.
<P>
	In less than three decades, they achieved an absolutely 
stunning rate of growth, along with some other countries in the 
region.
<P>
	This phenomenal success is the result, among other things, of 
two strategic choices, one that I just mentioned, which is the 
implementation of export-driven policies, and manpower 
training as a major priority.
<P>
	In this regard, Quebec is particularly sensitive to the 
importance of implementing a manpower policy which is 
consistent, flexible, structured and effective.
<P>
	At the beginning of the sixties and until the early seventies, 
South Korea and Taiwan launched a very aggressive strategy of 
economic growth based on export promotion. A lot of incentives 
were made accessible to industry in areas that, today, we call 
soft sectors, for example textiles, clothing and shoes.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Following the difficult 1970s, these two countries emerged 
with leading annual growth rates of nearly 10 per cent between 
1985 and 1991. They also succeeded in diversifying their 
production in favour of goods with a higher value added.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1542"> 1542 </A></B>
<P>
	An interesting parallel can also be drawn with certain Latin 
American countries. Before the 1980s, countries of Latin 
America would have been hard pressed to pass for champions 
of free trade. Quite the contrary, in fact.
<P>
	Most of them had adopted trade policies aimed at protecting 
their domestic market from foreign competition, instead of 
policies which would have allowed domestic firms to exploit 
their comparative advantages on foreign markets.
<P>
	However, in the early 1970s, a number of Third World 
countries and many Latin American countries such as Brazil, 
Mexico and Peru, experienced a debt crisis. Consequently, with 
the blessing of the International Monetary Fund and the World 
Bank, these countries were compelled to adopt outward-looking 
policies, lowered tariff barriers, introduced import permits and 
quotas and adopted export promotion measures.
<P>
	During the 1980s, several Latin American countries rid 
themselves of dictatorial regimes and replaced them with 
democratically elected governments. Contrary to all 
expectations, these governments managed to survive and, in 
most cases, are still around today.
<P>
	Conditions in several countries in this region, chief among 
them Mexico and Chile, appear favourable to very significant 
economic growth. It comes as no surprise, then, that the 
adherence of other Latin American countries to NAFTA has 
aroused considerable interest.
<P>
	It should be noted, however, that the world trading system 
still has some shortcomings which impede the economic growth 
of developing countries.
<P>
	According to the OECD, sectors such as agriculture and 
textiles which represented the strength of many developing 
countries after World War II, have in no time become the target 
of protectionist measures imposed by industrialized countries.
<P>
	As paradoxical as it may seem, the beneficial effects of 
development assistance policies implemented by industrialized 
countries have often largely cancelled out by the protectionist 
trade measures theses very same countries have adopted.
<P>
	Under GATT, agriculture was excluded de facto from the 
usual applicable rules, thereby allowing industrialized countries 
to protect their domestic market through the imposition of 
tariffs and quotas.
<P>
	Moreover, industrialized countries have not hesitated to 
subsidize their agricultural surpluses around the world, pulling 
the rug out from under developing countries in the process and 
often rendering the latter's domestic production uncompetitive. 
With your permission, I would like to quote an excerpt from an 
OECD report released last year which states the following: 
``Exports of Latin American agricultural products have also 
been affected by the high levels of agricultural production 
within OECD countries as well as by the ever-increasing level 
of subsidies. In some cases, agricultural exports from 
developing countries have been squeezed out of  profitable 
markets by highly subsidized exports from industrialized 
countries''.
<P>
	Furthermore, the tariff system in place in industrialized 
nations penalizes imports of processed products by giving the 
advantage to raw materials and other unprocessed products. 
Developing countries would be at a disadvantage if they wanted 
to diversify their economies and begin producing value added 
products.
<P>
	The success of the recent GATT negotiations should make life 
easier for exporters in Third World countries, particularly 
exporters of agricultural products, clothing and textiles. The 
elimination of tariff barriers on a growing number of products 
from tropical countries, along with the dismantling in ten years' 
time of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement, which will be included 
under the GATT rules, should also be a boost to Third World 
countries.
<P>
	However, over the last decade or so, we have been witnessing, 
unfortunately, a resurgence in trade protectionism. New forms 
of protectionism, such as orderly market sharing agreements, 
voluntary restrictions on exports and other quota measures, have 
been introduced. Automobiles, semi-conductors and steel have 
been targeted, along with other industries which successfully 
lobbied for protectionist measures.
<P>
	These measures add to those already in place for textile, 
clothing and agricultural products. Anti-dumping measures, 
so-called temporary safeguard measures and accusations of 
unfair trade practices are popping up everywhere these days.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Canada, as we know, is certainly not immune from this 
insidious and looming return to protectionism, particularly from 
its main trade partner, the United States, which is the market for 
almost 80 per cent of its exports. Our trade problems with the 
United States, especially with beer, steel, magnesium, softwood 
lumber and agricultural products, constantly remind us that free 
trade benefits are fragile and that we must watch our trade 
partners' practices more closely.
<P>
	Economic development formulas vary between countries. 
Export promotion strategies are not, by themselves, a panacea. 
Although they are important, there is no question that other 
measures must also be contemplated.
<P>
	People's happiness is not necessarily contingent on increased 
individual purchasing power. We must allow societies to 
develop at their own pace without forcing them to conform to 
the economic development model dictated by market forces. It 
is a decision that these societies must make for themselves. It is, 
however, important and even essential to contribute to these 
countries' economic growth by giving them preferential access 
to our markets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1543"> 1543 </A></B>
<P>
	Promoting the growth of developing countries' exports to 
industrialized nations is therefore a most commendable goal. 
The Bloc Quebecois does not deny it, of course. But if I may, 
I would like to outline a number of concerns we, on this side 
of the House, have about the practical application of the general 
preferential tariff.
<P>
	We must first of all recognize that the countries that currently 
benefit the most from the general preferential tariff are newly 
industrialized countries, mainly the new economic powers of 
Southeast Asia. These are not, strictly speaking, third world or 
developing countries.
<P>
	Furthermore, China and Indonesia, for instance, which are the 
beneficiaries of 38 per cent and 3 per cent respectively of 
Canadian preferential tariffs, are regularly censured for their 
repeated violations of human rights.
<P>
	As the purpose of the general preferential tariff is to help real 
developing countries to grow, without hurting the Canadian 
economy in the process, we should be entitled to a more 
in-depth study of products and countries benefiting from the 
general preferential tariff.
<P>
	This brings us to question the relevance of maintaining the 
general preferential tariff for developing countries that have 
since become newly industrialized nations. As a result, we must 
determine if these countries still meet the criteria allowing us to 
define what is a developing country, which, we agree, can be 
very complex.
<P>
	In the cases concerning us, we should ask whether newly 
industrialized countries such as Hong Kong, South Korea, 
Taiwan and Singapore should still get preferential treatment. If 
all industrialized countries decided to take away from these 
countries preferential tariffs generally extended to developing 
nations, this could impact on their treatment by international 
financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, 
the World Bank or regional development banks.
<P>
	One must know that the United States no longer gives 
preferential tariff treatment to South Korea and Hong Kong. 
Japan, Canada and the European Community, for their part, have 
still not made a decision on this issue.
<P>
	The federal government has already announced its intention 
to study how desirable it would be to continue to extend the 
general preferential tariff to countries that have reached a high 
level of economic development. In fact, such a study is 
unavoidable in preparation for the meeting of the United 
Nations Conference on Trade and Development to be held in 
1995, precisely about the general preferential tariff. Now that 
the Uruguay Round is over, the government has also announced 
its intention to review, and probably reduce, the extent of the 
general preferential tariff.
<P>
	In addition, we know that the government intends to consult 
with Canadian manufacturers before making any decision on the 
general preferential tariff, a move that we wholeheartedly 
endorse.
<P>
	It goes without saying, however, that any change to the 
general preferential tariff as it applies to any product or country 
could have major political repercussions.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Taking the general preferential tariff away from South Korea 
or any other newly industrialized country could lead to a 
deterioration in our trade relations with them since they may not 
like what Canada is doing.
<P>
	The case of China, which has nearly 40 per cent of Canada's 
preferential tariffs, could also arise. Like the United States, 
which is wondering whether it should now deny most favored 
nation status to China, mainly because of the repeated violations 
of human rights in that country, Canada could show how 
important it considers human rights to be by also considering 
withdrawing the general preferential tariff from all countries 
that blatantly violate these rights.
<P>
	In that the government has said many times that it intends to 
involve Parliament in Canada's foreign policy, and since any 
change in the scope of the general preferential tariff is likely to 
have political repercussions, would the government agree to 
consider the possibility of consulting parliamentarians, as well 
as Canadian manufacturers, before changing any component 
whatever of the general preferential tariff and if necessary 
amend this bill along those lines?
<P>
	Such a consultation could proceed in a flexible and efficient 
manner through the Standing Committee on Finance or the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
<P>
	Be that as it may, I eagerly await the government's response to 
this suggestion, which I am making as a request, in view of the 
importance which the government claims to attach to the 
opinion and judgment of parliamentarians.
<P>
	I close by reiterating our total support for the basic principles 
underlying the extension of the general preferential tariff for the 
so-called developing countries. At the same time, I also 
reiterate my concerns and questions about applying this tariff to 
the newly industrialized countries and to developing countries 
which openly violate human rights.
<P>
	I trust that the government will follow up our request for prior 
consultation with parliamentarians before any change is made to 
the general preferential tariff structure.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to be involved in this debate. First, I would like 
to thank the hon. parliamentary secretary for the extensive 
outline of not only the benefits but the concerns with regard to 
Bill C-5.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1544"> 1544 </A></B>
<P>
	I would also like to thank the Minister of Finance for the 
co-operation of his staff in providing information to us as a 
caucus, not only on this bill but on other bills as well. The staff 
responded very quickly and briefed us well in an open manner 
and presented us with a very good case for and against the bill 
and we were able to make a judgment as a caucus.
<P>
	As we well recognize, the purpose of Bill C-5 is to extend 
Canada's general preferential tariffs for developing countries 
from June 30, 1994 to June 30, 2004. That is a major 
commitment we are making as Canadians to the needs of other 
countries in terms of industrial and social development, in our 
attempt to bring their economic base closer to what we enjoy as 
Canadians. In terms of a world responsibility as Canadians we 
are to be well commended for taking that approach.
<P>
	The Reform Party, after examining this bill and going over the 
presentations that were made to us, supports the bill. We feel 
that it is right in principle and that it is an obligation we should 
take on as Canadians.
<P>
	There were some very positive qualities of the general 
preferential tariff that we felt should be noted at this time in our 
presentation to the House. First, it will lower import barriers, a 
concept we support as the Reform Party. Second, the lower 
tariffs will stimulate economic growth in developing countries. 
Third, it is very wide ranging in terms of its unconditional 
nature as to how it can assist these countries. More than 180 
developing countries and territories qualify for lower Canadian 
tariffs. That is certainly a benefit.
<P>
	Another reason for our support is that while in a sense Canada 
loses in terms of bookkeeping some $156 million because of the 
lower tariffs, we recognize as Canadians that we benefit because 
the general preferential tariff will also enable us to have lower 
prices in terms of goods as consumers in this country. That 
certainly is a direct benefit in that sense. However, we do have 
some concerns.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	First, while businesses in our country can benefit from lower 
input costs under this system, there are some questions with 
regard to savings that may actually be passed on to consumers.
<P>
	We would be remiss in our responsibilities if we moved into 
the marketplace and said that we should implement some type of 
legislation to prevent that. I think more supervision by 
government, more public servants to do that which would cost 
us as taxpayers more money, or more interventionist actions are 
certainly not the way.
<P>
	We must have confidence that the forces of the marketplace 
will take care of that concern. It may not in all cases but I think if 
we let the marketplace work properly, it certainly will.
<P>
	Second, while this system will help developing countries, I 
believe we should go one step further by using this opportunity 
to encourage a responsible government in those nations. We 
certainly want to give disadvantaged nations a chance to grow 
economically.
<P>
	However, we want to ensure, and I am sure we all feel this as 
parliamentarians, that these countries uphold a major standard 
of human rights such as we enjoy here in Canada. It is part of the 
obligation and part of the message that I think we want to send 
indirectly through this bill to those nations that are benefiting 
from our compassion here as Canadians.
<P>
	Third, we should ensure that rebates to developing countries 
are not part of the deal. The government should ensure that 
countries only benefit from the reduced tariffs. I am sure the 
government will keep a watchful eye in that area.
<P>
	Fourth, we as a government must prevent any kind of dumping 
of cheap imports into other countries as that may strain relations 
with our trading partners. For example, a commodity should not 
be imported into Canada at a reduced tariff and then dumped into 
the United States to cause a distortion in the American 
marketplace.
<P>
	In summary, as I said before, we support the bill and 
encourage the government to move quickly in this direction. It 
was explained in our briefing sessions that if changes need to be 
made quickly, regulations can be changed and are in place and 
they can be amended to protect any industry that may be 
adversely affected by these tariffs.
<P>
	Those industries have the right to appeal and to make 
presentations. If the government in its wisdom following those 
presentations sees that there is a negative effect which affects 
our industries or our businesses, it can act very quickly by 
changing those respective regulations. I think that is a good 
addendum to this bill.
<P>
	If we take these points into consideration I believe we will be 
upholding Canada's trading interests, a goal that we certainly 
want to strive for. I encourage Parliament to support the bill and 
proceed with it as quickly as possible.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will cover 
five points in my remarks. To help my colleagues follow, here is 
the plan. I will start with underdevelopment and the poverty gap. 
I will then set Bill C-5 in context. I will talk about Canadian 
official development assistance. I will reiterate the Bloc 
Quebecois position as stated by my colleague and, finally, I will 
describe a certain number of concerns.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1545"> 1545 </A></B>
<P>
	Out of a world population of five billion, four billion people 
are living in developing countries, one billion of whom in total 
deprivation.
<P>
	The United Nations has reported that the gap between have 
nations and have-not nations has doubled over the past 30 years. 
The economic growth rate of developing countries has been 
dropping steadily, particularly in Africa and Latin America. In 
the Bruntland report, the World Commission on Environment 
and Development stated, and I quote: ``Deteriorating terms of 
trade, rising debt-service obligations, stagnating flows of aid, 
and growing protectionism in the developed market economies 
caused severe external payment problems. The increased cost of 
foreign borrowing, at a time when exports were depressed, also 
helped to plunge many developing countries into debt crises. 
Growth was cut back and many social objectives fell by the 
wayside, including those having to do with employment, health, 
education, environment, and human settlements''.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The United Nations development program authorities 
estimate that protectionism in industrialized countries will 
deprive the South of $500 billion a year in export income, or ten 
times more than it receives annually in development assistance. 
At the same time, due to structural adjustment programs 
imposed on them, developing countries are forced to abandon 
any form of tariff protection and what not.
<P>
	This means there can be no sustainable development without 
fair and equitable reform and restructuring of international 
financial, trading and policy systems. Less trade protectionism 
on the part of industrialized countries would be a first step in a 
true financial reform.
<P>
	Just recently, we have heard the president of the GATT 
general assembly warn industrialized countries against 
reintroducing protectionism on the basis of preserving human 
rights and the environment.
<P>
	In that context, industrialized countries have taken steps in 
the seventies, with the general preferential tariff, to promote a 
reduction of duties for developing countries. In 1974, Canada 
established the GPT under the Customs Tariff Act. Since then, 
the tariff has been extended every ten years.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to support the economic growth of 
developing countries by promoting exports from these countries 
to Canada through tariff reduction.
<P>
	The general preferential tariff is beneficial in many other 
ways as well. First of all, the GPT is a unilateral tariff reduction 
program, and Canada remains free to change tariff preferences 
without breaking any commitment under the GATT agreement.
<P>
	The Canadian GPT would be one of the best in the world as it 
would not be used to put financial or political pressure on 
developing countries, as is the case in other countries.
<P>
	Canada also made sure that imports under the GPT caused no 
injury to domestic producers. That is why the GPT does not 
apply to all products imported from developing countries, but 
only to those products which do not adversely affect the 
competitiveness of Canadian producers. Also, safeguard 
measures have been developed to protect Canadian businesses 
affected by the importation of goods under the GPT. Two such 
safeguards are presently applied to rubber soles and inner tubes.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that, in 1992, gross imports under the 
GPT yielded approximately $90 million, or 5 per cent of Canada 
Customs' revenues.
<P>
	Bill C-5 extends the general preferential tariff for another ten 
years. The Bloc Quebecois supports this government bill with 
reservations, but we will get into that later.
<P>
	Canadian development assistance has been drying up for a 
few years. Difficult economic conditions in Canada have often 
been set forth to explain or justify this drying up. Budget cuts in 
official development assistance have reduced contributions to 
the assistance program to 0.4 per cent of the Canadian GDP.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	To put things in perspective, Norway spends 1.16 per cent of 
its GDP on international assistance, Denmark and Sweden 1.03 
per cent, the Netherlands 0.86 per cent, France 0.63 per cent, and 
Finland 0.62 per cent. In other words, although Canada is 
generous in absolute terms, it is not in the lead group and it is 
rather far from the internationally recognized standard of 0.7 
per cent.
<P>
	The reality is that, in the nineties, we almost gave up any 
measure which could have enabled us to reach that level. More 
recently, the April 1993 budget restricted to 1.5 per cent, as of 
1994-95, the budget increase for Canadian international 
assistance.
<P>
	A large part of Canadian development aid is provided through 
bilateral assistance and it covers more than 150 countries. 
Projects implemented are the subject of agreements between 
Canada and each beneficiary country. However, Canada also 
looks after its own interests, since 80 per cent of goods and 
services targeted for this bilateral aid come from our country. 
Tied aid, as it is called, has the effect of considerably reducing 
the value of the help provided to beneficiary countries.
<P>
	For all intents and purposes, bilateral aid is a disguised form 
of subsidy to Canadian exporters. This creates a danger in that 
profiteering could play havoc with the priorities of assistance 
programs, by giving too much importance to commercial 
interests.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1546"> 1546 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1993-94, bilateral aid is distributed in this fashion: Africa 
and the Middle East get 45 per cent, Asia 37 per cent, and Latin 
America 18 per cent. It must also be noted that this form of 
support represents 44 per cent of total Canadian aid to 
developing countries.
<P>
	In spite of some flaws, preferential customs tariffs are an 
important tool of Canadian development aid. In an increasingly 
global economy, foreign trade, and this is particularly true for 
Canada, plays a vital role in the creation and retention of jobs.
<P>
	It is precisely because Canada is free to classify developing 
countries, from the poorest to the most developed, that the GPT 
could be a flexible tool to direct aid to those who need it most.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois agrees that promoting export growth of 
developing countries is a very commendable objective. 
However, we do have some reservations.
<P>
	First, a large number of those countries which benefit the 
most from the GPT are newly industrialized countries, 
especially Brazil and the dragons and tigers of South-East Asia 
to which the hon. member referred. Those countries can no 
longer be considered as genuine third world nations. Yet, they 
are the main beneficiaries of that tariff.
<P>
	Moreover, importing certain products from these countries, 
such as auto parts, could adversely affect the setting up of 
manufacturing plants for those parts close to auto builders in 
Canada, to use the same example.
<P>
	Also, some countries like China and Indonesia, which largely 
benefit from preferential tariffs, are known for repeatedly 
violating human rights. If the Canadian government was 
consistent in the implementation of its foreign policy, it would 
have some reservations about favouring countries which do not 
respect human rights, as it does in the case of its development 
aid policy which, as you know, is conditional upon the respect of 
those basic rights.
<P>
	Since the general preferential tariff is designed to help the 
growth of developing countries without causing a prejudice to 
the Canadian and Quebec economies, we would be justified to 
ask, at this time, for a more in-depth study on countries and 
products benefitting from the GPT.
<P>
	This leads me to the classification of developing countries 
into newly industrialized countries. Does the government think 
that the general preferential tariff program still meets its 
objective, which is to promote the growth of developing 
countries, considering that some of the beneficiary countries 
have already reached high growth levels? And since newly 
industrialized countries are entitled to this tariff, does the hon. 
member think it is appropriate for the national treasury to forgo 
millions of dollars in annual revenues which is being not 
collected by customs services?
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	How to determine which countries no longer meet the criteria 
used to define developing countries is a complex issue. But we 
have to wonder if countries like South Korea, Taiwan, and others 
should still be entitled to a preferential treatment concerning 
customs duties.
<P>
	Since my colleague already mentioned it, I just want to 
remind the hon. members that the United States have already 
withdrawn the benefit of a number of preferential tariffs.
<P>
	It seems that the Canadian government wants to wait a little 
longer before taking a stand on this issue. However, it would be 
important for Canada to determine its position before the 1995 
meetings of the United Nations conference.
<P>
	In short, the Bloc Quebecois believes that we should reflect 
on the possibility of linking the general preferential tariff to 
some criterias, such as the industrialization level of the 
beneficiary, the human rights situation in that country, the 
alignment of its foreign policy with that of Canada, compliance 
with established rules of public international law, such as 
non-violence in its international relations and peaceful 
resolution of conflicts in which the beneficiary is involved.
<P>
	As you see, before extending the benefit of the general 
preferential tariff, Canada should take into account these 
principles which should influence our foreign policy. But 
Canada should also consider the restrictions of its trade policy. 
For example, withdrawing the benefit of the general preferential 
tariff from any product originating in China could jeopardize 
trade relations with this country or other countries. However, 
since development assistance should be provided to the people 
who most need it, the list of beneficiaries of the general 
preferential tariff should be revised.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes that such decisions should flow 
from consultations and discussions within the Canadian 
Parliamentary system, including the Standing Committee on 
External Affairs and International Trade.
<P>
	Unfortunately, under the Customs Tariff Act, the government 
is under no obligation to undertake such consultations. On the 
contrary, the government may, on the recommendation of the 
Minister of Finance, by order in council, amend the list of 
beneficiaries to the general preferential tariff without any 
consultation. We, in the Bloc Quebecois, think it is unfortunate 
that the House of Commons does not have any say in the matter.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois urges the government to undertake 
consultations with its Parliamentary partners, at least for the 
review of its position on the general preferential treatment 
before the 1995 meetings of the United Nations Commission on 
Trade and Development, as well as discussions on its general 
policy concerning the classification of countries.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the speech of my colleague from Louis-Hébert. 
First of all, I want to congratulate and to thank him. His speech 
was very interesting because his arguments confirmed those I 
developed in my own speech, arguments to the effect that the 
general preferential tariff can be profitable for developing 
countries.
<P>
	Of course, Canada considers this general preferential tariff to 
be part of its assistance program to developing countries. 
However, the question is this: Can this tariff have an adverse 
impact on the Canadian market? I said a moment ago, and the 
minister has made the same point before, that the government 
intends to consult Canadian manufacturers on their position so 
that they do not find themselves at a disadvantage because some 
products have easier access to the Canadian market thanks to the 
general preferential tariff.
<P>
	Of course, the general preferential tariff represents a plus, an 
important asset, for developing countries that would like to 
export their production overseas, particularly to Canada.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Here is my question: What are the advantages or 
disadvantages of this general preferential tariff for Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paré:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think that there are really any 
disadvantages, because under the customs tariff, products from 
developing countries against which Canadian products can 
compete are excluded from the general preferential tariff when 
imported into Canada.
<P>
	As for the advantages, I will say that since it is a well 
established fact that Canada often ties its development 
assistance to trade with developing countries, it is a major 
beneficiary of those imports. So, as I said, there are no real 
disadvantages because of the safeguards included in the 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate my learned colleague for his brilliant speech. He 
talked about reviewing the list of countries benefiting from 
general preferential tariffs and about developing countries, but 
he added that we should examine the issue of assistance given to 
countries which are not necessarily at the developing stage but 
where such assistance would have important commercial 
impacts and therefore could also impact on our future 
relationships with them.
<P>
	Could the member tell us what countries he had in mind by 
that? And since, according to what we saw this last month, the 
government seems ready to hold debate after debate, and 
yesterday was even prepared to create a special committee on 
national defence, would it not be appropriate to have that list of 
countries and the assistance given through preferential tariffs 
reviewed by a committee, be it a new one or an existing one, 
where members of all parties would meet and where they could  
also think of ways of increasing the assistance given to 
developing countries?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paré:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true the general preferential 
tariffs are applied to more than 150 countries, 180 to be exact. 
Evidently, these countries are not all at the same development 
stage. Some are at the first stage, others are more advanced. In 
fact, tariffs are adjusted according to three categories.
<P>
	Given that tariffs are renewed for ten-year periods, we should 
think about this gradation and try to determine if it still 
appropriate to classify certain countries as underdeveloped 
when in fact they have experienced dazzling growth, as some 
Asian countries have.
<P>
	We must keep in mind however that if we are to strike a 
country off the most advantageous list, we will have to do so 
with considerable tact and diplomacy because such a measure 
could have an impact on our commercial relationships with that 
country or other ones.
<P>
	I think it will be important to proceed in co-operation with the 
House, so the House should be aware of these data. Indeed, the 
House has a tool in the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade. I feel it would be quite in order that 
issues of such importance no longer be determined by order in 
council on a simple recommendation of the minister. In keeping 
with the spirit of the red book, the government should allow all 
members of the government and of the opposition to participate 
in the review of these questions which could affect the very 
image of Canada.

	The minister responsible for Canada Post and the Prime 
Minister and indeed all of cabinet deserve our praise. I am sure 
all rural Canadians are grateful.
<P>
	Now let us turn to the next postal issue. Let us all join together 
to convince Canada Post to stop harassing rural mail contractors 
and to provide rural mail contractors with some kind of dignity, 
the kind of dignity they had in their employment under previous 
Liberal governments.

	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
welcome the announcement made yesterday in Brussels by the 
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization that a moratorium on 
cod fishing in international waters off Newfoundland will take 
place immediately.
<P>
	This ban was called for by our party during the last election 
and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has worked hard for its 
implementation.
<P>
	As a member from Atlantic Canada where so many fishermen 
and the fishery itself are affected by foreign overfishing, this 
moratorium is welcome news. A small ray of hope now 
glimmers at the end of the tunnel for the fishery off the east 
coast.
<P>
	I appreciate as well that the Canadian proposal to extend until 
the end of 1994 the pilot on board program that places observers 
on vessels to ensure the moratorium is maintained has been 
implemented. The minister should be complimented for his 
efforts.
<P>
	However we must continue to be vigilant in everything we do 
nationally and internationally to ensure that the Atlantic cod 
fishery survives to be a viable economic industry in the future.

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am concerned 
about yesterday's refusal by the Reform Party House leader to 
allow a ministerial statement in the House.
<P>
	Private members fought long and hard against Brian 
Mulroney's policy of ignoring this Chamber. He broke the 
longstanding tradition of making government announcements in 
the Chamber. Instead he and his ministers made statements to 
the press, often off the Hill, which members would read about 
afterward.
<P>
	If this Chamber is ever going to get back its ancient role of 
being able to control and contain government spending, it must 
reclaim the right to hear all ministerial announcements that 
affect spending. Forcing ministers out of the House, as the hon. 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster-

would refrain from attacking other members personally.
<P>
	The generally accepted rule of the House has been that we 
have allowed a certain leeway on attacking party policy. But I 
would encourage hon. members to refrain from attacking each 
other personally or from imputing any kind of motive.
<P>
	If hon. members could consider that as a guideline it would be 
very much appreciated.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="KANESATAKERESERVE">KANESATAKE RESERVE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. The 
Mohawk leader of Kanesatake, Jerry Peltier, said yesterday that 
he had the government's assurance that there would be no police 
or military intervention on that territory to end the criminal 
activities of certain individuals who are terrorizing the 
population. The situation has become so serious that the chief 
editorialist of <I>La Presse</I>, Alain Dubuc believes that tough action 
from the police and, if necessary, from the armed forces has 
become inevitable.
<P>
	Is it true that the government has formally assured the chief of 
the Mohawk communities that there would be no intervention 
from the police or from the army to end the smuggling once and 
for all?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, absolutely not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is always curious to see the reactions following 
meetings between Mohawk leaders and the government; there 
are always at least two versions. At least two.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether she considers 
acceptable what a Mohawk spokesman from Akwesasne said 
when he threatened armed reprisals for any police intervention 
to end smuggling activities.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I consider these comments 
as repugnant as the comments of the Leader of the Opposition 
yesterday when he compared the situation in Bosnia to the 
tobacco problem here in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> That is not 
what the Leader of the Opposition said, and she knows that 
perfectly. I know that she is aware of repugnant statements, she 
is quite familiar with them.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Can she 
confirm the statements of the spokesman for the Mohawk 
community of Akwesasne, Mr. Russell Roundpoint, who said 
that many smugglers have AK-47 and AK-15 machine guns 
which they have admitted using to protect their cargoes of illicit 
goods in the Akwesasne-Cornwall corridor?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1552"> 1552 </A></B>
<P>
	This government wanted names. Russell Roundpoint made 
those statements. That is one name. What does the Deputy 
Prime Minister think?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member wants to quote 
people and now he says that the quote of the Leader of the 
Opposition is not true.
<P>
	I want to emphasize again that the Government of Canada 
does not agree with statements like this one the Leader of the 
Opposition: ``We are courageous enough to maintain peace in 
Bosnia, but when we have a problem here, we cannot solve it. 
Come on, it makes no sense. There is something wrong with 
that. International opinion will have to realize that we have an 
obligation to preserve our own societies''.
<P>
	How dare he compare the situation in Bosnia with a situation 
here, where the sale of contraband cigarettes has dropped 
dramatically in a week! Why is the Leader of the Opposition not 
here to applaud us?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
easy to see that the Deputy Prime Minister does not understand 
the difference between intervention and situation.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister would 
have the general public believe that the Bloc Quebecois is trying 
to tarnish the Mohawks' reputation. Everyone, including every 
person involved in this, knows and recognizes that illicit 
smuggling activities on Mohawk reserves can be blamed on a 
handful of armed individuals who are imposing a reign of terror.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Does she 
recognize that smuggling on reserves is done by a small number 
of individuals whose activities threaten the safety of the 
Mohawk people and the surrounding communities?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, members of the opposition 
continue to claim they have no hidden agenda here, yet since 
Monday, according to <I>La Presse</I>, 22 questions to the government 
have been on this topic.
<P>
	The problem of cocaine did not begin this week. The problem 
of cocaine is not exclusive to Indian reserves across the country. 
The problem of illegal drug abuse has existed for many years, 
including the years that the Leader of the Opposition was sitting 
in Brian Mulroney's cabinet.
<P>
	If the member would like to point the finger at Indian reserves 
and suggest there is a cocaine problem exclusive to them, let 
him go outside and say that. The reality is that the contraband 
cigarettes, the drugs, the other issues, are problems of organized 
crime which are as prevalent in the cities of Hamilton, Toronto 
and Montreal as they are in Kanesatake and Akwesasne.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are well aware that the RCMP itself has declared that the 
territory is a hub. The supplementary question I want to ask the 
Deputy Prime Minister is this: The Mohawk leaders' alarmist 
declarations have raised the already high level of tension on the 
reserves. Is it not the Prime Minister's duty to meet with the 
Mohawk leaders to demand that they promise to co-operate with 
the government to end smuggling and to ensure respect for the 
law on their territory like everywhere else in Canada, as the 
government claims?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, if there is one group 
responsible for feeding the crisis, it is the opposition.
<P>
	Just last week, a member of the Bloc visited the reserves, 
supposedly for a door-to-door survey. ``Do you own weapons? 
Do you buy contraband goods?'' Just imagine, Mr. Speaker, 
what would the reaction of Quebecers and Canadians be if 
members of Parliament went knocking on their constituents' 
doors to ask them about their illegal activities at home. Is that 
what Bloc members mean by democracy? I do not think so.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEBUDGET">THE BUDGET</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister and deals with the 
fiscal reality facing the House.
<P>
	Yesterday the Government of Saskatchewan brought down a 
provincial budget with no tax increases and a 33 per cent 
reduction in its deficit figure. Yesterday the Quebec premier 
said that his next budget will feature deficit reduction and a 
possible tax cut.
<P>
	Can the Deputy Prime Minister tell the House the extent to 
which federal deficit fighting measures are being co-ordinated 
with those of the provinces and whether the federal government 
is leading or following?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the leader of the Reform 
Party will have his answer in four days and I know he will be 
very happy with it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what I am asking is something that is relatively straightforward. 
I asked whether the federal government was co-ordinating its 
activities with the provinces, the answer to which is not 
dependent at all on the budget being brought down.
<P>
	My supplementary question is this. All three levels of 
government raise their revenues from the same taxpayer, yet no 
government budget in the country to date explicitly 
acknowledges the total tax load carried by Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1553"> 1553 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the federal government believe that total tax load must 
be taken into account in making any changes to federal taxes? 
Will it ensure that background information on total tax load is 
included with its budget presentation next week?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, many provinces have more 
than three levels of government. There are four levels of 
government and obviously this government is very cognizant 
that there is only one taxpayer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we can see why the Deputy Prime Minister is not Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> My third question is this. As the Deputy Prime 
Minister knows, Canadian business, capital and jobs have been 
leaving the country in recent years, citing high tax loads as one 
of the principal reasons for leaving.
<P>
	Does the federal government believe that Canada has room to 
further increase the total tax load carried by Canadians without 
driving more businesses, more capital and more jobs out of the 
country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister and the 
government believe that any government policy on finance has 
to be two track. It has to relate to taxes and jobs.
<P>
	We did not make the kinds of promises that were made by the 
leader of the third party in the last election and that may be why 
he is the leader of the third party.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LIQUORSMUGGLING">LIQUOR SMUGGLING</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
talk about another contraband product.
<P>
	It appears that losses related to smuggling of liquor might be 
more important than first thought. According to the Association 
of Canadian Distillers, this illegal activity results in a loss of 
$1.2 billion in uncollected taxes. In Quebec, liquor smuggling 
has increased 35 per cent and now affects 1.7 million cases of 
liquor, and 2.2 million cases are smuggled into Ontario each 
year.
<P>
	Will the Minister of National Revenue order an internal 
inquiry, following allegations to the effect that some senior 
customs officials are involved in liquor smuggling?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the claim that there are customs officers accepting 
bribes is one we take extremely seriously.
<P>
	The Solicitor General and myself announced yesterday that 
the RCMP would carry out an investigation of these allegations. 
That is all they are: allegations.
<P>
	I would point out to the hon. member that the document in the 
program which indicated this was taking place was dated prior 
to the last election. It may be that this program is dealing with 
very dated news. I cannot tell. The information is not there for us 
to know at what time this program was made and who was 
speaking.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I would again point out that the allegation was not in fact 
made by the CBC but was made by another individual who 
claims to be a smuggler and a thief. To rely upon this person's 
statement with respect to customs officers is perhaps the wrong 
thing to do until an inquiry has been held.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
considering the scope of the problem, will the minister consider 
a concerted effort with the provinces to curb the spread of this 
illegal activity?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yes, the hon. member can rest assured that we are in 
fact in touch with our provincial counterparts on the issue of the 
anti-smuggling campaign. May I remind him that the measures 
taken last week by the Prime Minister, the Solicitor General and 
other members of the government were not designed only with 
cigarettes in mind.
<P>
	We believe the reduction in tax on cigarettes is an important 
element of a strategy with many parts. Certainly the campaign is 
against smuggling which includes liquor, illegal arms, 
pornography, illegal aliens and kidnapped children.
<P>
	We will continue to maintain the closest links with the 
provinces to make sure that the interdiction activities of Canada 
Customs are as effective as they possibly can be.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister in the absence of the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	In recent days our Prime Minister-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Earlier in the Question Period there was 
reference to members either being here or not being here. It is 
the accepted practice of the House that we do not make mention 
of whether or not members are here for the simple reason that all 
of us are called away for various reasons.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1554"> 1554 </A></B>
<P>
	If hon. members would refrain from mentioning anything like 
this it would be appreciated.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad you are here. My question 
to the Deputy Prime Minister has to do with the fact that our 
Prime Minister has gone on and on recently about the need for 
members to use their judgment. Yet the last time this House 
voted on the question of physician assisted suicide back in 
March 1993 the Prime Minister, then leader of the opposition, 
failed to show up to cast his vote.
<P>
	Canadians are wondering when the Prime Minister-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know the hon. member will want to rephrase 
her question just a bit and she will be putting the question.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, if for some reason some member of 
the House chose not to vote on that sensitive issue, whom would 
he or she be representing: the party position, his or her personal 
judgment or conscience, or the wishes of his or her constituents?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair is having a bit of difficulty in the 
sense that this question, which was put at another time, does not 
refer directly to the administrative responsibility of the 
government.
<P>
	However, I guess in a general sense all hon. members are 
responsible for voting the way they wish. If the Deputy Prime 
Minister chooses she may answer.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, to refer to the comments 
made by the Prime Minister, the point the Prime Minister was 
trying to make was that in any decision of government we reflect 
on the views of our constituents, on the position of our party, on 
the knowledge we have garnered from listening to input, and 
ultimately we have to make our own decision.
<P>
	I think the member is treading on very dangerous ground 
when she is suggesting that we should be mere voting machines. 
The member will remember that the leader of her own party who 
took a very strong position against the Charlottetown accord 
was not supported by his constituents. They in fact voted in 
favour of the Charlottetown accord, yet he continued to 
campaign against it.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister can try to legitimize this mandate 
all she wants, but the fact remains that not a single word was 
campaigned on about physician assisted suicide, specifically in 
the Liberal red book.
<P>
	In the absence of a national referendum what guarantee could 
the Deputy Prime Minister give that government members will 
effectively represent their constituents' views on this issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has 
made it very clear it is the view of the Liberal Party and of 
Liberal members of Parliament that they are sent to Parliament 
to exercise their judgment; they are not voting machines.
<P>
	If we are to be reduced to mere voting machines in this age of 
technology, it seems to me we might as well abolish the House of 
Commons and just put the buttons in everybody's homes so they 
can vote immediately.
<P>
	The reason we have members of Parliament is so that we can 
come to this place, engage in a vigorous and informed debate, 
and ultimately exercise our judgment in our votes as members of 
the House of Commons.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CODFISHING">COD FISHING</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. The Northwest 
Atlantic Fisheries Organization, NAFO, agreed yesterday to put 
in place a one-year moratorium on cod fishing in the southern 
region of the Grand Banks off the coast of Newfoundland. 
Earlier, I heard my colleague say how delighted he was about it.
<P>
	Could the government explain why members of NAFO have 
settled for a one-year moratorium, while Canada was stressing 
the need for a three-year moratorium in order to rebuild cod 
stocks?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the absence of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
who until very recently was in Brussels-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member is taking away my thunder.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> On behalf of a Canadian representative who 
has recently been in Brussels may I say to the hon. member that 
the success of the negotiations on NAFO with respect to cod is a 
tremendous achievement for the minister and the Canadian 
government.
<P>
	I would point out that we have had almost no movement with 
respect to the members of NAFO on this issue for many years 
despite previous ministers of fisheries adopting a heckling, 
blustering tone which our minister of fisheries has failed to 
adopt. The diplomatic approach has succeeded.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1555"> 1555 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to say that we had a vote. It was not a unanimous 
vote but it was an excellent vote. There were three abstentions 
and I believe eight votes in favour. We now have the beginning 
of an agreement.
<P>
	It would be unfortunate if we attempted at this point to ask for 
too much. We have the start of an international agreement. It is 
the very first time we have had this. I think hon. members on 
both sides of the House will agree that if we try for too much at 
this stage we may indeed lose again. The appropriate, 
diplomatic and low key approach of the minister of fisheries has 
been enormously successful. I would like to applaud his success.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
understand the answer the minister just gave us. However, will 
the Deputy Prime Minister, the minister or God knows who from 
the other side of the House, acknowledge the fact that this 
moratorium will have a limited scope, since Norway and the 
European Union have refused to support the moratorium other 
members of NAFO have agreed upon?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is true there were three abstentions, but we believe 
even when nations abstained in the past they did not necessarily 
go against the majority decision of NAFO.
<P>
	We hope and trust that in this case we will have the same 
experience and we will find that in fact the moratorium is 
successful. After all, this is the very first time many of these 
members of NAFO have agreed there is a fundamental 
conservation issue on those two areas to the Grand Banks.
<P>
	That is an enormous step forward in the negotiations we have 
had with the Europeans on this issue.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is also for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	The government recently introduced changes to the standing 
orders to make the work of parliamentary standing committees 
more meaningful. Reform members have heard that the 
government has a plan to prevent Reform MPs from receiving 
any vice-chairs on these committees.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	What precisely is the plan that the government members are 
supposed to follow? Is this type of arm twisting really 
compatible with the freedom of members in committee as 
promised in the speech from the throne and in recent 
amendments to the standing orders?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the whole premise of the 
member's question is false. In fact the government does not 
change the standing orders. They are changed by the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my supplementary question is also for the minister.
<P>
	Would the minister then be willing to send a memo to all 
government backbenchers advising them that they are free to 
vote in committee using their judgment which the Prime 
Minister-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Again the Chair is having a bit of difficulty 
with the formulation of the question. Perhaps I might suggest, if 
the question could be put in more general terms the member 
could get the information he is seeking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, regarding this business of the 
House, the Prime Minister declared he had placed much 
confidence in the judgment of his members rather than them 
being mere voting machines.
<P>
	Therefore, would the minister respond on behalf of the 
government that it will give its backbenchers freedom to vote 
and act in committee using that judgment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my understanding that the House itself cannot discuss 
matters that go on within committees. However, in order to be 
helpful to the hon. member, if he would like to raise this matter 
with me at one of our House leaders meetings, we will see what 
we can do to come up with a reasonable response.
<P>
	It is certainly not the desire of the government to prevent 
members from doing their jobs. I regret the hon. member has

great concern to Montreal.
<P>
	Several times in the past Liberal critics have asked for 
changes in the POWA program. This income support program

Montreal, because one of the criteria provides that 100 workers

like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to support it, since she 
made the suggestion herself. In fact, I see this as a sign that the 
government is willing to support this initiative.

	I would also like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister for 
assurances that when the next budget is brought down on

discrimination.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

Labour Code affects the employees of about 10 per cent of the 
companies across this country.
<P>
	I suggest that before the Bloc Quebecois goes ahead with this 
bill, it would be a good idea to check with the Quebec 
government and make sure there is no conflict between federal 
and provincial legislation. I assume he will do so before tabling 
his bill. Once that is done, his bill will be considered.

	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	A vibrant aerospace industry exists in my riding of Winnipeg 
St. James. Companies such as Bristol, Standard Aero, Boeing 
and Paramax have benefited a lot from government and private 
contracts. However, the industry suffered setbacks when, a few 
years back, the CF-18 contract was not awarded to Bristol and 
more recently with the cancellation of the EH-101 helicopter 
contract.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Can the minister inform the House what his department is 
planning to do to maintain a strong aerospace industry in my 
riding of Winnipeg St. James and in fact in the whole city of 
Winnipeg?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all let me say that we agree that the strength and the 
health of the Canadian aerospace industry are of vital 
importance. This is a niche in which Canada has been very 
successful. In terms of sales, our aerospace industry is fifth in 
the world.
<P>
	I am very well aware, as the member has made me aware, of 
the fact that there are a number of companies that are very 
important in the aerospace sector in the Winnipeg region. 
Bristol Aerospace is expected to win a very large contract very 
shortly from the U.S. government. Boeing expects to play an 
important role in the 737-X program.
<P>
	The fundamental means of providing support to the aerospace 
industry, apart from the general policy framework that we have, 
is the defence industry's productivity program. That will be the 
cornerstone as promised in the red book of our defence 
conversion initiatives. We expect that we can continue to use 
that program as a very vital tool-most of its contributions are 
repayable-to ensure that the Canadian aerospace industry in 
Winnipeg and in the rest of Canada continues to be very 
competitive in the world.

	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	At present the United States standards for blood collection 
exceed those of Canada. The Canadian Red Cross recently 
decided to meet the U.S. standards so that Canadian blood can 
continue to be sent to American blood plasma extraction 
facilities.
<P>
	Will the minister commit to raising Canadian blood collection 
standards to meet those of the United States?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me assure the hon. member that our standards for blood 
collection are certainly not inferior to those of the U.S.
<P>
	Our standards are different and in some instances they may 
even be superior because basically we are dealing with very 
different blood collection systems. In the U.S. it is a fee and for 
profit type of system whereas ours is a voluntary system.
<P>
	I believe we will continue to make sure that our blood 
collection systems are extremely safe.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
statements have been recently made to the Krever commission 
indicating that the Canadian Red Cross centres are supposed to 
be inspected every two years, but in fact have not been inspected 
for at least five.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the Minister of the Environment. Yesterday, the 
International Joint Commission presented its biannual report on 
the water quality of the Great Lakes. It lists a series of 
catastrophic consequences for human health. Birth defects in 
newborns, lower sperm count, an increased incidence of breast 
cancer, and a decreased learning capacity among school age 
children are all cases in point.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	In view of this report, does the government intend to ban the 
dumping of chlorine in the Great Lakes by Canadian industries?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, I wonder whether my hon. 
colleague had a chance to read the report which says, on page 
seven I think, that the use of chlorine should not be banned until 
the economic impact of such a decision is examined. If he wants, 
I can send him a copy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
same commission has been making roughly the same kind of 
recommendations since 1978.
<P>
	Why is it that the minister refuses to commit herself to 
following through with the recommendations of a commission 
which provides for Quebec's participation in the agreement on 
the Great Lakes water quality, while her own department 
acknowledges that 40 per cent of the toxic load of the St. 
Lawrence River originates in the Great Lakes?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to 
point out that in the 100 days that we have been in office we have 
begun a process to abolish a number of toxins. I think it is 
important to point out that this is not the first report of the IJC. 
In fact, I personally made a presentation to the IJC several years 
ago dealing with the issues specifically of prenatal problems and 
the problems of breast cancer.
<P>
	I think it is significant that this particular report is receiving a 
tremendous amount of attention because it is the first time that 
there is a relationship between the toxins and the problem of 
spermatozoa. We have known for many years that there are some 
serious problems.
<P>
	The report also points out that the level of toxicity took 50 
years to achieve. The report further underlines that there is no 
immediate call by the IJC for a ban on chlorine. In fact, the IJC 
report is very specific that any eventual chlorine ban should only 
be precipitated by a serious study of the effect on the basin of the 
Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.
<P>
	We are prepared to table within the next four to six months a 
list of timetables and schedules for the sunsetting of all problem 
chemicals including the possibility of sunsetting 
organo-chlorines.

of 23 first-degree killers who were paroled and then went on to 
kill 32 more people while on parole. This list is certainly not all 
the examples but it is a sample of the last five to six years that I 
know of.
<P>
	Will the minister agree that our present parole system and 
parole board is incompetent and that automatic parole should be 
stopped until this incompetence is addressed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has raised an important concern. I do not think 
there is automatic parole. In any event, it is the intention of this 
government to have the parole system operate in a way that puts 
security of the public as a major priority.
<P>
	I would be happy to have the hon. member's research to see if 
it will help us to achieve our Liberal government objective.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> A supplementary, Mr.

stringent criteria that checks the qualifications of such a board?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

it is the intention of this government that appointments to the

agricultural production.
<P>
	The question of country of origin labelling is a subject that I 
am very interested in pursuing. I thank the hon. member for 
raising the issue.

	The issue has implications of course for the private sector and 
for the provinces. It also has certain trade implications in terms 
of our obligations with respect to the new GATT and GATT

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. The 
Junior Bar Association of Montreal is calling on the Canadian 
government to amend the Criminal Code so as to criminalize 
acts of pedophilia committed abroad by Canadian nationals. 
Certain European countries have recently moved to criminalize 
acts of pedophilia committed abroad.
<P>
	My question is as follows: Does the government intend to 
follow up on the request from the Junior Bar Association of 
Montreal to criminalize acts of pedophilia committed abroad by 
Canadians and if so, will the Deputy Prime Minister undertake 
to table a bill on this matter before the House rises in June?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, of course we take this 
request from the Junior Bar Association of Montreal very 
seriously. Pedophilia is repugnant, regardless of where it 
happens. If Canadian tourists are travelling abroad to take 
advantage of pedophile networks, as is the case in certain 
countries, then clearly the Minister of Justice will be looking 
into the matter raised by the hon. member. I can already tell her 
that the Liberal caucus has brought this matter to the minister's  
attention and I am confident that he will deal with it as soon as 
possible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre):</B> Mr.

best to ensure that appropriate draft legislation is indeed tabled.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I would like to ask a supplementary question. 
Can the Deputy Prime Minister give us her assurance that this 
bill will contain provisions to deal with those who organize what 
are commonly referred to as sex tours?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the Minister of 
Justice is already aware of these very difficult and repugnant 
issues. I am confident that once he has considered what steps the 
Canadian government can take to prevent the growth of this kind 
of tourism-and I hesitate even to call this tourism because it 
involves disgusting acts-the Minister of Justice will do his 
utmost to ensure that these kinds of things do not happen here in 
Canada or anywhere else in the world.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	On February 16, 1994, BCTV News carried an interview with 
the Hartwick family of Surrey, B.C. Bonnie Hartwick wants her 
son, Mike, charged with auto theft after being caught driving a 
stolen vehicle. Mike is apparently part of a juvenile car theft 
ring that has stolen more than 100 cars in the last four months. 
The authorities could not oblige Mike's mother, Bonnie, 
because Mike is only 10 years old.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister this: Will this government 
lower the age limits of the Young Offenders Act to make young 
offenders accountable for their criminal activity?

	During the interview, 10-year old Mike stated that he was

this behaviour and attitude is in the best interests of either 
society or young Mike?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

the attitude the hon. member referred to is certainly troubling.

launched in 1987 created a comprehensive co-ordinated effort 
to reduce the harm caused by alcohol and other drugs to 
individuals, families and communities.
<P>
	The harm caused by substance abuse includes, among other 
things, sickness, death, social misery, crime, violence and 
economic cost to all levels of government.
<P>
	My department plays a leading role in Canada's drug strategy 
but we have many partners who co-operate in its 
implementation. These partners include other federal 
departments, the provinces, businesses, law enforcement 
agencies, labour and professional and volunteer organizations.
<P>
	The strategy responds to four areas of need: prevention; 
treatment and rehabilitation; information and research; and 
enforcement and control.
<P>
	As each member of this House is only too aware, drug abuse 
and the untold suffering it causes knows no geography, no 
socio-economic class, no social graces. I would think that every 
one of us has met constituents who have experienced the anguish 
of a son or a daughter, a sister or a brother, a friend or a 
neighbour consumed by the ravages of drug addiction.
<P>
	The problem is widespread. According to a United Nations 
survey, trade in illegal drugs is second only to world trade in 
arms. Such is the clout of the global industry that we are up 
against in our efforts to control drug abuse in Canada.
<P>
	Recent statistics reveal that within a single year almost 15 per 
cent of young Canadians ages 15 to 19 have admitted to using 
cannabis.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, the incidence of drug abuse rises considerably 
among teenagers and young adults who are school drop-outs, 
unemployed or homeless. Further evidence shows that over a 
one year period 2 per cent of Canadians claim to have used 
cocaine.
<P>
	These are formidable figures. What do they mean? Just what 
is their significance? They mean heartache; they mean 
suffering. They mean a toll of crippling misery being exacted on 
those caught in that seamless web called addiction. The real 
importance of these figures goes well beyond their statistical 
relevance. They translate into many millions of dollars spent on 
health care, family welfare, unemployment benefits and 
disability pensions.
<P>
	As a further response to this ongoing challenge, the 
government announced two years ago its renewed commitment 
to Canada's drug strategy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On March 31, 1992, Canada's drug strategy was allocated 
$270 million over a five year period. Seventy per cent of these 
funds are directed to reducing demand for drugs through 
prevention, education and treatment programs. This new bill is 
one element of the other 30 per cent that is dedicated to law 
enforcement.
<P>
	The bill now before us, along with the Proceeds of Crime 
legislation passed by this House in 1989, are fully consistent 
with the strategy's objectives relating to enforcement and 
control.
<P>
	It takes direct aim at those who seek to profit from exploiting 
the young and the vulnerable. The bill is intended to consolidate, 
modernize, enhance and streamline the government's drug 
control policy underlying two current Acts of Parliament; and to 
fulfil Canada's obligations under three international 
conventions.
<P>
	In 1961, the government of the day enacted the Narcotic 
Control Act. In 1961 and 1969, Parliament passed Parts III and 
IV in essence, much of our existing legislative framework is 
now more than 30 years old.
<P>
	Furthermore, as signatory to three international agreements 
on the illegal drug trade, Canada is obligated to the terms of the 
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, the Convention 
on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 and the United Nations 
Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychoactive Substances of 1988.
<P>
	Consequently, the controlled drugs and substances bill is 
designed to achieve three prime objectives: to provide the 
government with the flexibility required to better control the 
import, production, export, distribution and use of controlled 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1562"> 1562 </A></B>
<P>
substances; to provide the mechanisms needed to implement our 
obligations under international agreements-this relates to the 
restricted production or  trade of internationally regulated 
substances destined for medical, scientific and/or industrial 
purposes-and to enhance the ability of the police and the courts 
to enforce our laws. The bill actually provides for the seizure 
and forfeiture of property used in offences involving controlled 
substances.
<P>
	The existing Narcotic Control Act and the Food and Drugs Act 
do not deal effectively with emerging trends in drug abuse. 
These trends point to the increasing availability of new illicit or 
new designer drugs which, under current law, can escape 
effective control.
<P>
	Under the aegis of the drug strategy, the government remains 
committed to a working partnership whose ``raison d'être'' is 
the reduction of drug abuse in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The controlled drugs and substances bill is an integral part of 
the strategy. It consolidates, modernizes, enhances and 
streamlines drug abuse provisions contained in the two current 
laws. Simply put, it builds on the government's current policy 
on drug abuse.
<P>
	Those who profit from this are undeniably resourceful, 
determined and cunning. Their methods, their tactics and their 
products are forever undergoing change. We need flexible 
legislation which allows those on the front lines of enforcement 
to adapt quickly to these new developments as they occur.
<P>
	For example, one of the more recent developments in the drug 
underworld is the production and illicit sale of so-called 
designer drugs and look alike drugs. Designer drugs are potent 
substances with slightly different chemical structures than 
substances presently controlled by the Food and Drugs Act and 
the Narcotic Control Act, substances like stimulants, 
tranquillizers and pain killers. These drugs affect abusers in 
similar ways and can lead to the same health and social problems 
produced by more conventional drugs.
<P>
	Look alike drugs, on the other hand, are substances made to 
resemble illegal drugs. The manufacturers of these malicious 
offerings can mimic the more powerful drugs. Much harm can 
result from the abuse of these drugs and primary targets of these 
merchants of misery are often school-age children.
<P>
	The manufacture and sale of designer drugs and look alike 
drugs can be a very profitable business. Sadly, it is a business 
with terrible consequences for hundreds of thousands of 
customers, many of them young people.
<P>
	Under the current Food and Drugs Act and the Narcotic 
Control Act, drugs must first be listed on a schedule to the act. 
This regulates the conditions for the sale of that particular 
substance in Canada. Only once a given substance is listed can it 
become an offence to sell it. To correct this deficiency the 
controlled drugs and substances bill proposes interpretive 
clauses to include these substances.
<P>
	Under this proposed act, new illicit drugs appearing on the 
street which fit this description will be covered automatically.
<P>
	The bill also permits the control of precursors. Precursors are 
chemical substances used to produce controlled substances. 
New provisions contained in this bill will enable authorities to 
regulate the import and export of these substances.
<P>
	Other sources of drugs sold on the street are substances 
intended for medical or scientific use. They may be stolen from 
a hospital, obtained through illegal prescriptions, secured by 
obtaining numerous prescriptions from different doctors for the 
same ailment, or via a forged prescription. People who deal in 
diverted pharmaceutical drugs are collecting very large profits.
<P>
	The bill enhances present controls that deal with this issue. 
Under this bill the monitoring of the distribution of drugs will 
continue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To ensure compliance with the law and prevent diversion, 
inspectors, in close co-operation with law enforcement 
authorities would continue to visit pharmacies, hospitals, 
licensed dealers, dispensing practitioners, researchers and 
laboratory analysts.
<P>
	We know there exists a criminal element which is using more 
and more sophisticated networks to illegally produce, sell, 
export or import controlled substances in Canada.
<P>
	These people buy property and consumer goods to further 
their criminal activities and bolster their personal wealth.
<P>
	As I see it, such people should be prevented from retaining 
illegally obtained capital and goods.
<P>
	The bill before us today, together with the proceeds of crime 
legislation, strikes at the heart of criminal enterprise.
<P>
	Together, these enactments will enable the courts to strip 
criminals of profits and property illegally amassed through drug 
dealing.
<P>
	Trends in illegal production, distribution and use of 
controlled substances change frequently and quickly.
<P>
	This bill is designed to deal with current problems and to 
anticipate future needs. There is no doubt that there is a very real 
problem of drug abuse in Canada.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="1563"> 1563 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	It causes death, injury and illness; leads to lost productivity in 
the workplace; is a burden on our health care system; and, 
increasingly, puts a strain on our courts and police forces.
<P>
	In spite of these glaring facts, some people still doubt that 
drug abuse is a real concern for the majority of Canadians. They 
imagine that it is a local problem, affecting relatively few 
teenagers, primarily among low-income groups in large cities. 
It is true that it is not possible to measure accurately the full 
scope of drug abuse in Canada.
<P>
	What the statistics fail to show are the personal and social 
costs-in a word the real costs. We can only guess what the real 
costs of abuse are: the loss of the potentiel achievements of our 
youth; the crippling of promising professional careers; the 
painful destruction of homes and families; the costly disruption 
of productive communities. These are the disturbing facts of life 
in virtually every corner of the nation.
<P>
	Fifteen per cent of teenagers using cannabis. The total number 
of Canadians using cocaine-500,000 persons. These facts, as 
unsettling as they are, deserve our attention. They deserve our 
attention as legislators.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	More important, they deserve our attention as parents, family, 
friends, colleagues and neighbours to those in need, for nobody 
is immune. I believe the bill proposes a significant 
strengthening of our current legislative framework.
<P>
	At the present time three levels of government spend millions 
of dollars each year on drug law enforcement. In spite of these 
enormous expenditures, the fact is that police forces and the 
courts are hampered by outdated provisions in the laws they 
seek to uphold.
<P>
	I welcome debate on the bill. While there are bound to be 
differences of opinion, I believe this bill merits, nonetheless, the 
support of members on all sides of the House. In bringing the 
bill forward I am asking on behalf of the crown that we as 
members of this place do our part to help equip the government 
with a new set of tools that will allow us to get on with the job at 
hand.
<P>
	It may well be that striving for a drug free society is an 
unrealistic if laudable goal. Given what is at stake I submit that 
Canadians expect us to act.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there have been some consultations between the parties and I 
think you will find unanimous consent for the following motion.
<P>
	I move that the sixth report of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs, presented to the House earlier this 
day, be concurred in.
<P>
	I want to say very briefly how much I appreciate the 
co-operation that has been shown on this very delicate issue on 
all sides of the House. This is concurrence in the report 
concerning prayers.
<P>
	I should note for the record that there was a question raised the 
other day by the hon. member for Saint John who is ill and 
unable to be here today. She has heard this prayer and agrees 
with it. I have consulted with many members on all sides of the 
House including the hon. member for Hamilton West in respect 
of this issue.
<P>
	I think there is agreement that this be adopted. I am pleased to 
move this motion for concurrence this afternoon and I thank all 
hon. members for their co-operation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> I rise on a point of order, 
Mr. Speaker. Are we now at the tabling of the motion imposing 
the new prayer upon us? The hon. member asked for unanimous 
consent; we would be happy to give it, provided that those who 
would want to say a few words about this new version of the 
prayer could do so.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if the Chair 
could ask for the assistance of the parliamentary secretary to the 
government House leader and of all members. Would there be 
unanimous consent for members to make interventions-and I 
would hope brief interventions-with regard to this motion? Is 
it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend the committee for 
having thought about a new prayer. It seems to me that the 
traditional one was old-fashioned and had to be updated, since 
nowadays members of this House practice different religions.
<P>
	However, I am surprised and I personally disagree with a 
specific part of the prayer, but as a member of my caucus, I will 
go along with the majority's wishes. What I disagree with is the 
reference to Her Most Gracious Majesty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1564"> 1564 </A></B>
<P>
	When I am sitting in the House, I am very surprised to see 
all the members from the other parties stand up and very loudly 
express their pride in being Canadian. Yet, as soon as there is 
a symbol that would reflect this pride in being Canadian, what 
do we do? We use the Queen of England. We do not say the 
government speech, but the throne speech. We do not have a 
typical Canadian signing a bill, we have royal assent. We 
always use the symbol of Great Britain. Are we a colonized 
people? Or are we an independent country? That is the problem 
that I have with this prayer.
<P>
	It is ironic that a member from the Bloc Quebecois would 
have to remind the others parties in the House that they are 
Canadian. They are not a colony of England, they are Canadian. 
In fact, all the symbols that they have as Canadians often come 
from the French reality.
<P>
	We have sung <I>Ô Canada</I> in French for one hundred years, 
while you were singing <I>God Save the Queen</I>. After a hundred 
years, you started to sing it too, in English, and you made it the 
national anthem. We asked for a flag for 50 years, but you 
preferred the red ensign. We wanted Canadian symbols, because 
we were of French descent.
<P>
	I am often told: You are more committed to the Quebec flag 
than to the Canadian flag. Of course I am, because ever since the 
1950s, we have identified with that flag, we did not have any 
other. Everywhere we looked we saw the British flag.
<P>
	I am surprised that at a time when you have the opportunity to 
declare yourself Canadian, at a time where you could choose a 
Canadian symbol for the prayer which starts the day in this 
House, you decide to beseech the Queen of England. I cannot 
understand-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> She is also the Queen of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Really? She is also the Queen of Canada, 
says my colleague. Of course, she is a symbol, a tradition, she is 
part of our history. Is it not high time that you adopt your own 
symbols, if you are truly Canadian, if you really want your own 
identity?
<P>
	Every time someone in the Bloc makes a reference to a 
sovereign Quebec or something like that, you rise and claim that 
you are Canadian. I am surprised.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to remind all 
members that they should address themselves to the Chair. 
When ``you'' is used in English, or ``vous'' in French, 
something may be lost.
<P>
	Would the hon. member for Richelieu like to conclude?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Speaking through 
the Chair is a fine Canadian tradition and I respect it with 
pleasure.
<P>
	I was about to conclude on the prayer issue and I did not make 
this remark in a aggressive way.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	It is just a thought. It is just something I have noted every day 
over the nine years I have been in this House. Each time you 
have the opportunity to adopt Canadian symbols, you fail to do 
so. The fact is that British symbols always come back, with 
words like royal assent, The Queen in the prayer, the throne 
speech, and so on.
<P>
	Of course, I agree that we have to modernize the prayer, but 
again I just wanted to conclude my remarks on this note.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have not prepared a speech but I served on the 
procedure and House affairs committee and was somewhat 
involved in this process. It is a very delicate issue that affects 
not only members in the House but all Canadians in a very deep 
and meaningful way.
<P>
	I commend all members of all parties involved in the 
discussion and the process. I know it is impossible to please 
everyone, but I find this prayer acknowledges an almighty God. 
I believe this was important to the members on the committee 
and I believe it will be acceptable to Canadians. It also reflects 
our system of government, the fact that we are functioning in a 
parliamentary system. It also reflects that we do want to serve 
Canadians. We want to see our country prosper and go forward.
<P>
	The process also allows for a time of reflection which I think 
is very important. It allows people of all faiths-and certainly I 
know Reformers strongly support the concept-the right to 
freedom of religion. By this means all members of the House are 
able to reflect in a way that they deem most appropriate.
<P>
	Therefore, although I do not expect there is unanimous 
agreement that it is 100 per cent perfect in its construction, I 
believe that all members who look at this format believe the 
process is there so that they can effectively reflect and pray at 
the beginning of each session of the House. It properly reflects 
the make-up and nature of Canada.
<P>
	Therefore I think there is general agreement among 
Reformers in the House that we would be very happy to proceed 
with this new structure for our Speaker's prayer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to make a comment if I may because I participated in 
the proceedings of that committee. Let me remind the House of 
some elements that were already announced concerning what we 
call Prayers.
<P>
	We have been debating the question for several years and I 
think the committee has done a magnificent job in trying to unite 
everyone around one fundamental form of prayer. We all know 
that Prayers open every sitting of the House; what we have now 
constitutes a great improvement compared to the previous text 
which made some members ill at ease on religious grounds.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1565"> 1565 </A></B>
<P>
	You know the Chair must open every sitting by determining 
if there is a quorum before starting to say prayers. Given the 
general discomfort among members, the committee could not 
accept that a few of them feel unconcerned by these first 
moments of the sitting of the House and have no other recourse 
but to stay outside if they do not feel involved in what is going 
on. This is the first element of importance.
<P>
	Our objective was then to include all elected members in the 
discussions and that prompted us to prepare a text almost free of 
any references to specific religious beliefs and acceptable to 
almost everybody. All members also had to feel the House was 
their place and that this activity was meant for them. Of course 
my colleague mentioned the reference to the Queen, but above 
all, our aim was to design a moment of reflection intended for all 
members of the House.
<P>
	We are practicing democracy at its best here today in trying to 
recognize all religions and I think this is very positive and 
valuable, even more so when you think that prayers do not 
necessarily have to be a formal text; that is an argument I 
presented to the committee.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	We know that any prayer is something very personal, it is a 
conversation with what each of us calls God, but one's own 
personal God, according to one's own values. In that 
perspective, we are extremely satisfied that all faiths are 
recognized here through what I would call multiple persuasions.
<P>
	The second element is that the intimate nature of prayers is 
recognized by the moment of silence each member of this House 
will respect and, in so doing, will feel concerned by the very first 
opening instants of each sitting of the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It was agreed 
unanimously to make brief remarks. If we do not have 
unanimous consent on the motion proposed by the member from 
Kingston and the Islands, I could suggest that there be further 
negotiations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are ready. Of course, you do 
not have to beg us to speak about prayers. We are ready to give 
unanimous consent, as we have already said. We can go on with 
the debate or agree unanimously to adjourn at 2.30 p.m. without 
any extension of the sitting. If I have the Government House 
leader's promise to that effect, we will stop pleading.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker 
if there is unanimous consent right now to adopt the motion 
presented by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government 
House Leader, I would be happy to give a commitment that this 
House will not sit past 2.30 and will adjourn at that time. Again, 
that is on the condition there is unanimous consent given  
immediately for passing this motion and we return to second 
reading debate of Bill C-7.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Members have heard the 
terms of the motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, insofar as the Government House 
leader gives us his word that we will adjourn at 2.30 p.m., we 
agree to give unanimous consent to have the vote on the prayer. 
We are more than willing to do so.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon, members:</B> Agreed.

	(Motion agreed to.)

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>	Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, drug trafficking, possession and intoxication is a very serious problem that modern society must face. We all know that adults, teenagers and even children get intoxicated with and addicted to drugs. 
<P>
	This is why I ask all those who are watching to listen carefully 
to what I say. If you have a videotape recorder, I advise you to 
record what I am about to say.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What we are going to talk about should interest everyone. 
People may think there is nothing exciting in the new bill. That 
is not so today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As a matter of fact, during the next 40 minutes we will be 
dealing with issues that are of interest to everyone, honest 
people, sick people, health professionals, law enforcement 
people but also those who produce, distribute, possess and use 
drugs. We will be talking about Bill C-7.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	This bill deals with certain drugs, their precursors and other 
substances. It was tabled in the House of Commons and passed 
the first reading stage on February 2. The passing of this bill at 
third reading would result in the Narcotic Control Act, and 
certain sections of parts III and IV of the Food and Drugs Act, 
being repealed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1566"> 1566 </A></B>
<P>
	It is important to note that Bill C-7 is, for all intents and 
purposes, identical to Bill C-85, an Act respecting the control 
of psychoactive substances, which was tabled by the 
Conservative government on June 11, 1992. That bill passed 
the first and second reading stages on June 11, 1992 and May 
6, 1993. The committee tabled its report on June 3, 1993. Bill 
C-85 died on the Order Paper when the elections were called.
<P>
	Bill C-7 is part of the national drug strategy. It consolidates 
and adds to the provisions of the Narcotic Control Act, and of 
Parts III and IV of the Food and Drugs Act. Last but not least, 
Bill C-7 would enact certain provisions of the Single 
Convention on Narcotic Drugs, dating back to 1961, and of the 
1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Both 
international conventions were ratified by Canada.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes it is necessary for Canada and 
Quebec to be able to adequately and efficiently control narcotic 
drugs on their territories. Consequently, the Bloc Quebecois 
recognizes that legislating to that end is an obvious necessity.
<P>
	Let us quickly review the situation as it is presently in 
Canada. At the present time, under the Narcotic Control Act and 
the Food and Drugs Act, drugs must be listed in a schedule to the 
act for their sale on the streets to become an offense. 
Consequently, new drugs are not considered illegal as long as 
they have not been analysed and added to a schedule. This 
process takes a lot of time. Meanwhile, people who use these 
substances, and society in general, may and do suffer grave 
prejudices.
<P>
	It should be noted that Bill C-7 includes the provisions of the 
present legislation. Under clause 2 we find the same definition 
of the word ``sale'' as including distribution, whether it is made 
for consideration or not, that is to say free of charge.
<P>
	Certain provisions, however, have been added. For example, 
besides manufacturing, synthesizing, cultivating, propagating 
and harvesting, ``produce'' also includes offer to produce, as 
mentioned in clause 2.
<P>
	Moreover, according to clause 3(1), a substance included in 
the schedules is deemed to include not only any substance 
capable of producing an effect similar to that of a substance 
included in these schedules, but also any substance represented 
or held out as such by the purchaser, whether acting in good faith 
or not.
<P>
	Thus, every person who, whether acting in good faith or not, 
traffics in a substance represented or held out as a substance 
included in the schedules, is guilty of an indictable offence or of 
a punishable offence, pursuant to clause 6(1), (3) and (5).
<P>
	The mere act of possessing, for the purpose of trafficking, 
even if no money is involved, a substance included in the 
schedules, is an indictable offence or an offence punishable 
under clause 6(2) and (3). The bill provides for harsher penalties 
for substances included in schedule I and the severity decreases 
from one schedule to another. It should be noted that cannabis is 
listed in  schedule I. Every person producing cannabis, no matter 
to what extent, is guilty of an indictable offence liable to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years, under 
clause 8(2)(b).

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This being said, is Bill C-7 substantially different from actual 
laws in regard to unlawful drug distribution? No, not at all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is important to make this statement to correct any other 
perception which some may have had following the recent 
comments made by the Solicitor General.
<P>
	Indeed, on February 15, the Solicitor General said to 
journalists that Bill C-7 was the best way to curb cocaine 
smuggling activities by warriors on aboriginal territories. These 
comments tend to imply that current laws are not sufficient to 
adequately fight this traffic.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. Like Bill 
C-7, the existing Narcotic Control Act makes the smuggling, 
importation and exportation of drugs a criminal activity. That 
act also says that it is illegal to have goods directly or indirectly 
linked to the commission of an offence, in or outside Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-7 only adds the notions of conspiracy and attempt to 
commit an offence. The same is true in the case of laundering 
proceeds of certain offences. The powers to search, seize and 
detain are very clearly defined in the existing act.
<P>
	Therefore, it appears that the legislation already provides the 
Solicitor General with all the necessary tools to intervene now 
on aboriginal territories to stop cocaine smuggling by warriors.
<P>
	As for the Solicitor General's statement to the effect that Bill 
C-7 will allow police to make controlled sales, thereby allowing 
undercover agents to infiltrate smuggling rings and catch 
criminals by proposing deals, I wonder if that is anything new. 
Indeed, the power to investigate already allows police to 
conduct undercover activities and make controlled sales.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe that the Solicitor General would 
try to use Bill C-7 to buy time and delay any action against 
smugglers who use aboriginal territories for their operations. 
The fact is that current laws contain all the necessary provisions 
to allow the Solicitor General to make a move. To claim 
anything else would only confirm that there is no political will 
to act, which cannot decently be true, naturally.
<P>
	Having said this, I think we should question how effective Bill 
C-7 will be once it comes into force.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1567"> 1567 </A></B>
<P>
	For instance, how many more people are expected to be 
arrested and convicted thanks to this bill? Who do we expect 
to arrest and convict? What kind of a reduction in trafficking 
and use is expected? Finally, will the judicial system be able 
to absorb the extra caseload? And what is provided in this law 
for the unfortunate people who have become addicted to drugs? 
Answers to these questions are either non-existent or 
unsatisfactory, as we will demonstrate in this debate.
<P>
	Indeed, we consider that Bill C-7 has several significant 
flaws and not only ignores the parameters to be defined in 
effective drug control strategy but also opens the door to some 
major adverse effects. In the time at our disposal, my colleagues 
from the Bloc Quebecois and I will try to express our concerns 
so that this House and the general public can cconsider this bill 
in the light of accepted modern values.
<P>
	The flaws that we have identified in Bill C-7 can be grouped 
under four questions. First, are legitimate activities of 
physicians, pharmacists, vets and dentists properly protected 
against abusive application of the legislation and especially 
against regulations the scope of which we do not know at the 
moment?
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Second, will the significant powers granted to inspectors, to 
be designated directly by the minister, not possibly lead to some 
errors which could unduly penalize health professionals and 
their patients? Will Canadians be able to take on the added 
responsibilities arising from this bill? And is this bill in line 
with the rights and privileges of provincial governments, 
especially Quebec?
<P>
	Third, how will the confidentiality of medical records be 
ensured when the bill allows absolutely anyone designated as an 
inspector by the minister to reproduce documents found in a 
physician's office or in a pharmacy and to seize electronic data.
<P>
	Fourth and foremost, why are drug-dependent persons who 
need to be treated and not jailed considered criminals in this 
bill?
<P>
	I will now address each one of these issues in order to 
determine the provisions which need to be improved and which 
are, in our opinion, crucial for the purpose of this Act and for 
avoiding disastrous secondary consequences.
<P>
	Let us begin with our first concern. Are legitimate activities 
of physicians, pharmacists, vets and dentists properly protected 
against an abusive application of this act and especially against 
regulations the scope of which we do not know at the moment?
<P>
	I would like to remind hon. members that the Canadian 
Medical Association expressed its concerns, last May, before 
the legislative committee on Bill C-85, because physicians will 
have no way of knowing which activities are legal or illegal 
before the regulations have been promulgated. Hence, they do 
not have all the information they need to properly examine this 
bill. In fact, since regulations can be amended by the  
bureaucracy, how can physicians and their patients be informed 
of such changes? The lack of information in the bill on which 
medication will be controlled also added to their feeling of 
uncertainty.
<P>
	For example, the Canadian Medical Association was 
concerned about the definition of practitioner in clause 2, which 
is left to the regulations, especially for the purpose of the 
definition ``provide'' in section 54<I>z</I>.1.
<P>
	We understand that the purpose of Bill C-7 is not to cause 
problems for health care professionals or their patients. 
However, it has recently come to our attention that the Canadian 
Medical Association clearly indicated that the bill requires 
some clarification so as not to cause undue prejudice to medical 
practitioners.
<P>
	Dr. Barry Adams, chairman of the Council on Health Care and 
Promotion of the Canadian Medical Association, had this to say 
when he appeared before the legislative committee last May, 
and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Canadian Medical Association is extremely concerned about the changes 
brought about by this legislation, because some seem to be directed at legitimate 
patient and physician activities. Our concerns are twofold. First, the changed 
definitions of some offences will have direct and undesirable consequences for 
physicians in their daily practices, and also for their patients. Second, the new 
regulatory powers will inappropriately and ineffectively regulate the prescribing 
practices of physicians, and will give increased access to confidential patient 
information.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We share those important concerns expressed by the Canadian 
Medical Association. In particular, we are seriously concerned 
by the important modifications that will affect all individuals 
treated by two or more doctors.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Is indeed guilty of an indictable offence or of a punishable 
offence a person who, having obtained within the preceding 
thirty days a substance included in the schedules or an 
authorization to obtain such a substance, neglects to mention 
that fact to a practitioner from whom that person obtains or 
seeks to obtain any substance included in the schedules or an 
authorization to obtain it.
<P>
	The Canadian Medical Association points out that this new 
provision applies not only to patients who consult two doctors 
within a period of thirty days but also to any person obtaining or 
seeking to obtain a drug from a person authorized to provide it. 
This would include doctors who are obtaining or seeking to 
obtain drugs for legitimate medical reasons as well as every 
patient wanting to treat real symptoms.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1568"> 1568 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian Medical Association stresses that the law does 
not clearly define what is unlawful. Consequently an individual 
would have to know if he or she is authorized to request drugs 
and who is an authorized drug supplier.
<P>
	This creates an unacceptable uncertainty for the doctors as 
well as for their patients.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Does that mean, for instance, Mr. Speaker, that you and I and 
everyone will have to memorize the schedules to the act in order 
to avoid committing an offence unwittingly? If such a substance 
was legitimately injected while unconscious in a hospital, would 
it be a crime to neglect to mention that to the pharmacist you are 
asking to fill a prescription for that substance or any other 
substance included in the schedules?
<P>
	Does that mean that every one of us, in Quebec as well as in 
Canada, will have to ask our doctor or pharmacist for a list of 
everything that is prescribed, sold or administered to us, and a 
list of the drugs a third party has been authorized to sell or to 
administer to us, whether or not that sale or administration 
happened? If clause 5(2) of the bill was to be taken literally, the 
nightmare I just outlined would become a definite possibility.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To those who think that no one in his right mind would apply 
the law so strictly and so foolishly, my answer is we should 
know better.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Unfortunately, there is no doubt somebody will choose to 
enforce the act rigidly and blindly, if given the opportunity to do 
so. The only thing that remains to be seen is where and when 
and, above all, who the unfortunate victim will be! It is our 
responsibility in this House to have a bill that is crystal clear and 
deals with the true goals to be achieved and leaves law-abiding 
citizens and pharmacists alone. The House should legislate and 
not leave it to well-intentioned bureaucrats to regulate.
<P>
	There is another concern due to the fact that patients are 
included in the definitions given in the bill. In this context, we 
should consider the case of pain-relieving drugs used to spare 
unnecessary pain to the sick, the chronically ill and terminally 
ill cancer patients. If, under this bill, the physician must ask 
himself each and every time he writes a prescription whether he 
is breaking the law or not, then Mr. Speaker, I ask you: How 
many sick persons will be denied the drugs they really need?
<P>
	The bill must be explicit and make a clear-cut distinction 
between an unlawful behaviour on the part of a physician and a 
questionable way of prescribing drugs.
<P>
	The medical association emphasized also that it was not sure 
the federal government could legitimately regulate the 
prescription and administration of drugs by physicians to their 
patients. Moreover, it is far from certain that the enforcement 
mechanism will be effective. It thinks that the use of penal law 
to regulate quality in health care is counterproductive and 
inconsistent with modern management theory.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I notice I still have a lot more notes to go 
through. How much time do I have left?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion, you still 
have 15 to 18 minutes, that is until 1.20 p.m.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would now like to tell you 
about the Canadian Pharmaceutical Association, which also 
testified last May. The president of that association, Mr. Leroy 
Fevang, said: ``We have four concerns: the uncertainty about the 
type of substances which will be affected by the bill; the extent 
of the administration and enforcement powers provided by the 
bill; the possibility that the bill will force pharmacists to give 
information in such a way as to almost incriminate themselves; 
and the uncertainty caused by the lack of information on the 
nature of the regulations and the lack of any mention of 
medication in the bill. The Canadian Pharmaceutical 
Association wants the act to specify clearly what substances a 
pharmacist can legally handle''.
<P>
	The association also wondered how we should define 
``stimulant effect''. Do we even have a standard to measure it? If 
one definition could cover everything, would there be 
exemptions for people who can have unusual reactions? Who 
would decide what is a so-called psychotropic substance? How 
would this information be given to pharmacists in order to help 
them to start exercising some control over those substances?
<P>
	The association mentioned, for example, the risk which a 
pharmacist would incur in selling or packaging 
over-the-counter drugs that are not listed in the act and have 
minor or unexpected effects that can be associated with 
psychotropic properties.
<P>
	I will now discuss the second aspect, and I am referring to the 
wide-ranging powers given to inspectors appointed directly by 
the minister, powers which I think will perhaps not encourage 
but at least open the door to errors that would unduly penalize 
health professionals and their patients. Will the public be able to 
deal with the new responsibilities it has under this bill? And how 
can this legislation co-exist with the prerogatives of Quebec and 
the provinces for dealing with their respective jurisdictions?
<P>
	Bill C-7 appears to grant quasi inquisitorial powers to the 
minister, through inspectors, adjudicators and justices. Last 
year, the Legislative Committee on Bill C-85 wondered whether 
the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian 
Rights and Liberties Federation would have something to say 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1569"> 1569 </A></B>
<P>
about the compatibility of measures provided in the bill with the  
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, especially in matters 
concerning the Criminal Code.
<P>
	For instance, the committee had some questions about 
searches without a warrant. It seems that in 1984, in the Hunder 
and Southam case, the court ruled that a warrant was necessary, 
except under very special circumstances.
<P>
	Bill C-7 provides for circumstances in which no warrant is 
required. It not only does that, but it also says in clause 29(1) 
that the minister may designate any person, literally any person, 
as an inspector for the purposes of this Act. These appointees 
will enjoy quasi inquisitorial powers. These powers are 
considerable and sufficiently broad to cover any kind of abuse, 
whether it is accidental, voluntary or the result of a conspiracy.
<P>
	So the inspector is appointed by the Minister of National 
Health and Welfare. There are some questions about the 
minister's discretionary powers in this respect. First of all, this 
political appointment provides no guarantees that the inspector 
has the qualifications to perform his duties. Since the minister 
may designate anyone as an inspector, the appointment may be 
purely partisan.
<P>
	The inspector's powers are considerable. According to clause 
30(1) of this Act, ``an inspector may, to ensure compliance with 
the regulations, at any reasonable time enter any place used for 
the purpose of conducting the business or professional practice 
of any person licensed or otherwise authorized under the 
regulations to deal in a controlled substance or precursor''.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This article means that an inspector can visit and thoroughly 
search your doctor's office or your drugstore and all this without 
a warrant.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We understand that the intent of the bill is to give these 
powers to the inspector so that he can fulfil his administrative 
duties. But since the evidence that he accumulates could be used 
in a criminal court and a search warrant is required for any 
criminal proceedings unless there are very special 
circumstances provided for by the law, it seems to us that these 
circumstances should really be exceptional. However, the 
inspection powers go way beyond the principle that I just 
mentioned.
<P>
	Let me explain to the House what we are talking about. We are 
talking about clause 30 concerning any person authorized or 
licensed under the regulations, such as the pharmacist, the 
doctor or the hospital.
<P>
	Regarding these people, the search powers of the inspector are 
practically without any limitations, the warrant often being only 
required for a dwelling-place. The inspector can visit any place 
at any time that is convenient to him, he can search and examine 
any thing, including computerized data, he can use any 
computer or copying equipment in that place, without any 
compensation to the person in charge of that place, he  can take 
away with him any thing that he wants and he can use force. 
Moreover, any person present in the place, including the patient, 
undoubtedly, is required to help the inspector and to give him 
any information without interfering with his work, even by 
omission. And I remind this House that the Minister can literally 
appoint anybody to that job.
<P>
	I would like to mention also that this bill infringes on the 
jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces. According to the 
Canadian Pharmaceutical Association, under the present 
system, the provincial governments grant pharmacists licences 
which allow them to sell and package pharmaceuticals. 
According to that Association, it is not necessary for the federal 
government to issue new licences for the sale and packaging of 
controlled drugs, as this could create duplication and even 
greater confusion.
<P>
	Consequently, this bill infringes on provincial jurisdiction. 
For example, Quebec grants inspection power to the 
Corporation des médecins. The inspector working for the 
Corporation can, upon prior notice, visit physicians in their 
offices to make sure that everything is in agreement with 
common medical practice.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec, like the governments of the 
Canadian provinces, also gives the syndic of the Corporation the 
power to inspect the practice of a physician when it receives a 
complaint alleging that the physician prescribed harmful drugs 
to a patient. This is true for physicians and pharmacists 
everywhere in Quebec and Canada. This part of the bill would 
allow the federal government to enter areas of jurisdiction of 
Quebec and the provinces.
<P>
	Bill C-7 gives the Minister of Health and the Governor in 
Council increased powers. Clause 34, for example, gives the 
Minister, without prior notice to the person believed to have 
contravened the regulations, the right to make an interim order 
prohibiting the person from doing anything he or she would 
otherwise be permitted to do under their licence, permit or 
authorization. So, without knowing it, a licensee who has not yet 
received notice of the order issued and continues to carry on 
with the normal activities permitted under his licence, permit or 
authorization, becomes an offender.
<P>
	Similarly, according to clause 43, the minister can designate 
any person as an analyst for the purposes of analyzing or 
examining any substance or sample taken by the inspector. As in 
the case of the inspector, this analyst can be appointed on purely 
partisan grounds and his appointment is no guarantee of his 
qualifications.
<P>
	Another example is clause 55 of Bill C-7 which says the 
minister may exempt any person or class of persons or any 
controlled substance or precursor from the application of all or 
any of the provisions of this act or regulations, for medical or 
scientific purposes or if it is in the public interest. This 
ministerial discretion could have a major impact.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1570"> 1570 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, the minister could feel forced to exempt some 
controlled substances because of the pressure put on him by 
scientific or medical lobbies, even though these substances 
could entail a potential threat to public health.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	We must not forget that the scientific community can easily 
carry out research which is contrary to humanistic ethics, all in 
the name of science and of the sacrosanct well-being of 
humanity.
<P>
	This bill also gives the Governor in Council, the cabinet in 
other words, various powers and authorities with regard to 
regulations. The Bloc Quebecois and all the stakeholders of the 
health community should therefore carefully examine the 
regulations that will be tabled.
<P>
	Clause 54(1) gives the Governor in Council the power to make 
regulations for carrying out the purposes and provisions of this 
act, including the regulation of the medical, scientific and 
industrial uses and distribution of controlled substances and 
precursors and the enforcement of this act.
<P>
	Paragraph h) of this clause provides that the Governor in 
Council may make regulations:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>respecting the qualifications of persons engaged in the production, 
preservation, testing, packaging, storage, selling, providing or otherwise 
dealing in any controlled substance or precursor or any class thereof;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Yet, in this clause giving major powers to the Governor in 
Council, we can see that paragraph c) encroaches on one of 
Quebec's areas of jurisdiction. This paragraph provides that the 
Governor in Council may make regulations:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>respecting the issuance, suspension, cancellation, duration and terms and 
conditions of any class of licence for the importation into Canada, exportation 
from Canada, production, packaging, sale, provision or administration of any 
substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV or V or any class thereof;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We must recall that pharmacists' sales licences are issued by 
the Government of Quebec and by the provincial governments. 
This is another case of federal interference in Quebec's and the 
provinces' areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	And while the bill gives some powers that are not obviously 
necessary, it does not seem to give the powers that would really 
be needed. Last May, Scott Neward, general counsel of the 
Canadian Police Association, told the legislative committee that 
there could be a potential problem. What would happen, he said, 
if a court objectively decides after the fact that the force used in 
locating the drugs was not reasonable? Although he admitted 
that the police could be liable to prosecution for ripping up a 
floor, he was concerned that the 10 pounds of heroin found under 
the floor boards could then be ruled inadmissible evidence. He 
concluded by suggesting that it should be made clear that any 
violation relating to  that subsection should not affect the 
admissibility of evidence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure we all want the law to be without mercy for the 
so-called druglords, but is Bill C-7 up to that task? I am not so 
sure. For instance, why is there a double standard concerning 
cannabis offences? Carefully bear with me.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Paul Saint-Denis, senior counsel for the criminal law 
policy section of the Department of Justice, made the following 
remarks when addressing the committee:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose behind creating a hybrid trafficking offence for cannabis was 
really not geared towards attacking the leaders of drug trafficking groups but 
rather to deal with the difficulty of court delays. By creating a hybrid trafficking 
offence for cannabis, it would be possible for prosecutors to prosecute by way of a 
summary conviction, and thereby reduce or eliminate access to jury trials and to 
preliminary hearings, thereby cutting down considerably on court delays. The 
entire purpose behind creating the hybrid trafficking offence for cannabis was 
not to attack drug trafficking ringleaders but rather to deal with the fairly 
complex issue of court delays, part of which is the result of mounting trafficking 
offences which linger in the courts because of the time it takes for them to get 
through the court process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Obviously, this bill has not been properly thought through. It 
could potentially disturb honest people's peace of mind. We are 
rightfully questioning its ability to reduce drug use and 
trafficking.
<P>
	I will stop for a moment. I voiced my concern earlier and 
attempted to speed up, but I still have a few pages left to read. I 
wonder if the House would allow me to go over my allotted time.

<P>
	The House will remember that our third issue was medical file 
confidentiality. How can medical file confidentiality not be 
threatened by a law that literally allows an inspector to copy 
your file in a doctor's office or in a drugstore or even in a 
hospital and further allows this guy to get at your computerized 
data?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1571"> 1571 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Allow me to quote once again the Canadian Medical 
Association. This organization is very concerned about some of 
the changes proposed in this bill, namely those which seem to 
take aim at legitimate activities conducted by medical doctors. 
Among other things, the new regulatory process will ensure 
easier access to the confidential files of patients.
<P>
	I am also quite concerned to hear the Canadian 
Pharmaceutical Association say, again through Dr. Leroy 
Fevang, that it co-operated with the Bureau of Dangerous Drugs 
to develop a single electronic standard for computerized 
prescription delivery, in order to simplify the setting up of a data 
base on drug consumers.
<P>
	Such a data base would provide detailed information on the 
pharmacotherapeutic history of any individual and, 
consequently, on his or her physiological and mental profiles. Is 
this really the object of Bill C-7? Of course not! Therefore, this 
legislation must be redrafted so as to allow what is useful and 
necessary, while prohibiting what is not and what constitutes 
undue and unacceptable intrusion into the private lives of honest 
citizens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	May I now tackle our fourth issue? Although it is the last I 
believe it to be the most important one. I ask this House: Why 
does this law make criminals out of addicted people who need to 
be medically treated rather than jailed?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Indeed, Bill C-7 makes criminals not only of those who are 
involved in drug smuggling, but also of those who use the drugs. 
Instead of treating those who suffer from a dependency, the law 
makes criminals of them. Thus, Bill C-7 is a tool to control and 
suppress crime rather than to promote health. In fact, prevention 
and rehabilitation are two concepts on which this bill is 
absolutely silent.
<P>
	We all know that the illegal consumption of drugs results in 
the commission of various offences by those who have 
developed this kind of dependency. Some must steal and even 
prostitute themselves to be able to afford the daily dose which 
their sick body is so dependent upon. What slavery!
<P>
	Where do they steal? Very often in our homes, where they take 
electronic appliances and jewellery which they quickly resell at 
a very low price to receiver networks. These poor people are sick 
but, because they are afraid to incriminate themselves, they 
cannot seek medical treatment and are therefore condemned to 
steal in order to satisfy their drug addiction. They have become 
the absolute slaves of drug dealers who grow richer with the loot 
stolen by these unfortunates.
<P>
	That is the real problem. We must help these people, prisoners 
of their drug addiction. Once there are no more drug addicts, 
drug dealers will have to close shop. Alas, this bill does not 
show any concern about rehabilitating people found in 
possession of drugs. In particular, this bill aims at suppressing 
the drug trade. While it provides for the imposition of fines for 
possession of narcotics, there is no mention of providing access 
to rehabilitation programs.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	The focus of Bill C-7 is controlling supply of drugs. It 
completely neglects the need to control demand, as well as 
aspects such as prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.
<P>
	The May 27, 1993 issue of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> contained an 
article by Professors Usprich and Solomon about the bill now 
before this House. The article states the following: ``-the new 
legislation fails to address the vast majority of the problems that 
stem from the existing legislation and raises many new 
concerns. The proposed legislation is more complex and 
impenetrable than previous laws. The bill maintains the punitive 
nature of the law which is based on preconceptions which the 
findings of the LeDain Commission should have done away with 
once and for all twenty years ago. In its present form, the bill 
makes drug addiction a crime''.
<P>
	In addition, Dr. Reginald G. Smart, Chief of Social 
Epidemiology at the Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Research 
Foundation, has this to say: ``Many drug addicts in need of 
treatment end up in jail for possession of narcotics. We do not 
have in place a diversion process which would enable judges to 
give the accused a choice between jail or a treatment program. 
Our laws do not allow for this kind of choice, whereas such an 
approach is commonplace in many other countries in the 
world''.
<P>
	If we put a drug addict in jail, not only will we have a 
miserable, sick prisoner, but it will cost us an added $70,000 per 
year for most of his life. A withdrawal treatment and a 
rehabilitation program would only cost a few thousands dollars 
and would return to society an individual capable of greatly 
contributing to his or her community.
<P>
	Do not tell me that this concern will be addressed in another 
bill. We have before the House Bill C-7, which can and should 
legislate in such areas as rehabilitation and withdrawal 
treatment. Thousands of our young and not so young fellow 
citizens, who are trapped by their drug habit, cannot wait any 
longer.
<P>
	One more thing before I conclude. I want to mention two 
well-known psychotropic substances which have been left out 
of this bill. They are, predictably, nicotine and alcohol. Even 
though Canada and Quebec have always been relatively tolerant 
about the use of such substances, the population is very aware of 
the fact that nicotine is harmful, causes serious health problems 
and reduces the quality of life and life expectancy of people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1572"> 1572 </A></B>
<P>
	As for alcohol, driving a vehicle with .08 per cent or more 
of that substance in your blood is already a criminal offence. 
I wonder then if this would not be the right time to recognize 
the true nature of these substances and include them in Bill C-7 
with observations that would reflect our modern tolerance and 
awareness.
<P>
	In conclusion, we acknowledge the necessity of legislation 
like that proposed in Bill C-7 in order to control drug possession 
and trafficking. However, we strenuously insist that the bill 
should also deal with rehabilitation and detoxification.
<P>
	Finally, it is of paramount importance that Bill C-7 be 
explicit about the legitimate activities of health professionals 
and patients. We should not rely on regulations to specify what 
should appear in the act itself. Furthermore the bill we must 
provide an adequate framework for the powers it confers to 
individuals and institutions.
<P>
	Accordingly, we recommend that Bill C-7 be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Health which should revise its content 
in view of our concerns.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your kind attention, and I thank 
the hon. members of this House for theirs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was my 
intention when I started to address Bill C-7 to speak to the 
positives in it. However, I must admit that the best laid plans of 
this member to find something positive about this bill have gone 
astray, just like the contents of this bill.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	The intent of this bill was a noble enterprise definitely needed 
in today's society. Instead of taking the time and making the 
effort to properly research, plan and develop a bill that would 
fulfil today's needs, this government has simply borrowed Bill 
C-85 from the previous government, made some cosmetic 
changes and put this bill forward as its own.
<P>
	With laziness comes regret and the regret here is that the 
government was lazy. The only saving grace in this bill is finally 
a government is addressing the use of weapons, drug dealing 
near schools, and is requesting judges to offer written reasons 
for not incarcerating those convicted of using weapons in drug 
deals or dealing drugs near schools.
<P>
	I will outline the faults with this bill as I see them. This 
government would have members of this House pass a bill 
before the regulations outlining what is permissible are even 
published.
<P>
	Those regulations are needed in conjunction with Criminal 
Code rulings so that Canadians are aware of what is legal 
process. Ignorance of the law is not an admissible defence in 
court. Under this bill every Canadian would be denied a legal 
defence in court. They will be ignorant of the legal process until 
those regulations are known.
<P>
	The people of Canada should never be governed by 
regulations. They should be governed only by law. Passing this 
bill before the regulations are complete and known will entail 
giving the regulations superiority over law. I cannot support 
that.
<P>
	Further, this bill is so poorly written charter challenges leap 
off the page every time I turn one. Perhaps this government 
believes that Canadians have not had their fill of being tied up in 
courts, criminals being set free and large pay cheques for 
lawyers because of poorly written legislation.
<P>
	Let me assure this government that belief is wrong. Let me 
assure this government Canadians want laws and legislation that 
will stand the charter test. Bill C-7 will have an extremely 
difficult time doing that.
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled in violation of the charter previous 
legislation having the same errors in construction as section 12 
of this bill pertaining to search and seizure. The Supreme Court 
ruled in violation of the charter previous legislation having the 
same errors in construction as section 13 pertaining to the 
necessary force.
<P>
	Section 34 of this bill allows the minister to remove a person's 
right to a livelihood such as a druggist or a doctor and then asks 
them to present a case before an adjudicator.
<P>
	This bill allows a minister to presume someone is guilty and 
then asks that person to prove they are innocent.
<P>
	Do the words Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms strike 
any note of familiarity with this government? Nowhere in this 
bill do I see any reference to rehabilitation. I believe this 
government thinks this side of the House will support any bill 
offering jail terms for criminals.
<P>
	Let me assure Canadians we believe in rehabilitation. We 
believe society and taxpayers are better served by having first 
time, small quantity possession addicts sent to cost efficient 
drug rehabilitation centres, offering them hope that they can 
return to normal life.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	We believe excluding in this bill any option for rehabilitation 
is a sad oversight and shows Canadians the only understanding 
this government has for a judicial review is punitive measures.
<P>
	How can any Canadian who is a slave to drugs or a slave to 
drug pushers and organized crime make a decision for a better 
future when the only option is to remove them from society?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1573"> 1573 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill shows the true light of this government. This bill 
not only shows this government has a complete lack of 
understanding for judicial reform, but this bill also shows this 
government does not understand the concept of justice. The 
punishment should meet the crime. According to this 
government, seeking help for an addiction would be a crime.
<P>
	No one believes in the right of citizens to feel safe in their 
homes, in their schools, in their streets and in their communities 
more than I do. I also believe victims include those who are 
addicted to these soul-stealing drugs.
<P>
	Nowhere in this bill do I see where this government allows 
victims of drug addiction any hope of rehabilitation. I really 
wanted to support this bill. I really wanted this bill to offer 
protection to society against designer drugs. What do I see 
instead? I see a bill that is so poorly written, so broad in 
language that a charter fight will surely result.
<P>
	The wording in this bill could cause charges under section 3 
for giving someone too much coffee. Caffeine in large amounts 
creates similar stimulative effects as amphetamines. According 
to this bill, an attempt to keep a friend awake with several cups 
of coffee could result in charges.
<P>
	I do appreciate the intent of this bill and believe legislation 
must be enacted to address the issues intended, but this bill is not 
the answer. This bill will create more legal and more social 
problems than it will ever solve.
<P>
	It is a shame that this government did not take this issue to the 
serious extent that is required. This government simply 
borrowed an inept bill left over from the previous government to 
address a problem that most Canadians want correctly solved.
<P>
	This bill confuses regulations with criminal law. It presents 
far too wide powers for inspectors enforcing regulations, not 
laws. It offers wide powers that will lead to charter challenges, 
invalidating any evidence found and letting criminals escape 
from justice. It offers no hope for rehabilitation. It will force 
undue hardship on medical practitioners and pharmaceutical 
corporations.
<P>
	I must discourage support for this bill. I also must encourage 
this government to return this ill-conceived and poorly worded 
bill to the drawing table. Then let the government return to this 
House with a bill that will stand the test of modern 
jurisprudence.
<P>
	At that time I will be more than happy to support a new bill 
and its intention to bring controlled substances and those who 
are involved in the trade of controlled substances before the law 
and to justice.
<P>
	There are penalty provisions in Bill C-7 for small amounts as 
severe as large amounts of drugs, except a special provision for 
cannabis, but sharing cannabis with a friend can equal 14 years, 
according to this bill.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	It could cause prescription problems for doctors. Doctors 
could be charged with trafficking, especially if a substance is 
not on one of the schedules.
<P>
	It allows inspectors access to confidential doctor-patient 
records. It gives the minister the power to impose sentences for 
substances not yet on schedule, arbitrary power of 
imprisonment.
<P>
	The size of this document amazes me. This document, with all 
its contents and the way it has been written and all the matters 
that pertain to judicial matters, is then turned over to the health 
committee to study and to bring back to this House. If I were on 
the health committee I would wonder why such a document so 
full of judicial matters would be before us.
<P>
	Illegal drugs need to be dealt with.
<P>
	As many members know, I was the principal of a 
junior-senior high school for 23 years. I have a colleague who is 
also a principal in Quebec. We could probably share a lot of 
stories about illegal drugs and what I have seen them do to 
youth. I have attended many funerals in those 23 years, some of 
which were the result of drugs and the way they are handled.
<P>
	I suppose what bothers me more than anything is that over the 
last two decades or so we from the educational, community and 
parent levels have asked and continually ask governments and 
politicians, those in power, to please take charge of the situation 
and do something about it. It is out of hand, it is getting out of 
control and it is serious.
<P>
	I am really disappointed that over the last 23 years I have seen 
no such progress. If this 35th Parliament would only get the 
political will and the intestinal fortitude, the courage and the 
guts it takes, it could take on illegal drugs in the same manner in 
which it was so brave to take on cigarettes. When they moved in 
and did those things in such a harsh manner and told the whole 
world that they meant business it caused the health practitioners 
throughout the country to cheer and applaud.
<P>
	When we continually slide by other drugs that cause many 
serious problems, Canadians wonder when we are going to take 
the action. Then again, maybe I should not encourage my 
colleagues on that side of the House to get too much involved in 
doing this sort of thing just yet. After all, if they want to 
continue with a lackadaisical attitude they had when they put 
this bill together and continue to ignore the wishes and desires 
of Canadians, that should probably make me happy. If that kind 
of attitude continues they will be occupying some seats on this 
side of the House after the next election because Canadians are 
not going to stand for that any longer.
<P>
	There are problems out there and we are saying that is too bad.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1574"> 1574 </A></B>
<P>
	I remember going to the police and how they agreed with me 
that one individual, an adult, was responsible for trafficking 
most of the drugs in the small town I was in. Every time they 
got close to bringing this person under the thumb of the law, 
some kind of technicality or charter challenge would prevent 
that. In frustration we could only talk about how we could 
overcome that kind of a situation.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	Yet what I see today is a document that is full of the 
opportunity to continually cause more and more charter 
challenges. Why do we not get away from that? Or, do we all 
have some kind of stock or interest in a law firm and the busier 
we keep our lawyers the fatter their wallets get and the less we 
do for society?
<P>
	Many members make a mockery of these words. It is too bad 
they were not at some of the funerals I was talking about. It is too 
bad they were not there to watch the 14-year old blow his own 
brains out under the influence of a drug over which he had no 
control. It is too bad they do not get a little closer to the people as 
politicians to get a little more feel of what they are trying to tell 
us. Once they understand and get a feeling for it, they will 
understand why I desire getting something done.
<P>
	Things can go right when a 34-year old man is caught and 
charged for trafficking drugs in a small community in my riding. 
Everybody cheers because students in the area are the ones who 
were being supplied by the individual. They are glad he has 
finally been caught. However, there is something terribly wrong 
when three weeks later, after going to court and being charged 
under due process of law, he is out in the same town doing the 
same thing. It is just one example of thousands: a little tap on the 
wrist and ``don't do that again''.
<P>
	I will repeat. If the government had the political will, the 
courage and the guts, I guarantee it would have the approval of 
the Canadian people to take action. The government should get 
with it. I will join it and be pleased to work with it to come up 
with documents that will make sense and put an end to this 
problem. This is not a Liberal problem. This is not a Reform 
problem or a Bloc problem. This is a Canadian problem 
affecting our youth. When brain burning drugs are free and easy 
in our society it is time we started doing something about it.
<P>
	I had the privilege of going on prison missions once every 
month for a number of years. The prison where I served my 
missions was the Bowden Institute in my riding, a federal 
maximum security prison. I find it amazing that in our penal 
system it is easier to get access to drugs than it is on the streets. 
When I went on missions to the prison sometimes it was very 
difficult to counsel some of the individuals I was scheduled to 
counsel. They were already high or had come down off of a high 
because of drugs they had been using while in prison. They are 
readily available to them.
<P>
	Sometimes we as politicians continually challenge our penal 
system to rehabilitate, to fix these fellows up. Instead of turning 
out rehabilitated people from these prisons we are turning out 
more addicted individuals into society, saying that they have 
been in the penal system and should be able to walk out into 
society and function well. However they are already addicted.
<P>
	What kind of a system would allow that to continue? It should 
never be a Canadian system. It can be fixed and we need to fix it. 
But do we have the courage? Does the government have the will? 
So far I have not seen an example of it.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	I am waiting for somebody to do something other than come 
down with a massive document that is full of irregularities, full 
of things that will cause nothing but more grief and more 
problems. Would it be possible to break this document down so 
that we have a judicial section and a health section?
<P>
	I would imagine it would drive the health committee right up 
the wall when it comes to dealing with the judicial aspect. Being 
on the judicial committee, I certainly would not be comfortable 
dealing with this document when it comes to all the health 
aspects. It is a quick and easy way to brush it aside. They can 
make sure they take care of it and then go out and brag to 
everybody in their ridings about the wonderful bill they have 
passed. It is not worth the paper it is written on. It accomplishes 
nothing toward long-term drug rehabilitation and putting a stop 
to illegal selling and trafficking.
<P>
	When a country has billions of dollars in revenues from 
activities such as illegal drugs, is it something to be proud of? 
Do members want to run to another country somewhere and say 
that they are from Canada and our fourth biggest industry is 
drugs? Is that wonderful? Wherever it fits in, members can be 
assured it is very high on the ladder.
<P>
	Are members going to do their jobs in Parliament as people 
who have been asked to address these problems on behalf of 
Canadians throughout the country? Members could do it. For 
once they could focus on the victims and potential victims out 
there, waiting to fall into the trap created by the crime that is 
going on.
<P>
	I looked at certain areas throughout the world. Singapore was 
one. I understand from the statistics that it is down to 5 per cent. 
In my last year of school I was fortunate to have a 17-year old 
exchange student from Singapore for six weeks. I asked him 
whether there was a drug problem in Singapore schools. He said: 
``Not on your life. If you get caught with drugs, bang, you are 
dead''. I said: ``Really?'' It sounds pretty barbaric, does it not? 
Singapore has a 5 per cent problem or hardly any problem. There 
is no problem in the schools. It certainly is not causing a health 
problem. Traffickers are fearful of being in that country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1575"> 1575 </A></B>
<P>
	However I am afraid trafficking in this country is very 
inviting. When I visited the prison at Drumheller I was amazed 
by the numbers of drug traffickers from other countries who 
were there for short terms. For some of them to open their 
mouths and say the reason they are in Canada is that it is a haven 
for traffickers ought to be a message. They believe the easiest 
and most logical place to work is in a country like Canada that 
has namby-pamby rules when it comes to catching people like 
them.
<P>
	They can do something about it. Do they have the will? Do 
they have the courage? May God grant it to them because it 
needs to be done and it needs to be done now.
<P>
	It has even been suggested to me by a few that the real answer 
to our problems is that we need to legalize some of these drugs. 
Hogwash. Who would ever suggest such an idea? They should 
shake their heads and think again. Then they come back and say: 
``But prohibition never worked''. Maybe it did not, to whatever 
extent they are talking about, but I can guarantee that when 
alcohol was finally legalized-and I do not think anybody would 
have to work too hard to research and verify this-it was one of 
the problems that caused more divorces than anything else.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	What is causing more financial breakups? Alcohol. What is 
causing more bankruptcies? Alcohol. Why are more people in 
prison than ever before, 70 to 80 per cent of them? Alcohol. Was 
it a great and wonderful deal to legalize alcohol? Were we good? 
Now we want to turn around and consider doing the same kind of 
thing to these other drugs.
<P>
	To those who would even suggest that we consider legalizing 
these kinds of drugs I say: ``Move away from me immediately or 
we will have a serious argument''. There is no way, after seeing 
what I have seen through the experiences I have had with the 
youth of the country, that I would say for a single second 
legalization of drugs is what we need.
<P>
	In Canada we need law and order. We need legislators who 
will say it is time to make the country safer. We can do it and 
they are the people to do it. They had better find the courage and 
guts to do it. If it is not done it will continually get worse and we 
will regret the day that members of the 35th Parliament sat back 
in their chairs like all other Parliaments have done and let it go. 
It does not matter if we are left or right; we can write a common 
sense bill. We can look at it, think about it and then think of our 
children.
<P>
	I doubt seriously if there is one of the 295 members in the 
House who could stand and say: ``It really does not apply to me 
because drugs have never had an effect on my life''. If we look at 
grandchildren, nephews, nieces, friends and families all around 
us we will find somebody. I guarantee it. That is how widespread 
it is. Yet we are making it better and better for those who want to 
sell,  traffic or make a living in bringing these drugs into our 
country.
<P>
	I hope the words I have said today do not fall upon deaf ears. I 
can guarantee that most of the ridings I visited prior to the 
election and after are worried about the economy, about the 
deficit, about the jobless, and about many other things. However 
right behind their first worry is their worry about the safety of 
their children and their grandchildren, their grandmothers and 
their grandfathers.
<P>
	Only last week I appeared on a talk show in Calgary where it 
was suggested to me that crime was not nearly as bad as it used 
to be. However the very first phone call was from Catherine, 83 
years of age, living in Calgary which really does not have a high 
rate of crime, violence or things of that nature. She said: ``I live 
alone; I only have my cat. All I want for the rest of my days in 
this world is to have a little peace and security but I cannot even 
sleep at night because I am so afraid''. She lives in a community 
where the seniors are totally afraid that any day somebody is 
going to break in, bash them over the head and steal what they 
have. Most of the time that is done to support some kind of drug 
addiction.
<P>
<B>(1400 ) </B>
<P>
	In the rural community of Wild Rose, in the smaller 
communities police service is not available because they are 
quite far out. These are towns and communities of 200 or 300. I 
invite members to come and look at the bars on the doors and the 
windows of the businesses and homes. Behind the bars are 
law-abiding citizens. That is the only way they can protect their 
property in that part of the country.
<P>
	I wonder where have we come to when law-abiding citizens 
are locked behind bars and the rest are out running around. It 
does not make sense to me and it is time that we did something 
about it.
<P>
	For crying out loud, take a good look at Bill C-7. Do not brag 
about what a wonderful thing it is until you do so. If you cannot 
see what I have seen going through that, I suggest that you go to 
an eye doctor and have the doctor take a good look at your eyes 
because that piece of paper will not solve the problems that this 
country needs solved.
<P>
	I encourage members to vote down this bill and then go back 
and get serious about addressing these problems. Be prepared to 
go out into the country and the communities and say to the 
people that you are going to draft some legislation that is going 
to stop protecting the criminal. We are going to put a stop to you 
being a potential victim because we are going to start 
concentrating on the criminal from another aspect. Instead of 
seeing what we can do to keep him safe and to make sure his 
rights are looked after, we are going to see what we can do about 
putting him away where he belongs so you as a law-abiding 
citizen can enjoy a little peace and security in your own land.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1576"> 1576 </A></B>
<P>
	We can do it. Let us do it. But we are not going to do it with 
Bill C-7.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time you have given me 
today. This is serious. Some members may not want to take it so 
seriously. It is more fun to make noise on that side than it is to 
get serious, but they had better be serious because this is killing 
this country.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to support the second reading of the 
controlled drugs and substances act.
<P>
	This government recognizes the need for legislative reform to 
modernize and improve the drug abuse provisions currently 
contained in the Narcotic Control Act and parts III and IV of the 
Food and Drugs Act.
<P>
	In fact some of the present legislation is over 30 years old and 
is ill suited to deal with law enforcement requirements arising 
from the dangerous and complex Canadian drug scene of the 
1990s. As the Minister of Health has already pointed out, drugs 
have a devastating impact on our society, particularly our youth.
<P>
	The health minister has described to this House why this bill 
is important and how it will help safeguard the health of 
Canadians.
<P>
	It is true that drug use has slightly diminished in recent years 
but that has been countered by the increasing potency of drugs, 
the new and dangerous ways in which drugs are injected and 
increasing use of different drugs in lethal combinations.
<P>
	New emerging trends in drug abuse include hydroponic 
cultivation of potent strains of marijuana, the clandestine 
manufacture of designer drugs such as PCP imitations and the 
sale to children and teenagers alike of so-called look alike 
drugs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Obviously, this legislation, which was passed 30 years ago, 
can no longer keep up with new drug trends today. The new bill 
will make Canadian drug control legislation meet the needs of 
the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Minister of Health has already made clear the important 
health dimensions of this bill. As Solicitor General I want to 
discuss the equally important aspects of the law enforcement 
dimensions of the proposed legislation.
<P>
	The increasing complexity of the drug scene has been 
matched by the increasing sophistication of drug traffickers and 
their ability to evade conventional police methods of fighting 
drug trafficking.
<P>
	In the past the courts have repeatedly recognized that ordinary 
police methods are often ineffective in investigating drug 
offences. They have suggested on more than one occasion that 
legislation needs to be passed that would expressly authorize 
our police forces to carry out effective undercover operations 
against drug traffickers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The controlled drugs and substances act which we are 
presenting will meet this need and give police the statutory 
instruments needed to fight drug traffickers in a way that 
complies with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This bill will also help us fulfil our international obligations 
related to the suppression of drug trafficking. In 1990 for 
example the United Nations convention against illicit traffic in 
narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances came into force in 
Canada. This international agreement is currently in force in 
over 70 countries. It provides for co-operation between nations 
and is aimed at suppressing the illicit traffic in various 
psychoactive drugs and the chemicals used in their clandestine 
manufacture.
<P>
	This convention also calls for the use of specialized 
investigative techniques which are often necessary to infiltrate 
sophisticated trafficking operations and to identify and bring to 
justice the ring leaders and their helpers.
<P>
	Techniques such as ``reverse sting'' or ``sell bust'' operations 
have been used by police forces in other countries to excellent 
effect in the fight against sophisticated drug trafficking 
organizations. During this type of sting operation it is frequently 
necessary for the police to sell small quantities of drugs to the 
traffickers to establish credibility and further the investigation.
<P>
	Until now, however, such an operation in Canada has had no 
basis in legislation and has therefore been open to legal 
challenge. The new bill will confirm that the police have the 
statutory foundation they need to carry out such operations. This 
bill will also allow Canada to fulfil its obligations under two 
other international conventions: a single convention on narcotic 
drugs and the convention on psychotropic substances. The bill 
will do this using a four point approach.
<P>
	First, it will provide for controls on the import, export, 
production and distribution of psychoactive substances while at 
the same time allowing for the use of the substances for medical, 
scientific and industrial purposes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1577"> 1577 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, it will provide a control on the import and export 
of precursors, which are chemical substances used to produce 
controlled substances.
<P>
	Third, it will enhance enforcement measures available to all 
police services, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and 
provincial and municipal police forces to suppress unlawful 
import, export, production and distribution of psychoactive 
substances.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	It will provide for the forfeiture of any property used to 
commit such offences. On the home front this bill will make it 
easier for the police to deal with those who produce illegal 
drugs.
<P>
	Under the old legislation new drugs were not considered to be 
illegal until they were analysed and identified. Needless to say 
this process took time. This bill instead uses a broad description 
to define psychoactive drugs. In the future new drugs appearing 
on the street that fit this new generic description would 
automatically be covered by the bill. This would give the police 
the authority to arrest traffickers dealing in these new illicit 
drugs.
<P>
	Last but by no means least, this bill will help us better protect 
our young people. I do not think anyone in this House would 
argue with the statement that our children represent our most 
precious resource and that we must do everything in our power 
to protect them.
<P>
	Unfortunately one of the facts of modern life is that our young 
people are often the most vulnerable to the temptations of drug 
use. Drug traffickers know this and take full advantage of any 
opportunity to peddle their deadly products in places where 
young people congregate. Today's schools and even 
playgrounds are no longer safe from the attentions of drug 
traffickers.
<P>
	To help protect children from this influence, the bill will 
introduce new criteria known as aggravating factors to assist 
judges in determining sentences for drug traffickers. Examples 
of these factors include dealing drugs in a school, near a school 
or to minors or involving minors in drug trafficking operations.
<P>
	There are also other aggravating factors, such as previous 
drug convictions, possession of a weapon or the use of violence 
while engaged in drug trafficking. These are laid out in the bill.
<P>
	Generally under these new provisions a convicted drug 
trafficker can expect to receive a stiffer sentence, particularly a 
jail term. Judges who do not impose a prison term in such 
circumstances will be required to give the reasons for their 
decision.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe that the Controlled Drugs and 
Substances Act will give Canadians the tool they need to better 
protect their health which is threatened by the harmful effects of 
drugs.
<P>
	From the Solicitor General's point of view, in terms of 
enforcement, this bill will give the police the power they need to 
organize more effective anti-drug operations, especially against 
major traffickers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The proposed legislation will broaden the impact of existing 
proceeds of crime legislation which allows the police and the 
courts to strip the traffickers of the profits of their criminal 
enterprises. This bill will also enable the police to deliver a 
more forceful one-two punch to drug traffickers to severely 
curtail their deadly trade.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is the kind of approach that the people, the courts and the 
police have rightly demanded to deal with this type of criminal 
justice problem and our government is committed to such an 
approach.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I ask members on all sides of the House to give early and full 
support to this bill.
<P>
	I have listened to the concerns raised by opposition 
spokespersons about it. I believe those concerns should and will 
be addressed in committee when the bill is considered in detail 
following second reading. This is the place to go into the 
concerns that have been raised about the bill, its purposes, its 
approach and so on.
<P>
	Therefore I urge hon. members to give early second reading to 
the bill to enable it to go quickly to committee so that all the 
points raised by opposition spokespersons and by other 
members in the House can be looked at and dealt with in the 
seriousness with which they were raised in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1415 ) </B>
<P>
	I say this because I believe this bill will provide important 
additional tools to the enforcement community and the courts to 
fight the drug problem everywhere in this country.
<P>
	Again, I ask this House to give this bill its early and full 
support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
instructive things when one has been on the opposition side of 
the benches and one moves to the government side allows one to 
look back at how one referred to a bill when one was in 
opposition. I encourage the members opposite to do that.
<P>
	I have taken the opportunity to go back into the committee 
hearings and look at comments made by the hon. member when 
he sat over here.
<P>
	Is it appropriate, Mr. Speaker, for me to refer to one comment 
made by one member when that member was in the opposition?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I believe so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1578"> 1578 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> This comment was made on this bill 
when the hon. member was in opposition: ``As I have told you, 
the subject has not been given any media attention at all. Yet 
I understand it was given first reading almost a year ago in June 
1992. To rush through it within a couple of months will not 
speak well of Parliament, to say the least''.
<P>
	When the present government was in opposition a bill was 
introduced very quickly by the Conservatives, put into 
committee with a very similar undertaking, not well thought out 
in this House at all. As the committee comments will show, there 
were serious problems. I ask the government to listen very 
carefully in this House to the problems with this bill before it 
goes to committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are not asking that the bill be dealt 
with without debate or without consideration of the concerns 
that have been raised or are yet to be raised. However, the format 
of consideration of legislation under the rules is such that the 
way to respond to these concerns is to do so in the course of 
committee proceedings and then through the report stage 
following committee proceedings.
<P>
	There are a lot of points that have been raised which are quite 
technical which apply to individual clauses of the bill, for 
example, and I will not attempt to deal with them now. Second 
reading debate enables us to discuss these matters broadly but 
does not enable us to make the kinds of changes which may or 
may not be required in the light of parliamentary considerations.
<P>
	That is why I am not saying that there should be no debate but 
that the best vehicle for examining in depth the kinds of 
concerns that have been raised and making changes, if they turn 
out to be changes that are necessary, is in the parliamentary 
committee. It will look at this bill in the next stage of debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had the 
pleasure almost a year ago of attending a conference on crime 
prevention and community safety. It was chaired by a member 
who is no longer with us, Mr. Horner, I believe.
<P>
	I was very impressed when I went to the conference because it 
was an all-parliamentary committee that produced a unanimous 
report. The committee took the approach that crime prevention 
could be best handled through better enforcement as well as 
social development.
<P>
	I bring that up because in this past campaign I tried not to play 
politics with the whole issue of crime, justice and law 
enforcement. What impressed me was that there was 
all-parliamentary agreement. Every member of each political 
party had the same position in the committee when the report 
was finally put in place.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	I would really hope that approach will continue with this bill. 
The reason I say that is that the problem of crime is a complex 
one which the committee report stated very ably.
<P>
	If we as a country, not just political parties, are going to be 
able to deal with the issues of crime we cannot look for 
simplistic solutions. We have to understand the complexity of it. 
It behoves us all to try to give it the serious consideration it 
deserves.
<P>
	If one looks at models in different communities or different 
countries, when Canada is compared to the United States of 
America, we are an incredibly good model. Our communities 
are a lot safer, there is a lot less crime, we have fewer people in 
prison and we do not execute people. We have a much safer 
community than they have in the United States of America.
<P>
	We have to look at the issues as to why that is. It is important 
that as much as possible we take the politics out of it. Partisan 
politics are dealing with issues that have such an impact on our 
nation and our communities. We have to work together to solve 
the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Waterloo has 
made some very important comments. They reflect his own 
professional experience working with young people who have 
had difficulties. I am glad to see him here in this House to 
provide us with the benefit of not only his experience but also 
his wisdom.
<P>
	I look forward to this House approaching these kinds of 
matters with the same type of constructive and non-partisan 
approach which reflected the report about which the hon. 
member spoke and which was published in the last Parliament.
<P>
	We are dealing with serious matters involving the fabric of 
our communities. We are dealing with serious matters involving 
our young people and their future. They are very complex. 
Certainly no one piece of legislation, whether it is this piece of 
legislation before us or any piece of legislation, can deal with all 
the complexities by itself.
<P>
	Certainly we need to make a serious effort toward crime 
prevention. That is why this government is working to bring 
forward a national crime prevention council. Certainly we need 
measures of rehabilitation. That is why this government is 
moving to bring forward amendments to the corrections and 
conditional relief act.
<P>
	There is also a place for enforcement unfortunately but it has 
to be addressed and recognized. That is why we are bringing this 
legislation forward. It is to deal with the enforcement aspect of a 
very serious part of the concern for the breakdown of law and 
order in this country, that is traffic in drugs.
<P>
	I ask the House to approach this and similar legislation on the 
basis of the very good advice given us by the hon. member for 
Waterloo. I hope in considering this matter they will recognize 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1579"> 1579 </A></B>
<P>
that this piece of legislation is a  serious and well intentioned 
attempt to deal with not all aspects but one aspect and an 
important one of the very serious problem linked with traffic in 
drugs.
<P>
	It is in that context that I invite the House to consider it, to 
debate it, and to give it relatively prompt second reading so that 
in committee we can approach it in the spirit urged on us by the 
hon. member for Waterloo and as a result, come out with the best 
possible legislation to address a very serious concern.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my concern is precisely the importance of this bill 
and its emphasis on the justice system that we have heard so 
many people talk about this afternoon.
<P>
	It is a very serious area of concern. It confuses me why this 
bill would be passed on to the health committee to be looked at 
rather than the justice committee. I and many others would feel 
more comfortable if this were going before the justice 
committee to look at those issues that have serious 
consequences long term rather than it being referred to the 
health committee.
<P>
	Perhaps if there was some change in that, more of us would 
feel more comfortable.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, the very same thought has crossed 
my mind. I intend, after consultation with the Minister of 
Health, to see if there would be some disposition in the House to 
amend the motion for second reading to have this bill referred to 
the justice committee.
<P>
	Looking over the bill in preparation for taking part in the 
debate, frankly the very same thoughts went through my mind as 
were expressed by the hon. member. If we present a motion to 
amend the motion for second reading to have the justice 
committee consider this matter, I hope we will have the support 
of the hon. member and others for the reasons she has 
mentioned.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to make a 
suggestion to the House. The minister began his intervention at 
two o'clock. Under the Standing Orders-we are presently 
under Standing Order 74-he would have had 20 minutes to 
speak and 10 minutes for questions and comments for a total of 
30 minutes. This will bring us to the magical hour of 2.30 which 
is the agreed upon hour to terminate today's sitting.
<P>
	The minister spoke for 15 minutes. If I could be allowed to be 
so creative we could extend the question and comments by five 
minutes, which will still represent the 30-minute allotment that 
is allowed the minister on a subject of such great interest, as I 
see many people still seeking the floor. In the five minutes left I 
will recognize both the member for Wild Rose and the member 
for Portneuf, recognizing that both these members have already 
spoken, that the preamble will be short and the questions 
succinct, to allow the minister to respond before 2.30.
<P>
	I will begin by recognizing the member for Wild Rose, if the 
House agrees.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
friend from B.C. took care of the question I had. I will pass to the 
next person.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In fairness, would there 
be anyone else from the Reform Party who would care to take the 
time. The member for Macleod, with the same consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, the comment made 
that we could have the justice committee involved in this bill 
certainly satisfies a lot of my concerns. However, the medical 
community needs to be represented as well. So it looks to me as 
if the committee might well need to have joint responsibility.
<P>
	Could the minister comment please?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will have to see what we can do 
under the rules. But I would remind my hon. friend that under 
the rules any member can attend any committee, even a 
committee in which that member is not a regular participant, and 
take part in the discussions. In fact, a committee like the justice 
committee-if that is the way it turns out-could and would 
have to have the Minister of Health and her officials appear.
<P>
	If it turned out that the justice committee would be the best 
overall vehicle, this would not exclude consideration of the 
health aspects or prevent members who are more interested in 
the health aspect from participating. That is my understanding 
of the rules.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, so that the 
Solicitor General can understand the context of my comment, I 
can tell him that my question deals with the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms. Bill C-7 criminalizes dealing in controlled 
drugs, as well as import and export of those drugs. This is 
already in the present Act, and we have no problems with that. 
The bill also criminalizes possession of property obtained as a 
result of certain offences, but this is also in section 19 of the 
current legislation, so I see no problem here either. But perhaps 
you could tell me whether or not you anticipate any problems 
with respect to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	We also know that concerning the laundering of proceeds of 
certain offences, section 19 of the current legislation and clause 
10 of the bill are pretty similar. Regarding search, seizure and 
detention, clause 12 is the equivalent of sections 11 and 12 of the 
Narcotic Control Act. As for the power of infiltration and 
making supervised sales, clause 54(2) of the new bill provides 
for things that were essentially covered already under section 18 
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1580"> 1580 </A></B>
<P>
	However, where there is a departure from all this, it is in the 
powers given to the inspector. And I will conclude my question 
here. We know that, on the one hand, there are administrative 
powers used by the inspector and, on the other hand, there are 
judicial powers-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I hesitate to 
interrupt the hon. member for Portneuf, but the minister will 
have very little time left to respond. The hon. member has had 
the opportunity to make an eloquent speech on this very 
important matter. Seeing that time is running out, if the Solicitor 
General could please respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray (Windsor West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I intend to read 
over carefully the meaty speech of the Bloc Quebecois critic as 
it raised very complex and interesting issues.
<P>
	I would like to respond briefly to his last comments. He feels 
that a certain section of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act 
gives police sufficient powers to control sales, but based on 
court decisions and legal opinions from our counsels, it is not 
enough. That is why we came up with clause 54(2).
<P>
	I may not be an expert in the field, but it seems to me that the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act cannot give powers to other 
police forces, like the Sûreté du Québec or the OPP, the Ontario 
Provincial Police. That is why we need the amendments 
proposed in this bill.
<P>
	I can assure you that I take great interest in preserving the 
freedoms guaranteed to Canadians from coast to coast under the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, it is the 
duty of the Justice Department to let us know whether or not a 
bill meets constitutional requirements, including those set in the 
charter. Without their advice, no bill could be tabled in this 
House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The interesting comments made by my hon. friend indicate 
why, although there is a place and a need for general debate, in 
my opinion we should get this bill into committee as quickly as 
possible so that we can deal in depth with the very interesting 
points the hon. member has made and so that we can give all 
possible explanations and assurances with respect to the charter 
of rights and freedoms and in general with respect to the 
foundation and need for this law.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to conclude 
by thanking the minister and all members present for their 
co-operation.
<P>
	It being 2.30 p.m. this House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.30 p.m.)
