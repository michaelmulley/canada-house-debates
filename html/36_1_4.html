</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to include the terms “nutrition 
services” in the definition of “insured health services” within the 
present Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nutrition is an essential component of an individual's health. 
We know that Canadian dieticians are the only health professionals 
with the proper training and skills to assess a person's 
nutritional health.  Moreover, the Canadian government recognizes 
them as a key resource in drawing up health policies such as 
Canada's Food Guide, which provides guidelines for a healthy diet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore believe that it is important, both for the public 
and for the professional association of dieticians, that they be 
officially recognized and integrated into the Canada Health Act.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>AGREEMENT ON INTERNAL TRADE IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK25">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-203, an act to amend the Agreement on Internal 
Trade Implementation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to introduce my 
private member's bill, an act to amend the Agreement on Internal 
Trade Implementation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement on internal trade, which was signed nearly three 
years ago, was a start.  However, it has not been completed.  The 
main obstacle to completion has been the term consensus which was 
used by the negotiating committee comprising of cabinet, 
representatives from the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee has interpreted consensus to mean unanimity. 
Therefore, any one government, regardless of the population it 
represents, can impede the progress of the agreement and of the 
Canadian economic union.  This is what has happened many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill will allow the federal government to use its 
constitutional responsibility under sections 91 and 121 of the 
Canadian Constitution to complete sections of the agreement on 
internal trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that this action will only be taken in 
situations where a co-operative agreement between the provinces 
has been sought and has not been reached.  This proposed approval 
formula will require the agreement of at least two-thirds of the 
provinces that have at least 50 percent of the Canadian population. This 
provision will facilitate the removal of internal trade barriers 
and present growth opportunities to Canadian businesses which 
previously have been restricted by these interprovincial trade 
barriers.

<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-204, an act to require that in the 
advertising and at the opening of a cultural project supported by 
public money a public acknowledgement of the grant be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the Liberals speak quite frequently of 
protecting Canada's culture which is a very noble cause I am 
sure.  They speak of it in terms of motherhood and apple pie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that many times Canadians are appalled at the 
choices they make or the people who they assign to make the 
choices of the projects.  Furthermore, there seems to be a lack 
of accountability of those dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to raise awareness of Canadians to 
the choices that the appointees of the Liberals are making. 
Second, it will give some acknowledgement to the long suffering 
taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the positive, it is my contention in this bill that when the 
decision-makers are aware that their choices are going to be made 
public they will be making more responsible choices.

<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-205, an act to provide for parliamentary 
scrutiny and approval of user fees set by federal authority and 
to require public disclosure of the amount collected as user 
fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this is a bill to provide for 
parliamentary scrutiny and approval of user fees set by federal 
authority and to require public disclosure of the amount 
collected as user fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1993 auditor general's report the AG said:  “We are 
concerned that Parliament cannot readily scrutinize the user fees 
established by contracts and other non-regulatory means. There 
does not exist a government wide summary of the fees being 
charged, the revenues raised and the authorities under which they 
are established”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The design of this bill is to ensure that there is scrutiny and 
that we get a handle on the fact that revenues from user fees 
have doubled in the last 10 years under Liberal and Tory 
governments, something that should concern all Canadians.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE

<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am in receipt of a notice of motion 
under Standing Order 52 from the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 52 to seek leave to 
move a motion to adjourn the House for the purposes of having an 
emergency debate on the multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With your permission I will say a word or two as to why I am 
seeking that emergency debate.  This is an agreement which is 
presently being negotiated in the context of the OECD between 
Canada and other OECD countries.  It is an agreement which when 
arrived at will bind Canada for 20 years.  It will tie the hands 
of future Parliaments.  It is an agreement which has not been 
debated in the House. The government has signalled no intention 
to have it debated in the House or to have an appropriate public 
consultation process.  It is an issue which concerns a great many 
Canadians with respect to sovereignty and the ability of 
governments to act in the public interest and the increasing 
restrictions on that ability of governments to act in the public 
interest and in the common good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it only makes sense that we use this standing order to 
allow ourselves the opportunity to debate this particular 
agreement, to hear what the government has to say and to hear 
what other members of Parliament have to say on this very 
important matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair has heard the 
representations of the hon. member and has made a review of the 
material submitted in respect of the application.  While no doubt 
the matter is of considerable interest, the Chair does not take 
the view that this is a matter of emergency or one that would 
justify setting aside the normal business of the House in order 
to debate the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the House is currently debating the address in reply 
from the Speech from the Throne which offers a very general 
debate in which members are free to make remarks on any subject 
they wish.  I would like the hon. member to participate in that 
debate in respect of this matter at this time.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SPEECH FROM THE THRONE 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from September 24 consideration of the 
motion for an address to His Excellency the Governor General in 
reply to his speech at the opening of the session, of the 
amendment and of the amendment to the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure and an honour to take 
part in this reply to the Speech from the Throne which was laid 
before the House two days ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has presented a comprehensive agenda, one that 
speaks to the basic values of Canadians.  It ensures opportunity 
for all members of society in all regions of the nation and 
creates jobs, especially for our young.  It ensures universal 
quality health care for all.  It provides every child with a fair 
chance in life, as the prime minister spoke so eloquently about 
yesterday, and it maintains a united country able to fulfill 
these values and reach the dreams he talked of yesterday in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne outlined Canada's ability to trade 
with and draw investment from all parts of the globe.  This is 
essential to the success of that agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to international trade, the Speech from the Throne 
addressed four key elements.  The first outlined the important 
role trade plays in the economic life of Canada.  Most important, 
it is absolutely crucial to the creation of jobs.  One out of 
three Canadian jobs is directly tied to trade.  Forty per cent of 
our GDP is directly tied to exports and trade, which is one of 
the highest, if not the highest, percentages of any western 
economic base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian sales abroad come to more than a quarter of a trillion 
dollars.  Every $1 billion of trade in merchandise creates or 
sustains 11,000 jobs for Canadian workers. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of trade extend to every part of our economy and 
affect all Canadians, the farmer who grows wheat, the engineer who 
designs tractors and the factory worker who builds planes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all touched by trade and we all share in its benefits. 
Around the world barriers are coming down, markets are opening up 
and opportunities are being created which were simply 
unimaginable a few years ago, opportunities which are absolutely 
critical to Canada's continued economic prosperity.  Canadians 
have come to the full realization that we are too small a nation 
to simply to trade with each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Speech from the Throne underscores that to take full 
advantage of these opportunities we must expand our trade base 
further.  To do so governments must work better and smarter. 
Departments must speak to each other in a consistent single 
message.  We must seek closer partnerships with the business 
community.  We must redefine the role our trade associations and 
chambers can play for business people who are seeking new markets 
abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Expansion will ultimately mean that small and medium size 
businesses will have to play a greater role in Canada's global 
trade.  They must become a more integral part and focus of our 
global trade strategy.  Currently only 10 percent of Canada's 
small and medium size firms directly export.  A great number of 
small businesses are suppliers that feed the large corporations 
that do trade.  We know there is more room to grow for small and 
medium size businesses in the world of export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Canada is very much an exporting nation, we have not 
become a nation of exporters.  Fifty large corporations account 
for over 50 percent of Canada's trade.  Our goal therefore is to 
double the number of companies exporting by the year 2000, which 
will mean a greater take up by the small and medium size firms. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1030
<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only logical that if we point to small businesses being 
the cornerstone of our domestic economy, if we speak to small 
businesses creating the jobs in all of our communities, it stands 
to reason that by increasing and encouraging more small 
businesses to join our large ones on the international field we 
will reap the very same benefits that these enterprises give our 
communities domestically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be successful in this doubling of the number of companies 
which will be in the export business, it will also mean 
harnessing the energy and talent of our women entrepreneurs, for 
one-third of Canadian firms today are either owned or led by 
women entrepreneurs, firms that are providing almost two million 
jobs for Canadians across the country. On top of it all, women 
CEOs are creating jobs at a rate nearly four times the national 
average.  This is a track record that we cannot ignore because 
clearly it is creating benefits that we cannot forgo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in November I will be leading the first Canadian 
business women's international trade mission to Washington, D.C. 
We expect more than 100 women entrepreneurs and executives will 
join us in exploring the lucrative $11 billion mid-Atlantic 
market.  This mission will include new entries to the export 
field and experienced exporters who will perform the important 
role of mentoring. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cultural and educational sectors will also be part of a team 
marketing products that generate wealth and employment while enhancing 
Canada's image in the world and making us proud to be Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Utilizing the capacity of our modern economy and the diversity 
and strength of our citizens, the entire world must be Canada's 
market.  Therefore we are building on our transatlantic heritage 
to Europe and our close links with the United States. Of course 
we are a Pacific nation as well and our view of the Americas does 
not stop at the Rio Grande. Canadians have links to every corner 
of the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People and companies trade with countries they feel most 
comfortable with, in languages they can speak and in cultures 
they understand. That is one of Canada's biggest advantages. 
Indeed it is Canada's competitive advantage in the sense that no 
part of the world is alien to our Canadian citizenry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than anything else the team Canada missions which our Prime 
Minister began have demonstrated these very strengths and are 
broadening the spectrum of Canadians involved in global trade. 
Large as well as small and medium size firms, women 
entrepreneurs, Canadians of all origins and backgrounds, 
provinces, municipalities, educational institutions, all are on 
team Canada thereby giving Canadians a stake in every part of the 
world and every part of the world a stake in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am confident that the next team Canada voyage in 
January to Latin America will continue this winning tradition and 
above all will promote the formula that Canada works best when 
Canada works together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third element raised by the Speech from the Throne is that 
we must devote the same kind of energies and effort to attracting 
investment as we do to stimulating trade in merchandise. Direct 
foreign investment in Canada increased by some 8 percent last year, 
reaching almost $180 billion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investments bring us capital, research and development, as well as 
strategic and financial alliances that can help small businesses move 
from exclusively regional to world markets. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately investment generates jobs. 
For every $1 billion worth of investment in Canada, 45,000 jobs 
over a five year period are created or sustained. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT8"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT8"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035
<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the multilateral agreement on investment which 
we are negotiating currently with the OECD will provide us with a 
secure and stable framework of rules for Canadians investing 
abroad.  That investment is sizeable.  At the end of last year 
Canadian investment not only by companies but by pension funds of 
our seniors and Canadians across the country was estimated at 
over $170 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To promote more investment in Canada however, we must be even 
more aggressive in promoting Canada around the world.  The world 
is growing ever more competitive by the day.  As more countries 
industrialize we cannot assume that our share of global 
investment will remain constant.  In fact in a number of 
countries while our investment and our trade is going up, our 
market share in that region is going down.  It means that we 
cannot rest on our past laurels.  It means that we have to 
compete with the best.  We have to keep up with the Joneses and 
sometimes you are as good as your last trade deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is a priority for me and this government to put 
forward the case for Canada and to remind people around the world 
that the country the UN found to be the best place to live is 
also one of the best places to work and to invest.  It is to 
remind people, as the Prime Minister did yesterday, of the 
extraordinary efforts that this government placed in putting our 
economy and our finances on a solid footing; yes, for Canadians 
at home first and foremost, but at the same time making it more 
attractive for investors abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally the Speech from the Throne emphasized the leadership 
role that Canada plays and must continue to play in liberalizing 
trade around the globe.  Freer trade has been positive for 
Canada.  Over the past few years our export figures have 
increased exponentially.  It is no accident that Canada is 
expected to record the highest rate of employment and growth of 
all the G-7 countries this year and next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note however that if trade has been 
successful for Canada—and it has—we can attract investment and 
promote more trade as long as we are dealing in a transparent, 
rules based system of law.  That assures nations like ours the 
opportunity of equal treatment with larger trading partners. 
Rules for Canada and for other countries are the equalizer.  That 
is why Canada must always help to write the rules and not walk 
away from the table where the rules are being written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is the successful Canada-U.S. trade relationship, the 
largest that the world knows—every day $1 billion moves in trade 
between our two countries quietly and effectively and it is 95 percent 
hassle free, so at no time should we allow the 5 percent of irritants to 
define this great relationship—or whether it is in helping to 
set the agenda at the World Trade Organization, it is this rules 
based system which has allowed us to reduce our barriers to trade 
while at the same time promoting our vital interests as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is also helping to draw the countries of Asia-Pacific 
closer together, a region which includes the world's fastest 
growing economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the Prime Minister signed an action plan with the 
European Community that speaks to a strong and dynamic future, 
including increased trade and investment, rather than simply 
resting on past glories, as great as those glories were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is also championing the free trade area of the Americas 
and is seeking a closer relationship with the countries of 
Mercosur.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago in Miami, the concept of a free trade zone of the 
Americas seemed a far off dream. Three weeks ago in Brazil, I became 
convinced more than ever before that plans for a trade agreement 
covering the entire hemisphere are about to materialize. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely vital that Canada continues to look outward not 
inward, because if the world moves without you—and make no 
mistake that the global march is very much on—then who really 
gets left behind? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world has experienced protectionism and has suffered through 
its consequences. The protectionist rage which snapped a golden 
age of trade in the U.S. in the 1930s turned a severe recession 
into a great depression.  The world learned from this rather dark 
lesson, leading to Bretton Woods and the creation of an 
international rules based trading system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that we cannot build a fortress and lock 
ourselves inside.  Neither is our goal free trade at any cost. On 
the contrary, we must always preserve and promote the values and 
traditions that Canadians hold dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade and investment are simply not a matter of crunching 
numbers or posting figures.  The bottom line for trade should be 
and must always be people, and their bottom line is jobs.  It 
provides the revenue we need to maintain a quality life and a 
universal health care system.  It provides those revenues, the 
national wealth we need to secure a good start for all of our 
Canadian children and to provide opportunities for all Canadians 
in all parts of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Prime Minister talked of trying to help youngsters 
get on to the other side of the fence, to lower the fence and to 
help them see the other side which as he said is always greener. 
I believe that on the matter of trade, Canada is doing just that. 
It is jumping over that fence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not too many years ago that our country contemplated a 
free trade agreement with the United States.  There were 
concerns, indeed fears, among Canadian communities of whether 
this deal would work for Canada, of whether we would be able to 
survive, of whether we would be able to be competitive with the 
largest economic market the world knows. Thanks to a rules based 
system and thanks to an independent way of breaking those log 
jams, not only has Canada been able to survive, but Canada has 
been able to win. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we went on to sign NAFTA, and a free trade agreement 
with Chile, and a free trade agreement with Israel.  Canadians 
obviously have recognized the absolute necessity of connecting 
with the bigger world outside of Canada for the purposes of 
keeping our economy strong and prosperous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has rare strengths and enormous potential.  We are 
competent, we are competitive and we are confident.  In the world 
of global trade and investment, Canada has come of age. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take this opportunity to welcome the minister to 
his new portfolio.  As he said during his speech, trade is a very 
important area for Canada.   He noted that barriers to trade are 
coming down worldwide and that Canada is very dependent upon 
trade.  I would agree with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the Liberal caucus to the area of free trade.  One by 
one, the Liberals are slowly becoming believers.  It was not 
always the case.  In some cases they are actually born again free 
traders.  I welcome that conversion, albeit a little bit late. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned with the government's approach in a few areas and 
would like to ask the minister some questions on that.  I am 
concerned about its approach to adopting new trade regimes around 
the world such as a new trade deal with Chile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now talking about one with Mercosur, which I welcome, but 
we have not done the homework to make it possible for our 
businesses to take advantage.  We have the worst record in the 
G-7 countries of trade barriers within our own country.  As a 
matter of fact, we have more barriers to trade in Canada than 
there are in the entire European Union.  That is simply not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister talks about barriers coming down, I suggest 
the next time team Canada is out on a mission perhaps it should 
take a team Canada mission right here at home to dismantle trade 
barriers that are making it very difficult for our businesses to 
take advantage of our trade deals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact a private member's bill was introduced this morning by 
my colleague from Lakeland talking about just that.  I would hope 
the Liberals on the other side would support that private 
member's bill and maybe even lift it up and adopt it as their own 
to get rid of the trade barriers that are limiting us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned that the government is not using the 
processes the minister talked about to settle disputes.  We have 
a very good dispute settling mechanism within NAFTA and now 
within the World Trade Organization.  What happened when it came 
time to use them on durum wheat a couple of years ago, softwood 
lumber and Helms-Burton?  They never used the processes that were 
put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the minister to tell me why and what they will do 
about that instead of accepting export caps and accepting 
intimidation from the United States.  I want to know why we are 
not using the processes that have been put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know what the government is doing to bring down 
internal trade barriers in this country.  At our committee on 
small and medium size enterprises we heard businesses state that 
they had actually moved from Ontario into Michigan because they 
could do better trade with the provinces in Canada that way than 
they could from Ontario.  That is simply unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will they do to correct this problem?  What will they do 
about using the processes we have in place to settle disputes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me first 
congratulate my hon. friend for being appointed as his party's 
spokesperson on international trade.  I say to him and to his 
colleagues that I very much look forward to working with him on 
this important file to the benefit, ultimately, of Canadians and 
the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also touched upon the history of the Liberal Party.  I urge 
him to reread the history of political parties a little more 
carefully.  If he did so he would see very clearly that the 
history of the Liberal Party has always been one of a trade 
liberalizing party, a party favouring and wanting to bring down 
barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, the history of the party he and many of his 
colleagues supported before the Reform Party, namely the 
Conservative Party, has always been one of protectionism and 
building up the walls.  In terms of the free trade agreement 
debates and the NAFTA debates, yes, our party had something to 
say; but our party, whether it was Mr. Turner, our former leader, 
or our trade critics at the time, never said that we were against 
freer trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We stood up for fair trade.  We stood up for and spoke to a rule 
based mechanism.  We spoke to a dispute mechanism that would not 
allow the might to be right but for the dispute to be settled 
based on facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the battles the Liberal Party has fought, which has 
resulted in the side agreements on both labour and environment 
and the rules we as a country need to survive and obviously do 
very well.  I think the member has the history on that issue 
quite backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the business community not being prepared to 
look as aggressively to a free trade area of the Americas or 
Mercosur.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Our business 
community is incredibly bullish in the opportunities it perceives 
for companies in our country in the area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our trade has shot up.  Our investments in Brazil, Argentina, 
Chile and Mexico have gone up.  It has actually come from the 
business community for us to be facilitating trade by getting our 
policy signals right.  It is very anxious to be in the free trade 
area of the Americas. 
Obviously it is anxious to get on a plan to go with the Prime 
Minister to another team Canada mission in Latin America.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the member is right about internal trade barriers.  He is 
absolutely right that as we liberalize trade around the world, as 
we look to liberalize the Americas or APEC or get closer to 
Europe or the United States, that somehow in a very contradictory 
way these ancient walls still exist in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been working very hard on that file.  My colleague, the 
Minister of Industry, has brought together his provincial 
colleagues numerous times.  There was a reference in our throne 
speech to bringing down those walls.  In the last meeting of the 
premiers I took considerable hope in the fact that all premiers 
but one was prepared to begin to bring down those barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the member and his party to talk to the provinces that 
have fought and resisted those barriers coming down.  It is not 
this government.  We have actually tried to lead the coalition 
and consensus of the provinces to bring down the barriers and 
ultimately make those companies better prepared and more 
competitive to face the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's last point was on dispute mechanisms.  He said that 
we needed to work closely with the business community.  On the 
other hand he said that we had to use those mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to whether we should or should not activate those 
mechanisms quite often it comes from advice from the industry. 
If we take any commodity, many times the overwhelming consensus 
of not wanting to trigger a mechanism does not come essentially 
and exclusively from a government or a minister but from the 
industry.  It too has to size up: “Do we go to the wall?  Do we 
fight on this issue?  Or, do we try to manage the trade so that 
we will forgo the kinds of expenses and the kinds of energies 
obviously implicit in any fight on any mechanism?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned and troubled, if it begins to set a trend, 
that every issue will get managed.  Managed trade is not freer 
trade and one way trade is a dead end.  We have to take stock of 
how the industry feels on a particular issue as opposed to simply 
going to the wall and in the end only hurting the industry even 
more.

Medicine Hat.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of the 10 minute question and answer period is that 
there be an opportunity for a number of members to rise.  I do 
not know why the minister was so particularly anxious about 
receiving a question from the NDP that he used up all the time. 
He was asked a question and he went on and on.  The idea is to 
have a variety of questions and answers.  I did not feel that the 
entire 10 minutes had expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There were approximately 20 to 25 
seconds left in the 10 minutes and the Speaker decided to 
terminate it because I did not feel that a question could be 
asked in 20 seconds and answered in 20 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps members who spoke were long winded for a period of 
questions and comments, but I think the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona who has been in this place a long time knows 
that sometimes the questions are short and the answers are short 
and sometimes they are long in both cases.  This happened to be 
one of those where there was a lengthy question and a lengthy 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry that the hon. member did not get a chance to ask a 
question, but I am sure he will have an opportunity later in the 
day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
start by congratulating Mr. Speaker and his peers on ascending to 
the chair once again.  I know of the Speaker's interest in this 
position.  I know he will enjoy his time even though, as some 
people suggest, it may be a difficult Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also congratulate all members of the House on their election 
to the House of Commons.  It is a great privilege to be here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly thank the constituents of Medicine Hat for placing 
their trust with me once again.  It is a great honour.  I will do 
my level best to ensure that I deliver their message loud and 
clear to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise to address the throne speech delivered on Tuesday by the 
governor general. 
I will touch on what I think is, at least in the economic spirit, 
the key point in the throne speech from which all decisions in it 
will flow.  That is the decision in the spring during the 
election campaign when the government said that it would devote 
about 50 per cent of its surpluses, any surpluses that it 
realized, to new spending.  The other 50 per cent would go toward 
tax relief and debt reduction. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What criteria did the government use to determine how this 
formula would work?  What were the criteria? I do not recall any 
consultation with the people of Canada asking them how they 
wanted to spend any surpluses.  I do not recall that at all.  I 
do not recall any focus groups or any polling.  I do not remember 
any of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago when the government decided it would create a new 
$2 coin, there were consultations to decide what would go on the 
coin.  However there were no consultations on what to do with the 
75 billion $2 coins the taxpayers send to the government every 
year.  There were no consultations on that, but it was very 
committed to ensuring that we got the $2 coin with the polar 
bear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next issue implicit in the government's decision not to 
consult people is its belief that the money from the Canadian 
public actually belongs to the Liberal Party.  That seems to be 
implicit in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here—and it is something successive Liberal and Tory 
governments have missed for a long, long time—is that money 
belongs to Canadian taxpayers.  Canadian taxpayers work hard and 
long, in fact probably longer and harder than just about any 
country in the industrialized world, to produce taxes for the 
government to spend on their behalf.  Certainly it is time for 
governments to recognize this and acknowledge them in the form of 
consultation process.  Unfortunately that did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically in the throne speech, once we get beyond the 
decision to spend 50 per cent on new programs and the decision 
seemingly to spend 50 per cent on tax reduction and debt 
reduction, we encounter the actual words in the speech.  There is 
one line about tax relief and debt reduction.  We should gild it. 
It should be framed.  It is on page 4 and is the only reference 
in the whole document.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will seek to devote one-half of the surplus in this mandate to 
addressing the social and economic needs of Canadians.  The other 
half will go to a combination of reducing taxes and the national 
debt. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does it go after that?  For the next 20 pages all we hear 
are plans on how to spend Canadians' money.  It does not even end 
there, because on a subsequent day we have the Prime Minister 
announcing in his speech that we will spend even more money in a 
new endowment the government thinks is necessary for the 
millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we hear that the government is contemplating buying 
helicopters, the self-same helicopters it chastised the 
Conservatives for wanting to buy.  Truly I wonder what is going 
on here.  It is as though Pierre Elliott Trudeau never left this 
place.  There is a social program in every pot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be very concerned.  It has taken us 27 years to get 
out of a deficit situation but the government, ignorant of the 27 
years that have gone before us, now seems intent on going back 
and starting to spend all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big concern—and I am glad to see the media is raising this 
as well—is that the government never set a base line anywhere in 
the document upon which it will determine its surpluses.  Now it 
is very possible that it will spend all its surpluses before we 
even get to a surplus point.  It is already borrowing against 
future surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have a very insignificant surplus.  Therefore we will 
not have the money that should go to Canadians in the form of 
debt retirement and tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One question the government needs to answer very soon is what is 
the base line upon which it will determine what the surpluses 
really are.  Then we can have an honest debate within the narrow 
bounds the government has laid out about how much money should go 
to taxes and debt retirement. 
I am very critical of what is in the throne speech from an 
economic point of view.  I am very disappointed.  However, I 
believe it is the role of the official opposition to also offer 
some constructive criticism.  I would argue that the Reform Party 
has done that in spades over the last few weeks by offering not 
only a discussion paper on some of the alternatives to what we 
could do with the surplus but to inform the debate and start a 
consultation process.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe it is very important to consult with Canadians on 
this issue.  As I pointed out earlier, it is Canadians' money. 
They deserve to have a say in the whole issue. It is a novel 
approach in this place to recognize that the money belongs to 
Canadians.  They worked long and hard for it.  In a moment I will 
tell the House just how long and hard they work compared to 
citizens from other countries around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have produced a document called “Beyond a Balanced Budget”. 
I want to draw from it right now to explain how the Reform Party 
would approach the ad hoc debate that is occurring today in the 
country about what to do with any surplus.  It is ad hoc because 
the government has chosen not to involve Canadians in it. 
However, in our role as official opposition we have decided that 
we would like to do that. We do that by asking seven basic 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, what is a realistic projection of future surpluses once 
the federal books are balanced? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, what is the optimal level of government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, can these surpluses be increased by more responsible 
federal spending? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, what is the optimal level of taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, what is the optimal level of debt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, how can we change the spending patterns of government to 
better reflect the priorities of Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh, if a public consensus can be achieved with respect to 
an appropriate level and pattern of federal spending, taxation 
and indebtedness, what measures are required to ensure the 
federal government respects those targets and lives within its 
means? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the seven questions that we want to put to Canadians. 
We have already started the process and we argue it is something 
that the federal government should do. If Canadians want to read 
this document it is available to them on the Internet at 
www.Reform.ca/babb.  I will try to remember to mention that at 
the end of my speech as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go through some of those seven specific areas to lay out 
why the Reform Party has huge concerns about the whole approach 
the government is taking with what would be a surplus, if the 
government does not spend it all before it actually got there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point comes from the section in our document on the 
size of the surplus.  What is a realistic projection of future 
surpluses once the federal budget is balanced? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point I want to make is that when we use the 
government's own projections we find that probably by the year 
2001 or 2002, which would be the end of its mandate, it will have 
a surplus of approximately $14 billion annually.  That is a very 
conservative estimate.  Others estimate as much as $20 billion. 
Of course, that suggests that the government will be spending 
about $7 billion to $10 billion on new programs every year by the 
end of its mandate.  This is the same sort of increase we had in 
spending during the 1970s that got us into this whole problem in 
the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second section I want to touch on is the part on the optimal 
level of government.  I point out in the second section of our 
paper this quote.  “While provincial spending increased from 2.5 
percent of GDP in 1960 to 6 percent of GDP in 1995 and local 
government spending went from 4.74 percent to almost 6 percent, 
signifying greater participation in the provision of direct goods 
and services in each province, the federal level only dipped from 
6.2 percent of GDP to 4.22 percent of the GDP over the same 
timeframe”.  In other words, the provinces and the 
municipalities have done their part.  In their jurisdictions they 
have done what they needed to do to realize the needs of their 
citizens.  However, at the same time the federal government had 
trouble letting go. It cannot for a moment consider, and this was 
especially true under previous Liberal administrations, letting 
go of some power. I would argue that is one of the reasons we 
have a constitutional problem that never ends.  The neverendum 
they call it, and it is certainly true.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue it is time to look at the optimal level of government. 
We want to talk about responsible federal spending and whether 
these surpluses can be increased.  During the election campaign 
we pointed out how we could shrink the size of government while 
improving services for health care, higher education and research 
and development.  That would leave us with bigger surpluses. In 
the third section we talk about that.  $24 billion in surpluses 
under a Reform government with the chance to implement some of 
our ideas would mean more money for deficit reduction, more money 
for tax reduction and money that would go toward important 
programs like health care and higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fourth section we talk about the optimal level of taxes. 
It is important, especially after the international trade 
minister has spoken, to point out how much we are at a 
competitive disadvantage to other trading partners around the 
world.  In the G-7 Canada is the highest taxed as a percentage of 
personal income tax to GDP of any country, by far. Our personal 
income tax rate is 52 percent higher than the rest of the G-7 nations 
and 25 percent higher than the industrialized countries in the OECD. 
Canada's personal income tax rate is through the roof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has a tremendous negative impact, like the brain drain for 
instance.  We lose all kinds of very highly qualified people to 
the United States and other countries around the world because 
the personal income tax burden drives them away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were able to drop those tax burdens we would have an 
increased labour supply, increased participation in the labour 
force, lower gross wage costs for employers, increased 
entrepreneurship and business start-up. There is no end of 
benefits to lowering personal income tax. It is time for the 
government to start to consider those things, and we want to talk 
to the Canadian public about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fifth section of our paper we talk about the optimal 
level of debt.  We point out the horrendous impact of the debt. 
We pay $47 billion in interest payments on the debt each and 
every year.  That adds up to a tax burden of $3,518 in taxes per 
year or $295 each and every month for every Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had that money to apply to health care, we could run every 
single hospital in the country for two years on one year's 
interest payments on the Canadian debt.  It is time to start 
reducing the debt.  We make that argument forcefully in our paper 
but the government has shut off that option by deciding it is 
going to spend its way to prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next section of the paper we talk about responsible 
spending.  We point out that because of things like interest 
payments on the debt the federal government has reduced its 
transfers for health care by 35 percent.  Yesterday the health minister 
tried to deny that it is 40 percent, so we will grant him that it is 
just 35 percent, $6.8 billion.  And Liberals claim to be members of the 
party of compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have closed more hospitals in the country than any 
provincial government, yet they say that they care about 
Canadians.  If they truly do, it is time for them to come to 
grips with the problem of the debt, with the problem of taxes. 
Specifically, if they get a handle on government spending and 
quit spending more and more and more, they will be able to devote 
more money to the programs Canadians really care about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final section of our paper we talk about the need for 
government to be accountable.  I know that is a novel theme in 
this government.  We know the government has promised in the past 
to be more accountable.  The Liberals talked of ethics, watch 
dogs and that sort of thing but it has never come to be.  We 
argue very strongly that it is time we had balanced budget 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we point out in our paper, a balanced budget law would be an 
important first step in reassuring Canadians from coast to coast 
that the painful tax increases and reductions in the social 
safety net that were made necessary by previous governments will 
never occur again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is in our paper.  We will be going across the 
country during the next several months asking people to help us 
bring forward some recommendations for the federal government, to 
give it a road map so it understands where Canadians are at on 
these important issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outside of the unity debate there is probably not a more 
important issue that the government will deal with in its 
mandate, yet it has decided to shut Canadians out of the process. 
I think that is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole debate reminds me of a mutiny.  It is as though a 
mutiny has occurred on the ship of state, while the captain, the 
Prime Minister, is on shore golfing, and the first mate, the 
finance minister, is asleep in his cabin.  The Minister of 
Canadian Heritage along with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
the Minister of Transport have taken over the helm of the ship of 
state—and I am borrowing an analogy which the leader of the 
Reform Party used yesterday—and decided to go to Sweden because 
that is where they saw the land of opportunity.  However, they 
are going from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario but they have decided 
not to use the Welland Canal.  They are going down the Niagara 
River.  It is scary.  I do not have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, 
what is at the end of the Niagara River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Envision the Minister of Canadian Heritage with a parrot on her 
shoulder and a patch over both eyes.  As they go down the river a 
din is heard in the distance.  The minister says “Oh listen to 
the people applauding.  They can hardly wait for us to arrive”. 
The finance minister, now swabbing the deck at sword point, is 
saying “No, I don't think that is applause”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can you imagine what the Canadian people are saying? They hear 
the rabble upstairs, they hear all the noise and they are very 
concerned because they too can hear the din.  It is time for the 
government to recognize where it is headed with this throne 
speech.  It is heading toward the falls.  It is time it allowed 
Canadians to come up out of the hold to take control of the ship 
and turn it around.  We will never in a 100 years solve the 
problems of the 1990s with the solutions of the 1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the government to wake up and recognize that 
Canadians have a stake in this.  This is the most important 
economic decision the government will make in its mandate, the 
most important decision it will make as it leads Canadians into 
the new millennium.  Let us ensure that Canadians have a say in 
this.  Let us ensure that their values are reflected in the 
direction in which the country goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have some appreciation for the fact that the small 
business people are the job creators.  Let us understand that 
they want to have some of the $13 billion EI surplus.  Let us 
understand that they are frightened to death that we are going to 
pass on a burden of $600 billion worth of debt to their children. 
Let us have some appreciation for where Canadians are at and let 
us make sure that from here on the government hears what 
Canadians are saying. In the government's absence, the Reform 
Party will be there to stand up for them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to commend the Reform Party, both this hon. member's speech and 
the leader's speech yesterday.  Their rhetoric and their imagery 
is improving.  Unfortunately, their content and their 
comprehension remains at about the level of the previous 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to question the hon. member on the point he raised in his 
speech about the lack of consultation with the Canadian people. 
The issue of what will be done and where we will be going once 
the budget is balanced and once we have surpluses was a major 
plank in the Liberal platform.  It was put to the people during 
the electoral campaign and the majority of Canadians voted for 
the platform, as is evidenced by the composition of the House. 
If that is not consultation, what is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, what is the member's opinion of the electoral 
process?  What is the point of going to the people with electoral 
platforms and having them judged and voted on?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would suggest it is the 
ultimate naivety to suggest that every Canadian across the 
country decided they were going to cast a vote on the basis of 
one line in the Liberal red book.  My friend says it was a major 
plank.  I do not recall any ads running based on the 50 percent spending 
promise.  I recall all kinds of ads where the prime minister was 
sitting down to coffee and suggesting that things were wonderful 
with him, but I really do not recall those ads about the 50 percent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue, and I think my Conservative friends over here 
would argue, on the big debate about national unity during the 
election campaign that a lot of people voted on that basis.  A 
lot of people voted on the basis of cutting taxes.  A lot of 
people had it in mind that there was an important issue of taxes 
that needed to be addressed and they cast their ballot on that. 
Some people cast their ballot on the basis of the MP who was 
running. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that it is simplistic for the member to suggest 
that the whole election campaign was based on that 50 percent promise. I 
would also mention that all the provinces have not only got 
balanced budgets now but they consulted their people.  Then they 
had elections and they won.  By and large, they won them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely naive for the member to suggest that the reason 
that Canadians voted the Liberals in with a diminished mandate 
was because of their promise to spend 50 percent of any surpluses on new 
spending. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the hon. member's comments on the throne speech. 
I appreciate his thoroughness and his straightforward comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has obviously read the throne speech.  Could he find anywhere 
in the throne speech where the government indicates its plans to 
purchase helicopters as a top priority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully when it was being read.  I do not remember 
hearing any comment.  I reread the throne speech and I saw no 
reference at all to the multibillion dollar purchase of 
helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that if this were a priority of the government, 
it should at least have been mentioned in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My other question is that tax reform, as was indicated, was a 
major discussion in the last federal election and again I do not 
see much reference to tax reform in the throne speech. Does he 
agree with me that there was no mention of the helicopter 
purchase and could he clarify for the House his party's view of 
the purchase of helicopters?  Do they support spending these 
moneys now on search and rescue helicopters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also he made comments about tax reform.  Has his party given 
much thought to the fact that if there is going to be any tax 
reduction that it be in the form of reducing the GST as a way of 
assisting Canadians from all parts of the country at all levels 
in the socioeconomic scale? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate hearing from 
the hon. member for Kamloops.  He always provides thoughtful 
questions.  He has asked me a number of questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I too have scoured the throne speech and I have 
yet to find the reference to the EH-101 helicopters.  It just is 
not in there.  Perhaps it was a typo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps, on the other hand, the government is going to announce 
new programs each and every day which cannot all be included in 
this document unless it expands it dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also asked about tax reform.  Tax reform is 
extraordinarily important.  Canadians have talked about it for a 
long time.  It is not in this document.  I do not see it anywhere 
in the throne speech.  It is not in here at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go to town hall meetings people often ask why we do not 
have a flat tax in this country, why the taxation system is not 
simplified.  It is not in here at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend has asked me about the GST, a very important 
issue.  I think it is notable by its absence from the throne 
speech.  Obviously the government is somewhat reluctant to talk 
about the GST.  It has had its problems with it in the past, and 
we need not go over that.  That is well known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suffice it to say my party believes very strongly that should we 
one day decide to balance the budget in this country, we hold out 
the option of reducing the GST in stages as we go along.  It is 
part of our blue book policy.  We leave that open for Canadians 
to tell us to do that.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is part of our consultation. We have talked about a number 
of different tax reforms in our document.  One that I think would 
have perhaps even a greater advantage than reducing the GST would 
be raising the minimum exemptions.  Then it would truly help low 
income Canadians. In the election campaign we argued that we 
would take 1.3 million Canadians completely off the tax rolls by 
lifting up those minimum exemptions.  That is the Reform approach 
to helping low income Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question has to do with the number one issue that the member 
referred to.  I would have thought the number one issue would be 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at Atlantic Canada, in some areas in the province 
of New Brunswick we have 40 percent unemployment.  When we had the 
chamber of commerce take a look at our area and to ask what can 
we do, it said “we are not at a point at the present time 
whereby we can be independent of government assistance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear people in the Reform Party stand up and say no more 
government programs, no more government assistance, no more need 
for it across this country. There is need.  We want to be 
independent. We will be independent.  We will get there but we 
cannot do it now.  The government programs that have been put in 
place for the last three years have hurt us dramatically.  We 
have the breakup of families.  It is very difficult for our 
people. They want their dignity.  I would think jobs would be 
number one and we cannot just do that with tax cuts.  We have to 
have government programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear from the member of the Reform Party on 
where he stands on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought all the NDP 
members were at that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party plan would deliver about $1 billion in tax 
relief to Atlantic Canada.  We argue that is a much more 
effective way of ultimately not only delivering money into the 
hands of people in Atlantic Canada and allowing them to have more 
money for consumption but also ultimately what it does is allow 
small businesses to start to spring up.  It starts to change the 
economy in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have outlined an entire plan to help Atlantic Canada get out 
of the morass that it is now in because of successive Liberal and 
Tory governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan will lift Atlantic Canada up in terms of the economics 
of the country to the level of the other provinces. That is our 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that we can continue to send transfers to 
Atlantic Canada all the time without other reforms that go on to 
fix the economy fundamentally so that it can take advantage of 
its ties with New England and that sort of thing so that we can 
ultimately give Atlantic Canadians the hope that they really do 
need and really do deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to share my time with the 
hon. member for Leeds—Grenville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an honour for me to be in this rather august Chamber 
representing the great riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke. My 
duty is to articulate the concerns of my constituents, to be 
their advocate.  But in a broader sense we as federal members of 
Parliament have an even greater obligation, and that obligation 
is greater than to our own political parties.  That obligation is 
to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our mission is not merely the preservation of political power 
but to harness the awesome strength that we have been given and 
channel it toward the perpetuation of freedom, peace, prosperity 
and unity.  We must not bicker among ourselves when the future of 
our country hangs in the balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our strength as a nation will be immeasurably enhanced if we 
continue to foster actively an environment that is conducive to 
achieving even greater unity as a nation.  We must all be 
invigorated by our triumphs of the past, by the magic of the 
present and by our hopes and dreams of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the endless possibilities of the future that we as 
parliamentarians must look toward by generously accepting new 
people, heartily believing in new ideas and boldly encouraging 
innovation. 
We must accept the value of dissent and daring and savour 
courageous controversy as a hallmark to courageous change.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary to remember that in order to achieve this vision 
for the future we must allow those blessed with the talent to 
reach for a higher calling, a higher destiny, on their own merit. 
It is equally important to remember that we must help those who 
through no fault of their own cannot help themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some people who argue that the principal function of 
government is to clear the decks, clear the obstacles out of the 
way of the strong and the cream will rise to the top, whether 
that cream be rich and powerful individuals or rich and powerful 
regions of the country.  This is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I unquestionably defy anyone who expounds the survival of the 
fittest model of living.  That may be the basis by which we 
describe the process of evolution, but a government must 
associate itself with a higher moral and philosophical order.  A 
country as blessed as Canada should be able to somehow find room 
at the table for the hungry, shelter for the homeless, work for 
the idle, care for the elderly and infirmed and hope for the 
destitute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people say that we should not care about the other people, 
that we should treat them with disdain, that we should charge on 
and do our own thing.  We must remember that we are a family.  We 
are one family and we must stick together.  We must share both 
benefits and burdens, strife and success fairly and equitably for 
the good of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally speaking, I am one from a family of ten. I have five 
sisters and four brothers.  We do not always agree on everything, 
but at the end of the day we come together.  We are one.  No 
family, no political party, no province and no country which 
ignores its troubled regions and troubled peoples while watching 
others thrive and prosper can call itself justified, decent or 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the duty of any political party that wants to be given the 
mandate to lead our country in the future to reach out to all 
people in a non-partisan fashion.  It is precisely this ability 
that marks the signature of a great leader.  All great leaders 
have had an uncanny ability to take with them not only members of 
their own party, not only selected individuals, but with a unique 
combination of courage, determination, introspection and 
imagination an entire country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, imagination is no substitute for reality, and the reality 
is this: when citizens stand together, we feel stronger as a country. My 
son Tyler, who is 12, goes to a French school in Pembroke, Ontario. I 
think this is wonderful, but what is not so wonderful is that some 
Canadians would destroy our country for purely selfish reasons. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If need be we must join a crusade to keep this country together. 
We must turn lethargy into energy.  We must counter misguided 
passion with focused conviction.  We must overwhelm narrow minded 
nationalism with broad minded federalism.  We must overpower this 
scurrilous innuendo with the unmasked truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth of the matter is that we live in a country called 
Canada which is acknowledged as the greatest country in the world 
in which to live.  This acknowledgement comes as a result of our 
tremendous strengths.  We are a very decent nation, capable of 
understanding, compromise and diplomacy. 
We are also a very accomplished nation.  It was a Canadian who 
discovered insulin.  It was a Canadian who invented the 
telephone, although considering the fact that I have two 
teenagers, I am not so sure about that invention for the time 
being.

forces, not for war but for peace.  These are but a few of the 
accomplishments that Canadians have come forward with to leave a 
lasting legacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this is not enough.  We must do more.  We must continue 
to work to make sure that every yesterday is a vibrant and 
beautiful dream of happiness and every tomorrow is a magnificent 
vision of hope.  We must continue to reach out to our fellow 
citizens, strengthen our bond and our identity as Canadians.  We 
must continue to pursue excellence on behalf of our country 
Canada. We must continue to relentlessly challenge not only our 
own standards but those of the international community.  We must 
continue to make our Canadian voice heard distinctly and bravely 
among other nations in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As their federal member of Parliament, my duty is to galvanize 
the will of the citizenry of the great riding of 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, to represent their voice here on 
Parliament Hill bravely, with intense passion, fervent conviction 
and undying and unyielding determination so that we may travel 
through the 1990s and into the next millennium proud of our noble 
heritage, supported by our family and friends, enriched by our 
diversity of talent, invigorated by our unity of vision, 
empowered by our infinite hope, our undying optimism and our 
indomitable spirit.  This is my duty and I will do so without 
fear and without favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members of Parliament to join with me in my resolve. 
For a newer, brighter, more beautiful frontier is within our 
grasp. Let us not fail at this critical time.  Let us, yes, 
sprint forward together and continue to build a great country 
called Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
listening with great interest to what the hon. member for 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke had to say, and I heard him defend 
this great Canada of ours as only assimilated French Canadians 
are capable of doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want him to know that he is a perfect example of what I would 
never want to be. In this House he represents a diminished Quebec, a 
Quebec that has been swept under the rug, a Quebec that they want to 
erase from the map, the francophones that they intend to extinguish 
sooner or later, and as far as they are concerned, the sooner the 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we look at the history of Canada, although people say 
there were two founding peoples, the francophones were here first, 150 
years before the new bosses of my hon. friend opposite. But how many are 
left today? 
They used to be the majority, but now not even 25 per cent of the 
population of this country speaks French. Some of them changed sides, 
and he is one of them. He should realize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad but true that in a country that supports multiculturalism 
and has two official languages, one has been ignored and given no 
consideration whatsoever.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reason for the presence of the Bloc Quebecois 
members.  They, too, are here to promote the rights of their 
electors, the rights of those who elected them to this House and 
just as legitimately as in the case of the hon. member.  Maybe he 
decided to obliterate his past—footprints on the sands of time, 
as Longfellow put it—maybe he brushed all that away, maybe he 
sided with the Governor General in trying to tell us that the 
deportation of the Acadians was a sort of Club Med excursion, all 
expenses paid.  I have no problem with that.  There have always 
been people in the history of francophones in Canada to join those 
who oppose us, our adversaries, and to diminish us.  I think the 
member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke is one of those, and he 
should be made aware of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whether the member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke 
acknowledges Quebecers as a people and their presence here 
for 350 years.  I would like to have his answer, because this is 
the subject of an amendment to the speech from the throne.  I would 
like him to tell me whether Quebecers are a people and whether he 
can reconcile that with the remarks of the Minister for 
International Trade, who said earlier he was capable of promoting 
Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what is Canadian culture?  I would like to hear what he 
has to say on that.  Is it selling the Calgary stampede in Paris? 
Perhaps he could do that, but that is of no real interest to me. 
Just as selling the songs of Gilles Vigneault around the world is 
of no interest to the Reformers.  I would like him to say how he 
plans to reconcile the two cultures, if he will admit that there 
are two in Canada.  He would first have to admit that there are two 
peoples in Canada, and I am not sure he could do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I would ask the hon. member, not knowing where he is 
coming from, whether he acknowledges that Canada has two peoples 
and, if so, how he can promote the French culture he has totally 
lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, my Canada includes Quebec and 
my friend opposite, even though he does not think Canada is a great 
and wonderful country.  I am only a modest woodsman, but I fear he 
may have been hit on the head by a piece of wood.  I cannot find 
the right words.  It is great for me, I feel very strongly for that 
part of the country, and there is no problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, on your

difference between right and wrong.  He provided me with a vision

</I></B></P><P align=left>History will show that Jim Jordan was a politician who clearly 
cared more for the public than he ever did about public 
relations. Throughout his career this approach was all too often 
dismissed as unsophisticated and old-fashioned but I believe he 
was ahead of his time.  And as the political pundits are 
predicting chaos for this session of Parliament, it might serve 
us all well to revisit some of his qualities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to add my voice in support of the Speech from the 
Throne. I wish to preface my comments with the point that the 
very fact we are now engaging in a discussion about how we might 
spend surpluses is a tribute to the sound monetary and fiscal 
management of the 35th Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tough decisions and sacrifices that Canadians made have 
served to open doors of opportunity for us as a country.  But we 
have some fundamental decisions to make.  The key here is that we 
are now in a position to debate and make those decisions and not 
have those decisions made for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the central themes of the throne speech was the 
commitment to co-operation between various levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was born into a family of seven boys and can attest to the 
fact that co-operation is far easier to preach than to practise. 
But open participation in competent, transparent processes with 
clear evaluation mechanisms is the key to Canada's continued 
success on the world stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt as recent history has shown that certain 
traditional federal powers have been better exercised at the 
provincial or even the municipal level, but gravity need not be 
the only force at work in this process.  If the federal 
government is to exercise its responsibilities in a global and 
highly competitive world, then certain traditional provincial 
powers might be better exercised at the federal level. When we 
talk of a collaborative approach to strengthening and modernizing 
Canada's social union, let elected representatives focus on 
allocating powers to the government level where the interests of 
Canadians, not politicians, will be best served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was particularly pleased to hear the reference in the throne 
speech to environmental technologies and the potential for growth 
and global leadership. If we commit to targeting this vital 
sector with the goal of developing commercially viable, 
sustainable development practices, then we as a nation will not 
only have demonstrated the ability to live within our means, but 
we will also have developed the capacity to live within our 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be clear about this concept.  It does not involve 
disadvantaging Canadian companies by enforcing high output 
standards.  Certainly, regulation is required.  But we need to 
put our collective energies into how governments can support 
sustainable practices given the self-policing concepts of profit 
and competition inherent in free markets. Canadian firms will be 
able to expand into emerging markets with higher quality products 
at lower prices because of, not in spite of, sustainable 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The political risks of such initiatives are being eliminated as 
successes are being documented. The popularity of recycling 
programs demonstrates that when efforts toward sustainability can 
be brought into a legitimate arena, the public will respond. The 
challenge for us then is to clearly bring all aspects of 
sustainability into the realm of legitimacy.  That is going to 
require some fundamental shifts in thinking and a healthy dose of 
collective effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business and engineering schools will need to begin to teach 
decision making models and algorithms that incorporate 
comprehensive costing principles.  Certainly, disposal and 
remanufacturing costs are every bit as real as inventory and 
transportation costs.  Industry will need to recognize 
sustainable growth as the opportunity that it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we continue to saturate markets and as technology shortens 
traditional product life cycles, the latent demand for this 
sector will present Canadian companies with opportunities to 
develop and market proprietary technologies globally.  Companies 
will need to work in consultation with the government to ensure 
that policies such as lifetime product stewardship have 
appropriate phase in periods to allow for the necessary design 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to show leadership through co-operative 
domestic regulation and aggressive global negotiations to allow 
the industries committed to the future to prosper and grow.  I 
have every confidence that Canada can and will be at the leading 
edge of sustainable technologies.  The co-operative and 
incremental adoption of economically successful sustainable 
practices is critical to the continued success of Canadian 
society and I feel will be an area of considerable comparative 
advantage well into the next century.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech also directed necessary resources toward the 
problem of youth unemployment.  The lack of secure employment 
manifests itself in any number of social symptoms.  By treating 
the problem we can begin to break some of the cycles that served 
to frustrate the youth of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a representative of a riding that has seen its fair share of 
downsizing and restructuring, although the youth need jobs, so do 
the displaced workers.  We must strive to address both the long 
and short term requirements of society.  As a government we must 
strike a balance between the present and the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech outlined a strategy for expanding 
opportunities in aboriginal communities.  As I worked on the text 
of this response to the throne speech, I spent a great deal of 
time and energy struggling with the semantics of the complex 
concept of sustainable development.  I smiled at myself as I 
recalled the Iroquois practice of making decisions based on the 
impact they would have on the seventh generation from now.  I 
cannot help but wonder what other wheels we as a nation need not 
reinvent if we can restore the health back to these cultures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret the fact that time does not allow me to comment on all 
aspects of what I truly believe is an enlightened framework, but 
there are a few more points I would like to mention.  It strikes 
me as we talk of the new millennium that January 1, 2000 is a day 
after December 31, 1999.  Let us not miss the opportunity to 
accomplish as much as we did in the last two years in the next 
two years.  Let us commit to working toward, not simply planning 
for, the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In key areas of challenge such as unity, health care, crime and 
poverty the speech contained a common theme.  There is 
considerable evidence to support that early and aggressive 
intervention can be correlated to positive long term outcomes. As 
my predecessor would have said, an ounce of prevention is worth a 
pound of cure. Let us commit as a Parliament to focusing on that 
elusive ounce of prevention for I believe it sets a much less 
confrontational and much more productive agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember that democracy is a precious thing but it is 
merely a means and not an end.  It is what we choose to do in 
this place, not the fact that we are in this place that 
transforms shared values into actions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my comments and statements will be brief.  It is amazing 
that the Liberals can predict the weather now.  Winter has come 
early to Ottawa as this is the biggest snow job throne speech I 
have ever heard or seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the members of the Liberal Party that in 1956 my 
mother, father and six children immigrated to Canada.  We did not 
have to pay a head tax to immigrate to this country.  That is how 
good it was back then.  Under the current policies it would have 
cost my family $8,000 to immigrate to this great country and he 
is talking about what a great society it is and how great and 
wonderful it is.  I would like to see him answer to my parents or 
any new immigrants coming to this country who will have to pay 
$8,000 for a family of eight to immigrate so they could receive 
the opportunities he has so eloquently described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party should also be thanking all those millions of 
people they have placed in poverty, especially our children, 
under their scorchers policies.  They are following the Reform 
right down in a rush to the bottom. They are ripping up labour 
contracts and denying people their basic rights.  May I remind 
the member from Ontario that when he denies a child sustenance or 
food or anything that is called child abuse.  When they take that 
sustenance away from millions of Canadians it is called balancing 
the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question.  I was describing where I think we need to go as a 
country.  We certainly face challenges.  I caution the member 
that this notion that the good old days were comprehensive good 
old days is deeply rooted in myth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this country were bankrupt, the problems the member is 
describing, which I do not deny exist, would be compounded right 
up the social ladder.  It is important that as members we try to 
at least deal in reality.  By painting pictures of things that 
may not happen is not serving the interests of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am struck as a new member by the differences and the 
similarities.  Certainly the difference that I heard from the 
throne speech has been echoed by my colleagues who stood with 
pride to speak about a document that was about confidence, vision 
and hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have heard in response troubles me.  This is an 
opportunity for us in a non-partisan way to share our thoughts 
and views.  I would ask my colleagues, if they came to this House 
in a spirit of positive nation building, which I know they did, 
how they feel today to know that not everyone shares the goals of 
building together and working for this nation. I feel sad that 
there are those who would tear this country apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that my constituents in the wonderful riding of 
Thornhill expect all of us to do what we can to solve the 
problems that we face in a positive and constructive way.  I 
congratulate my colleagues for putting forward their vision and 
speaking to the throne speech document which I think shares the 
vision of hope, confidence and nation building that should 
permeate this place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
history has shown that, when two peoples exist within a single 
nation, they each come to understand that it is in their mutual 
interest to separate. This was the case with the Austrians and the 
Hungarians before the 1914-18 war. It was also the case with the 
Swedes and the Norwegians at the turn of the century and, more 
recently, with the Czechs and the Slovaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I imagine my hon. colleague denies Quebec's right to separate. 
Perhaps he could tell me if it is because he does not consider 
Quebecers a people? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly the world has 
regions that are separating.  However, I would like to remind the 
hon. member that if he looks at the very regions he is talking 
about that their desire to enter NATO and their desire to enter 
the European Union clearly points to the fact that together these 
groups have a much stronger presence and a much higher quality of 
life.  The partisan feelings that would suggest that we could 
make it better on our own or that somehow life would be better if 
we split up certainly do exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if we look at the world, that is clearly the minority 
opinion.  In Canada we have not only two cultures but three. With 
the aboriginal community, the French community and the English 
community, Canada will be much stronger. I think the people of 
Canada are starting to realize that.  That might very well 
explain some of the frustration that I am seeing across the way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate you on your appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to thank my fellow citizens of the 
riding of Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot who have put their trust in me again in 
the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was outraged by the speech from the throne that was delivered two 
days ago. It was riddled with misrepresentations, distorting reality 
with respect to the existence of a Quebec people, among other things. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1155

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of misrepresentation, I would like to focus on two 
elements of the throne speech: public finances and national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as public finances are concerned, we must refer to page 4 of 
the throne speech, which reads, and I quote, “This 36th Parliament opens 
at a time when we have brought order to our public finances”. The speech 
goes on to say “The government will continue to be vigilant and 
responsible about keeping the financial affairs of the country in 
order”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I almost fell backwards when I read that, because the Minister of 
Finance has been anything but responsible in his last three budgets. The 
Minister of Finance can boast about our public finances being in order. 
Credit must be given where credit is due, but the fact is that the 
credit should go not to the federal finance minister, but to his 
provincial counterparts, especially Mr. Landry, of course. Why? Because 
they are the ones who had to do his “dirty job”. He did not do a thing 
to bring about the conditions that will result in a zero deficit as 
early as next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty four per cent of federal spending cuts were made in social 
programs. 
The Minister of Finance cut $4.5 billion from federal transfers to 
the provinces for education, health and social assistance. This 
represents a $1.3-billion shortfall for the Quebec government. 
Fifty-four per cent of the cuts were made in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the finance minister replied to a question from a Reform 
Party member on taxes. The other major contribution made to bring order 
to our public finances is the taxes paid by Quebecers and Canadians. 
Since 1994, the Minister of Finance has let tax revenues increase by $23 
billion. That money comes from taxpayers' pockets. The minister is now 
talking about $2 billion in targeted tax cuts. This is the least it can 
do after collecting an additional $23 billion since 1994. 
Taxpayers are getting a little treat from the finance minister after 
years of tightening their belts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it is easy to boast about bringing order to our public 
finances, considering that the finance minister literally robbed workers 
and employers by improperly dipping into the employment insurance fund. 
Last year, the minister pocketed $5 billion, even though it has been 
years since the federal government contributed to the employment 
insurance fund. This year, the minister will take $7 billion from that 
fund. So, it is easy to boast and to brag, but taxpayers will not forget 
that the Minister of Finance made himself look good at the expense of 
Quebecers and Canadians. What did the minister himself do in all this? 
What was his own contribution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1994 budget speech, the Minister of Finance told us that 
departmental spending would be cut by 19 per cent.  The minister has not 
kept his promise.  Departmental spending has been cut by only 9 per cent 
over the last four years.  The minister has not made even half the 
effort demanded of those who are ill, of students, of the most 
vulnerable members of society, especially welfare recipients, or of 
those who would normally re-qualify for employment insurance, but, 
because of the new employment insurance policy introduced last January, 
find themselves back on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here too, he can go on about how unemployment is down.  Of course 
it is.  The unemployment figures, meaning the number of people actively 
looking for work, have dropped, but entire families are now stuck on 
welfare because of the minister's new employment insurance policy, which 
also happens to be generating surpluses that he is using to reduce the 
deficit. 
These folks no longer show up in the official unemployment figures. 
This is not what being a responsible government means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is our charming Minister of Finance going to do with the 
surpluses he is generating?  He will move right into areas of provincial 
jurisdiction.  Do you know why?  Because the throne speech, just like 
the first throne speech we heard in this House, tells us that the 
federal government will be barging into areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, including education.  We are told in the throne speech 
that the federal government will measure the readiness of Canadian 
children to learn.  Education comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of 
Quebec and nobody is ever going to interfere in education, which comes 
under our jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these investments being announced in Quebec's areas of 
jurisdiction, after what they did to Quebec's public finances in 
particular, have been in the works since March 1996. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, I will quote the President of Treasury Board who, in 
the March 8, 1996 edition of <I>Le Soleil</I>, publicly admitted the 
federal government's strategy, a strategy which consisted of 
dumping its problems of public funding onto the provinces, getting 
the provinces to do the dirty work, so that it can come out looking 
good to all of the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote the President of Treasury Board in the March 8, 1996 
edition of <I>Le Soleil</I>, “When Bouchard—he does not even have the 
decency to show a little respect for the Premier of Quebec—will 
have to make cuts, those of us in Ottawa will be able to 
demonstrate that we have the means to preserve the future of social 
programs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such is the strategy of the federal government: to make Quebec 
look like the bad guy when it comes to social programs and to the 
health sector, when in fact they are the main ones responsible. 
They then come along with great fanfare to announce that they will 
be putting programs in place, that they will help our young people 
and improve the health system.  Such behaviour is odious and 
absolutely hypocritical, particularly when it is at the expense of 
the least advantaged and the sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our campaign platform was clear with respect to sound 
management of public finances, as well as the battle against 
poverty.  Our program had six points, basically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first was that we were calling upon the federal 
government, since public finances are getting in better shape, to 
give back what it has swiped from the provinces, that is to say 
return the $4.5 billion it has stolen yearly from social programs 
in order to fund social assistance, postsecondary education and 
health.  These are no small amounts we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just looking at the health transfers the federal government 
was making to the provinces in past years, for every dollar cut by 
the Minister of Health since he has been responsible for this 
sector, 93 cents were used to reduce the federal deficit.  And for 
all of the social programs, every time a dollar was cut from social 
programs in Quebec, 78 cents of it were used to reduce the Minister 
of Finance's deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a lot of money, and if for the past year the federal 
government had done its job, if it had not slashed social transfers to 
the provinces, the Quebec government would no longer have a deficit. The 
problem would have been settled long ago, and our books would have 
balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, considering that the country's financial situation has 
improved, we asked the government to reduce employment insurance 
premiums. Not a cosmetic 6 cent per $100 of insurable payroll. We 
suggested a reduction of about 30 cent per $100. Why? For the simple 
reason that the Bloc Quebecois is on the side of jobs and job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government meant what it said when it talked about job 
creation, it would have consistently reduced employment insurance 
premiums, because they kill employment. 
Any direct payroll tax as substantial as employment insurance premiums 
is bound to kill employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, since the government's finances are in better shape, instead of 
this nickelling and diming, instead of these intrusions in Quebec's 
jurisdictions, without so much as a by your leave, because it is so 
important to hand out cheques with a big Canadian flag, the Liberal 
government should consider what people need and put more money into the 
employment insurance fund and social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third point is that since the new employment insurance system 
came into effect last January, the benefits and usual protection for 
workers who lose their jobs were greatly reduced. 
We are therefore suggesting that the federal government, since they are 
in a better position financially, get back to a better approach that 
would genuinely help unemployed workers get back on their feet and 
remain on the labour market instead of being forced to go on welfare, 
which is no way to help families get back on their feet, especially if 
it keeps them out of the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth suggestion we made in our campaign platform, and it is 
still valid, is to have a targeted tax reduction. Not the kind of 
generalized, useless tax reduction which does nothing to stimulate 
consumer buying and job creation, but targeted reductions based on a 
logical analysis of the tax system.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I am particularly proud to remind people that 
the Bloc Quebecois conducted two major studies in the past year and 
a half.  One was on reforming corporate taxation to make it fairer 
with fewer of those loopholes that allow hundreds of millions of 
dollars annually to avoid federal taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also put forward a document on improving personal taxation 
to make the system fairer and to ensure that families, especially 
low and medium income ones with children, get the benefit of such 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We repeat the suggestion to the Minister of Finance that this 
tax reform should take place in his second mandate. 
If he was too sluggish in his first mandate to implement our 
suggestions, which, I would point out, are currently being used by 
Canadian universities as a good example of tax reform, he should be 
delighted and accept the proposals of the Bloc Quebecois.  In this 
mandate, however, I think that it would be a good idea for him to 
make the tax system fairer for lower income classes and not just 
for his millionaire and billionaire friends and those of the 
Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our fifth proposal would increase tax benefits from $850 
million to $2 billion, adding $1.15 billion in child tax benefits. 
This is a real battle against child poverty.  I think that, with 
the developments in public finances, it is not too late for the 
Minister of Finance to do the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time I see him put his hand to his heart, I cannot help but 
wonder if he is feeling for his wallet. If he is really concerned about 
child poverty, he should be spending more in that area and make it a 
true national priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, it is not hard to understand, in fact it is quite simple: if 
the federal government minded its business and refrained from 
interfering in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, I am sure it 
would save money. Every time the federal government announces with 
fanfare plans to get involved in education, to put an education program 
in place, to meddle in health issues and every other area under Quebec's 
exclusive jurisdiction, that costs money. And, in spite of his financial 
position, the finance minister is not paying for all this, the taxpayers 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every instance of duplication and overlap in programs entails 
administration costs borne by taxpayers. 
Taxpayers are also paying twice for federal government employees to do 
the exact same job as Quebec government employees. The public must know 
that. That is what I mean by distorting the reality behind public 
finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something else in this speech from the throne struck me; I was 
quite shaken by it. It contains, on page 7, third paragraph, a line as 
disgraceful as they come, in my view, and I quote, “Our future as a 
country is too precious for us to risk losing it through 
misunderstanding”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A nation's aspiration to sovereignty is not based on any 
misunderstanding. It is based on this desire we share to build our own 
country, a country soon to be known as Quebec. There is no 
misunderstanding there, and it is disgraceful to suggest such a thing. 
This would mean that, in the referendum held in 1995, 61 percent of 
francophones voted yes but did so based on a misunderstanding. Seventy 
per cent of francophones on the island of Montreal voted yes, but did so 
based on a misunderstanding. Almost half of all Quebecers voted yes, but 
did so based on a misunderstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is probably the most preposterous statement I ever heard. If 
there were misunderstandings in the history of the relations between 
Quebec and Canada, they were on the federal side. There were of course 
a number of such misunderstandings, but I targeted four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These misunderstandings go as far back as 1867. Here is the 
first one. In 1867, two founding nations signed a confederation 
agreement. At the time, it was believed that our French Canadian 
ancestors and the English Canadians had signed a historic accord 
between two sovereign nations, two founding peoples. However, 
over time, we came to realize that such was not the case. Over 
the decades, English Canada shrank the scope of this 
confederation agreement. English Canada will not admit at all 
that Quebec is different. In fact, if we look at the throne 
speech, we realize that it not only denies that there is any 
difference, but also that it denies the existence of a distinct 
society, a distinct culture and, more importantly, the existence 
of a distinct people. The throne speech reinforced this first 
historic misunderstanding.  It is a true misunderstanding and it 
originates with the members across the way.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second historic misunderstanding was to have believed that, in 
1982 when Pierre Elliott Trudeau patriated the Canadian Constitution 
without Quebec's agreement, we would get down on our knees and agree to 
this Constitution that we never wanted.  Quebecers stood their ground 
and I am proud of that.  We never agreed to this Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third historic misunderstanding, and again it originates with 
the members across the way, is to have thought that, in order to make 
amends for the historic affront of the 1982 patriation, they could toss 
any little scrap our way after the failure of the Meech Lake accord and 
we would go for it, in order to put the problem behind us once and for 
all, with no regard for our pride or our wish to build a strong Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They gave us Beaudoin-Dobbie, Beaudoin-Edwards, the Spicer 
Commission report, and the Charlottetown accord, which was put to a 
referendum and defeated.  They came to us with completely meaningless 
concepts, empty shells, such as the rather comical idea of principal 
homeland.  Now, after the Calgary declaration, they have come up with 
unique character.  Quebecers are not interested. 
Quebecers will do exactly what they did to every other meaningless offer 
they received concerning Quebec's future and reject it out of hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bourassa had gone much further, and if Daniel Johnson agrees to 
bow and scrape for mere crumbs, he will go down in history as having 
bowed and scraped for just that, mere crumbs, putting his electioneering 
interests before Quebec's true interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fourth misunderstanding and it has to do with plan B, to 
which the throne speech refers yet again. In Quebec, there was a time 
when fear was an effective tool. So was English Canada's paternalism. We 
will be hearing a great deal about this with four federalist parties 
represented in the House of Commons. But it does not work any more. 
Perhaps plan B could have worked at another time, but it will not now. 
The Supreme Court and its judges will not change the course of history. 
We will repel any attack on the territorial integrity of Quebec. And no 
minister of intergovernmental affairs or member for Saint-Maurice will 
be able to slow down or stop the people's march toward sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no misunderstanding in nearly winning the last referendum 
on sovereignty. There a clear desire to build our own country in Quebec. 
I have a word of warning for those across the way who may be tempted to 
crow over the results of recent polls. These polls are no referendum, 
but let me tell you that, when one is called, Quebecers will speak. They 
will speak loud and clear and, this time, the will say yes for real and 
that will be the last referendum in the history of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to address my Canadian friends in their own 
language, if I may. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way for our common future is not the status quo but the 
independence of Quebec, a new relationship, a new partnership 
with Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether or not you want this partnership does not change 
anything.  Nothing will stop the determination of my people, the 
Quebec nation, to reach liberty, to become a sovereign country. 
The next referendum will be the right one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither your political representatives, Liberal, Conservative, 
Reform or NDP, nor the judges of the Supreme Court will change 
anything.  You could not force 7 billion Quebeckers to stay in 
Canada against their desire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our aspirations are legitimate and deeply democratic.  They do 
not rely on justice to be planned.  The respectable attitude of 
Tony Blair, Prime Minister of United Kingdom, with Scottish and 
Welsh people must be for you a source of inspiration. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, I would encourage my fellow Quebecers to 
contemplate sovereignty and heed the advice of Félix Leclerc, who once 
said, and I will close on this: “The fruit is ripe in my country's 
orchards. This means that the time has come, if you get my drift”. I am 
convinced that Quebecers will heed Félix's advice in the next 
referendum.

it is appropriate to remind the member that one of the greatest 
destabilizing factors to investment in the province of Quebec is 
the constant threat of separation especially when corporations 
think about expanding their plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will know that we are in an economy right now where 
things are very much on the rebound, people are being hired and 
plants are being expanded.  Business looks for stability and 
business needs stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member, a respected economist, knows full well that this 
constant irritant, constant threat of destroying this country is 
a disincentive to investment which is really hurting those 
constituents looking for jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that when the member talks about the economy and caring 
and sharing, about those people who are most in need, as he did 
in his speech, those are the ones who are looking for work.  And 
the best way for them to get work is to ensure that the 
businesses in Quebec that feel they want to expand feel they will 
be able to survive in a very healthy, stable marketplace and not 
one that is under a constant cloud of separation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the throne speech. We just said that provincial 
jurisdictions will be interfered with, that it will cost as twice as 
much in civil servants' salaries, program administration, and so forth, 
that we would be better off without this perpetual quarrelling, that we 
could each determine what is best for ourselves and pool our resources 
when our interests coincide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me this is perfectly clear. I think what is happening 
today in the United Kingdom is marvellous. 
If Canadians like you were to show the same understanding for the 
history and destiny of the people of Quebec, I think it would be easier 
for all concerned.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I share 
the same views as my friend from Broadview—Greenwood on this 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member, in his thoughtful presentation, referred to the 
plight of Canada's children.  I think we sometimes assume that it 
is just a matter of fact that we have to have poor children.  We 
have to have people who do not have jobs and who are living in 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might want to remind my hon. friend, who probably does not 
need reminding, being the economist that he is, that there are 
many countries in the world where child poverty does not exist. I 
refer specifically to countries like Norway and Denmark where 
children do not live in poverty because their parents do not live 
in poverty.  Poverty is not something that we have to accept as a 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that in a country as rich as ours we should not 
have the number of children living in poverty and suffering today 
because their parents are living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the situation that exists in what has to be the 
wealthiest country in the world, would the hon. member not agree 
that this is actually, to quote the Catholic bishops, a form of 
child abuse for a government to allow this condition to continue? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> I agree with the NDP member, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather despicable to see the Minister of Finance and 
government members place their hands on their hearts and talk about the 
plight of children, given that they themselves are responsible for a 
situation which has gotten worse over the last three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not normal to make cuts based on a budget plan tabled by the 
finance minister in 1996, to slash, year after year on a cumulative 
basis, the budget for social programs by some $42 billion, and to think 
this will have no impact on child poverty. The government should give us 
some credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the decisions made by this government have 
had an impact on child poverty and made parents poorer. 
Parents got poorer as a result of, among other things, the employment 
insurance program implemented in January, which consistently reduces 
benefits and which also excludes many adult workers from the labour 
force. These people have to rely on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, do not try to appeal to our emotions. We are not going to be 
fooled by the finance minister's crocodile tears. It is not right to 
present things in that light. The minister should admit he made a 
mistake in his plan and he should at least put aside the budget cutting 
scheme developed in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not even any mention of this in the throne speech. The 
government says it will give back some money. Do you know what the 
government is doing? The Minister of Finance originally wanted to cut 
$48 billion. Now the new figure is $42 billion. The federal government 
will cut $42 billion from transfers for social assistance, 
post-secondary education and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is despicable to present things as if the government was handing 
out goodies when in fact it is merely cutting somewhat less than 
anticipated in 1996, but with the same slash-and-burn approach. The 
minister should have the decency to rise, to tell the truth and to 
announce that he is immediately putting an end to his planned cuts for 
the next three years. This would be an effective way to fight poverty, 
particularly child poverty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note:  Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you for this opportunity to speak in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It it a great honour to be back in this Chamber.  I say back 
because in 1975 I sat here in the House of Commons as a student 
participating in a model Parliament in seat 113. I did not think 
then that I would be representing Nunavut 22 years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be the first female in the history of my riding to 
sit in the House of Commons and even more proud to be of Inuit 
descent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my constituents for the privilege of representing them 
at this crucial point in the future of Canada and Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavut covers 1.9 million square kilometres of our country. 
That is 20 per cent of Canada.  It spans three different time zones and 
the population is roughly 25,000 people.  The land covers fiords, 
mountains and tundra. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I was travelling through the communities in my campaign I 
could not help thinking it was truly a lesson in geography.  My 
constituency goes north to the North Pole, west to the 
Alberta-B.C. border, south to James Bay and east almost to 
Greenland.  Nunavut has many international borders including 
Russia, Denmark and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This vast and untouched area has great potential for a natural 
resource based economy.  Each year more exploration is going on 
in the north, in particular mineral exploration.  Nunavut's high 
Arctic hosts two lead and zinc mines.  This activity benefits 
northern communities by creating jobs for our population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need continued support for sustainable development and 
training in this sector.   Alongside this is the challenge of 
protecting our environment.  We have to make sure our land 
remains natural and beautiful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to promote fisheries and the processing of country 
food. This along with tourism are areas that create employment 
in the north and must be explored as valid industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the mandates of the Government of Nunavut is to staff its 
public service with a 50 per cent Inuit workforce.  This is a realistic 
goal considering that the Inuit population of Nunavut is over 
80 per cent and the working language will be Inuktitut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak the Government of Canada and the Government of the 
Northwest Territories are training Inuit to staff Nunavut's 
public service.  Nunavut Arctic College has been instrumental 
in making education accessible and relevant to all Nunavut 
residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week in Iqaluit I witnessed the signing of a training 
agreement between the two governments that will ensure the 
employment targets are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although governments are now training to staff the public 
service there have to be mechanisms in place to keep our youth in 
school and to pursue post-secondary education.  There are many 
barriers that stand in the way of our youth attaining higher 
education.  One avenue to keep youth in school is through 
athletics.  There needs to be more focus on partnering schools 
and sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty-seven out of twenty-eight Nunavut communities are coastal 
communities but all are serviced only by air. There are no roads. 
Air freight is the only reliable way to ship goods and perishable 
food.  Communities receive non-perishables like fuel and 
construction material by sea lift, many of them only once a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Freight is the primary reason for the high cost of living in 
Nunavut.  In many communities a four litre jug of milk costs $10, 
a loaf of white bread $2.69, a five pound bag of potatoes goes 
for $6.95 and a case of Coca-Cola will cost $41.   With gas 
costing 71 cents a litre it is very expensive for northern 
residents to buy gas so they may go hunting for country food, 
which is still very much the main diet.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituency that I represent cannot be compared to any 
other part of the country.  When I was in Iqaluit, the future 
capital of Nunavut, it was mentioned that Canadians are as 
ill-informed about their north as Americans are about Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was going to high school in Ottawa I was asked before 
Christmas break by a classmate to bring back a stamp from my home 
so she could have one for her collection.  This is one example of 
how true it is that Canadians forget that their country goes much 
further beyond 60° north.  We are part of Canada and proud to be 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people outside the north think of the Arctic, they think of 
igloos, polar bears, and arts and crafts.  Carvings and crafts 
are a legitimate source of income to many families in the north 
and are relied upon to put food on the table.  We have 
tremendously talented artists who need to have their work 
marketed.  Therefore it is very disturbing for me to see 
imitation art displayed in stores.  No one can replace the beauty 
of an original carving of the north. Means to promote economic 
development of art must be explored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any culture is truly unique and different within Canada, it 
is the Inuit culture.  Our ancestors came here thousands of years 
ago, lived off the land and adapted to dramatic changes. In the 
span of roughly 35 years, Inuit went from igloos to houses, from 
dog teams to airplanes, and still kept their culture alive 
because we still use igloos and dog teams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my parents' time, Inuit used fox tags and wooden sticks 
to trade for supplies.  Today my father has a Visa card and my 
mother can use her Interac card to do her banking, even though 
they do not speak any English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Inuit are a very adaptable people and I am very proud of the 
progress we have made in such a short time.  These examples show 
that Nunavut residents are ready for the challenges that await 
them. The implementation of our long awaited territory is rapidly 
approaching and co-operation between parties involved is 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to working with the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development, the Interim Commissioner of Nunavut, 
the president of Nunavut Tunngavik, and the government of the 
Northwest Territories to make sure that Nunavut residents see a 
smooth transition on April 1, 1999 which is less than 580 days 
away. All of these parties, along with regional Inuit 
organizations, Qikiktani Inuit Association, Kitikmeot Inuit 
Association and Kivalliq Inuit Association, will be essential in 
providing me with real input as we face tough decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The division of the Northwest Territories is the most 
significant and exciting event taking place before the turn of 
the century.  It has not been since 1949 when Newfoundland joined 
Confederation that something of this magnitude has occurred in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Establishing the Nunavut territory is my priority as Nunavut's 
member of Parliament, but it must also be a priority of this 
House.  This is monumental.  I urge my colleagues in this House 
to take this chance to participate in making history in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be by working together and helping each other that we 
will accomplish the task.  This is the way the Inuit culture 
survived thousands of years in a harsh and unforgiving climate. I 
was pleased to see this type of co-operation during the 
unfortunate crises of the floods in Quebec and Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close this speech by extending an invitation to those 
members of this House and those Canadians from across the country 
who have not yet had the privilege to see Nunavut to come and 
visit us.  I guarantee that their experience will be 
unforgettable.

I want to say to her that I had an opportunity during the last 
sitting of the House to work with her people with respect to 
their needs.  I look forward to working with them once again. She 
is absolutely right.  She has a unique culture and she 
understands, like we understand over here, that there are regions 
of Canada with different needs.  We are there to help them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too want to pay 
tribute to the member for Nunavut.  In my riding, they would tell her in 
Inuit: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note:  Member spoke in Inuit</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means “Thank you very much.  You are a superstar for having 
been elected to the House of Commons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Abitibi covers 802,000 square kilometres, and has 92,000 
inhabitants, 68 communities and 68 mayors.  There are 14 Inuit villages 
in Abitibi.  So I am very familiar with the Inuit culture.  I would like 
to mention to the hon. member that it is true that, while in the south 
bread sells for between $1 and $1.06, in Nunavut, New Quebec, bread can 
cost between $2.50 and $3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many problems right now.  Housing is one of them. 
I realize that much needs to be done.  There are many who say that 
people in the north are receiving subsidies, but there is one thing that 
needs to be pointed out to the citizens of Canada and of Quebec and that 
is that, for every dollar we give our Inuit friends, 97 cents always 
comes back to the south.  They are participating in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much remains to be done, particularly in Nunavut and in Nunavik, 
Abitibi, such as working together and visiting New Quebec.  That is the 
Canadian economy.  We will play our part.  I wish to congratulate the 
hon. member on her election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I took great pleasure in listening to the hon. 
government member talk about the beauty and the uniqueness of the 
part of the country she is from.  Certainly I agree with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really interesting is that she basically confirmed 
everything the Reform Party has been saying for so many years, 
that every part of this great country of ours is unique and 
distinct and has its own unique and distinct character. It is 
very refreshing to hear a Liberal member agree with the Reform 
Party and take a route other than saying how unique and distinct 
the province of Quebec is.  I thank the hon. member for bringing 
that up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Nancy Karetak-Lindell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know that 
Canada is a country known for respecting all the different 
nationalities that come to it.  We are very proud to be one of 
the original nationalities, but I believe that Canada has room 
for all the different people who come to this country.  I am 
proud to be a part of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
too would like to congratulate the new member for Nunavut on her 
maiden speech in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to travel to that part of the world a year 
and a half ago with Canada's foreign affairs committee, which was 
studying the Arctic Council in that area.  I was greatly 
impressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one of the few ridings in Canada that is bigger than my 
own.  I come from Peace River in northwestern Alberta and I can 
understand the difficulties in representing a riding of that 
size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also struck by the impact of pollutants in Canada's Arctic 
and how they can affect people living in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked long and hard as the trade critic for our party to 
try to resolve the European ban on leg-hold traps and products 
from those traps from entering Europe.  My understanding is that 
an agreement has been reached.  I am wondering if the hon. member 
for Nunavut can tell the House whether she knows if it is 
satisfactory in addressing the concerns of the people who live 
off the industry of fur-bearing animals and whether the agreement 
will satisfy them.

a very very brief response, please do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Nancy Karetak-Lindell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as far as I know 
that is being put into place.  We have had a bit of resistance to 
the changing of the traps.  As I said in my speech, Inuit are 
very adaptable people.  We are trying to go with the change.  I 
have to research this a little more because as I said I am very 
new at this and it is such a large territory with so many topics. 
I hope I can answer it more satisfactorily with a bit of 
research. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
want to congratulate the hon. member for Nunavut.  I am sure she 
will represent her riding with a passion unparalleled.  An area 
of 1.9 million square kilometres certainly brings a new meaning 
to door to door at election time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate you on your recent 
appointment.  I take this opportunity to publicly congratulate 
the hon. member for Niagara Centre on his re-election as Speaker 
of the House.  His remarks at orientation for the new members of 
Parliament were both inspiring and motivating.  I certainly thank 
him for those words of encouragement. I am sure I speak on behalf 
of all of my new colleagues when I say that his words and actions 
have instilled a confidence in all of us based on the characters 
of those who are chairing this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the constituents of Simcoe—Grey.  I am both 
honoured and humbled that they chose me as their elected 
representative.  I fully intend to represent them to the very 
best of my ability in this House.  It is a responsibility that I 
do not take lightly.  I want to assure all my constituents that I 
have ample access and little restrictions with regard to my input 
in voicing their comments or concerns to our government. I commit 
to them that I will take full advantage of this opportunity to 
voice their feelings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss and somewhat in trouble if I did not take time 
to thank my wife Sandi and our three children for the love and 
support they gave me throughout the election.  It is something I 
know I can draw on throughout this term of office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made a special commitment to my riding, one that I hope 
all residents will join me in no matter what their party 
affiliation.  That commitment is to work hard to maintain and 
enhance what we believe to be the best place in Canada, and that 
means the world.  I ask my constituents to join in that 
challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is a diverse and precious place just like the people 
within it.  The agriculture industry in Simcoe—Grey represents 
the largest geographical make-up and is the largest single 
employer in our riding.  We are a rural riding that has made and 
will make an enormous contribution to Canada as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To touch on a few of those contributions, I remind the House of 
Sir Frederick Banting, as was mentioned earlier, the co-founder 
of insulin and a World War II hero.  Recent contributions have 
been made by Sue Palmer and Paul Shaw, two of Canada's Olympic 
athletes.  I could spend the rest of the day talking about our 
many contributions and how proud I am to be a part of 
Simcoe—Grey riding but time does not permit it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From our dairy, poultry, cattle and swine producers in Alliston, 
Elmvale, Markdale and Stayner to the best apple growers in the 
world in and around Thornbury and Collingwood, these farms are an 
integral part of Canada's food producing industry and deserve the 
support and confidence of the federal government.  I am very 
pleased to see that happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simcoe—Grey is a riding that leads in agricultural excellence. 
For this reason I am extremely pleased that the Liberal 
government has continued to support the agricultural community in 
the form of marketing boards and quotas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am especially pleased to see the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food leading this industry into the next century.  As a 
result of his extensive background the minister understands that 
agriculture is the very foundation of this country and must be 
maintained no matter what countries or trade agreements try to 
threaten that foundation. The farming community can be assured 
that I will continue to support and endorse this agenda very 
aggressively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, my riding is very diverse.  Our 
industrial components had their very foundations shaken, some 
even destroyed, throughout the mid to late eighties and early 
nineties.  Now, thanks to a strong and fiscally responsible 
government, we have provided a stable and strong economic 
environment to allow these industries to rebuild and strengthen 
their positions in Canadian and world markets. 
At long last there is a glow of optimism within industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take this time to thank the Prime Minister and 
his previous government for having the fortitude to take us from 
what was near certain economic ruin to a healthy deficit free 
economy in four short years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very grateful for the vision and direction of my colleague, 
the Minister of Finance.  His fiscal formula has been a remedy 
for success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleagues, when dealing with what looks like a small 
surplus—it has certainly been talked about today and 
previously—to remember one thing.  The only reason they are in 
this place talking about a surplus is because of the Liberal 
platform over the last three and a half years.  The formula 
worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like all ridings across Canada, jobs are at the forefront of the 
constituents' minds in Simcoe—Grey.  I commend the Prime 
Minister for partnering with the private sector and leading trade 
missions abroad.  I encourage the federal government, as I will 
encourage my riding, to take these types of proactive steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased that we have a small surplus coming this year 
to invest back into social programs that are not just important 
to Liberals but important to all Canadians.  With regard to this 
forecasted surplus, I strongly encourage the finance minister to 
stay his course in dealing with the debt.  For our children it is 
a legacy in which I would like to put a serious dent, of course 
always keeping in mind Liberal values and social 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are known worldwide as a compassionate society with very 
liberal values.  Now that our house is back in order, it will be 
necessary for us to focus more strongly on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simcoe—Grey is likely one of the most well-known tourist 
destinations in Canada.  If it is not, I will certainly make sure 
it is by the end of this term.  For this reason I was extremely 
pleased that the federal government, along with the Business 
Development Bank of Canada, initiated a $500 million lending pool 
to help accelerate development in private sector, four season 
type resort areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a scenic geography that is second to none.  We have, and 
will continue to develop biking, hiking and cross country trails 
that go on for hundreds of kilometres.  We have the largest 
downhill ski area in Ontario, the friendliest and best run in 
North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all my colleagues, both sides, and extend an 
invitation to visit and see our great riding.  I extend that same 
invitation to industry.  We want them too, and we need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding, like many other rural ridings, has been continually 
losing its most cherished asset to larger urban centres.  That 
most precious asset is our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initiatives, like partnering with the YMCA, is a large step in 
the right direction.  It offers our youth opportunities within 
the riding, not only to be employed but equally or more important 
to upgrade their skills.  It provides opportunities to which they 
may not otherwise have access.  This is a program of which I am 
proud to be a part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I say to all my colleagues, irrespective of party, I 
look forward to working with all of you in order that we may 
build a country and a future for our children that is second to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to begin with my congratulations to you for having 
accepted the appointment to your position.  I hardly need remind 
you that this is only the third time in the history of this 
Parliament that a party in power has designated a deputy speaker 
from outside its ranks.  This is a great honour, therefore, and 
your friends and family, the members of your party and certainly 
those who elected you will be very proud of you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the new member for Simcoe—Grey. 
I listened closely to his speech and I feel he will make a good 
MP—or at least I hope so. He strikes me as being full of good 
will.  He gave particular attention in his speech to agriculture 
and to unemployment. 
My riding seems rather like Simcoe—Grey, with a number of farmers 
and many unemployed people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the valiant new member for Simcoe—Grey, 
who states his readiness to work with all members of this House, 
what concrete proposals he wishes to make to his Liberal caucus 
that will be of any help whatsoever to the agricultural sector, 
which has seen its net earning power weaken year after year, 
particularly since 1993 when his party came to power, and to our 
young people in particular, with their abnormally high rate of 
unemployment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what has his government done to sustain employment since 
1993? 
It has toughened up eligibility for unemployment insurance, 
particularly for young people, counting not the number of weeks but 
the number of hours. New workers have to accumulate 910 hours 
before they qualify.  And worse still—my final point—the duration 
of employment insurance benefits has been shortened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the hon. member for Simcoe—Grey gives me the impression 
of being very very positive in these, his first days in the House 
of Commons, what are the concrete proposals he will make to his 
party caucus, to the Liberal party? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I question how well the 
hon. member listened.  I did touch on some of the initiatives of 
this government.  Certainly the YMCA partnering initiative is a 
major step in the right direction.  That is not just offering 
employment opportunities, it is also offering training 
opportunities to provide youth with a better lifestyle down the 
road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so far as the agriculture community is concerned, one of the 
things that I have done in my riding, and I have certainly been 
vocal in caucus as well, is to open up lines of communication. 
The member seems to have his facts in error.  There has been an 
increase in the last two years in farming income, certainly in 
our area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to opening lines of communication, I have over the 
summer had the opportunity to have the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food travel to our riding and meet with the farmers, the 
brokers, the average people out there; not just their OFA 
representatives, but the actual farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken the time this summer to travel throughout the 
riding and sit in on the Grey County Federation of Agriculture 
and the Simcoe County Federation of Agriculture meetings.  I 
bring that communication back to the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and I tell him how it has impacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very unusual situation which is going to be a great 
reward for the farming and agricultural communities and that is 
the minister who is leading us into the next millennium.  He is a 
farmer, very well educated in the field and he is being met with 
an excellent response.  I am certainly a pipeline to this caucus 
and to this government on behalf of the farming community in my 
riding.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to indicate that I will be sharing our speaking slot with my 
hon. colleague from Winnipeg North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join with my parliamentary colleagues to congratulate you, Mr. 
Speaker, on your ascension to the Chair.  I look forward to 
seeing not only your smiling face but also your good judgment 
exercised during the next number of months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all listened carefully and attentively to the throne speech 
as was read by the Governor General.  I would like to quote from 
this throne speech before I make some remarks in my response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the inauguration of a new Parliament.  Let it be also 
the beginning of a new era of national reconciliation, economic 
renewal and social justice—. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are no easy solutions to the great problems facing 
our great country, there is a new will among Canadians to make a 
fresh start in the search for answers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is that phrase “fresh start”.  It goes on to state: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a priority goal of my Ministers will be to breathe a new spirit 
into federalism and restore the faith and trust of all Canadians 
in the effectiveness of our system of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A constant process of consultation and co-operation must be 
restored.  My Ministers are regularly meeting their provincial 
colleagues to eliminate irritants and to improve services to 
people where the federal and provincial governments have joint 
responsibilities. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This throne speech goes on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process of consensus-building will engage the private sector 
partners in an era of co-operation on economic goals.  In such a 
context, government would act as a guide, a mediator, a catalyst, 
becoming less intrusive in the private sector but vigilant over 
the integrity of the national economy and of national 
standards—.The three-part strategies of my Ministers is to 
restore fiscal responsibility, remove obstacles to growth and 
encourage new investment—This three-part strategy is aimed at 
renewing economic growth in order to provide jobs our people need 
and to address the continuing tragedy of youth unemployment— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My government will enter into discussion with the provinces 
aimed at a comprehensive overhaul of our pension system— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultations will also begin with the provinces to consider the 
most effective means of providing increased federal support for 
the improvement of—health care— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are deeply troubled by the incidence of crime, 
especially crimes of violence— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad my Liberal colleagues here are applauding because this 
is the throne speech of Brian Mulroney.  It sounds exactly the 
same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Liberal, Tory, same old story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>   This is the same throne speech.  They 
did not even bother to re-write it.  It was a new governor 
general, that is all.  This throne speech is worth nothing.  This 
is absolute pap. Yap, yap, who cares?  I looked through here to 
find out where the helicopters were mentioned because the 
government announced today that a major priority is to purchase 
billions of dollars worth of helicopters.  There is not a mention 
of helicopters in here. This is pap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order.  The hon. member for Kamloops 
is a very experienced member and he knows that he is not to use 
props in the course of his debate.  While his point may have been 
one that he feels he should make in this way, I am sure he knows 
it is wrong to perhaps over-dramatize things by tearing up books 
and so on in the course of his speech.  I would ask him to 
restrain himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may recall that in the last Parliament we had incidents of 
this kind and the Speaker intervened.  I am reluctant to do so 
with such an experienced member, but I feel in the circumstances 
I should draw the rules to his attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I apologize.  I got so 
worked up that I just could not help it.  However, I do have 
another whole version of it here. Pap is pretty cheap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listened to the throne speech in the other place, I 
reflected back on the last number of years here.  I go back to 
the Tories because it is basically the same group, only different 
faces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember as a kid having my mother read me a story by Robert 
Louis Stevenson, called <I>The Wreckers</I> where unscrupulous 
people on a desert island would light fires on the rocks at night 
to lure ships into thinking it was a harbour. The ships would 
smash on the rocks, people would loot the ships and the people on 
the wrecked ships would die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds of the government.  This reminds me of my Liberal 
friends.  I wonder if they really know what they are doing to the 
people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a reference in the throne speech to the deficit war 
being won.  I suspect that if we listen carefully we would hear 
the Liberals cheering, saying “We won the deficit war.  Yes, we 
were successful”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to acknowledge the heroes of the deficit war over the 
last number of years it would not be the Minister of Finance and 
our Liberal colleagues across the way or our previous 
Conservative friends in the House of Commons.  It would be the 
long line-ups of people waiting to get into hospital.  It would 
be the thousands and thousands of young people with huge debt 
loads on their shoulders as a result of having to fund so much of 
their education.  It would be the 1.4 million people who do not 
have a decent job or perhaps do not even have a job at all.  It 
would be the millions who have part-time jobs and are barely 
scraping through to make ends meet for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about others like the 10,000 people every month, 
month after month, who declare personal or business bankruptcy, 
who are walking away from their businesses and their homes.  In 
many cases they walk away from devastated families as a result of 
the economic policies of the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the true heroes of this deficit war.  They should be 
the ones who are first rewarded when there is a dividend.  The 
minute there is a surplus we should go back and start mending the 
safety net that has been ripped and torn apart by the Liberals 
and by the Conservatives before them.  This should be a top 
priority if we are a caring and decent country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look across at these people.  They look like nice people but I 
do not think they care about people.  If they cared about people, 
would they permit having over a million children—they are 
laughing, Mr. Speaker.  I do not think this is funny.  They are 
laughing at over a million children waking up this morning and 
living in poverty in the richest country in the world.  The 
Conference of Catholic Bishops calls it a form of child abuse, 
that this is allowed to happen.  The government has to accept 
responsibility for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people sit quietly in their places and give little 
speeches in the House of Commons about how nice the country is, 
how great they are and how hardworking we are all going to be. 
This country is in a mess for a growing number of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge that luxury car sales are up.  I acknowledge that 
the Toronto Stock Exchange is at historic levels.  I admit that 
corporate profits have never been higher and the banks are 
happier than they ever have been in our banking history.  At the 
same time increasing numbers of Canadians are living in poverty, 
increasing numbers of people are losing their jobs, their 
businesses and their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the government do about this?  Let us look in the 
throne speech.  We are positive, happy people trying to find some 
goodness left in this world.  There must be some goodness left in 
this government.  There must be something in here about what it 
will do about the 1.4 million people who do not have jobs today. 
Is it mentioned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am being asked to talk about something new.  The Liberals 
would love me to shut up about this topic.  They would love me to 
stop talking about the 1.4 million people who are out of jobs? 
They would love me to stop talking about the people in Atlantic 
Canada who met our caucus and said they have not worked in four 
years because of this government's policies on free trade, NAFTA 
and now the multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a slow erosion in our country of what our parents and 
grandparents before them struggled to build for generation after 
generation into one of the best countries in the world.  We have 
people by the hundreds of thousands lining up to come here 
because of what they built and what the government is tearing 
down systematically budget after budget after budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has to stop.  We cannot sit here passively, talking about 
minor shifts in trade and changes to trade policy or tinkering 
and so on with various social programs.  At the same time as we 
sit here today, the Minister of Finance has tabled legislation in 
the House to radically change the way seniors receive their 
pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we cut through all the red tape and all those provisions, 
what does it say?  It says that hundreds of thousands of seniors 
in the future will receive fewer benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the kind of country we are?  Is that what we have come 
to?  Is there anything in this throne speech about a national 
child care system?  I heard minister after minister promise to 
introduce it.  I heard Tory ministers promising to introduce it. 
Now it has reached a point where they were too embarrassed to 
mention it in the throne speech because they know nothing will 
happen in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things must change.  I am pleased to be here with a group of 
very progressive New Democrats who on a daily base in the House 
will remind the government how it has been cruel and continues to 
be cruel to many Canadians.  That has to change and change soon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
let me congratulate you on your appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not surprised to hear the member from the NDP trying to 
draw a parallel between us and former Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney.  Aside from his actions in tearing up his speech, he 
failed to draw to our attention that the Brian Mulroney and 
Conservative era left us with a humongous deficit of $42 billion 
that we inherited in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice of them to say that we have to do this and we have to 
do that, but if we are adding debt and debt we will never be able 
to implement any of the programs such as the scholarship fund. 
Unfortunately he was not listening.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He failed to bring forth that just last week one of the local 
papers in the greater Toronto area stated that employment levels 
were as high as they were in 1989.  They have been rising. They 
all talk about doom and gloom.  They do not want to talk about 
the good news that has been happening out there.  They do not 
want to talk about the fact that in 1993 unemployment rates were 
11.5 percent and today that are at 9 percent and dropping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to point out to the people that spending our way out of 
this is not the solution.  The member is saying “Let's open the 
purse.  Let's spend.  It doesn't matter how much debt we will 
have.  Let's just keep adding to it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Was that a question, Mr. Speaker?  It 
was kind of a rant, I thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend is right.  The government announced that it will 
do something to help students some day in the future.  Is this 
not nice?  In fact it was more precise.  By the year 2000 it will 
take some action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my friends opposite were sincere about helping young people 
afford post-secondary education, they would go far beyond having 
a scholarship program.  They would consider doing away with 
tuition fees in our post-secondary institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can hear my hon. friend now, that whining we hear all the 
time: “Where are they going to get the money?”  We always hear 
whining from across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new concept.  Other countries that put a priority 
on young people's education have long had tuition free 
universities and colleges.  It is not a new concept.  It exists 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than give a tax break to one of the tens of thousands of 
very profitable corporations that do not pay a single cent in 
income tax year after year, why do we not close some of those 
loopholes?  Then we could have some money for post-secondary 
education funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will hear comments any day now—we should be hearing them in 
question period today—that the government has decided the 
Cadillac helicopter purchase has been changed into a Chevrolet 
and now we can afford it.  We will be dishing out money now for 
the helicopters.  Fair enough.  That is what this job is all 
about.  Helicopters will probably be a lot more important than 
helping poor children.  Buying helicopters will probably be a 
more important initiative than helping young people afford 
education. That is a decision that the government might well 
take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it does, let us recognize that as long as it tolerates more 
than one million children living in poverty it will have to wear 
on its shoulders what the Conference of Catholic Bishops reminded 
us is a form of child abuse.

Mr. Speaker, I listened to the compassion in the speech of the 
member for Kamloops as he talked about the people living at the 
poverty line, the unemployed and the seniors who are scraping to 
get buy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask the member for Kamloops, who is looking forward to 
his $1 million gold plated MPs pension, where his compassion was 
when he had the opportunity to say “No thanks.  I have a 
conscience.  I can't accept that gold plated pension”.  Where 
was his compassion then, when he gets a pension five, six or 
seven times richer than the union members who have to work 30 
years to get one-fifth of that?  Where was his compassion?  He is 
no different from the Liberals.  He is no different from the 
Tories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party gave $30 million back to the Canadian people by 
giving up their gold plated pensions.  We did it because we care 
about Canadians.  We care about the debt and we care about taxes.

the Canadian people.  He is not on pension.  That is a ridiculous 
statement and is completely out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon member will realize 
that was not a point of order.  It was a matter of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member for Kamloops wish to respond to the comment 
made by the hon. member Prince George—Bulkley Valley.  If so, I 
will give him a moment.  The five minute questions and comments 
period has expired so I would ask him to be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief.  My

he could do would be to ask his own members of the Reform Party 
to take their pensions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I begin my first speech in this assembly of democracy 
feeling a tremendous sense of responsibility given to me by the 
people in my constituency of Winnipeg North Centre, a 
constituency which is recognized right across this country as a 
symbol, as an example of the struggle for dignity, equality and 
justice in society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have given me a responsibility to fight for things that 
matter most to people, the things that were missing in the Speech 
from the Throne, the most important issues that affect people on 
a day to day basis:  the matter of jobs, the matter of quality 
health care, the matter of good public education, the matter of 
hope for our young people, the matter of security for working 
families and the matter of dignity for our seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in the NDP caucus feel the sense of responsibility 
people have entrusted in us.  We will keep our promise.  We will 
not break our commitment to raise those issues day in and day 
out.  We will work as we have never worked before to ensure that 
their voices are heard in this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was elected I asked my eight year old son what I should 
say and do.  He said “Tell everyone that we will make Ottawa 
rock”.  That is exactly what we intend to do day in and day out 
in this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here on behalf of people everywhere saying the rhetoric 
that ran as thick as syrup in the Speech from the Throne will not 
end the despair of people living without work or living with the 
daily fear of losing the job they may now hold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not relieve the stress on families trying to juggle 
several jobs, the responsibilities they have for the care of 
their children and the obligation they feel for their communities 
and their involvement in community life.  It will not end the 
pain and suffering women feel on a day to day basis because they 
have to live with the threat of violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My sense of responsibility, as I make my first speech in the 
House of Commons, also comes from those who came before me, those 
who made a difference in the lives of people in my constituency 
and indeed everywhere in this country.  I am very fortunate to 
claim both Stanley Knowles and David Orlikow as my predecessors, 
two longstanding parliamentarians who made a real difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who among us would not be familiar with the dogged persistence 
of David Orlikow who, for 26 years in this House, fought day in 
and day out for individuals and for policies that would improve 
people's lives and ensure some measure of dignity, security and 
equality among all people of all regions of the country?  I am 
proud to carry on his work.  I am grateful for his contribution 
to Canada and I look forward to his ongoing help and advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my leader said yesterday, I also register a great deal of 
sadness at not being able to enter this Chamber and see my old 
friend and colleague, Stanley Knowles, sitting at the table.  It 
was a dream I had.  Unfortunately it just was not to be.  However 
we are left with his legacy.  The best way we can honour the work 
of Stanley Knowles is to carry on the work he fought for so long 
and hard for 38 years in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the issues and policies he fought so hard to achieve are 
now under attack by the Liberal government today. Canadians can 
be sure that we will fight to preserve a public pension system to 
stop the erosion of security for seniors in their old age.  We 
will be there day in and day out.

take my critic areas very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty years ago when I was a parliamentary intern in this place 
I remember hearing a member of Parliament, a member of the then

among women, after all it is men who are the primary wage 
earners”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been here for the past few days, having heard the Speech 
from the Throne, are we any further ahead today under this 
government, or is this government just more subtle about its 
practice of continuing inequality and discrimination in our 
society today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not the case that the privatization and deregulation and 
off-loading and cutback policies of this government are 
contributing to hardship and pain and suffering and greater 
inequalities facing women in our society today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If women's equality is important would it not be the case that 
this government would have long ago honoured its obligations 
under the human rights act to ensure that women in the federal 
public service were paid on the basis of equality? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be the case that instead of offering women half a 
loaf, this government would have said that before it considers 
spending $12.2 million on bonuses for senior civil servants, it 
will ensure it meets its obligations and ensures equal pay for work 
of equal value? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you can also be sure that I will be raising, as 
much as possible, issues pertaining to health care.  Medicare is 
our most treasured national program, a matter of pride, a matter 
of equality and a matter of real meaningful intervention in the 
lives of people. That program is in serious trouble and let us 
not forget it is because of the policies of this government.  Let 
us not allow members of this government to suggest that it is 
another level of government's responsibility entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember that this government in 1993 introduced the most 
regressive social policy in the history of this country, the 
Canada health and social transfer, and took the single biggest 
bite out of health care in the history of medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many of us it was absolutely galling to read the Speech from 
the Throne and the statement “we will legislate to put back, to 
increase funds for the Canada health care system to the tune of 
$12.5 billion”.  We now are at the base floor of $12.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government owes it to the people of Canada and to the 
future of medicare to ensure that our cash transfer payments for 
health care reflect the needs of health care, ensure that we are 
able to meet our obligations and that every Canadian is able to 
gain access to the best quality care in this country by virtue of 
being a member of a civilized country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deception, absolutely, because in fact the Speech from the 
Throne did also not mention that under the present formula of 
this government dollars from the federal government to provincial 
governments will actually decline in real terms.  It does not 
look at the growth in the economy.  It does not consider growth 
in population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see in real dollar terms a continual drop in funding 
from this government to the provinces, thereby jeopardizing even 
further the future of medicare in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many more issues to raise and so little time.  I 
want to acknowledge the challenges we all face.  I and many of my 
colleagues in this caucus are trying to juggle our work as a 
members of Parliament and also our responsibility to our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us have young children.  We are grateful for their 
support and we recognize that we are not unique.  We represent 
many families, many women in this country trying to juggle so 
much because of the inaction and the lack of attention of this 
government to those very important issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to congratulate the member for Winnipeg North 
Centre for her maiden remarks in the House of Commons.  As I 
listened to her I thought about the fact that many of the things 
she said today are things that, believe it or not, many of us on 
this side of the House believe in as well.  In my riding 50 p. 
cent of 
the people who voted for me are New Democrats.  It is not a 
question of us being ideologically different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this Parliament we must not throw ideas out in a general 
sense.  We have to be a little more specific in how we get our 
ideas into play.  For example, the member for Kamloops came up 
with the idea of cancelling tuition for post-secondary education. 
It is an interesting idea but I do not think we can table an 
idea like that on the floor of the House of Commons unless we can 
link some dollars to it.  If our ideas are going to have 
credibility I share the member's son's view that we should try to 
make this place rock.  We really should. This place is a stiff, 
dull place at the best of times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are really going to have credibility we need to have 
numbers attached to some of these ideas.  It is only through that 
approach that we will have a reasonable chance of getting some of 
these ideas into a debate with some credibility attached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member a specific question.  Does she 
think it is a reasonable request for when New Democrats throw a 
specific idea on the floor? For example, I do not believe Bob Rae 
or Roy Romanow really wanted to close 100 hospitals over 18 
months.  I believe they had a fiscal dilemma on their hands. They 
are both good people.  When we come back with ideas on how to 
correct it, I really think numbers should be attached.  If the 
notion of forgetting about the fiscal framework of this country 
creeps back in, then we will have higher interest rates which 
will hurt us when we are trying to get jobs going. Could the 
member please respond to that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the member is 
wondering at all why some provinces are trying to do the best 
they can in terms of limited health care resources, he should 
start asking his own Minister of Health how we can revamp the 
transfer payment system so that provinces are not squeezed.  He 
should consider the fact that if we take $6.8 billion out of the 
health care system, we will be left with enormous pressures on 
provincial governments, on other organizations and on families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely critical that we all work together to reverse 
that trend.  I look forward to help from the member in convincing 
the ministers of health and finance that we need to start 
increasing transfer payments.  It may not be overnight that we 
get it back up to the $19 billion it was when they took office 
but certainly we could start today to reverse that so people are 
not forced into a difficult decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was how much.  We have been very specific on this 
issue and every other issue.  We have said let us work now to 
increase the transfer payments to provinces at least to $15 
billion.  That is a small step toward improving the situation. It 
would make a big difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked for specifics. Give me 24 hours and I could 
fill that time with the specifics we have suggested. 
Let me make two very quick references. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the whole area of health care and caring for seniors and 
children we have said over and over again that if the government 
would only look at it as something which is an important social 
investment and a job creation tool, we would be a lot better off 
in this country.  There are thousands of jobs to be created if 
the government would just realize that it has a responsibility to 
ensure that there is a measure of quality care for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>   And the source of funding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  If the member would give me another 
few hours I could certainly list a variety of measures, 
especially under the taxation system to deal with precisely that 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other quick example is that if we did something as simple as 
environmental conservation in energy efficiency in our own public 
buildings, retrofit them, with a small investment we could create 
4,000 jobs very quickly. That would not be a cost because it 
would pay for itself in a short time.  There are dozens and 
dozens of ideas.  We will keep bringing them forward in the 
House.  I look forward to the member's supporting our proposals. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I too would like to offer either my congratulations or my 
condolences to you.  I think your job is going to be interesting 
over the next four or five years.  I wish you well and I look 
forward to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington who will speak after me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by paying tribute to my predecessors who 
have represented Mississauga West.  Mississauga Centre became the 
new riding in the redistribution and the member previous for 
Mississauga West is now the member for Mississauga Centre; prior 
to her Dr. Bob Horner, a good friend and a wonderful man, 
unfortunately with the Conservative Party, although not his fault; 
prior to him of course Doug Fisher, a good long time Liberal, and 
Tony Abbot before him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding has always sent a representative to the government, no 
matter what party happened to be elected.  Fortunately for me 
it has done so once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically I would like to thank the voters of Mississauga 
West for their confidence in sending me to Ottawa to represent 
them in this place.  Mississauga West is an interesting riding 
made up of three very distinct communities, Streetsville, Erin 
Mills and Meadowvale.  The perception of the riding is really 
different than the reality, as is probably true of many ridings. 
The perception is that it is a riding with high average 
incomes.  It is mainly family and small business oriented, a 
riding of baby boomers one might say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition we have our share of concerns and problems.  I 
frankly take exception to a member of the House standing in his 
place and saying that because we are Liberals in the government 
we do not care about people. That is absolute nonsense.  It is 
stuff that I have listened to for five years in opposition to the 
NDP in the parliament of Ontario.  It is interesting that is 
almost déja vu in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We care about social housing problems.  We need more in my 
riding.  I was the president of the Peel non-profit housing while 
a member of Peel regional council.  I was on that board for nine 
years. We have women's shelters and a food bank. We want to end 
the systemic violence against women and children, and no 
individual or political party in the House has cornered those 
concepts and ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have youth unemployment and under employment.  I have three 
sons in their 20s and I am concerned about their future the same 
as all parents care about the future of their children. We have 
new Canadians, refugees who need help to adjust. We have crime. 
We need to fight crime to take back our streets.  We in the 
Liberal Party believe that we can do all of those things by 
providing a balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to my point with regard the throne speech. We 
will not govern on the extremes of the right or the extremes of 
the left.  Rather we will bring a balance to the government of 
this great country. 
We hear calls to spend more from the left.  I sat and watched an 
NDP government in Ontario take the total debt of that province 
from $39 billion in 1990 to over $100 billion in 1995, which 
literally destroyed the confidence of one of our greatest 
provinces.  What I hear from the party of the left is to spend 
more.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I watched what the Tories did.  It was interesting to hear the 
sound bite this morning on the news of the leader of what I 
believe is the fifth party in this beautiful establishment, the 
leader of the Progressive Conservatives, who said that there was 
a sign over the Prime Minister's door which reads “send it and 
we will spend it”.   There was a sign over Mr. Mulroney's door 
which read “we will spend it before you send it”.  The NDP sign 
would say “we will spend it.  You send it and we will spend it 
again”.  That is the nonsense of getting into extremes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the official opposition to be rather interesting.  It is 
the politics of Ross Perot.  It uses analogies like Ross Perot 
would do when he says on television “If you want to know why the 
car won't run, you have to open up the hood and look at the 
engine”.  I heard the Leader of the Opposition say that they 
have fixed one of the flat tires on the car.  I heard the speaker 
from the Reform Party this morning go through some incredible 
analogy about a ship at sea going down the Niagara River.  He 
lost most Canadians and most people in the House before he got on 
board the particular ship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He failed geography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Our plan is a balanced plan.  We said 
clearly and loudly during the election that when we achieve a 
surplus, 50 percent of that surplus will go to the kind of social 
spending that the NDP talks about and for tax relief, and 50 p. 
cent 
will go toward debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a balanced plan that we believe the people of Canada 
believe in.  Clearly they have sent us here to administer that 
plan and to deliver it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my hon. friends in the third party to remember that 
Canada is a unique and wonderful country. From coast to coast, our 
country embraces many regions, each different in its own way, including 
the very unique province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout our long history, we have learned to set our differences 
aside and work together to build a great country. 
A great and vigorous country where democracy flourishes, without 
sacrificing minority rights, a country where citizens can move freely, 
a country where everyone can speak freely without fear of persecution, 
a country that is the envy of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe all Canadians are prepared to reconcile their differences 
and continue building their country. Recent surveys show that the vast 
majority of Quebecers want to stay in Canada. Quebecers want to be a 
part of this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge hon. members of the third party to respect the will of 
the majority of Quebecers as expressed in two referendums and numerous 
surveys, and give up their plans to destroy this unparalleled success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest they join us to continue building this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize for the quality of my French, but I think it is 
important that we send the message to the third party in the 
House that the people of Quebec are sending to you.  We want 
Quebec to stay in Canada and help build this wonderful country.

interested to hear what the hon. member from the Liberal Party had to 
say. In particular, in spite of his pronunciation, I appreciated the few 
words he said in French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to Canada as unique. This is a word we are hearing 
constantly nowadays. Unique and wonderful. And he referred to Quebec as 
a very unique province. This qualifier adds to the uniqueness. He said 
that Canada and Quebec should work together. He also referred to two 
referendums.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just wanted to inquire—and I believe this is a point 
of order—whether it is customary for an official opposition 
member who is standing to receive the first question following a 
debate or whether it is up to the Speaker's discretion.  Could 
you clarify that for me?  I was standing in my place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I saw the hon. member.  There were 
two members who rose.  I noted that the hon. member had been 
given a question in questions and comments a short time ago and I 
thought it fair to give one to one of the other members who had 
risen.  I am choosing a round as best I can in exercising 
discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is normal that necessarily the official 
opposition gets the first question on a government member's 
question.  What is normal is that an opposition member gets it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge and appreciate 
your customary wisdom. I also want to thank my other colleagues for 
their smiles and moral support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, our Liberal Party colleague referred earlier to 
the two referendums which were held. I may remind him, however, that on 
both occasions, promises were made to the people of Quebec, and in both 
cases, these promises were not kept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to the Speech from the Throne. In 1994, the throne speech 
considered the possibility of being more open, in 1996, it proposed 
strategies to that effect, but in 1997, we hear the exact opposite from 
the Governor General. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member of the Liberal Party two 
questions, and I would appreciate an answer. He wants Quebec and Canada 
to work together. 
Does the hon. member opposite acknowledge the existence of the people of 
Quebec? To work together, we must first be who we are. If we are, we can 
work together in a partnership, something we have offered to do since we 
came to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he acknowledge the existence of the people of Quebec? That is 
my question. I am waiting for his answer. If he is consistent in what he 
says, his answer will be a resounding yes. I will now listen to what he 
has to say. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is helpful for the 
member to ask the question and then tell me what I should answer. 
I appreciate the fact that the two parties are fighting over an 
opportunity to respond to some of my comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say very directly to the member opposite that I 
certainly—and I believe my government—recognize the province of 
Quebec as a partner within Confederation.  We recognize it as a 
unique society.  I personally recognize it as quite distinct. 
When we look at language, when we look at law, when we look at 
culture, there is every reason for the country to embrace the 
province of Quebec as a distinct society or a unique society, 
whatever word we want to put on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in fact cautioned before I made my somewhat embarrassing 
attempt at French. 
The reason I was doing it was that hopefully within a year or so 
I will be a little more proficient and able to address answers to 
the member in the French language.

country.  Frankly that is not what— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I do not wish to 
interrupt the hon. member but he must address his remarks to the 
Chair.  I invite him to do so and he may continue his answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the party opposite has a 
clear-cut goal.  Having said that, I think it is important for 
those of us from English Canada, from communities like 
Mississauga which by the way is designated as officially 
bilingual because of the francophone community we have there, to 
say that we do not want the polarization that party seeks.  We 
want Canada to be strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that in order to be strong we have to deal with the 
issue of separation and national unity.  We have to send a 
message from sea to sea to sea which says we are united, that 
Quebec is a part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A vast majority of the people, at least a clear majority of the 
people in the province of Quebec, has recently stated they are 
tired of this issue.  They are more concerned about the economy 
and they want to get on with building this great nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I congratulate you on your appointment as a Speaker of this great 
House.  It is an honour for you and deserving of both you and 
this great institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the riding of Waterloo—Wellington, one of the four 
new ridings in Ontario and one of four new ridings in all of 
Canada.  I am exceedingly proud, honoured and humbled to 
represent this great riding.  I am immensely grateful to my 
constituents for electing me to this 36th Parliament.  I will 
undertake to serve my constituents to the very best of my ability 
and talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Waterloo—Wellington captures the essence of Canada.  It 
contains a large city, the city of Kitchener.  It contains small 
town Ontario: Elora, Fergus, Jacobs, Elmira, Baden, New Hamburg, 
Harrison and Palmerston.  It contains a number of smaller towns 
and villages including St. Agatha, New Dundee, Wellesley, 
Drayton, Clifford, Belwood, Conestogo, Maryhill and Breslau.  It 
contains that famous place called Punky Doodle's Corner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Waterloo—Wellington is a rich and diverse riding of urban, 
rural and suburban people.  It contains people from all walks of 
life and from all backgrounds.  Approximately 30 percent of the wealth 
of the riding is generated as a result of agriculture and 
agribusiness.  Farming is important to our part of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was born, raised and still live on the family farm.  My great 
great grandparents first settled in the area in 1828, arriving 
via Pennsylvania with the many Mennonites whose descendants still 
inhabit the area.  In fact the highest number and concentration 
of old order Mennonites and Amish people in all of Canada reside 
in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the histories of my constituents are rich, varied and 
diverse, they are united in their love of and loyalty to Canada 
and all that we as Canadians stand for.  We as Canadians are 
respectful of our institutions.  We as Canadians are respectful 
of our symbols.  We as Canadians are respectful of our values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of these helps to define us as Canadians.  The Speech from 
the Throne delivered on Tuesday by the Governor General will also 
contribute to our definition as Canadians.  I want at this time 
to thank the mover and seconder of that speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will march confidently into the 21st century and the new 
millennium.  We have a plan and a vision which will enable Canada 
to be the very best in every way for its citizens.  The 
foundation of that plan is to balance the books.  It is 
gratifying to hear that the deficit will effectively be 
eliminated in the next fiscal year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trouble with doing something right the first time in over 30 
years is that no one really appreciates how difficult it was to 
get there, but I believe Canadians do appreciate the enormity of 
the sacrifice to bring the deficit from $42 billion in 1993 down 
to zero in the next fiscal year.  I believe Canadians appreciate 
that the many years of sacrifice will pay off in the end, and 
that end is soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we are in the surplus situation, the formula as has been 
noted is an easy one to understand.  One-half will support the 
programs Canadians want and deserve and the other half will go 
toward debt reduction and tax reduction.  With this game plan 
Canada is poised to lead the industrialized world in economic 
growth this year and next and beyond.  Our plan provides us with 
the fiscal stability necessary to allow change to be accommodated 
effectively and efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jobs are being created at a remarkable pace but we need to do 
more.  Unemployment, especially youth unemployment, is at an 
unacceptable level.  We need to look at establishing a national 
apprenticeship style program for our young people, recognizing 
there are provincial implications, but co-operation would be the 
key here.  It would be an apprenticeship program that would marry 
the needs of society with the aspirations of our young people. It 
would assist the private sector to meet its labour requirements 
and ensure that young people would have the opportunity to 
acquire that important first job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even before we turn our eyes to youth unemployment we need to 
reach out to the youth of our nation.  Some of the very most 
vulnerable Canadians go to school each day hungry.  As a former 
teacher I can say that a hungry child is much more likely to be a 
problem learner with poor school performance.  A hungry child is 
much more likely to be a behavioural problem.  Children with 
learning and behavioural problems are much more likely to become 
drop-outs from school and from society. As the former chairman of 
the Waterloo regional police I can also say that drop-outs from 
school and society often fall into the trap of crime and become 
young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social and economic impacts of youth crime are unacceptable 
to Canadians.  They are demanding that we act proactively to 
attack the roots of crime.  In a country as wealthy as Canada 
with its physical and human resources, I find it unacceptable 
that even one child would go hungry.  I believe that we as a 
caring society and a caring nation need to put in place a program 
to eradicate child hunger.  Investments in that regard made today 
will pay enormous dividends tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe our children regardless of the status of their families 
the opportunity to learn, to grow and to become valued citizens 
without the burden of hunger.  Attacking child hunger and the 
roots of youth crime must therefore be a priority of this 
government in its attack on child poverty. I am pleased to see 
the progress made and the initiatives outlined in the Speech from 
the Throne.  We owe this investment to our children, to ourselves 
and to the future of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally look forward to voicing the views of my 
constituents in this great Parliament, and like all good 
parliamentarians I will listen more and judge less.  I look 
forward to working together with my colleagues for the betterment 
of Canada.  Finally I look forward to helping to continue to 
build the strong foundation upon which this great country of ours 
stands, a foundation which will confer prosperity, safety and a 
sense of community for all Canadians into the 21st century.

Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member from the Liberal Party 
talk about how the Liberal Party should be getting a lot of 
praise and pats on the back for finally doing something right 
after the last 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what the Liberals have done right.  What they 
have been practising for 30 years along with their friends in the 
Tory party and their friends in the NDP is more effective ways of 
wrenching dollars out of the taxpayers' pockets.  They not only 
got it right during the 35th Parliament, but they have perfected 
it.  They have wrenched an extra $25 billion out of the pockets 
of Canadian businesses and Canadian workers by raising taxes in 
more than 36 different areas. 
They got it right all right, but let us not let them take any 
praise for it because the Canadian taxpayers are the ones who had 
to bear the brunt of that tax torture.

the question the finance minister could not answer.  When exactly

exactly according to the Liberal numbers, how much is that 
surplus going to be?  When and how much? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to the hon. member opposite, 
I would not presuppose and begin to answer for the finance

Reform Party just does not get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is importance in getting our fiscal house in order.  We as 
a government have been able to do that over the past number of 
years not only effectively but efficiently.  That speaks volumes 
about the ability of the government to take a terrible financial 
situation and put in place the kinds of safeguards that will 
ensure prosperity not only for this generation but for 
generations to come.

before making my comments to the member for Waterloo—Wellington, 
I would like to congratulate you on being returned to your duties 
as Deputy Speaker of this House.  You certainly deserve it, having 
proven your mettle in the 35th Parliament, and I trust you will be 
just as vigilant in the 36th. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would address my remarks to the member for Waterloo—Wellington, 
an educator it seems.  I understand that he cares a 
great deal about young Canadians and especially the young people in 
his riding. 
Does he consider the abnormally high rate of unemployment among 
young people to be normal? The rate, unfortunately, did not 
decrease over the four years his government, the Liberal Party, sat 
in this House.  On the contrary, it increased.  The rate of 
unemployment among young people increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the member's intention to propose concrete solutions to 
his Liberal caucus for improving things for our young people, to 
enable them to find satisfying work that complements their studies 
at CEGEP or university? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in reply to the hon. member 
opposite, I would simply say that any rate of unemployment is not 
normal.  We will have to, as will people from all parts of Canada 
and members on all sides of the House, work to ensure that the 
kind of unemployment which we have now is brought down to an 
effective and appropriate level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to him that we need to continue to work very hard to 
ensure that is the case.  We will press not only government but 
also caucus members to do that to ensure that the best kinds of 
jobs will be in place for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Debate. Of course I am going to recognize 
the hon. member for Charlotte.  However I was wondering, instead 
of having you begin and then interrupting your remarks for

prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among

cancer and only lung cancer kills more men than does prostate 
cancer.

breast cancer, a serious disease which affects huge numbers of 
Canadian families.  Yet prostate cancer, which kills 4,000 men 
each year, was ignored in the government's throne speech.  It 
continues to receive just one-ninth of the funding of breast 
cancer research and one-fiftieth of the research money given to 
AIDS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>September is prostate cancer awareness month so let us begin 
adequately funding prostate cancer research, not at the expense 
of funding for other cancer research, but at least to the same

today we read of the sad and unfortunate conclusions of a

reduced to bitter mumblings about B.C.'s separation from Canada. 
What went wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it started with the Liberals and the national energy 
program, an arrogant, me first initiative that gouged the west 
and catered to the east.  Perhaps the fault lies with the 
Conservative leader, the leader of her own party who, bereft of 
ideas for Canada, clings desperately to the distinct society 
clause as a solution to national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First it was a report from the B.C. adviser on national unity

</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly lower taxes mean both economic and employment growth. As 
a nation that depends on bilateral trade with the United States, 
the widening tax gap between the two countries continues to 
damage our standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is serious about jobs for all Canadians in 
this new economy, it must now get serious about tax cuts and 
lower EI premiums as Canadians have earned this right.

with your help of course, to make question period a little more

yesterday, those who put the questions and those who gave the 
answers.  I especially want to thank the Prime Minister who 
pointed out that he understood that I would be intervening when a 
certain amount of time went by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am going to try to tighten it up just a little bit more 
so that we get in both the question and the answer in 35 seconds 
and I know that we are all going to co-operate.  With that I am 
going to recognize the hon. Leader of the Opposition.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE DEBT 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in 1992 the Mulroney government passed the debt 
servicing and reduction act.  It established a special account to 
pay down the debt from a special surplus.  Of course, Mulroney 
continued to spend so there was neither a surplus nor any debt 
reduction.  The whole thing was a shell game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now this prime minister promises to put 50 percent of any surplus into 
a special fund and to pay down the debt and give tax relief from 
that account while continuing to spend at record levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the prime minister is how is his shell game 
any different from Mulroney's shell game? 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the difference is that during Mr. Mulroney's time he 
moved the deficit up to $42 billion.  We are reducing it to zero. 
That is a very big difference.  According to the Speech from the 
Throne it will be done in the next year.  We are not there yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing the satisfaction I am getting today standing in 
the House seeing the Leader of Opposition very preoccupied with 
the fact that we have been very successful in what we did with 
the finances of the nation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, anybody could have done better than the federal Tories 
in reducing the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the prime minister failed to mention is that the national 
debt is $82 billion higher than it was under Mulroney. What he 
fails to mention is that his government is ripping $3,000 more 
from every average Canadian family in taxes than Mulroney did. 
And on top of that there are 1.4 million unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the prime minister is not playing a shell game, if he wants 
to make himself different from Mulroney, then why does he not 
pass the bulk of any surplus on to Canadian taxpayers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if we reduce taxes we are not reducing the deficit. That 
is something people will understand.  We said that in the end 
we will be in a position of surplus. It is coming but we are 
not there yet because there are still some problems in the 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the program of the Leader of the Opposition, he 
promised to put $4 billion more into health care.  He is a 
spender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not a promise from us.  We have done it.  Right at the 
beginning of the campaign we said that next year the provinces 
would receive $700 million more and the year after $1.4 billion 
and the same thing in the years to come.  So over the period of 
our term we will have given more back to medicare. 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the prime minister has done it to health care.  He has 
cut the transfer from $19 billion to $12 billion. That is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are young families out there in which both parents are 
working and they cannot make ends meet because of high tax 
levels.  There are businesses out there that would hire these 
younger workers we are all concerned about except that the 
government is charging excessive payroll taxes, and the throne 
speech did not promise a cent of tax relief to those families or 
those businesses.  What it promised are 29 new spending proposals 
from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the prime minister is who does he think would 
spend any surplus more wisely, Liberal politicians and bureaucrats 
or those families and businesses? 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition wanted me to speak about 
equality of the provinces.  I am for that.  I am for equality of 
individuals.  That is exactly why I said yesterday that to make 
sure that everybody in Canada is equal we will put some of the 
money in the surplus to give a chance for students to go to 
university so they will be on an equal footing with the children 
of the rich people of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Reformers believe that any surpluses belong to Canadians and they 
are really demanding accountability.  To lay to rest the 
confusion over the government's 50:50 promise, will the finance 
minister provide a separate accounting for the surplus in all 
future budgets and will he commit to itemizing in the 1998 budget 
all the new spending announced today?  A simple question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is axiomatic and very clear that in every budget the 
government accounts for government spending.  I can assure the 
hon. member that I will do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition drew the comparison between the 
Tories and the current government and asked what some of the 
differences were.  There are a multitude.  There is another 
difference.  I believe that the then minister of finance, Michael 
Wilson, wanted to cut the deficit but he did not get the support 
of his prime minister, and I did. 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
are glad to see that the finance minister is making up with the 
prime minister.  That is wonderful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the finance minister said no government can operate 
effectively when its projections fall consistently short of the 
mark.  Yet now even he refuses to set a mark.  Is this 50:50 
shell game a deliberate attempt to bamboozle the public and to 
pick the pockets of the Canadian public?  That is what we want to 
know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleague, I am having a bit of trouble 
with the phrase “a deliberate attempt to bamboozle”.  I want to 
caution the member to please choose his words judiciously. 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if anybody is going to make up with anybody, perhaps the 
hon. member might make up with his leader whom he consigned to the 
scrap heap of history yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be very clear.  We are going to balance the budget in 
1998-99.  There are going to be surpluses.  We are going to be in 
a position to cut taxes.  We are going to reduce debt and we are 
going to invest in the future of Canadians.  We will set this out 
in the budget and in the interim between now and then in the 
fiscal update we are going to consult with Canadians as to their 
priorities.

<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the Prime Minister made a very telling statement on the 
consultations to be held by the provinces on the Calgary declaration. 
The Prime Minister said that the federal government might consult 
Quebecers, going around the Government of Quebec and the National 
Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to ask the Prime Minister whether he knows how the 
other provinces will consult their citizens on the Calgary declaration. 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
provinces have used or will use all kinds of ways to consult their 
citizens, and I think the Canadian government has the right to consult 
Canadians throughout Canada. However, I did not say we would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh! 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B> No, that is not what I said. I said, in 
response to a question by the member who asked us to do so immediately, 
that I did not reject the idea. First we will see what the provinces 
that agreed to work on this will do, and then we will let you know. 
However, no one can deny the right of the Parliament of Canada to 
consult the voters who elect the members of this Parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister talks about all kinds of ways. We saw a number of these 
mentioned in the newspapers. But the Prime Minister did not specify what 
kind of means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could he, in a major speech he made yesterday, lend such 
credibility to strategies as yet unknown, to consultations which may or 
may not be reliable? How can he try to go around the Government of 
Quebec and the National Assembly without knowing what kind of 
consultations the provinces will hold on the Calgary declaration? 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, each 
provincial government will decide what form of consultation it will use. 
At this point, it seems obvious that each government will opt for 
different methods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many ways to consult the public. We think that we can 
consult the public if necessary. I never said we would do so, and we 
never determined what form this would take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are perfectly happy to see the provinces select different 
methods to consult their citizens, and we hope that at some point they 
will adopt resolutions in their respective legislative assemblies, each 
province according to its own lights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, as soon as they have presented these resolutions, 
a similar resolution will be put before this House, and then we will 
discuss— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the Right Hon. Prime 
Minister, but the hon. member for Temiscamingue has the floor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of Newfoundland has stated that his consultation 
on the Calgary declaration would be done via the Internet, a 1-800 
line, or at riding meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister, who claims to be so concerned about 
clarity and transparency, consider this method of consultation to 
be sufficient and satisfactory? 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the premier of Newfoundland is the one answerable to the voters of 
Newfoundland, and it is up to him to defend his proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to what I have read so far, he has the agreement of 
the opposition parties to do this.  If he is making use of a modern 
method of consultation, that's fine.  Each province will have its 
own method of consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the premier of Newfoundland faces his legislature, he 
will have to justify his consultation formula.  It is not up to me 
to approve or disapprove of it, that is up to his legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B> And if the Government of Quebec 
wants to consult the people of Quebec on the same subject, it can 
do so, only it is up to the Government of Quebec to decide, not us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK143"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
very pleased to hear that it is not up to the Prime Minister to 
decide how the provinces are to conduct their business.  At last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Since the Prime Minister does not, when it 
comes down to it, know all that much about how Brian Tobin and his 
colleagues are going to hold their consultations on the Calgary 
declaration, how can he use that consultation, whose methodology he 
does not know, as a pretext, in a major speech, to make yet another 
threat against Quebec? 
<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is of course no connection. I believe the hon. member is saying 
that the procedure relating to a referendum on secession should only be 
determined by the secessionist government. This is probably what the 
member has in mind, but he certainly cannot name one country in the 
world which would accept such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member must realize that the consultation process carried 
out by the premier of Newfoundland has to do with a policy statement 
which has no constitutional impact and which only involves that 
particular province, for the time being. In the case of a secession, the 
territory of Quebec would be excluded from the Canadian legal order and 
from Canadian federal institutions, something which cannot be achieved 
through such a procedure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of trade barriers within Canada, the Minister of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think the Prime Minister has his priorities wrong.  My question 
was not for the premiers accompanying him.  It was not for the 
business community that is going to be accompanying him.  It is 
for the taxpayers who will be paying the bill for the people on 
the trip; the people who pay $1,000 a year on average because of 
trade barriers in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An internal memo of the Department of Industry established that 
only 13 percent of the trade barriers had been struck down in the last

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA PENSION PLAN 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today this government is proposing to introduce the 
single largest tax increase in history.  Working Canadians will 
be forced to pay up to $3,300 each year in the form of CPP 
payroll taxes for a maximum pension of only $8,800 a year when 
they retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Minister of Human Resources Development support such 
a bad so-called investment for Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, some time ago the chief actuary projected that unless 
the federal government and the provinces did not come together to 
deal with escalating premiums, he projected that they would have 
to go to over 14 percent in order to preserve the Canada pension plan, 
that in fact financial chaos would ensue. As a result of that, 
together with the provinces—let me be very clear—the federal 
government put in place a plan for more funding.  Yes, it will 
take the premiums to 9.9 p. cent.  That is substantially lower than the 
13 percent recommended by the Reform Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when the CPP was introduced, the government claimed that 
Canadians would never have to pay more than 5.5 percent of their 
earnings to finance the plan, but now we see 9.9 p. cent, nearly double 
its prediction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister justify making Canadians pay more in CPP 
taxes when he has actually admitted that his chief actuary of the 
fund has said that there is no guarantee that increase will give 
the return that Canadians have been promised?

</P>
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Quite the 
opposite, Mr. Speaker.  The chief actuary has said that as a 
result of the actions taken by ourselves and the provinces, as a 
result of the fuller funding, as a result of some of the changes 
to the benefits, in fact we have now preserved the Canada pension 
plan for future generations of Canadians, for those who will 
receive disability pensions which they would not receive from the 
Reform Party, for those who would receive maternity benefits 
which they would not receive from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact we have put in place along with the provinces one of the 
most modern and one of the most progressive retirement systems in 
the world.  Canadians are very proud of it and the Reform Party 
should be too.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>André Tremblay, the former constitutional adviser to several of 
Quebec's premiers, including Robert Bourassa, said that the Calgary 
declaration was an empty shell, that it amounted to next to nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since even Quebec federalists are calling the Calgary declaration 
an empty shell, how can the Prime Minister see it as a huge step forward

<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
we are to have quality debates in this House, members would do well not 
to distort what has been said.  The Prime Minister never said that it 
was a huge step forward on which we could pin all our hopes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> He said so yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Yesterday, that's right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> We can pin our hopes on the fact that Canada is 
a country Quebecers want to keep.  And that is why the Bloc Quebecois 
finds the Calgary declaration so annoying.  It is annoying because 
Quebecers want to remain in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion: </B>And that is why they far prefer anything 
advancing Canadian unity to anything calculated to destroy the country, 
as one of the Bloc Quebecois members put it, and I am not distorting his 
words. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps 
the minister was listening to something else yesterday when the Prime 
Minister gave his own speech in reply to the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another question for the minister.  Daniel Johnson, who is 
recognized as a staunch federalist, is one of the few individuals in 
Quebec right now who can go around and defend, in any event, he is one 
of those defending the Calgary declaration.  In order to sell the idea 
in Quebec, he tells Quebecers that the unique character recognized in 
Calgary is the same thing as distinct society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Minister, do you support— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, I think he heard the question. 
Moreover, you must always address the Chair.

fact— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes or no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B>  —if ever the Calgary declaration were to 
become an interpretive clause, which is possible, although it has not 
happened yet, of course, as it is under discussion, the interpretation 
given would guarantee Quebecers that the courts would take into account 
today's unique, as opposed to yesterday's distinct, character of Quebec 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a single serious jurist who would say that being 
unique had anything less to recommend it than being distinct.

that annually in Canada we have over 200,000 immigrants who will 
become Canadian citizens and whom we are very proud to welcome. 
That is the federal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, however, there are always people in life who try to

doing with the Government of Vietnam, that the federal government 
is greasing the wheels with the Vietnam government for acceptance 
of these deportees, that it is using an $8 million CIDA contract 
in Vietnam headed up by Marc Lalonde, a former government

really be continuing to try to create myths about immigration. 
That is just what he is doing with this sort of question and it is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat.  In the case of those who abuse the system, who come 
here illegally, we try to have official agreements with foreign

and breached the judicial independence of the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidence in justice documents filed with the supreme court 
indicate that a false story and cover-up of this incident were

the justice official in question exercised bad judgment but did 
not act in bad faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I reassure the hon. member that I will be 
taking under advisement that which the supreme court said and I 
will be reviewing it in the coming days.

for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considerable time has gone by since the last changes to the

people and seasonal workers are hard hit by the changes introduced by my

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development,

year ago. We have been monitoring its implementation very carefully and

Canadians from coast to coast are well served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell you that, after 25 years of an employment insurance 
system that did not keep up with changes in the job market, it was 
imperative that it be reviewed, upgraded and brought up to date because 
it served Canadians very poorly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can also tell you that we are watching the system's results very 
closely but we feel that, for the time being, it is in the interest of 
Canadians to move from passive to active measures within the system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, are the

fund to reduce the deficit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> In my opinion, the word “stealing” is unparliamentary; 
I would therefore ask my hon. colleague to withdraw it.

everywhere in this country want to retain jobs and have social 
systems which help them adapt to the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we have done with the transitional job fund. It 
has helped thousands of workers in the Atlantic region work in 
dignity instead of being limited to continual dependence on an 
income coming from outside. Our respect for these workers is what 
has prompted us to commit to active measures with enhanced budgets 
which give them the dignity of real jobs, by moving from a system 
of passive measures to active measures.

<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B>  Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker, for recognizing me on a point of order arising from 
question period.  You will have guessed that it has to do with 
the expression used in question period on which you intervened. 
It has to do with the expression “picking the pockets of 
Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I have looked in Beauchesne's sixth edition, page 
142, the section on unparliamentary language.  Unless I am 
mistaken—and I have not had a lot of time to examine precedents, 
as you will agree, Mr. Speaker—I have not found it in 
Beauchesne's.  In fact, I think it is an expression that I have 
heard in this House before.  It is an expression that I think is 
widely understood by members in the House as not being derogatory 
if that is not the intent of the person who is saying it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would respectfully submit that the expression used by the 
member was an expression that should be allowed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Many times in the course of the give and 
take in the House of Commons certain words are used and 
sometimes, as your Speaker, they seem to be inappropriate.  I do 
not know if this word is in Beauchesne's or not, but sometimes it 
is the tone used with the word and sometimes it is circumstance, 
that causes disorder, etc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the House would indulge me at the beginning.  I will have 
a look at Beauchesne's again of course.  However, I would prefer 
that we use words that are less inflammatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will surely look at the precedents and refresh my memory.  If 
it is necessary I will come back to the House.  With that said, 
this point of order is over unless the member has another point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did want to add a 
very brief comment because I think it is relevant to the way the 
House will operate and how you will, from the Chair, deal with 
these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply wanted to add that I find the same to be true for the 
word “bamboozle”.  I would appreciate if you would equally give 
consideration to that word in your research of precedents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  There are no words that I know of which of 
themselves are unparliamentary because they can be used in such a 
way that they would not be.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As your Speaker I have to decide matters during the course of 
the give and take in question period.  Surely I should have 
enough room to make decisions on your behalf so that the debates 
can continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants me to look up the word “bamboozle”, I 
will be happy to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that when I make decisions of this nature, that you will 
grant me enough room.  My intentions are to see to it that the 
House functions properly.  I will not intervene any more than I 
have to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to go to tributes.  I recognize the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona who will be saying a few words about a very 
dear colleague of ours who passed away, Mr. Stanley Knowles. 
<p align=center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE LATE HON. STANLEY HOWARD KNOWLES 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
when the last Parliament adjourned we were still fortunate enough 
to be in the company of Mr. Stanley Knowles, the former member 
for Winnipeg North Centre.  However, as everyone here will know, 
shortly after the general election of June 2 Mr. Knowles passed 
away just short of his 89th birthday.  At that time he was 
honoured appropriately on the Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the special honours that he received at that time 
from the House, from the government and from the Canadian people 
in a massive overwhelming way, we have a tradition in this place 
of paying tribute to former members.  It is at this time that I 
would like to pay tribute to Mr. Knowles, the former member for 
Winnipeg North Centre, whose association with this place 
stretched over 50 years, 55 years from the time he was first 
elected in 1942 up until 1997 when he was still serving as an 
honorary officer of the table, with the exception of the four 
years that he spent out of office from 1958 to 1962.  But he 
first ran for Parliament in 1935. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously it was a tremendous span of association with Canadian 
politics.  He was someone who I think was regarded almost 
universally as one of the great parliamentarians of our time.  We 
will miss him and we will miss having him here with us.  Of 
course as New Democrats we especially regret that he was not here 
to enjoy our return to this Parliament with the status of an 
official party. I know that my leader expressed similar 
sentiments yesterday when she spoke to the Speech from the 
Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley Knowles was a great defender of veterans, of the poor, 
of women, of anyone who needed help, of anyone who should have 
been the object of our compassion, either individually or as a 
society.  He saw government as something that could play a 
positive role in the economy and in the creation of social 
programs.  He fought especially for the elderly and for pensions 
and for a decent public pension system in this country and he 
lived to see many of his dreams realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately he also lived to see the day when some of those 
dreams began to unravel as part of the policies adopted in recent 
years.  So many of us here, inspired by his work and by his 
commitment to such things, intend to continue that work and to 
defend and to promote the ideals that he represented in this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could talk about Stanley Knowles for a long time and never 
say the same thing twice because there is so much to say about 
the former member for Winnipeg North Centre but we only have a 
brief time here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to extend on behalf of my colleagues and I am sure on 
behalf of everyone our condolences to his family and our great 
appreciation of the gift that they gave to us, all the hours that 
Stanley Knowles spent in this place day after day, night after 
night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember seeing him the night before his stroke.  It was 11 
o'clock in the evening in the hallway of the sixth floor of the 
Centre Block.  He always paid attention to Parliament and cared 
about Parliament and cared about what Parliament was doing and 
how it was doing it.  If there is one thing we can say about Mr. 
Knowles, it is that he always carried out his duties with a great 
deal of honour, dignity and a respect for the parliamentary 
process.  We mourn his loss here today and pay him tribute.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to be able take part in this tribute 
to the memory of the late Hon. Stanley Knowles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a vigorous spokesman for the elderly, for the poor, for 
the less favoured people in our society.  He was an outstanding 
expert on the procedures and the rules of the House.  He was one 
of the ornaments of the House of Commons in this and in previous 
generations.  He will be very much missed.  It will not be the 
same when we look toward you, Mr. Speaker, and do not see Mr. 
Knowles sitting at the table as honorary clerk, as the 
proceedings unwind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Government of Canada I would like to extend 
deepest sympathies and condolences to the family, the children 
and grandchildren of Stanley Knowles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will be very much missed in this House and in our country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I also join with other MPs in paying tribute to the late 
Stanley Knowles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Knowles' contributions to this House and to Canada are well 
known.  His consistent advocacy of social legislation to help the 
old, the sick, the young and the poor, his advocacy in defence of 
democracy mainly through the development and the improvement of 
the rules and procedures of the House, his contributions and 
accomplishments as a social democrat are a monument in themselves 
and there is little we can do to add to their lustre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other dimension of Mr. Knowles' life and career 
that we should not lose sight of in praising his accomplishments 
as a social democrat. Stanley Knowles began his career as a 
minister of the Christian gospel.  All the old western populace 
movements, Réal, Social Credit, the Progressives, the CCF, which 
later became the NDP, all had a spiritual dimension to their 
beginnings and their mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Knowles, like his friends and collaborators J.S. Woodsworth 
and Tommy Douglas who were also Christian ministers in the 
Methodist and Baptist traditions, was a part of the social gospel 
movement, a movement that true religion encompassed not only the 
vertical relationship of individuals to God but also the 
horizontal dimension of service to one's fellow man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of Stanley Knowles as a servant of Canada, as a servant 
of his party, as a servant of this House and a servant of the 
common people. But I also think of him as a servant of a higher 
master. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an honour to pay tribute to him today in all the 
dimensions of his service. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure, on behalf of Bloc Quebecois members, to join with my 
colleagues in paying tribute to Stanley Knowles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I became a member of this House, in 1984, Mr. Knowles had just 
ended his last term as an active member of Parliament. A few months 
earlier, the Prime Minister had offered him, with the unanimous consent 
of the House, to sit at the clerk's table. So, during my first years in 
this Parliament, I often had the opportunity to consult with him. He 
became an effective conciliator between the leaders of the various 
parties, as well as a knowledgeable consultant to each party and an 
exceptional advisor to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No Bloc Quebecois member currently in this House has had the honour 
of sitting with him. However, most of us have heard about him since 1993 
and seen him sitting at the clerk's table in the past few years. 
Everyone knows of his tremendous efforts to introduce social measures in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Knowles' religious background eventually led him to run for 
office. Sometimes he would say, and I do not know for sure whether he 
was joking or not, that it was easier to change laws than souls. This is 
why he went into politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was elected to Parliament and quickly became an expert on 
procedure. 
I think his great parliamentary skills were confirmed during the famous 
pipeline debate, in 1956. In addition to being an expert on procedure 
and a man who devoted his political career to the poor, Mr. Knowles was 
also a good organizer and he had the ability to bring people together. 
This led him to create the New Democratic Party, in 1961.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was said that Parliament was not his second home, but his main 
residence. Stanley Knowles was a man of conviction; he was always 
prepared to fight for the poor and the elderly. He was a man of courage, 
in spite of his physical frailty. He suffered from multiple sclerosis, 
but this never stopped him from fighting for the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was an honest man, respectful of and respected by his political 
opponents. 
In a sense, Stanley was the conscience of this Parliament. He will 
remain a legend in Canadian politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To his family, his friends and his party, I express, in my own name 
and on behalf of my colleagues, our most sincere condolences. I conclude 
with this beautiful line from the great French author Alexandre Dumas, 
who said “Those whom we have loved and lost are no longer where they 
were, but they are still everywhere we are”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
tributes the public paid to Stanley Knowles earlier this summer 
here in this building and in this city and in Winnipeg stand as a 
monument to a politician who cared deeply for his community and 
for his country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Behind the legend there was a mortal who saw his public duty, 
who was prepared to engage in public life to change things, and 
millions of Canadians benefited from his efforts, the poor, the 
veterans, the aged, to name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mention has been made of the high honour the House gave to Mr. 
Knowles by making him an honorary officer and giving him a seat 
at the table.  People who watched the proceedings of the House 
perhaps remember him in that capacity in his latter years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we set out at the beginning of this new Parliament perhaps it 
would be best to remember Stanley Knowles as a politician, a 
political warrior who was armed with the strongest armour that 
any of us can have, a writ of election and a seat in the House of 
Commons of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gave him the ability to confront the issues of our time as he 
confronted the issues of his with determination, unfailing 
courtesy and hard work.  The families of politicians inevitably 
pay a price for this dedication.  I hope that the pride that they 
are entitled to feel at the end of Mr. Knowles' life tempers the 
sense of loss which, regardless of age and its infirmities, must 
still be great indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a House of Commons gentleman, a politician, a 
parliamentarian, and we are better in this country because of his 
dedication to Canada.  On behalf of my party here, our deepest 
sympathy goes out to Mr. Knowles' family.  We want to say that we 
honoured him greatly and we still do in the remembrance of him. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today also on behalf of my colleague, the member for 
Winnipeg Centre, since both of us share in the privilege of 
representing a constituency that Stanley held for 38 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our only regret today as we take up our rightful places in this 
Chamber is that Stanley Knowles is not looking over at us from 
his place at the centre of the table in this Chamber.  We know 
that nothing would have made Stanley Knowles happier and prouder 
than to know that his constituency, one for which he worked so 
long and hard, had come home to the NDP on June 2, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg Centre and I, and I believe all of my 
colleagues in our caucus and all parties in this House share in 
the responsibility of carrying on the legacy of Stanley Knowles.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know it is impossible to fill his shoes but we can strive to 
be like him, fighting for social justice with honour, pursuing 
righteousness with kindness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the best way to carry on his legacy and honour 
his work is to try to maintain the high standards he set for all 
of us, the standards of fighting persistently for social justice 
and always doing it with honesty and integrity.  It is our turn 
to carry on the torch of Stanley Knowles, to carry on his fight 
for security for seniors, for equality for all people and hope 
for a better day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We mourn the loss of a great Canadian, a founding member of the 
NDP, the conscience of Parliament.  But his work, his words, his 
fighting spirit live on.  The best way we could pay tribute to 
Stanley is to use his own words, words he delivered in 1930 in a 
valedictory address to Brandon College. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To paraphrase his words, as we stand here in this Chamber our 
thoughts go back to the pioneering spirit of Stanley Knowles who 
struggled and sacrificed for this institution here in this place. 
His memory seems to hallow the very ground on which we stand.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY

His Excellency the Governor General in reply to his speech at the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
nice to be back here.  I will be sharing my time with the member 
for Shefford.  I want to congratulate you on your elevation to 
the Chair.  Most if not all of us would agree that you are a 
learned student of this House.  I would say you have mastered the 
rules of procedure and you are very diplomatic in your skills and 
in handling numbers.  Congratulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my constituents for sending me here and for 
placing their trust in me.  I want to let them know back home 
that I will do the very best job I can to represent them in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention my riding a little before I begin my address 
to the throne speech.  My riding is called Charlotte but it 
contains seven counties either in whole or in part.  The name 
Charlotte really does not do justice to the description of the 
riding.  One of the things that we will be entertaining is the 
possible name change for the riding to reflect those folks who 
live in some of the other counties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech was a big disappointment to me.  It was filled 
with vague generalities and all kinds of platitudes with not a 
whole lot of meat or substance.  I do not think many Canadians 
could find satisfaction in what they heard in that speech the 
other day, in particular when we note that Canada is going 
through a high rate of sustained unemployment.  We have had 87 
months of unemployment at a rate of over 9 percent which is absolutely 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often said that the essence of life is hope.  I do not 
think there was much hope in the document of the other day. 
Canadians, in particular Canadians from Atlantic Canada and some 
of the poorer parts of Canada, would not take a whole lot of 
comfort in it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that last week when the Leader of the 
Opposition was interviewed by a newspaper in Atlantic Canada he 
alluded to some of the poorer parts of his province which 
sometimes we do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that some of the hurt that is being experienced in the 
country knows no bounds.  I can talk about Atlantic Canada but 
there are other parts of Canada that are also going through some 
pretty tough times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often said that a real measure of a government should be 
how it deals with its poor, its elderly and its sick.  After 
examining this government since 1993, I would add to that list 
the youth of Canada.  The government has failed miserably. It 
cannot seem to grasp the reality that there are a lot of people 
hurting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we listen to the finance minister I believe he assumes that 
since everything is well on Wall Street and Bay Street, that 
everything is well in the rest of Canada.  But let me tell the 
House it is not.  That is one of the reasons the House did make 
some changes which were reflected during the election period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members have returned to the House there is a decrease in the 
size of the majority of the government which it enjoyed in its 
first mandate.  I believe that was for a very particular reason. 
I believe it is because there are lot of very disillusioned 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States over the last 10 years there has been an 
11 percent increase in real incomes.  In the corresponding period in 
Canada there has been a 1.3 percent decrease in real incomes. There is 
something wrong when that happens and the government has yet to 
figure out what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take a look at the unemployment rates in the country we 
are in the same situation.  Our unemployment numbers are exactly 
double those of the United States. There are many reasons for 
that obviously.  But I think one big reason we have had that 
sustained unemployment rate in Canada is a lack of vision on the 
part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been blessed by many things, some of them 
completely beyond its control or which it had nothing whatsoever 
to do with. It has been blessed with a period of economic growth 
since it took office but that has not actually been translated 
into real jobs.  It has been blessed with very low international 
interest rates, which has played well for the government in terms 
of debt reduction, which again has nothing to do with the 
government itself.  It has been blessed with some financial 
measures which any government could have fared better with than 
what it has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediately on taking office in 1993 it proceeded on the route 
it is famous for, downloading its problems on to another level of 
government.  It certain did that.  If we measure the reduction in 
spending in Ottawa since 1993, over 90 percent of that has been 
downloaded on to the backs of the provinces.  The statistics will 
tell us that only 2 percent of the cuts came out of downtown Ottawa and 
its government departments. The rest was downloaded on to the 
backs of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is an example.  A 40 percent cut in health care transfers 
to the provinces.  That translates into a figure of approximately 
$8 billion.  What the government and its finance minister and the 
prime minister forgot is that there is only one taxpayer.  When 
they download on to the provinces they have to do one of two 
things, accept the download or download themselves on to the 
backs of the municipalities, again forgetting there is only one 
taxpayer. 
That has hurt us in Atlantic Canada.  It has hurt us in a number 
of ways but particularly in health care.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is anyone in any part of this country who 
could stand up today to say with any degree of confidence that 
our health care system can sustain those types of cuts.  If we 
measure what we have today versus what we had 10 years ago, there 
are a lot of Canadians who are very worried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answers to some of these problems are not easy.  There is no 
question about that.  It requires some ingenuity on the part of 
the government to recognize that there are problems out there 
which must be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Atlantic Canada we are not talking about handouts; we are 
talking about strategic investment into the area of the country 
that has the greatest amount of unemployment.  In some parts of 
Atlantic Canada the unemployment rate is over 30 p. cent.  The 
government has to do something about it.  Just downloading onto 
the backs of the provinces, particularly the poorer provinces, is 
not going to solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the brain drain of Atlantic Canada.  We educate our 
youth only to find that they have to move out to get a job.  The 
old expression is that Atlantic Canada is a nice place to live, 
provided you can get a job.  There is nothing in the throne 
speech which would give Atlantic Canadians, particularly young 
Atlantic Canadians, any degree of hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent on this government to take the message which was 
given to it on June 2 and respond to the needs of Atlantic 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the speech of my 
colleague from the Conservative Party with interest and was unable 
to detect, in the part I was able to hear, any personal opinion on 
the matter of the amendment to the amendment by the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for my colleague from the Conservative 
Party.  Does the hon. member acknowledge that the Government's 
legislative program denies the existence of the Quebec people and 
its culture? 
In responding to this question, can he tell us whether he will in 
fact vote in favour of the amendment we are proposing?  And even 
more fundamental than that, does the hon. member acknowledge the 
existence of the Quebec people as a people? Such recognition would 
make it possible to reach a solution to the constitutional problem 
which has been with us for more than 30 years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that one of the best things the government could do 
for Canada—and obviously Canada in my eyes includes Quebec, a 
healthy Quebec, a Quebec that is as vibrant as we want to see the 
rest of Canada be—would be to get the economy moving in a way 
that brings everyone in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned before, the government is taking a lot of 
pleasure in the growth in the stock market and how well Bay 
Street and Wall Street are doing, but it has forgotten that 
consumer confidence in Canada is at an all-time low.  The 
sustained rate of unemployment is hurting us.  Ordinary Canadians 
have no confidence in the future.  That includes the citizens of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anything we can do to help in creating a healthy, vibrant 
economy and anything that we can do to improve the lot of all 
citizens in the province of Quebec, English as well as French 
speaking, I am in favour of it and this party is in favour of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
know that time is short so I will simply move to one of the 
member's statements and that was that there is only one taxpayer. 
The member probably will know that in the province of Ontario 
the Mike Harris government has extended a 15 percent tax decrease to the 
residents of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member believes there is only one taxpayer.  Would he not 
agree that the impact of so-called downloading has not been as 
severe as he might suggest simply because the government feels it 
is important to have given that tax break notwithstanding any 
changes from federal transfers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I were a member from 
Ontario I think I could stand up here and boast about the economy 
of my home province, but unfortunately I am not from Ontario. 
Obviously that is one of the reasons why the Liberal Party won 
every seat, with the exception of one, that of my colleague just 
in front of me.  It is because the people very seldom reject a 
government if the economy is moving well as evidenced in just 
about every election in the United States and Canada in the last 
100 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were living in downtown Toronto or Oakville, Ontario I 
would agree 100 percent with what the member has stated.  They are 
basically satisfied with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country as a whole is what I am worried about.  That wealth 
and industrial prosperity has not spread across this country in 
the directions that we would like to see it spread.  It has not 
spread north, east, or west in some areas.  As I mentioned 
earlier in my speech, even places in British Columbia and Alberta 
have their problems, but in Atlantic Canada we have serious 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that the government does have to take a look 
at is a reduction in taxes.  We are proposing a reduction in 
payroll taxes, those employment insurance taxes of which the 
government today is sitting on a bank roll of somewhere between 
$5 billion and $10 billion and using that for goodness sake to 
reduce the size of the national debt, which is ridiculous.  The 
government is putting the problem right on the backs of the 
unemployed, the very people it should be helping.

first like to congratulate you on your appointment.  I would also 
like to take this opportunity to thank the people of Shefford for 
the confidence they showed in me in the recent federal election. 
I want them to know that I will work with all my heart to defend 
their interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To return to Tuesday's speech from the throne, the government 
has revealed its political intentions. 
Satisfied with the current state of the country and unable to offer 
Canadians a national vision with clear objectives for the country 
as a whole, the Chrétien government has certainly set out its 
intentions, but without structure or time frame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the speech not put forward any creative vision 
enabling us to move into the 21st century, but it fails to respond 
to Canadians' real concerns.  The speech is a Liberal speech, the 
same one they have been dishing up for years.  It says nothing to 
me and enables them to improvise, as they always have.  They turn 
whichever way the wind blows, taxing, cutting, taxing, spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuesday's speech from the throne contained at least one piece 
of good news.  The government will soon have a budget surplus. 
The bad news is that Canadians will not see a cent of it.  The 
Liberal government now has to repair the damage it did in its first 
mandate and reinvest in the programs it had previously cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know, we should not be surprised, this is the Liberal 
style.  We are here in the House of Commons to work together to 
build a better future for our country.  The challenge facing Canada 
is of significant proportions and warrants all our energies and 
creativity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must build for our children a country in which they can grow and 
develop without going hungry and without lacking quality health care, in 
a context that will encourage them to excel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, has 
developed a plan providing Canadians with a vision for the future that 
meets their aspirations and expectations, a simple, down to earth and 
unifying plan. Time has come to take new approaches and to offer new 
solutions. The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada has already come 
up with a plan that will give Canadians a vision, a down to earth plan 
for the future of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a vision and a plan are not enough. Leadership is required 
to achieve key priorities. Our program for growth has three main 
thrusts: sound management of taxpayers' money; quality of life for our 
fellow citizens and, finally, initiatives for a brighter future. Quite 
simply, what sound management of taxpayers' money stands for is the need 
for any responsible government to introduce legislation to make fiscal 
balance mandatory, lower employment insurance premiums and reduce 
personal income tax. What people want is not rhetoric and empty 
promises, but action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was in a position to act, but once again it sat back 
and did nothing. There is also a need to improve the quality of life of 
all Canadians. 
Our social safety net, which is the envy of many nations around the 
world, cannot be expected to withstand much longer the drastic cuts made 
by the government across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerned with putting its financial house in order, the 
government, during its first mandate, brought all existing support 
programs and the Canada Assistance Plan together under a single umbrella 
called the Canada health and social transfer. Once again, concern about 
saving money took precedence over common sense, and government 
assistance was cut by $7 billion over four years with the results that 
we know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of federal transfers leaving the provinces at the mercy of 
the federal government's goodwill, we are proposing a tax point transfer 
to the provinces and territories to ensure stable funding. This way, 
provincial and territorial governments would be forever protected 
against cuts like those imposed by the Liberals. 
In addition, the public would receive services from governments that are 
closer to them and their situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud the government's desire to end child poverty. 
Unfortunately, its efforts are directed more at the consequences of the 
problem than at the problem itself.  There are 1.5 million children 
living in poverty in Canada.  These children are poor because their 
parents are poor.  Their parents are poor because the government has 
focused all its attention on one thing: the deficit.  And all the while, 
Canadian workers, children and the elderly have been paying the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government even admits in the throne speech that it has the 
means to improve our children's lives and that it intends to invest in 
their well-being.  Let us remember that the money referred to by the 
government in its speeches has already been committed in the two 
previous years' budgets. 
Let us be clear: the government is promising us money it has already 
invested and it is promising to invest at least that much again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this another of those elusive promises, like the 150,000 day 
care spaces, or will the federal government actually make a commitment 
this time?  Of all the promises made by the Liberals during the election 
campaign, let us hope that those concerning children will be kept, and 
kept a little better than the motion passed in the House of Commons in 
1989 to end child poverty by the year 2000.  If the current trend 
continues, the child poverty rate will have doubled by then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, over 1,500 food banks and hundreds of soup 
kitchens are waging the fight against hunger.  Under the present 
government's plan, millions of children will still go to school hungry 
tomorrow. 
It is unfortunate that this sad reality is only brought home to us 
during electoral periods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising that election-minded politics like this have 
undermined the credibility of our institutions.  When the public has 
regained faith in its public institutions, we will have the stability 
and confidence necessary to move forward.  The country needs leadership 
with the courage to renew and revitalize the federation in order to show 
that it can work to everyone's satisfaction.

of discussion. I am convinced that it is possible to find a basis 
for agreement. Canadians from all walks of life will not waste much 
time in extremist rhetoric, and they will demonstrate their 
attachment to Canada, I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time again for us to join forces around a common ideal. 
the polls clearly demonstrate that Quebecers have Canadian values 
at heart and want to remain within the country they helped build. 
Let us not get hung up on the words, the reality is clear. 
Quebecers are Quebecers, and just as proud to be Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is less clear is that, in neither the last referendum nor 
the last electoral campaign, not even in the meeting at Calgary, 
was there any manifestation of leadership by our Prime Minister. 
I apologize for not mincing any words, but his leadership is worn 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our dynamic team, representing a new generation of 
politicians, will advance some constructive ideas which will rally

and the true opposition which can speak on behalf of all Canadians

I remember in 1967 the Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup 
and 90 percent of the team was made up of older players who brought a 
wealth of experience and knowledge to the team.  Punch Imlach was 
able to bring the Stanley Cup to the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
Similarly, this administration and its leaders with a wealth of 
knowledge and expertise has done many things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member on her election.  She referred to 
damage done by the Liberal government's first mandate.  I would 
like to talk about that damage for a minute:  damage such as 
900,000 jobs created in its first mandate; damage such as 
inheriting a deficit of $42 billion which her Conservative Party 
left us with—and it is now said to be anywhere from zero to $5 
billion; damage such as creating the fastest growing economy in 
the G-7; damage such as creating opportunities for youth in the 
programs outlined in the throne speech and before; damage such 
as, as the national health forum indicated before the election, 
the need to make the ceiling $12.5 billion.  Immediately the 
government restored it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member.  She talked about 
lowering payroll taxes.  Is the member aware that when the 
Liberal government took over in 1993 the Conservative government 
had it pegged at $3.30 per $100?  Does she know what the Liberal 
government did from day one until now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If she does not know, I will be glad to remind her.  If she does 
know, I would like her to point out what the payroll taxes are 
today as opposed to what they were under a Conservative 
government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to respond.  I 
did not understand everything the hon. member said, but I think the 
deficit he is talking about was created by the Liberals.  We too 
had to deal with that deficit, and, had the Conservative government 
not introduced free trade, we would not be where we are today.

programs, children and the deficit, but the most important point 
the Prime Minister raised yesterday was Canadian unity.  I heard no 
mention of that, particularly with respect to the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask her a question, because it is all very 
well to talk of the economy, but I think the most important thing 
is simply to reach a common understanding.  What is the role of 
each province in the Constitution?

the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to indicate at the beginning that I am sharing my time with the 
hon. member for Windsor—St. Clair. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great pleasure to speak to this House in reply to the 
throne speech, which outlines the government's priorities for the first 
session of the 36th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start by thanking the people of Simcoe North for 
renewing their vote of confidence by granting me a second term in the 
federal election last June. I would also like to mention the inestimable 
support I have received from my wife and family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many positive elements in the throne speech. Thanks to 
the persistent efforts of the federal government and the support of 
Canadians, we can at last enjoy the fruits of our collective labours. 
Optimism is no longer the exception but the rule, since we now have 
regained the ability to address the priorities of Canadians fairly and 
equitably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to expand on three themes we find in the throne 
speech: social reform, economic reform and national unity. The 
legislation that will be introduced to implement the proposed changes to 
the Canada Pension Plan and the non-taxable seniors benefit will, I 
believe, ensure that our public pension system will remain sustainable 
for generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may point out that when the seniors benefit comes into effect in 
2001, benefits for our neediest seniors will increase. 
In fact, about 75 percent of seniors, which includes nine elderly women out of 
ten, will have an income that is either equal to or higher than their 
present income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support unconditionally the government's commitment to maintain 
a comprehensive public health care system that provides universal access 
to high quality care for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the National Forum on Health tabled its report this year, the 
government had to acknowledge its conclusions, and it did so in the 
throne speech. Canadians, including many of my constituents, were 
worried about the restructuring of our medicare system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The announcement that the government, working with its partners, 
will develop a national plan, time table and fiscal framework for 
setting up a system that guarantees access to medically necessary drugs, 
and will also support home and community care, shows that the message 
sent by Canadians about public health care has been received and 
understood by this government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of the government's economic record.  The throne 
speech reflects our commitment to thoughtful economic management. 
I would like to mention some examples of this commitment, for 
instance a balanced budget no later than 1998-99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be the first time in almost 30 years that the country 
has had a balanced budget. 
With a surplus debt to GDP ratio the current account balance has 
gone from a deficit of 4.2 percent of GDP to a surplus of .55 
percent in 1996. The government achieved the first annual surplus 
since 1982.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the spending contained in the throne speech is funded by 
budgetary surpluses.  I want to be crystal clear on this point. 
The budgetary surpluses during this mandate will be the source of 
funding for new programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will not be relying on borrowing moneys.  We will 
not be spending our children's inheritance.  Fifty per cent of 
budgetary surpluses will go to investments in social and economic 
priorities and fifty per cent will go to tax reduction and debt 
repayment.  This 50:50 split ensures that the Liberal commitments 
to sound economic planning and to social responsibility will go 
hand in hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second mandate the government will do more on job 
creation for young Canadians.  In February 1997 the government 
announced the youth employment strategy.  This strategy 
consolidates over $2 billion in new and existing programs and 
services for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will also work with the business community and 
the provinces to forecast areas of job growth.  This planning 
ahead is a concrete example of how the government will help young 
people meet the challenges of the job market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently lead community consultation on job creation in my 
riding of Simcoe North.  The citizens of Simcoe North felt that 
apprenticeship and training programs would help young people get 
into fulfilling and well paying jobs.  They also felt that the 
perception of various kinds of jobs needs to improve.  For 
example, the skilled trades should be valued for the contribution 
they make to a vibrant economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will be initiating measures similar to those 
suggested by the people of Simcoe North.  Internship programs 
will be extended and expanded.  The government will provide 
enhanced funding for student summer placements.  A Canada-wide 
mentorship program will be created in partnership with the 
provincial governments and the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the government has shown that it is listening to 
Canadians and working with them to secure a better future for 
young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly encouraged by the government statement on 
national unity.  As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, I have had the opportunity to discuss 
national unity with Canadians from Newfoundland and Labrador to 
British Columbia.  The government's approach to national unity 
reflects the concerns I have heard from these Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the government is committed to the recognition of 
Quebec's unique language, culture and legal system.  The 
government will work closely with provincial and territorial 
leaders to advance the progress made in the Calgary declaration. 
Recognition of Quebec's unique character, language and legal 
system will not entail any new powers, privileges or rights. This 
message must be carried to all Canadians in every province and 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the government will ensure that the national unity 
debate is conducted with clarity and frankness.  It is critical 
that Quebeckers, especially francophone Quebeckers, understand 
the consequences and the implications of separation.  It is 
equally fundamental that Canadians outside Quebec understand the 
same consequences and the implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the words of the throne speech: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the government will bring frankness and clarity to any debate 
that puts into question the future existence or unity of Canada. 
It will create a better understanding of the true complexity and 
difficulty for all of us in severing ties— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the government on the commitment to deal 
assertively to bring clarity to this debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of this government's programs could be carried out if our 
national unity initiatives were not successful. The government therefore 
views its mandate in that area in a global and encompassing fashion. Any 
measure that strengthens the country will have a unifying effect on 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, we pledge to work in partnership with the 
provinces and territory. Our federation as we know it is flexible. This 
needs to be repeated over and over in the presence of separatists. Far 
from being fixed and immovable, our federation is one that keeps 
evolving.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that Canadians have done a great deal to help the federal 
government put its financial house in order and strengthen the social 
and political fabric of Canada. We have come a long, hard way, but the 
end is in sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I want to reaffirm my solemn commitment to represent

Atlantic Canadians were not simply frustrated with cuts but

enterprise system and can utilize the tools of the free 
enterprise system to build a stronger, more self-reliant Atlantic 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a Conservative, an Atlantic Canadian and a small business 
person.  None of these are mutually exclusive.  Earlier today the 
member for Medicine Hat referred to the member for Saint John as 
a New Democrat because she expressed compassion for the 
underprivileged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compassion is not partisan in principle.  Compassion is 
something we all should have within the House.  While some 
members in this House prefer to talk about fights for the right, 
there are some of us who prefer to simply work hard for what is 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I look forward to working with the members of this 
House and to making a difference in the lives of Canadians.  I 
would like to ask this government what, over the next four years, 
it intends doing to demonstrate vision for Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would first like to 
indicate that the hon. member has some tremendous shoes to fill 
in representing the riding of Kings—Hants.  The former member, 
John Murphy, served that riding extremely well.  I visited the 
riding with John and know it well so I wish the member the best 
of luck in that endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His question concerned the vision the government intends to show 
over the next four years.  That is the subject matter of this 
debate.  The Speech from the Throne is the blueprint.  There is 
much that I and others have pointed out in our speeches which 
addresses that question.  For instance, the new commitment of 
another $850 million to the child tax credit is something that 
will address the concerns that were addressed by the member in 
the prelude to his question.  That is but one example of the 
vision that we need to show.

to congratulate you on your appointment as Acting Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to draw your attention to the speech made by the hon. 
member, who is an experienced member of this House, and who 
speaks in English in a certain way and in French in a different 
way. I heard him speak in English about being firm. When alluding 
to the issue of national unity in English he advocated the hard 
line, because he was addressing English Canadians, of course, but 
he used a much more conciliatory tone in French.

francophone, but he is also the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs. I want to ask the hon. member if, as the 
assistant to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, he does 
recognize the people of Quebec. Is he prepared to say, in this House, 
that there is a Quebec people? Is the hon. member prepared to do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois' strategy in 
this debate is clearly to ask all Liberal members the same question. Of 
course, we use inclusive terms such as “society”. The word “people” has 
several connotations which may give rights in international law, but we 
use the word “society” because it is more inclusive.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B> 
Congratulations, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before commenting on the motion before this House I would like 
to take the opportunity to thank the constituents of Windsor—St. 
Clair for their support in the June election.  I am honoured to 
be asked to represent them once again and their faith in our 
government is not misplaced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish also to thank the many volunteers who supported our 
campaign and whose friendship I cherish very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Windsor—St. Clair, which is basically the east end of Windsor, 
Tecumseh and the village of St. Clair Beach, have once again 
placed their faith in our government.  Throughout the campaign 
they told us loud and clear what they were concerned about. Those 
things included health care, education, unemployment and in 
particular, youth unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were local concerns but we would be mistaken to think that 
the constituents of Windsor—St. Clair have only local concerns. 
Indeed they were also concerned about national unity, Canada's 
role as a trading nation and Canada's role as an international 
broker of peace, her role generally in the global village. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech and the subsequent address yesterday by the 
right hon. Prime Minister indicate that the government has 
listened to Windsor—St. Clair.  Not only did we listen but we 
are putting in place programs to alleviate the concerns that I 
have outlined.   All the while we are maintaining our steady 
attack on both the deficit and the debt. Canada will never under 
a Liberal government, in any event, return to the financial 
crisis that we faced when we came to power in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to funds for health and education, we will continue 
our attack on unemployment in general and youth unemployment in 
particular.  Programs like Youth Services Canada are already 
operating in Windsor—St. Clair to give young people work 
experience and a wage while they serve our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus of this government is such that we can be assured that 
the concerns of the constituents of Windsor—St. Clair will be 
met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to urge the government to work with us on more 
specific areas which will help our community to prosper even 
more.  It is my belief that an economically prosperous community 
is able to better overcome other social problems.  It is my 
belief that economic prosperity will lead generally to a better 
quality of life, to lower crime rates, to a lack of other social 
problems, to lower welfare rates and to a generally better 
lifestyle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way to do that is to offer more support to our local 
industries.  It is no secret that Windsor is Canada's motor city. 
I like to say that Windsor is effectively the centre of the 
universe, but that may not be the case for some of my colleagues. 
I can say however that it is urgent and very important for our 
community to see support from the government for the automotive 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The automotive industry employs directly or indirectly 
approximately half of working Ontarians.  It is the biggest 
employer in our province and as an industrial group the most 
important employer in our province. It is of the utmost 
importance for the Government of Canada to focus on issues like 
tariffs, apprenticeship training for skilled trades and on other 
areas that will offer support to our domestic automotive 
industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a trading nation and in the 1960s under the leadership 
of Prime Minister Lester Pearson and my predecessor in 
Windsor—St. Clair or Windsor—Walkerville as it was then, the 
Hon. Paul Martin, Sr., the auto pact was signed.  The auto pact 
has reached an almost sacred position in our community because 
the auto pact is the engine that allows those industries to 
exist, to prosper and employs our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view it is important that the government continue to focus 
on agreements like the auto pact, to give them support and 
strength so that we will have more employment, more prosperity 
and therefore a better quality of life in Windsor, Tecumseh, St. 
Clair Beach and in the province of Ontario generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important also that we support other industries.  In the 
last five or six years the tourism industry has become vital to 
our community.  Tourism and particularly the gambling industry 
fuelled by Casino Windsor have become extremely important. 
However, there is a fly in the ointment.  That fly comes from the 
Conservative government of the province of Ontario which has 
consistently refused and neglected to take the steps necessary in 
order to allow the government to legalize some aspects of 
gambling which would help the casino to prosper.  I am talking 
specifically about games of dice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the near future we will be faced with competition from 
gambling facilities in the city of Detroit.  Those gambling 
casinos will have dice games.  It is important that Windsor have 
the opportunity to compete but the initiative has to come from 
the attorney general of Ontario. In spite of consistent promises 
to the mayor and citizens of Windsor who want this to happen, 
nothing has been done to approach our attorney general in order 
to start the dice rolling, as we say in Windsor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is a very important part of what our community can 
provide to Canada.  It is a very important part of the puzzle 
that is unemployment.  The more tourism there is, the more 
service jobs and jobs in tourism there will be.  It seems to me 
that it is just a simple matter of a member of the Ontario 
government picking up a pen and writing a little note and 
whisking it off to the Attorney General of Canada. Once it gets 
here I am sure the Essex County lobby and others can make sure 
that the request gets the significant attention it deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members do not think this is too much about my community, 
but I would like to talk for a minute about the heavy taxation on 
distilled spirits.  We are a town that provides what I like to 
think of as one of Canada's basic food groups, Canadian Club 
whisky.  Canadian Club is an agri-food product and is also a 
great symbol of our country in my view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has been trying to initiate discussions 
with the provinces.  However, it is time for all of us to take a 
look at this commodity which provides hundreds of jobs in my 
community.  The factory is a historic one and it is very 
important to the community that this serious problem be 
discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general foreign trade is very important to Windsor.  I would 
encourage the Prime Minister to continue his trade missions and 
to continue to invite businessmen and women from Windsor, 
Tecumseh and St. Clair Beach to join him as he promotes Canada 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Windsor prospers economically our other problems subside. Our 
crime rate is lower than it has ever been.  When one is downtown 
in the evening going to a movie or to one of our wonderful 
restaurants there is a sense of vitality and prosperity there 
that I challenge any other community in Canada to meet.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker,

government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think she indicated she would continue to attack the

has suffered unemployment rates of between 15 percent and 20 p.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member recognize that there is nothing in the

Newfoundlanders and people in Atlantic Canada who have 
persistently suffered under this economic policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen:</B>  No, I will not acknowledge that, 
Mr. Speaker.  I think my hon. friend misses the point here.  The 
point is this is a throne speech which leads us down the track of 
prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as I am disappointed that they did not mention Windsor, 
Tecumseh and St. Clair Beach, the virtual centre of the universe, 
I am sure he is disappointed that his towns were not mentioned 
specifically either.

will be solutions for Sydney, for the Cape Breton Island, for

continue with it.

loveliest ridings in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great interest to the hon. member's speech and I

their culture?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty I see in my riding is that I talk to elderly 
people who are having to sell their homes because of clawbacks. 
They have small incomes and they cannot afford to pay the taxes. 
Youth cannot get enough money for education.  Men and women are 
losing established jobs from established companies and those jobs 
are not being replaced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see nothing in this throne speech which would offer hope to 
these people.  Is there some mechanism which the Liberal 
government has in mind to guarantee that taxes will not be raised 
and to give Canadians relief from the taxation which is killing 
us economically and destroying the social fabric of the lives of 
so many families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was a long 
question and, leaving aside the preamble, the nub of it was are 
we going to cut taxes.  The answer is that there is still a 
deficit and there is still a debt.  As well we have some 
spending to do to assist Canadians with respect to health care, 
education and youth unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that when the deficit is settled, when we are sure 
that the country is healthy, we will spend time looking at 
taxation.  We will spend time looking at the debt.  We will make 
sure that Canada is on the right track.  We will do what the 
Canadian people elected us to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to speak today in response to 
the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the constituents of Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley who in the June election gave me a huge victory.  I want 
to commit to them, as I have in the past, that my task here is to 
represent their voices and concerns to this Parliament.  My 
promise to them was to keep the Liberals accountable for every 
single thing they try to do, and I will do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is predicted that the Liberal government will in 1998-99 
achieve a balanced budget, using Liberal numbers. I do not know 
whether we can trust Liberal numbers, but let us say they are 
fairly accurate. It must be remembered that this could be the 
first balanced budget that we have had in some 30 years. It is 
sort of ironic considering that some members of the government 
are the same members who sat in previous Liberal governments 
which helped to run up our massive debt and helped to create our 
deficits which occurred year upon year.  It is surprising but at 
the same time I suppose somewhat remarkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before anyone decides to heap any praise on the Liberal Party 
for this predicted balanced budget it is important to clearly 
identify the reasons why this balanced budget may be occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the Liberals should be expecting any praise for 
the prediction of a balanced budget.  I suggest that this Liberal 
government should be giving thanks to the millions of Canadian 
taxpayers who have been taking all the hits over the last three 
and a half years as the Liberals have attempted to dig themselves 
out of this massive financial pit that they along with the 
Tories, cheered on by the NDP, have created for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give the House some examples.  I am talking 
about the employers and the employees of the country who have 
contributed significantly to the reduction of the deficit through 
employment insurance overpayments.  Let us make it clear that the 
Liberals have been treating the EI surplus as if it were their 
own money to put toward deficit reduction and to cover their 
wasteful spending.  Everyone who can think clearly has to 
consider the EI overpayments as being simply another tax.  That 
is what it is, another tax. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be preferable to let Canadian workers keep the 
amount of this EI overpayment and let them have the freedom to 
spend, invest or save?  All these things would create jobs in 
this country and would help to get a more buoyant economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be preferable to let Canadian businesses and 
employers keep their overpayment to the EI fund as well so they 
could invest in their businesses and hire more people, which 
would also lead to the creation of a more buoyant economy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about people who have taken hits, let us not forget the 
public servants in this country who have been working since 1990 
without a raise.  They have also been forced to make a tremendous 
sacrifice because of previous Liberal-Tory overspending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe the Liberals should give thanks for their deficit 
reduction prediction to the people in Canada's poorer provinces 
who have had to bear the brunt of Liberal offloading because of 
reduced equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my favourite one.  Let us not forget that during the 
last three and a half years of Parliament this Liberal 
government, this very Liberal government that is going around 
looking for pats on the back for its balanced budget prediction, 
increased taxes in this country in 36 different areas.  There 
were 36 individual tax increases brought in by this government. 
It wrenched out of the pockets of ordinary Canadians, Canadian 
businesses and Canadian investors over $25 billion in increased 
tax revenue.  Let us not forget that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government heading for a balanced budget because it has 
been prudent in saving money?  Mr. Speaker, I know you will agree 
with me that is not the case.  Let us not forget how the Liberals 
got there.  Let us not be too anxious to go over and pat them on 
the backs as they are expecting.  We see the Liberals running 
around seeking praise for such a great job they say that they 
have done but, to use the famous phrase of the finance minister, 
the fact is what they have really been doing is pulling on their 
magic tax lever to fill their coffers while Canadian businesses 
and Canadian workers have had less and less to spend, less and 
less to invest and less and less to save. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech they mentioned the word partnership many 
times, over 10 times.  Given the Liberals' performance one can 
only assume that the Liberal definition of partnership means 
“you work, send us most of your wages and hey, we're partners”. 
The sad part of this is that despite all the taxes Canadians are 
paying, by the end of the century we will still only be getting 
about 68 percent in services for every dollar they send to this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also remember that these tax and spend Liberals are not 
as compassionate as they like to appear.  They took little or no 
notice of the pain they were inflicting on Canadian families, 
Canadian workers and Canadian businesses over these last three 
and a half years as they grabbed this tax lever and over and over 
again pulled it and pulled billions of dollars more into their 
coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury, at the same time these Liberals were 
heaping tax upon tax on the Canadian people, they were still 
pursuing their insatiable appetite for spending money in 
ridiculous and wasteful ways.  Our member for St. Albert has a 
weekly waste report. I would like to read a few of the ways the 
Liberals have spent some of the money so that people can get this 
into perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals thought it prudent to give the multibillion dollar 
company American Express $17,000.  One has to ask did they get 
any flyer points for that.  How about Big Bill's furniture and 
appliance store, $176,000.  I wonder if that is a relative of one 
of the Liberal ministers.  How about Nothing Fancy stores, 
$89,000.  Here is one that I should not be upset about but I am. 
A golf tournament for literacy received $85,000.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Literacy is a good cause.  However, I would like to remind the 
House that I host an annual golf tournament for the special 
Olympics organization in my riding.  I do not get any grant.  I 
raise $25,000 a year on that one-day golf tournament.  I do not 
ask the government for a grant.  I go out and look for sponsors, 
supporters and people who believe in the cause.  I do not look to 
the Canadian taxpayer for money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on and on.  One hundred and sixteen thousand dollars was 
given to a committee to study the sexual habits of seniors.  One 
has to assume that by the time someone gets to be a senior he or 
she probably has his or her sex life figured out pretty well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech is like a shell game.  I am glad that we are 
the official opposition because without the Reform Party here the 
Liberals would not even be talking about reducing the deficit.  I 
assure the House that we are going to keep the pressure on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our approach to ensuring responsible future spending will 
include asking Canadians what their priorities are.  Do they want 
debt retirement, tax relief, reinvestment in health and education 
or a combination of all of these? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Reform Party as the official opposition, and these 
Liberals know it, the government is finally going to learn the 
difference between good spending and bad spending.  I know the 
difference, Reformers know the difference and ordinary Canadians 
know the difference.  By the time this Parliament is through, the 
Liberals are going to know the difference.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay—Nipigon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to respond to the question 
posed by my friend from Prince George. First, let me congratulate 
you, Mr. Speaker, on assuming your position in the chair today. 
We are sure that you will fulfil the mandate required of all 
Speakers.  All of us on this side of the House wish you well. 
Someone on the other side who was speaking earlier made some 
reference to your looks.  I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, from my 
advantage point down here you look a lot better than the people 
to your left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really quite taken aback by my friend who just spoke. 
Evidently he has not been listening to his leader for the last 
two or three years.  All we have heard from the Reform Party is 
its interest in making sure that we had a balanced budget and 
that we reduced a horrendous debt that was left to us.  I do not 
know how to refer to Reform members, but would it be kind to say 
they were kissing cousins of the previous government that had the 
administration of this country for nine years?  If not kissing 
cousins, they slept in close proximity to each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debt that we inherited in 1993 was what the Reform Party, 
when it first came into the House, talked about incessantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have done as a Liberal government in four short years is 
simply this.  We have eliminated the deficit which is what 
Reformers have been talking about.  Once we have the deficit in 
this country under control then we can take a good run at working 
on the debt that was assumed by their kissing cousins or whatever 
way we want to refer to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we took government, if they look at the facts of the 
situation, the debt in this country was $140 billion. When the 
Conservative government left power it was about $530 billion. We 
have been able to temper that debt over the last four years by 
something under $600 million.  We are beginning to reduce the 
debt because we know how to administer the financial affairs of 
the country.  That is basically what their leader has been saying 
and that is what we have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that my good from from Prince George is not 
giving the Liberal Party and ourselves the credit for that.  I 
would like him to respond to that, but just one more minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know what my friend from Prince George has against 
finding out about the sexual habits of seniors? What has the hon. 
member got against the senior citizens in this country?  Could he 
respond to that please.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  First of all, Mr. Speaker, let me assure 
the member from Thunder Bay that he will never ever find a 
Reformer kissing a Tory.   That is a certain thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I have nothing against seniors having fun.  My parents 
are seniors and they are always happy, so obviously they do not 
need any books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an interesting point about reducing the deficit though. 
Yes, we have been talking about this Liberal government getting 
the deficit reduced.  The difference is that we wanted the 
government to reduce it by cutting its insatiable spending 
appetite, by cutting the grants and handouts that are rampant 
throughout the waste reports, by cutting the patronage 
organizations, such as the western economic diversification fund 
and the economic development funds that are in eastern Canada, 
all the hundreds of millions of dollars that it gives to Quebec 
companies to keep the Bloc off its back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask the government to be more prudent and reduce its 
spending.  That is something that is foreign to a Liberal 
government.  Yes, it may get to a balanced budget but it has done 
it, as I said, by wrenching an additional over $25 billion out of 
Canadian taxpayers, Canadian workers and Canadian business.  That 
is why the government is having such a hard time getting the 
unemployment rate down.  It knows, though it will never admit it, 
that taxes kill jobs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all I would like to congratulate you on your 
appointment.  We are very confident that you will be an impartial 
Speaker.  It is a great thing to see you there.  It is a great 
thing for your constituents as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like at the beginning of my maiden speech in the 
House of Commons to thank my constituents for this great 
privilege.  It is a humbling experience to stand in this great 
Chamber of democratic deliberation for the first time and 
experience what the veterans are familiar with.  I only hope that 
I can, in whatever modest way, meet the aspirations and 
expectations of my constituents of Calgary Southeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asked to speak in reply to the Speech from the 
Throne.  The Speech from the Throne is remarkable.  It occurred 
to me that it was simply a more stilted and formal version of the 
56 page red book II, the one that we released ahead of the Prime 
Minister.  It was a book filled with congratulations.  The 
government congratulated itself on what it sees somehow as a 
brilliant record.  But let us take a closer look at that fiscal 
and economic record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals talk about job creation and prosperity.  What we 
have today is 1.4 million Canadians out of work.  We are now in 
the 98th straight month of unemployment over 9 percent, the 
longest string of high unemployment since the great depression. 
That is the economic record of this government.  Youth 
unemployment is over 17 percent.  In some regions it exceeds 25 
percent. Young people, people of my generation, are without hope. 
They have lost economic opportunity because of the policies of 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a 7 percent decline in the after tax family income of the 
average family since the beginning of this decade because of the 
tax increases of the Liberal government and its Tory predecessor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A quarter of Canadians tell us that they go to bed worried about 
job security, worried about whether the next day they are going 
to have enough money to put bread on the table and take care of 
their families.  We see anaemic economic growth of under 3 p. 
cent. While we have 9 percent unemployment, our largest trading 
partner, the United States, has an unemployment rate of almost 
half that.  Our second largest trading partner, Japan, has an 
unemployment rate at a third of that level.  The government calls 
this an economic record to be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals tell us that they have managed nearly to balance 
the budget which they helped to create over the last 25 years 
with their Conservative friends. How did they do that?  By acting 
responsibly as so many of the provincial governments did?  By 
acting in the same way a small business or family would by paring 
back the non-essentials, by cutting?  No, it was done by 
increasing the tax burden on Canadian families, by killing jobs, 
by increasing payroll taxes. It has income tax hikes riding on 
top of the de-indexation of the tax system imposed by the Tories 
in 1986.  That grosses $23 billion in new government revenues 
through 36 tax increases on top of the 72 tax increases 
introduced by the Mulroney Tories. That is the shameful fiscal 
record of this government.  And what has it done? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has added $100 billion of debt and called it responsible 
fiscal management.  That $100 billion brings our total 
indebtedness to just under $600 billion which, of course, does 
not include another $600 billion in the Canada pension plan Ponzi 
scheme for which my generation is going to have to pay.  That is 
the fiscal record of this government which has led to $47 billion 
a year in annual interest payments, a sum large enough to be the 
operating budgets of five of the the smaller provincial 
governments. That is a shameful record and one it ought not to 
applaud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what is the answer?  One would think that here in this last 
Parliament of this century, in this throne speech which sets the 
agenda for the new millennium that there would be a great vision, 
a new departure, a new direction for Canada. It might take the 
advice of the overwhelming majority of the people in the business 
communities who know how to create wealth because they do it 
every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the government has gone back to the traditional, old 
1970s Liberal policies of bigger government, chequebook politics, 
trying to buy the votes of its special interest friends by 
opening up the treasury yet once more for all its pet projects. 
The throne speech is filled with page after page of new spending 
programs.  There was only one mention of tax decreases and debt 
reduction while we are sitting in the midst of an economic crisis 
in the country. There is no imagination, no vision in this throne 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can the government not think about the kind of real economic 
distress that real Canadians are feeling?  For instance, what 
about providing Canadian families with tax fairness?  The 
government's throne speech is filled with talk about children who 
do not seem to have families, children who seem to be the worthy 
recipients of government programs designed by the Liberal 
government's social engineers.  It does not talk about 
traditional families who choose to have a parent stay at home to 
raise their children receiving tax fairness, even though this 
House with all party support in the last Parliament passed Motion 
No. 30 sponsored by the member for Mississauga South, calling for 
tax fairness in the tax code.  The government has done nothing to 
act on that.  It seems to be satisfied with penalizing families 
who make the sacrifice of giving up a second income to get by. 
They really believe that Liberal politicians and big government 
bureaucrats know better how to spend a dollar raised from the 
taxpayers than does a family or small business person or someone 
who is struggling to get a foot up in the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the government to listen to the message it got from the 
last election.  It came within a whisker of losing power.  We 
know that the Liberal Party exists to take and maintain power. 
The government ought to listen to the message that was sent by 
the voters.  The message was, let us not go back to the future. 
Let us try a different approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about tax fairness for families?  Heaven forbid, what about 
cutting capital gains taxes to increase investment and 
productivity, to reward people for taking risks in our economy? 
What about cutting payroll taxes so that we are not penalizing 
people for creating jobs and small businesses?  What about 
cutting income taxes and doing it now so that people can see the 
light at the end of the tunnel and not just another big 
government spending program?  Why can it not see that there is a 
different solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I invite my colleagues on the opposite side of the 
House to take a serious look at the kind of economic record that 
30 years of Liberal and Tory big government spending has brought 
us.  Governments around the world are doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's ideological friend in Washington, President 
Bill Clinton, a Democrat, said last year that the era of big 
government is over. The Labour Prime Minister in the United 
Kingdom said that the end of the welfare state has come. 
Yet this government is the only Liberal government in the 
developed world which seems to think that the old policies of the 
welfare state are the ones that can sustain a healthy and 
prosperous economy.

hope and opportunity for Canadians by providing them with real 
meaningful tax relief. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to start by congratulating the member on what I 
believe is his first speech in the House.  I would like to 
welcome him to the House.  I am going to try to be very quick 
because I know the member for Broadview—Greenwood would also 
like to ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House heard the message of the last 
election.  We won a majority government, something that has not 
happened that often in this country.  The people endorsed our 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member, who has been thoughtful on these issues 
for some time, to step aside from the rhetoric that he has 
brought into this House from his research department and sit down 
and itemize for me on the record the cuts that he would make in 
order to do it differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would hate to point out 
to the member that they won a majority government but with the 
smallest percentage of popular vote in Canadian history for a 
majority government.  If that is not chastisement with a divided 
opposition, I do not know what is. We still see the Liberal 
arrogance creeping into that member's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were very clear in our fresh start platform document about 
precisely which programs we thought were priorities and those 
that we thought could be cut. Let us talk about some of this. 
How about eliminating grants and handouts to special interest 
groups whose sole purpose is to demand more government spending? 
How about paring back some of the giveaway programs of the hon. 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, like her $23 million flag 
giveaway?  How about starting with the hon. members pension plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, 51 of 52 of my colleagues in the last Parliament 
gave up their pensions as a sign of sacrifice, as have many 
provincial legislators engaged in the same deficit cutting 
exercise.  Why don't my hon. friends start with the same kind of 
leadership by example? 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first 
of all I would like to congratulate you on your appointment and I 
would like to congratulate the member on his election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that there are not more members in the House 
today.  It may be due to the fact that we keep hearing all the 
negativism.  Canadians are fed up with negativism.  Clearly we 
point out to the member that his party not that long ago talked 
about the deficit as the number one issue in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the member of the opposition went to the school of 
Orwellian politics, doublespeak.  On the one hand, they want the 
deficit eliminated.  Now the deficit is being eliminated and they 
say “Well gee, we don't like the way this is being done”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comment is that in order to stimulate the economy, we had to 
get that deficit down, slay that $42 billion dragon.  Clearly 
there are more Canadians going back to work.  We saw 900,000 
Canadians put back to work because of this government and the 
actions of this government.  Want ads are fuller today than they 
have ever been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly reducing taxes, yes, I think all Canadians would like to 
see taxes reduced.  The question is the timing of those 
reductions basically because, if we are taking in more money in 
order to be able to deal with the deficit and certainly the 
debt—we have a $600 billion debt which I hope they would deal 
with—I would say that the hon. member talks about chequebook 
politics.  Could he explain to me what are the chequebook 
politics?  Helping Canadians I believe is what the government is 
doing in the throne speech.  Maybe he should read that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member comment on what he defines as chequebook 
politics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, talk about Orwellian 
rhetoric.  My goodness, that is quite a question.  I am not sure 
whether the member is from the Liberal or Tory party seated to my 
right and I am not sure that it matters. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple answer is yes, we did call for the elimination of the 
deficit and the reduction of the debt, not as an end in itself 
but as a means to an end.  That end is greater prosperity, hope, 
growth and opportunity for Canadians through tax relief.  You 
cannot provide Canadians with tax relief if you are spending the 
money instead of reducing it.  It is a simple mathematical thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps you have never balanced a family budget.  Heaven knows 
this Liberal government has never balanced a government budget. 
But when you cut your spending, you get a surplus and that means 
that you can reduce people's taxes.  That is why we have been 
pushing successive governments in this country since the Reform 
Party was founded a decade ago to get our finances under control 
so we could let Canadians keep more of their own money. It is not 
money that belongs to this Parliament or this government or the 
Liberal Party of Canada.  It is money that belongs to Canadians 
and they ought to be able to keep it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I regret to inform the large number 
of members who want to ask questions that the time for questions 
and comments has expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Broadview—Greenwood on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this member of 
Parliament, who has just arrived here, as we all know, is one of 
the foremost experts in the country on the whole issue of tax 
reform.  I wonder if we could have the unanimous consent of the 
House to extend this period of questioning for a few more minutes 
because we cannot let him off this easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to extend 
the time for questions and comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, thank you very much.  I am happy to be here in the House 
for the member's maiden speech. I have always had great respect 
for the member's work in the whole area of tax reform. I 
sincerely welcome his presence here in the House with the Reform 
Party because during the last Parliament, with the exception of 
Mr. Silye, very few of the members of the Reform Party really 
stuck with the whole issue of tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons why they failed to stick with this issue was 
because they talk about the tax grants to social organizations, 
but the real tax grants in this country are the tax expenditures 
that are buried in the 1,500 pages of the tax act and most of 
those tax grants go to large multinational organizations. They 
are in the guise of saying they will give them this tax 
expenditure or this tax grant so they can stimulate jobs.  No 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member of Parliament for Calgary Southeast if 
he will undertake to make sure in this Parliament that he will 
champion eliminating all of those hidden unaccountable tax 
expenditures, especially those that go to the oil and gas 
industry in western Canada.  I want him to make sure that he will 
stand in this House and champion that part of tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
hon. member for his kind words and extend some of my own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have enormous respect for the hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood's long and principled crusade for tax reform 
in this country.  He has been against the stream in his party and 
his government in calling for a single tax that would ultimately 
give Canadians what I advocate as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would I support the elimination of all the so-called tax 
expenditures?  Of course not because the single largest tax 
expenditure is the RRSP which most Canadians rely on for their 
retirement savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are of course tax preferences that some large companies 
have which I think are unreasonable in terms of creating a hugely 
complex tax system and which require tens of thousands of tax 
lawyers, accountants and bureaucrats at Revenue Canada at untold 
public expense to administer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I think the solution is not to eliminate those things 
while keeping the same tax rates thereby squeezing more revenue 
out of the economy.  If we are going to eliminate exemptions and 
deductions and credits for individuals and for companies, we need 
to do it within the context of overall radical tax reform which 
results in overall lower tax levels for Canadians.  On that 
condition I would support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>   Are hon. members rising on questions 
or comments? Is it the wish of the House to continue with 
questions and comments in this case?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is both an honour and a privilege for me to rise in my place 
as the new member for the riding of Kitchener Centre to 
participate in the Speech from the Throne debate. I am sharing my 
time with the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am both honoured and humbled by the support of the people of 
Kitchener Centre who have brought me here to Ottawa.  As well, I 
would like to acknowledge and send good wishes to my predecessor, 
Dr. John English, who has moved on to new challenges while he 
continues his work on the anti-personnel landmine issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the faith of Kitchener Centre in my ability to represent 
their best interests which has brought me to this historical seat 
of democracy to be a part of the historic second consecutive 
Liberal government, the last Parliament of the 20th century and 
the one which will lead Canada into the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of things I would like to share with the 
House this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like everyone to know why I support the Speech 
from the Throne as presented by the governor general on the 
opening day of this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second I would like to offer the government an idea.  It is an 
idea which builds on the agenda presented in the Speech from the 
Throne and one which would effect real change in the perception 
and effectiveness of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize the foundations which were laid for 
Canada and Canadians by those who have sat in this House 
throughout the last century, those who have shaped Canada's 
identity from coast to coast and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are known for our Canadian values, generosity of spirit and 
collective action; values which have set us apart in the areas of 
health care, foreign affairs and peacekeeping; all those 
characteristics which lend to our pride in our country and the 
respect of the maple leaf worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to Canadian values, much of our success is based on 
at least four principles of Canadian liberalism as laid out by 
Sir Wilfrid Laurier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is faith in the individual, which implies freedom of 
the individual to make his or her own decisions within the 
constraints of a democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle is compassion for the underprivileged, a 
principle which is the underpinning of a social safety net which 
Canadians of all parties speak of with pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third is the principle of tolerance toward individuals and 
groups.  It is this principle which enabled Laurier and his 
successors to bridge the ethnic, racial and cultural differences 
which characterize Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth principle is that of reform, pushing to develop new 
policies in keeping with changing times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne provided the vision as to how this 
government, the 36th Parliament, will continue to act on these 
principles, and to ensure and work to enhance the quality of 
living we experience as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme of partnership permeated the Speech from the Throne; 
partnership between governments, provincial, territorial and 
federal; partnership between the public and private sector, large 
corporations, small businesses, communities and individuals; 
partnerships which will provide a well-rounded, multifaceted 
approach to program development and delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased with the government's commitment to this type of 
collaboration as I believe it is important for the government to 
address issues on local and regional levels with the assistance 
of supporting organizations, businesses and government services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the outstanding characteristics of my riding is the high 
degree of volunteerism from the community and the willingness of 
the corporate sector to support both with personnel and funds the 
initiatives which the community values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's ability to draw on the strengths of our 
country's differences which will build a stronger Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kitchener is fortunate to be a part of Canada's technology 
triangle comprised of high tech companies located in 
Kitchener-Waterloo, Cambridge and Guelph.  The success of 
partnership in these areas demonstrates that no longer can any 
one group or sector effectively operate and succeed in isolation. 
This initiative has created a vehicle with which our area is able 
to compete in a global economy.  As stated in the Speech from the 
Throne “one in three Canadian jobs depend on trade”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last Parliament the government made progress in promoting 
trade both within our borders and beyond through reducing 
internal trade barriers and using the team Canada approach to 
open doors to Canadian businesses in Asia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of Kitchener area businesses which were represented on 
that mission have benefited from increased international demand. 
The success of this approach demonstrates what can be 
accomplished when governments and the private sector work 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased with the government's commitment to build on this 
success with a focused strategy.  I am confident that upcoming 
team Canada missions will be as fruitful for Kitchener area 
businesses as well as others throughout Canada.  By mounting 
these initiatives the government is providing fitting leadership 
which facilitates lasting job creation in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism plays a significant role in the economic mosiac of 
Kitchener and surrounding areas.  Many visitors, future residents 
and investors became acquainted with our community through 
tourism.  Kitchener's rich ethnic diversity and cultural wealth 
have certainly aided the development of various industries 
including tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kitchener is the ninth largest destination for new immigrants. 
The community benefits greatly from the contributions of these 
citizens.  I am sure many are familiar with what has become 
Kitchener's most famous celebration by far, Ocktoberfest, a 
wonderful celebration of the largest German population in Canada 
drawing an average of 700,000 participants each year.  It is an 
excellent example of people taking pride in their heritage and 
working together for the benefit of the entire community.  The 
associated economic benefits are in the millions of dollars and 
continue to grow each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Kitchener enjoys steady growth, the health of a community 
cannot be measured solely in economic terms.  We must also 
recognize the areas which require attention:  continued quality 
health care, reduced child poverty, improved community safety, 
lower unemployment and sustained economic growth.  All these 
areas must be addressed without jeopardizing how far our 
government has come in getting our fiscal house in order.  In the 
Speech from the Throne the government has offered a positive 
approach to these issues through strategic investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose that our government promote the integration of various 
government services and agencies to target the issues and work 
together with the business community, faith communities and the 
volunteer sector to create private and public partnerships.  As 
suggested in the Speech from the Throne, if we tackle the problem 
together we will gain strength as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to the 36th Parliament with one agenda: to be the best 
representative I can be, to fulfil this role with energy and 
dignity, and to participate in the development and implementation 
of legislation that is good for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne set the foundation for an exciting 
and fulfilling term.  Together we can bring a stronger, united 
Canada into the next millennium.

Speaker, at the onset I congratulate you on your well earned 
appointment.  I also congratulate the hon. member on her maiden 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member sang a hymn of praise to team Canada and told us 
about all the wonderful things that happened as a result of its 
overseas missions.  The figures are in; I am sure she is aware of 
them.  Our exports have dropped substantially to every area where 
there was a team Canada mission. This is a fact as presented in 
the government's own figures.  If this is indeed the case, why is 
she so proud of the work of team Canada?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question, if she will be so kind as to address two of 
them, is with respect to internal trade barriers.  She said the 
right things, that we have to bring down internal trade barriers. 
My question to her is when and how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has the constitutional power to do 
this.  We have a constitution that says that interprovincial 
trade must be free and open.  What does the government have in 
mind?  When will it get off its tail and actually do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will reply to the two 
questions the hon. member has posed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The city of Kitchener was able to send a mayor on team Canada to 
the Pacific rim.  The message he brought back was the fact that 
people in other countries needed to have a relationship built up 
over time.  To look for a quick turnaround and have all 
government policy be a bottom line ledger is not quite practical. 
We are looking for long term gains.  It is an investment that 
will accrue over several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the internal trade barriers are concerned, I mentioned 
in my comments about partnership.  One thing that a partnership 
relies on is a relationship between the two parties.  While we 
may have the federal power to impose, it is much better if we can 
bring the provinces along with us.  We have to acknowledge that 
when we share a vision we have to let the partner help shape it. 
I have every confidence the government will get where it needs to 
be. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again, 
I have listened carefully to what the hon. member had to say, and like 
all her colleagues, she did not mention the people of Quebec's interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is important, and I wish to pursue the point, because 
when I came to Ottawa, to this House, I came with my head held high, 
because the people of Quebec elected us.  We represent 60 per cent of 
the members from Quebec, and we have a sovereignist government in Quebec 
City with whom we share the same option and which holds 80 per cent of 
the seats there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of you who believe the polls, who try to say that we are not 
legitimate and that the people of Quebec do not want sovereignty, are in 
for some surprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for the member who just spoke.  I would like 
to know if she admits that the government's legislative program denies 
the existence of the people of Quebec and of their culture?  Does the 
member recognize the existence of the people of Quebec?  If so, is she 
prepared to support the amendment presented by the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge that one of 
the exciting parts of coming to the House of Parliament and this 
democratic process steeped in history was to be able to brush 
elbows with people in all parts of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Canada includes Quebec.  It is a vibrant, thriving society. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my colleague from Kitchener Centre not 
only on her maiden speech but also on her excellent replies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult to come into the House and suddenly face 
opposition questions.  It will be difficult to follow that act, 
as it were, but I will try to do my very best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by commenting on the speech in reply to the Speech 
from the Throne by the member for Calgary Southwest, the Leader 
of the Opposition. I draw the attention of the House to two 
points he made. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT86"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT86"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710
<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He condemned the Speech from the Throne because it did not state 
anything about the accountability of MPs.  I find this rather 
confusing because MPs are naturally very accountable.  We are one 
of the most accountable people in the land simply because if the 
people of Canada, the electorate, do not like us or are not 
satisfied with us they can fire us every four or five years, or 
whatever the case may be.  They can fire us nonetheless.  The 
Reform Party and hopefully some of the new parties might bear 
that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point is that the member for Calgary Southwest 
probably meant we should be seeking more accountability from 
government machinery.  We are all here to try to make government 
run better and more effectively for Canadians.  One of the ways 
of achieving that is to strive for more accountability within 
government machinery, all government departments.  All MPs on all 
sides of the House share this responsibility.  We express this 
responsibility by the questions we pose in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent some time on the government operations committee when we 
scrutinized a number of departments and found a number of flaws. 
Many of the flaws were due to a lack of accountability.  I am 
quite happy to say that the search for better government was not 
exclusively Liberal.  It was predominantly Liberal, but I was 
assisted by my colleagues, members of the Reform Party and the 
Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As MPs we are accountable.  It is the machinery of government we 
must scrutinize.  Reform Party members certainly have no 
exclusivity on the desire to bring accountability to government 
and to reform government.  Just because they have the name Reform 
in their party title does not mean they are the only MPs who seek 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary Southwest also criticized the Speech from 
the Throne because it devolved certain responsibilities that were 
once federal to the provinces.  The member for Calgary Southwest 
complained this devolution was done purely for administrative 
means.  He said that his party, were it in power, would have 
passed a bill and made these changes statutory.  He is referring 
to transferring certain responsibilities for forestry, social 
housing, mining and several other issues to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members opposite that Ontario is experiencing the 
consequences of transferring power, that is the power to control 
the responsibility for social housing.  What happens when it is 
given to a provincial government that does not have the same 
spirit of generosity and caring as the federal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario right now there is a controversy.  The Ontario 
government wants to have no responsibility whatsoever for looking 
after the poor and the disadvantaged people in society who occupy 
social housing.  Now it is devolving it to the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lesson for us is that we ought to make sure that when we 
transfer federal powers we transfer them in a way in which we can 
take them back if we need do so.  That is the situation in 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More unfortunate in the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition 
was that he suggested transfers of responsibilities should be 
done by statutes.  When he says that, because he is talking about 
provincial and federal powers, he can only mean changes to the 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians from sea to sea were fed up with attempts to 
change the Constitution by a previous party that I would prefer 
to leave nameless in the House.  Canadians do not want to see 
tampering with the Constitution.  It is the last thing Canadians 
want.  I am absolutely amazed the Leader of the Opposition should 
propose going into the Constitution again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I can say is good luck.  Look at what happened to a former 
Conservative prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to come to the Speech from the Throne. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry, but I found it a bit uninspiring.  I think that the 
throne speech lacked eloquence and inspiration.  The ideas are good, 
they are all good, but the speech did not have what I was looking for. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT87"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT87"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1715

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately the next day the Prime Minister spoke on the 
Speech from the Throne, and I found his remarks full of eloquence 
and ideas.  I found him eloquent on the subject of the government's 
ideas. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I especially like the idea in the prime minister's remarks of 
supporting young people.  I have to tell the House that I wanted 
to see the Speech from the Throne talk about citizenship, getting 
rid of the monarchy and a number of other things.  Instead I 
found a Speech from the Throne that was directed to helping 
Canada's youth.  One of the most important points in the prime 
minister's remarks was the fact that he proposed more exchanges 
of young people across Canada.  He mentioned that when he was 
young he remembers sitting in kitchens in Saskatchewan, shooting 
pool in Newfoundland and that kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can relate to that because when I was young I travelled across 
Canada, the first time out to the Rockies, into Reform country if 
you will, and saw the Rocky Mountains for the first time.  I was 
inspired.  It is beautiful country.  Any Reform MP who is from 
the Rockies or the prairies should be proud of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly later I visited Quebec.  I visited first Montreal and 
then Quebec City, actually right at the height of the FLQ crisis. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I found was a unique and vibrant society, whose language 
I did not understand.  A marvellous society.  I have become a 
federalist with my heart in the mountains and in the province of 
Quebec, because of that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the prime minister is right on when he said that the new 
Parliament and the Speech from the Throne, even though it did not 
express it very well, but he expressed it so much better, should 
be about the future generation, the new generation of Canadians, 
Canada's young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude with a quote.  The prime minister said 
this part of his speech in English and so with a certain amount 
of pride and perhaps trepidation I will attempt to say the prime 
minister's words in French.  Here is what he said and I do not 
think I could say it better. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have built that nation and we continue to shape its 
elements.  Our young will do so in the next century.  Their 
architecture will be new but it will be Canadian.  Greatness 
may have a different meaning, but it will still be Canadian. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the essence of the Speech from the Throne.

<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to bring to the attention of the House the 
member's comments and his criticisms against the member for 
Calgary Southeast. He was quite critical of the member when he 
was referring to accountability in suggesting that he has an 
exclusive on accountability and suggesting that the Liberal Party 
can be just as accountable and its members can as well. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the member that it is very easy to speak 
of accountability but the Reform Party has an absolute 
exclusivity on actions when it comes to accountability.  That is 
the only way he is going to be able to show the Canadian people 
accountability, through actions like giving up his pension. The 
Liberal Party has not come through with actions on 
accountability, but the Reform Party leads the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as an individual member I 
would like to refer the member opposite to some of my efforts 
with respect to bringing accountability to charitable 
organizations which, in a sense, are government organizations in 
the sense that they receive taxpayer dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also I think when he gains a bit more experience around here he 
will discover that there have been many initiatives not just 
among Liberal colleagues but among Reform colleagues and Bloc 
Quebecois colleagues that have sought better accountability in 
government, something we all do as MPs and we all should do as 
MPs or we certainly ought not to be here.  I think the member for 
Calgary Southwest should have recognized that he was criticizing 
MPs as MPs rather than criticizing the government.  He got a 
little confused there, if you will. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
wish to congratulate you on your appointment. You are one of the Reform 
Party members with whom I have had the opportunity to work. In fact, 
when we worked together, it was precisely on a youth initiative program, 
as our colleague mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to ask the hon. member is whether he admits that the 
federal government is about to get fully involved in areas under 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you will remember that the national conference on 
youth and the new economy had young participants from everywhere, 
including eastern and western Canada, Quebec and other regions of the 
country. 
These people from every region of the country told us that these youth 
initiatives, these employment initiatives must be implemented, to the 
extent possible, where the problems are, namely in the regions. In other 
words, we must take measures that are appropriate to the specific 
problems of the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listening to the hon. member opposite, one gets the impression that 
the federal government is the saviour of the world and that the 
municipalities and provincial governments have no jurisdiction and are 
not accountable to the public. Upon reading the throne speech, one 
cannot help but conclude that the federal government is trying to get 
involved in areas under provincial jurisdiction and to enhance its 
visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member. What does the federal 
government have to gain from getting involved in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, in my opinion it is simple. The 
federal government's most important responsibility is to help young 
people everywhere in the country, including those from Ontario and 
Quebec. This is a great and most important challenge. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to start, first of all, by thanking the people of Témiscouata who 
supported me for three and a half years during my first term. For the 
information of the hon. member opposite, as a result of electoral 
reform, Témiscouata is now part of the riding of 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, represented by 
our colleague, Paul Crête. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now wish to take this opportunity to thank the people of 
Rimouski—Mitis for giving me their support. Mr. Speaker, I realize you 
have already visited our lovely region and enjoyed the beauty of the 
St. Lawrence and our forests. I happen to live in one of Quebec's many 
beautiful regions, but this one is particularly attractive, in my 
opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now comment on the Speech from the Throne. The Liberal 
government could have taken advantage of the initial days of this new 
Parliament to take some concrete action that would have shown they have 
a number of answers to the problems besetting Canadian and Quebec 
society. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government is not really working for the people. 
It would rather perpetuate the doctrine of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who 
advocated a dominating and centralizing federal government and would not 
recognize the identity and aspirations of the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lester B. Pearson's legacy has completely disappeared. I will 
remind the House that Mr. Pearson had asked that the Laurendeau-Dunton 
Commission recommend steps to ensure that the Canadian confederation 
would develop in accordance with the principle of two equal founding 
peoples. Those days are really gone now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, in the eyes of the Liberal government, there is no 
such thing as a Quebec culture. In fact, the Prime Minister once 
said there is only one, Canadian culture, which may be of French 
or English expression. The Speech from the Throne may talk about 
a “tolerant and highly diverse society”, but the government still 
fails to recognize the basic historical fact that Quebec is one 
of the founding peoples of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the rest of my time commenting on how empty this Speech 
from the Throne, the third one of the Chrétien years, is. It only gets 
worse. The vacuum is particularly noticeable in the area of cultural 
development. This lack of vision and commitment is sad for Quebec as 
well as for Canada. Quebec however has a way out: relaim all its powers 
and achieve sovereignty in a hurry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 35th Parliament, the government demonstrated that 
culture was not one of its major concerns.  It contented itself with 
micro-managing seriously reduced budgets.  In addition to cutting back 
funding, it did nothing to encourage culture.  It has taken the 
relentless efforts of the Bloc Quebecois to persuade the Liberals 
finally to bring in copyright reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its speech, the government says it wants to make it possible for 
Canadian culture to reach audiences abroad.  We can only hope that this 
intention will take the form of support for creators and cultural 
industries.  We do not want to see a repeat of last year's attempts to 
force artists to promote Canadian unity, or to judge projects on the 
basis of political rather than artistic criteria, or to require artists 
to pay a visit to the member for Verdun, whom they did not know and had 
never met, in order to collect their cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government speaks proudly of our films.  What it should do is 
conduct an in-depth review of Telefilm Canada's film policy, which was 
seriously criticized in an internal report.  One of the things this 
report mentions is an overall lack of funding—cuts of $84 million do 
not go unnoticed in a budget—as well as shortcomings in marketing, and 
distribution problems.  Telefilm Canada has its work cut out for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government truly wants to reflect social and linguistic 
diversity, it should stop censoring artistic projects that deal with the 
history or culture of Quebec, as it did with Pierre Falardeau's plans 
for a film about the life of the Patriot Delorimier, entitled <I>Le 15 
février 1839</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most vital criterion should be script quality.  The 
decision making process ought to be free of any conflict of 
interest or political partisanship, which was not the case with Mr. 
Falardeau's production, as we now have all the evidence we need to 
prove. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is boasting about the quality of our books, yet 
it refused to listen to our suggestions when the Bloc Quebecois 
came to the defence of the publishing industry.  If the government 
still does nothing in this area, fewer and fewer books with 
Canadian content will be published, because our entire industry 
will have been sold out to the Americans.  In this area, the 
anglophone culture is more vulnerable than the francophone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must react to the World Trade Organization 
decision on split runs of American periodicals.  The Minister of 
Heritage had, moreover, made a commitment to present a plan in 
support of the magazine publishing industry as soon as Parliament 
reconvened.  Is she going to stick to that campaign promise, or 
will she be forced to resign a second time? Watch for the next 
instalment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Heritage will need to find ways of supporting 
the periodicals and scientific and cultural periodicals which are 
being seriously threatened by the reduced postal subsidy and the 
changes in its rules. I must point out that, in this area, there is 
a particular threat to specialized French language periodicals, 
given their limited market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne, there is also a reference to 
videos. If the government really wants to develop this industry and 
encourage creativity, it must immediate review the Copyright Act, 
for the audiovisual sector was excluded from the recent revision of 
that legislation.  A guarantee of receiving the revenues generated 
by their work would be the best way to stimulate creators and 
craftspeople in this area of cultural activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein, the $45 million in cuts made by the Liberal 
government have resulted in the National Film Board's virtually 
abandoning its assistance to independent film making, and this 
particularly jeopardizes the careers of the young film and video 
makers who represent the future of their industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We read in the Speech from the Throne that the government, and 
I quote “will provide increased support to the Canada Council”. 
Now that is really playing with words to mislead us in this area 
too. 
Here as elsewhere, the government will probably be content to give 
back some of the funding it cut in the past.  There will have to be 
a number of years of Liberal generosity before the Canada Council 
returns to the level of funding it enjoyed before the Liberals came 
to power.  As Liberal spending power is legendary, the government 
will announce straight faced and glowing with pride the ever 
increasing budget of the Canada Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the information highway, the government talks of the 
urgency of making Canada “the most connected nation in the 
world”. 
We have seen how that could help in consultations on certain 
declarations, because a number of provinces are contemplating using 
the connection from Industry Canada. 
Being “connected” is a praiseworthy objective.  However, the Speech 
from the Throne makes no mention of the promise of the second red 
book to create a $15 million multimedia fund and fails to act on 
the recommendation of the advisory committee on the information 
highway that a $50 million, and not $15 million, fund be set up. 
Will the Minister of Industry be the only one overseeing Canada's 
information highway, disregarding its cultural and education sides? 
This is another subject to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We read in the speech that “A connected nation is more than 
wires, cables and computers”.  What a discovery.  “It is a nation 
in which citizens have access to the skills and knowledge they 
need”.  We agree. 
This is why the Bloc Quebecois has insisted for nearly four years 
now on the need to develop francophone content for the information 
highway.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are gaping holes in this speech. In their first red book, the 
Liberals were committed to stable multi-year financing for the CBC. 
Every budget in the past four years has broken this promise, and the 
corporation has had to absorb $350 million in cuts. Should we be alarmed 
by the fact that the speech does not mention the CBC? When it was 
promised stable financing, it actually got cuts. This time, it is not 
even mentioned. Does this mean that its financing will be maintained, 
cut, or that it will again benefit from the government's largesse? On 
this, we will have to wait and see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government finally going to give equal treatment to the 
French and the English networks? At present, one hour of 
programming costs on average $37,500 on the English network and 
$18,390 on the French network. The government should stop 
treating francophones as second class citizens, and set up two 
autonomous corporations with equivalent budgets based on the same 
cost per hour of programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Per hour of programming? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Yes, sir. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the last federal election, the health minister promised 
amendments to the tobacco control bill to allow sponsorship of sporting 
events. Since there is no mention of this in the throne speech, are we 
to understand that the government has already forgotten its promise? 
What will happen to cultural events in danger of losing their sponsors 
as a result of this bill? 
At issue is the potential loss of some $30 million in economic benefits 
these major cultural and sporting events generate in Quebec, mainly in 
Montreal. Is the Liberal government once again going to abandon the 
cultural sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the few promising aspects of this speech is the federalist 
propaganda campaign. We are told they are going to rev it up as we 
approach the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After announcing that it will cut health, education and social 
assistance programs by another $42 billion by the year 2001, the 
government introduces new programs in areas of provincial jurisdiction 
so that it can mail directly to Canadians cheques emblazoned with a nice 
red maple leaf. The government is not interested in how useful or 
effective these programs will be. 
What matters to the government is to be visible with its flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be noted that on July 1, the government did not hesitate to 
take down our flag from our Parliament to replace it with the Queen's 
standard to show how dominated we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does this idea of visibility over effectiveness come from? 
Again it comes from Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who wrote in a 1967 book 
entitled <I>Federalism and the French Canadians</I>, and I quote: “One way of 
offsetting the appeal of separatism is by investing tremendous amounts 
of time, energy and money in nationalism, at the federal level. A 
national image must be created that will have such an appeal as to make 
any image of a separatist group unattractive”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are obviously inspired by this ideology. 
Contrary to what we heard in previous throne speeches, there is no 
question of working with the provinces to improve the federation. Now 
the only thing that matters to the government is to create an image, an 
illusion. While people are getting poorer and poorer and while the 
government refuses to recognize Quebec's identity, it will create the 
illusion of wealth and the illusion of the acceptation of Quebec by the 
outstretched hand that actually just wants to crush us and bring us down 
to our knees.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that the money we receive is our own money.  It 
comes from our taxes.  The federal government does not have a penny.  It 
gets its money from the Canadian taxpayers and does not own it, although 
it may think it does.  The federal government can start spending once 
again only because it keeps on cutting social programs and transfers to 
provinces and because it diverts the unemployment insurance fund from 
its intended purpose.  The money belongs to us and not to the 
government.  It wants to use it to serve its own interests and improve 
its visibility, not to ensure our development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will never stop calling for the federal 
government to stop useless and unwarranted spending for propaganda 
purposes. 
You will be surprised when we reveal these figures.  The sums are really 
huge.  The amounts recovered in these ways should be spent on cultural 
activities and on promoting freedom of artistic expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell you right away that the Canadian heritage minister will 
soon cheer when she learns that her government has raised her budget by 
3 percent.  Beware. Take a good look at Statistics Canada's figures.  You will 
see, in black and white, that the increase went to operating 
expenditures and capital expenditures and that it was used for severance 
packages given to employees laid off by the department and its agencies 
and not for the promotion of cultural endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, transfers to artists and cultural organizations have 
dropped by more than 5 percent.  The only new expenditures will be similar to 
those made by Heritage Canada over the past 15 months for billboards and 
flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In concluding, the strategies contained in the Speech from the 
Throne are basically aimed at restoring the tarnished reputation of this 
federal government and giving it a semblance of relevance. This the 
government intends to do by using money cut from transfers to the 
provinces for health, education and welfare and money saved at the 
expense of ordinary citizens: the unemployed, workers, seasonal workers, 
the sick, students and welfare recipients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of concentrating on rebuilding what it had destroyed, the 
federal government has embarked on new intrusions in areas under 
provincial jurisdiction. It is triumphant, carefully disguising the fact 
that we can expect at least $42 billion more in cuts between now and the 
year 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concealment is definitely the name of the game for this government. 
However, Quebecers are nobody's fool. When the time comes for them to 
determine their future, they will realize there is no risk involved in 
having one own's country and being sovereign, in exchanging the maple 
leaf for a fleur de lys, since all the money will stay in Quebec and be 
used to meet their own needs.

you, Mr. Speaker, for recognizing me.  I am pleased to have a new

elevation to that very wonderful post.  I hope that we are able 
to see many more of these emotional discussions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<Especially from the hon. member for the new riding of Rimouski—Mitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of ranting and raving for the benefit of the cameras, 
instead of turning this into a public circus and saying things like the 
federal government is destroying something it has built, perhaps the 
hon. member would entertain a constructive suggestion. How about 
starting on a policy, a movement for the purpose of building a good 
country, a country like Canada, the best country in the world to live 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in the hon. member's comments to the effect that 
she was very worried about cultural problems. We all know that people 
who work in the cultural industries, especially in certain provinces, 
have a political agenda. 
I am not particularly interested in all that. My interest extends to the 
work I did in committee last year. The hon. member was on the same 
committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There was $600 million from the cable operators' production fund. 
We were able to discuss how to use that money, and distribute it to 
people working in cultural industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it quite depressing, today, when some talk of not supporting 
francophones while others speak of preserving their culture in other 
provinces, to hear the position taken by members of the Bloc Quebecois, 
including the member who has just spoken. Such a position goes totally 
against the interests of francophones in Ontario, it is totally 
divisive, it divides the country and makes things even more difficult 
for people like me who fight for the preservation of their language 
outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are not the only ones who speak French. I find your position 
interesting, though it does constitute a shift. I find not only 
depressing but sad that they do not realize the harm they are doing to 
others, outside Quebec, who do not share their interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to respond to that, if she can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> The hon. member opposite has some nerve, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I suggest he reread my speech over at leisure. He will 
realize, after reading his own remarks, that he did not understand what 
I said. I have never said that we were the only francophones— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Don't be arrogant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, would you ask the minister to 
be quiet? He is carrying on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is an important point. We never claimed to be the only 
ones who speak French in Canada. I never said such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have followed with interest the situation in Ontario. We have 
seen what happened with Montfort Hospital. We have seen Mrs. Lalonde 
resign from her position as chair of S.O.S. Montfort. Why? Because the 
City of Vanier voted in favour of partition. 
Realizing what they had done after Mrs. Lalonde's resignation, they 
said: “Oops, this might have been a mistake after all; we will 
reconsider”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So they reconsidered their position and decided it was such a 
mistake to support partition that now Vanier would almost go as far as 
to support Quebec's sovereignty. You know, the hon. member opposite is 
in no position to criticize us. He used to be the member for Ontario; 
that was easy enough to remember, but I forget what his new riding is 
called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> There is “Ajax” in there and, to me, that is 
stuff used to clean the sink. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha, ha. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> That is the kind of trick I will use to 
remember the name of his riding in future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, we all have our own personality. I for one am a 
passionate person. He should watch the program on the French 
network of the CBC this evening, at 7.30 p.m. He would get to 
know me better because tonight is about who I am really, behind 
the image. This is an invitation. However, he will realize that I 
am a passionate person, and I am not about to set this aspect of 
my personality aside just because it does not please the 
Liberals. If there is something I intend to do, it is to show 
passion in this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton—Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to comment on the speech by the hon. member 
for Rimouski—Mitis. First, I must congratulate her for a very 
passionate and good speech, in which she defends culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has always been known to defend culture and I 
congratulate her for doing so. However, in her enthusiasm, she is 
wearing blinkers and is too focused on herself, on what she calls the 
people of Quebec. When she talks about the two founding nations, she 
talks about Quebec. She forgets the francophones from Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia 
and even Yukon.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member refers to us, francophones from outside 
Quebec, it is always in a negative way and I deplore that. I do not 
think she does it out of malice but, rather, out of separatist idealism 
to try to make a point. She should instead encourage francophones 
outside Quebec and show what is happening among French Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about Quebec's culture. There is a French 
Canadian culture. There are many cultivated people in Quebec. There is 
a thriving culture, but francophones living outside Quebec also 
contribute to that culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she talks about the francophonie, I wish the member for 
Rimouski—Mitis would include francophones outside Quebec as well as 
those in Quebec in Canada's French-speaking community. 
Together, we can make Canada an even better place, with a strong, 
thriving Quebec in an even greater country and in a world in which we 
can be proud of our dynamic culture, since the hon. member is always 
raising the issue of culture. Perhaps I should commend her for her 
interest in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
kind words, of course.  I am flattered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, in my speech, which I also invite this member to 
read, I never excluded francophones outside Quebec.  I asked whether 
there would be an information highway for francophones.  I did not 
specify that it would be for Quebec alone and that it would not go 
outside our province.  The information highway covers quite a distance. 
I would have a lot of trouble stopping it at the Quebec border.  I spoke 
about an information highway for francophones, meaning all francophones 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no objection to there being a French Canadian people. But I 
am no longer part of that group.  When I was growing up, I was taught in 
school that I was a French Canadian.  Later on, I was told that I was a 
Quebecer and I like that better.  But I will not be faulted for 
preferring to be a Quebecer to being a French Canadian.  As a French 
Canadian, I am a second class citizen. 
As a Quebecer, I am a first class citizen.  That is the difference.  I 
have no objection to their being French Canadians, but why are we given 
less money to produce television programs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am referring to the Canadian 
Constitution.  French Canadians are not second class citizens, as the 
member has just said. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With the greatest of 
respect, as the hon. member knows that is most likely a point of 
debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma—Manitoulin, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first let me offer my congratulations to you on your new 
office.  We are all confident you will do a great job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also say that I am sharing my time with the hon. member 
for St. Catharines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to participate in this debate.  There is no 
question the Speech from the Throne we heard this past Tuesday 
speaks for itself.  Nonetheless we are here, opposition members 
from one point of view and government members from another, to 
debate the merits or demerits of the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact I am here as the member for Algoma—Manitoulin is due 
to the voters of my riding who expressed their support in me. I 
appreciate that. 
We all had supporters among our volunteers and our loved ones. On 
behalf of all of us may I thank many people across the country 
who participated in the political process, in the democratic 
process.  They are helping to make this country the greatest 
country in the world with a parliament that at times seems to be 
raucous and noisy but a parliament that works, a parliament in 
which we can all have confidence.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I never cease to be in awe of this place even though this is my 
second term.  I say to first time members of the House that they 
can make of this job what their efforts produce.  If they serve 
their constituents and their country well, they will feel the 
reward of knowing that the country is bit by bit moving 
positively into the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appropriate that a Liberal government will lead the 
country into the next millennium.  Our Prime Minister is the 
right person to lead the government into the next thousand years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech has shown in many ways the caring and 
nurturing side of government.  Too often our citizens are cynical 
about government at all levels and the processes which seem to 
take place behind closed doors and in faraway places.  We 
demonstrated in the last Parliament—and we will show it 
again—that this is an open, transparent government, a government 
that will listen to the people and will make decisions, often 
tough decisions, that are needed to continue keeping the country 
the best country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote one sentence from the Prime Minister's speech of 
yesterday which sums up for me the theme of my remarks.  He said 
“Canada will remain the best country to live in because it cares 
about people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my time around here as the member of Parliament for 
Algoma—Manitoulin I have learned that ultimately voters want to 
know their governments and representatives care about them and 
their communities.  The less we express and show that, the more 
distant they feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding in northern Ontario stretches from Manitouwadge in the 
northwest to Chapleau in the northeast and south to the north 
shore of Lake Huron including Manitoulin Island.  Whether we 
represent a downtown city core or urban riding or a large rural 
riding, we are representing Canadians.  They are Canadians who 
all feel the same way about their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech expresses the caring nature of the government. 
We can find no greater evidence than in the words of the throne 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with the issue of the economy.  In the last 
Parliament a tremendous challenge was facing us with the deficit 
at record levels.  Let us imagine newspaper headlines screaming 
aloud that the government has brought our country into the black. 
Over the next year and a half, if not sooner, we will be in a 
surplus position.  What greater thing can we do for preserving 
our health care programs, our pension programs, programs for 
youth and so on, than by ensuring our economy is strong and 
vibrant based on a set of books we can all be proud of whether a 
member of the opposition or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That essence of caring has given Canadians for the first time in 
a long time a real sense of hope, optimism and confidence about 
the future.  We are certainly not there yet when it comes to 
solving all the problems of the country.  There will always be 
challenges and problems to face.  It has been a long time since 
this country has been at such a tremendous juncture in its 
history. 
In fact there is so much confidence as we approach the next 
millennium that the Prime Minister in the throne speech announced 
that we are going to have a tremendous millennium party in two 
and a half years, a party which I believe the world will come to 
because people around the world know that we have a country that 
cares about people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we hear complaints from different parts of the 
country it is only because people know that the government will 
listen when they speak and cry out for help.  They know we will 
respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A caring government must look at the first and most important 
group in our society, our children.  We have recognized that 
children must get a good start in life, be it through proper 
nutrition or through proper education. We have made tremendous 
strides, in co-operation with all the provinces, in developing a 
national child benefit system.  It is not completed yet but I 
believe it will evolve into a model for the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the young people of our society, people who we 
worry a lot about because of their concerns of future employment, 
this government in the last Parliament, and even more this 
Parliament, stands ready to make sure that in co-operation with 
the provinces through an enhanced scholarship program, through 
initiatives with industry it can make sure that they have a 
chance at that first job, at starting life on the right foot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, for some reason, they get off on the wrong foot we are there 
to make sure they have a second and a third chance if necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also looking out for those in our society who find 
themselves in the middle ages, sometimes victims of structural 
change.  With changing societies and economies, we will see jobs 
lost here and jobs created somewhere else.  That is the nature of 
our modern society. We have the sadness which comes with losing a 
job maybe at the age of 40 or 50 years of age.  Many of my 
constituents have faced that challenge, particularly in Elliot 
Lake.  It is incumbent on us to continue to assist people caught 
in this way with retraining or appropriate early retirement 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the final age category, that being our elderly, what more 
can a government do but to make sure that the pension systems are 
secure and that seniors do not have to worry about the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard from the seniors.  They were worried about the future. 
When they understood through our campaign that we were committed 
to securing the Canada pension plan for the future and that we 
were developing the seniors benefit plan, they knew that the 
government would be watching out for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not say that some people don't get lost in the cracks. 
It is incumbent on the government to close those cracks, to make 
sure that nobody is left behind.  It is an absolute feature of a 
caring government that no one gets left behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, again I wish you the very best in your new office 
over this next Parliament.  I wish the best for all my colleagues

Seventy-six percent of them are now gone.  Seventy-six percent 
of them are not working.  They have gone illegally to the U.S.A. 
to work so they can feed their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is selling off all the housing of CMHC.  Do you 
know who lives in CMHC housing?  All the low and middle income 
people live in those houses.  When you privatize it, the rent 
doubles and triples and the people are out on the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that the government understands what it has 
done.  It is time for it to stop and take a look. The member 
talks about a crack.  What is in the throne speech is a crack the 
size of the Grand Canyon. I appeal to the government to please 
tell us what it is going to do for the people who are hurting 
like never before.  I do not want to hear about governments in 
the past who did this or that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I know is that when I was mayor our people worked and we had 
a low unemployment rate.  I had 4,000 people working at my 
shipyard, some as plumbers, some as electricians.  It was

decisions.  You can care about the people and still make tough 
decisions knowing that what you are doing will be better for all 
the regions of the country.

a job loss of some 5,000 in the uranium mining industry.  There 
was a lot of adjustment, but in the long run the changes which 
took place have shown that Elliot Lake and that region will 
survive and do very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the spirit of the citizens of the Atlantic provinces 
is very much the same.  They will respond to change and they will 
deal with the challenges that face them in a very creative way. 
I have every confidence in the citizens of Saint John and the 
other ridings of the Atlantic provinces.  They will take up the 
flag and march into the next millennium with all of us.  All of 
our regions will be better off with the changes and improvements 
that we have made in the governance of this country.

like to congratulate you.  You occupy the chair so well.  Not 
only do you look well, you act well, you speak well and you have 
such a passion for the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to the speech we have just heard from the 
hon. member for Algoma—Manitoulin.  He used little phrases in 
his comment that really caught my attention.  He said “and no 
one shall be left behind”.  Now that was very interesting.  In 
fact I think “no one is left behind” were the exact words he 
used. That is very interesting because the moment he finished his 
speech, the hon. member for Saint John had to point out to him 
that there are people who are already being left behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member for Algoma—Manitoulin what he 
considers to be accountability and what he considers being left 
behind.  I draw his attention to the the allocation or awarding 
by the Minister of Industry of TPC grants.  It is is clearly the 
spoken intention of the Minister of Industry to say very clearly 
that these grants are to be in support of and to develop small 
industry in Canada.  What do we discover?  Until this point as of 
August 31, 1997, 75 percent of all of those moneys were not given to 
small industry but to large industries in aerospace and defence; 
75 percent on industries that are wealthy, industries with a profit, yet 
the small businessman could not get in. Does he call that 
accountability?  Does he call that being left behind?  What is he 
talking about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate what I 
think was a question from the member for Kelowna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he can check the blues, I believe he will appreciate my 
clarification on the people in our society who are being left 
behind. None of us in the House wants anyone to be left behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe I said that this government in the last Parliament and 
again in this Parliament will take steps to ensure that as much 
as possible no one is left behind.  It is a sad fact in the real 
world of life that some people for one reason or another find 
themselves lagging behind the bulk of society and it is necessary 
for society at large to reach back and make sure that no one is 
left behind. But sadly we do not live in a perfect world.  I 
doubt that we will ever live in a perfect world, but we can all 
work together to make it a better world and a better country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that opposition members of all parties will work with us 
to make Canada a better and better place in which to live where 
no one will be left behind. That is not a fantasy nor is it a 
dream.  It is a very high goal that will take a lot of effort and 
time to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the programs that we have and will put in place will 
provide our citizens with the very best possibility to achieve 
their own individual successes in life.  Take for example the 
scholarship fund that the Prime Minister referred to yesterday in 
his speech, the details of which will no doubt come out over the 
days and weeks ahead.  It is a scholarship fund designed 
specifically for post-secondary aspirants who find themselves in 
low and modest income family situations.  That among many 
initiatives is an indication of the government's commitment to 
those who might otherwise be left behind.  While he might want to 
say that I said we were there, he knows full well it is an 
objective that will be best achieved through the efforts of this 
government no doubt with the co-operation of the opposition 
parties.
