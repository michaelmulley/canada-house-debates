<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from March 27, 2003, consideration of the motion that Bill C-28, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 18, 2003, be read the second time and referred to a committee, and of the amendment.</p><A NAME="Int-481698"></A><a HREF="#Int-481714"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is actually a great opportunity to speak on the budget implementation act and, I am sure much to the chagrin of the governing party, an opportunity to comment on what the budget is lacking and the failure of the budget itself to do what it needs to do to better the situation in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to start by speaking first on an issue within the budget that is tied directly to my critic area, that being the issue of the infrastructure funding in the budget and, quite frankly, in past budgets, in that it  is and they were severely lacking in the amount of dollars needed for transportation infrastructure and other infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly in the area of transportation infrastructure there has been a call throughout the country from the municipalities and the provinces that there has to be some real and serious investment by the federal government into infrastructure. We have heard of the numerous cases where water and sewer infrastructure are needed  and where problems have arisen, but in the area of transportation we know wholeheartedly that the situation on a number of the roads throughout the country has reached points of absolute crisis and there are safety issues. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the increased transportation of goods by road has put greater stress on the highways. The government's failure to make these improvements has as a result increased the risk to travellers on the roads, for the transport truck drivers as well as for others on the roads in smaller vehicles. The government, in the course of the last month or so, introduced through the transport minister a blueprint for a transportation vision in the country, “Straight Ahead”. I have stated before that it was sort of like straight ahead and off the cliff, because the highway infrastructure just is not there in a lot of areas. It is an increasingly serious problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can have a wonderful vision but if somewhere in that vision one does not put in place the reality factors that have to be there to make that vision happen, there is just no point in talking about it with any serious approach. Quite frankly, that was certainly the case with the funding for transportation infrastructure in the budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I indicated, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities had called on the government for increased infrastructure dollars at the municipal level, for assistance on roads but also with other infrastructure. I am not going to even try to recall what the exact amount was in this budget, because quite frankly when we looked at the different dollars that the government was suggesting for infrastructure, it was another one of these shell games that it often plays, when it says, “We have given money for this program through infrastructure, we have given money for it this year in this program for infrastructure, and in this one”.  The reality is that it really is not the whole amount that it suggests it is putting into infrastructure this year, and it still is not nearly enough to meet the needs of Canadians. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the figure we came up with was that it would take something like 190 years to address the infrastructure needs in the country with the support that the federal government gives. While doing that, somehow the government suggests that it is okay to have tax cuts in numerous areas, which will not benefit the entire nation but will  certainly benefit some businesses. That is disappointing, not that I want to see Canadians taxed to death, and nobody does, but the Canadians I know, who are more or less the middle income, small and medium sized business owners, do not mind paying their fair share. But they want to see something come back in return. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we hear of tax cuts benefiting huge corporations that often do not even have head offices in Canada, that do not put in the investment that they need to in Canada, it is disappointing. It was no great surprise to see the Premier of Ontario doing the same thing in his budget announcement this past week, where the company in front of which he did his big advertising campaign for the budget is going to reap huge tax breaks in Ontario within the changes in that budget, the same company that gave him a whole lot of money. The premier in Ontario has chosen to do that but in reality the federal budget does the same thing in a lot of areas and that is disappointing, because it will have a direct impact on so many programs throughout the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly the budget is lacking in the area of  transportation infrastructure.  If the government does not make some serious considerations in that area, it will continually get worse. Municipalities and provinces will feel the pressure to get into a privatized toll type of approach to the highway system.  Canadians do not want to see that.  Everybody says we have to do it but the bottom line is that we would not have to do it if there were priorities within the government and a real effort to make access available to everyone without those additional user fees in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, the budget is lacking with respect to the issue of housing, extremely so.  I noted in some reading I did yesterday that the Federation of Canadian Municipalities again has called  for changes to the whole CMHC mortgage structure.  This has been a bone of contention with me for the last year or so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I did more    reading of the propaganda that comes from CMHC,   I saw how  it was doing all these wonderful investments in different types of housing and  in marketing of housing throughout the world, I was going, “Where the heck are they   when it comes to putting in place a good CMHC mortgage structure for Canadians to be able access mortgages?”  What about working at lowering the interest rates for mortgages in Canada and making them accessible to more     people?  What about getting rid of the whole attitude of making sure to get every penny out of everybody without making it possible for a good number of people to access housing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I see this stuff about how it is  going to do the marketing to other countries, I think that it might be important but quite frankly that is not my vision of what CMHC is intended to do.  To me, it is intended to be there to offer a good mortgage setup so Canadians are able to access housing.  If it wants to go  and do marketing, let industry do it.  Let outside business do it.  We have put enough money into all these different operations so that we can market this and promote the business aspect outside of Canada. How about promoting things that  will benefit Canadians?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a situation in the community of Leaf Rapids, Manitoba,   a one industry town. When the mine decided to close a whole lot earlier than it was supposed to, a number of people were      left with mortgages.   Some of these people were able to   get jobs elsewhere and    others were not, but they found   that at every step of the road or every mile of the road there was a roadblock put in place.    They had the insight and the fortitude to go out and get a job. They had mortgages in Leaf Rapids.  Some wanted to turn back their mortgages because they could not afford them.   They wanted to be able to go somewhere else, get jobs, work and contribute to the tax base of Canada.  They were told that they still had to make the mortgage payments in Leaf Rapids and make them somewhere else with whatever income they were making, which probably was less because they did not have the seniority they previously had.  For those people who were able to get jobs, it was a struggle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What also happened, though, was that a number of people were told that they could get a quit order, that it was recognized that the situation was serious, but to get another mortgage after that they would have to wait for two years or  put down 25%. The situation was that a family  that had just lost its income, and  often   two incomes because if one in the family moved the other had to move, was trying to go somewhere else. In some  situations   in other communities they could not rent places; all they could do was buy, but meanwhile they could not get mortgages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see a much more accessible and considerate CMHC mortgage operation than what we have seen. Again the  budget did nothing to provide affordable housing throughout Canada to address some of those concerns.  It went purely on the whole business aspect: “We are going to get every penny out of you even if we get you into the ground and have to stomp on you a couple of times”.</p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, let me suggest that there were some good things within the budget.  One of the things mentioned was the accessibility to caregivers' assistance  through the EI program for someone wanting to stay at home and look after a family member. There is going to be some time for people to do that, but to me the time that was offered was absolutely a slap in the face to those caregivers who have to leave their jobs to stay at home to look after a family member. A good number cannot and they want the opportunity to be able to do that.  Our health care system is going through a challenging time and we have caregivers who are family members. Quite frankly, a good number of those doing this were women. By the nature of the way things worked, it was mostly the women who were willing to take time off work and stay home and look after a family member. There were men too, but it was mostly women, and there were extremely great financial difficulties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they wanted to do seemed simple enough.  People are paying EI premiums.  It is not as if this is something for nothing.  People have paid for that insurance.  They wanted to take a reasonable amount of time off to look after a family member at home with a terminal illness or  a sick child who required acute care. What we were asking for were some real contributions through the EI program to provide people with reasonable time off. I think that what the government came up with was a six week period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone dealing with people with acute medical needs or a terminal illness knows that they need someone there for more than six weeks of that time. The challenges and emotions that are involved in that kind of family situation are really tough.  What does the government respond with?  It says it will give someone six weeks to access EI.  This is from a government that has taken a $42 billion surplus out of EI.  It says it will give back six weeks.  This is not about a person receiving money for nothing.  If people pay EI premiums, it is an insurance policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once had a discussion with a  previous minister and said that with most insurance policies one looks at ways of enhancing programs.  If the funds are available, the program should be enhanced and extend what people can be given. What we saw under this government year after year were cuts to benefits, cuts to EI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues from the Alliance have argued for cuts to the premiums that people had to pay in.   The government gave them every reason to argue that point because it kept having a surplus and did not give the benefits back.  I, on the other hand, as a worker had no objection to paying a few hundred dollars a year for an insurance policy which would ensure that if I did not have my job I would be able to collect EI for a period of time.  If I had to access the sick and disabled part of EI, I could do that.  If for other reasons I had to access EI, I did not begrudge paying that as a worker. I was able to claim it as a tax deduction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What benefits do most workers and, for that matter, most businesses receive by the cuts to the premiums? Some would argue they are saving all this money in payroll taxes. A good number of small and medium sized businesses out there benefit through training programs they are able to access through human resources and the EI funds.  It was not as if someone did not have the opportunity to gain from dollars going into EI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, as a worker I quite frankly did not mind paying for an insurance policy that was guaranteed.  I did not see it as a tax.  It was an insurance policy in the same way that I pay my life insurance.  I pay so much money so that if I happen to die in an accident at a certain time a specific  amount of money is going to come back to assist my family. If by luck I never have to access that life insurance policy, hallelujah brother, it worked out great. I am not going to ask for the money back because I recognize that it is an insurance policy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what EI was intended to be, an insurance policy, so that if rough times fall upon people they are able to benefit from it.  What we have seen time and time again are cuts to the EI program, cuts to the benefits, a few minor cuts to the premiums as a result of pressure, and the fact that there is a $42 billion surplus when what we really should have seen was more money going into the benefits side of the EI program so that women and other family members who wanted to stay at home to look after a sick or terminally ill family member could do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect that should have been accessed under EI. We have called for this before.  There are some workers who have worked for 5, 10 or 15 years who have never had to access EI even for minor things, but so be it.  They have paid into EI and they might find that they want to try something different, like increasing their educational opportunities.  I want to say that  it was nurses in Canada who first brought this to my attention.  They wanted the opportunity, after working 5 or 10 years in a certain part of the nursing profession,  to perhaps enhance that professional training opportunity or to try something a little different like perhaps taking a year off to do some other kind of training.  They wanted the opportunity to access EI, an insurance program that they have paid into year after year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the government open up any of those opportunities? We need improved health care in this country. We need more trained people in this country.  Did the government offer an opportunity for nurses throughout Canada to enhance their professional training, or to other workers for that matter?  No, it stomped on them, saying,  “We have a $42 billion surplus and we want to use it to give a tax cut to someone else over here, possibly, what the heck, Bombardier, Groupaction, whoever.  We want to make sure all of them get a tax cut”.</p><A NAME="Int-481714"></A><a HREF="#Int-481723"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-481698"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b>However we do not want to open up any better benefits or opportunities for Canadian workers who have paid into these funds.  It is not giving them something for nothing.  They would access those funds because they paid that insurance.  That would have been an enhanced EI program.  That is what a good, considerate government with a conscience and caring for its people would have done.  However not this government under this budget. It is extremely disappointing that the government had an opportunity to do that with a $42 billion surplus in EI but it never even bothered to think about it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue came up on EI in the last week or so.  Flight attendants were always, in my view, considered part of the flight  crew.  They are our number one first responder if an  airplane goes down. I always said how we expect them not to be injured any more than passengers was always beyond me.  However  they are considered the  persons to respond to emergencies on the plane.  Lo and behold flight attendants are not considered part of the flight crew.  As a result of them not being considered part of that crew, it has changed the whole concept of how CCRA and human resources will make available to them the opportunity for EI payments.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every contract with every airline has different kinds of agreements for the flight attendants.    I hate to say this because it is disappointing to have to be reminding the government over and over again, but this has opened up a situation where once again mostly women will be challenged as to whether  they can access EI payments, even for maternity leave, because of the way the government now sees  their hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without getting into how the hours for flight attendants work, we all know that we get on a flight and it leaves at a certain time. The flight attendant is there looking after us, helping out with a family member who might be a little tense or providing assistance if it is needed.  If the plane is delayed and it is sitting on the ground waiting, for a lot of flight attendants that is not considered flying time.  There are things built into the contract that mean it will be dealt with differently.  However the government is not going to acknowledge that.  It   will only consider the flying time and it will finagle around other agreements flight attendants  have as to whether they will be counted as hours worked.  As a result, flight attendants  will be denied EI benefits. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still working on this one and I  hope  the government will have the decency and conscience to recognize that if the flight attendant has to sit there and wait an hour and a half while the plane gets back on track that time will be considered as time worked and allow them to use that time to collect EI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I only have a short period of time left but there were so many other things I wanted to mention.  Let me just get on to a couple in that short two minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to mention the situation with the seniors' access to pension. Once again, a government with any conscience would not put into place a rule that says if seniors did not let the government know they wanted this pension which was rightfully due, then they would not receive it because the time had expired. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are our most vulnerable people in society as a result of cuts the government has made to health care, housing and numerous areas.  They have paid their dues to Canadian society time and time again  and have worked hard to get us good programs. Our seniors have supported health care over the years. With the  Canada pension plan, seniors have been paying that for us.  What is the government doing?   It is telling them that if they did not apply on time they will not receive their pension which they were  rightfully due.    They might get $15,000 to $16,000 a year and the government expects them to live on that, and it will not give them any extra cash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is absolutely unacceptable from a caring, considerate country such as Canada, and obviously acceptable to the government, which is not okay for Canadians.  I hope Canadians will recognize that next time around when they have seen the actions of this government in a number of areas.</p><A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-481723"></A><a HREF="#Int-481727"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-481714"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her intervention.  I point out that the government has in the budget dealt with families, communities and with real Canadians. We have done it in a way which is fiscally responsible.  We have no deficit again, with a balanced budget or better, which is the sixth in a row.  We have been able to deal with health care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the member is very concerned about health care.  There will be $34.8 billion going into health care over five years.  We have reduced EI premiums to $1.98 and we will have the commission  look at future changes in EI, about which I know the member is concerned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are concerned about the fact that communities need to have the support.  Through both the strategic infrastructure fund  and  the national infrastructure fund,  there will be leveraging of  money from the provinces and communities to help.</p>

There is also no question that a lot still has not been done.  Quite frankly the government's priorities were out of whack in some of the areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one was suggesting that we do not want to get rid of debt and deficit.  Absolutely a government does that.  However the bottom line is Canadians paid for those savings, not the government with all its fancy finagling and book work.  Canadians paid with loss of services.  Most Canadians did not benefit from decreased taxes or premiums or this kind of thing.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question there is a lot of work to be done, but there was also a lot of wastage of government dollars. I believe that happened within the gun registry, not gun control. These are two different things.  I strongly support gun control.  A much better job could have been done to ensure safety for Canadians through good gun control rather than through the mismanagement of the gun registry or that whole registry process which I think was just a sham to appease some people, giving an impression that it was going to provide safety when it was not going to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also the money that was wasted through the whole Groupaction scandal.  When Canadians hear someone say, “It was only a billion dollars, a bit of wastage here and we had to do this”, my gosh that money would have gone so far in those communities experiencing poverty to ensure that there was proper housing, proper dollars for schools and proper funding for increased infrastructure, for roads.  So much more could have been done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fine to say that we are putting this in, but year after year the government cut so much that it could have done a great deal more. We have to see that money go to where it is needed and that is not happening.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask if she thinks that it is right—and the employment insurance fund is another example—for the government to boast about reducing the national debt on the backs of the workers, the unemployed and the elderly. I know that several billion dollars belong to the workers and not to the state. It did not contribute one dime to this fund. This money belongs to the workers. Some $3 billion belongs to the seniors who were deprived of the guaranteed income supplement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does she think it is right for this money to be used to pay down the national  debt, when these people did not incur the federal debt. I would like to get her reaction to this.</p>

I know my colleague worked very hard on the issue of the guaranteed income supplement.  It took a good three years of constant badgering before the government even made an effort to let seniors know that it should have been rightfully theirs. The government used all these arguments, that it could not breach privacy with this by letting seniors know that the money was rightfully theirs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk about an act of omission, a lie of omission, an absolute unconscionable act of omission.  The government's way of getting around it is proof to the Canadian public that governments do not act in the best interests of the people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that members would be hard pressed to find a handful of Canadians who think there should be a clause in place that says if Canadian seniors did not apply on time they would not get the money.  If members can find a handful of Canadians, I would ask that they stand up in front of the Canadian public and say that they agree with the government that if seniors did not apply on time for this money, they should not get it.  If they can be found I would like to see them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody believes that seniors should not get that money, even if it took them 10, 15 or  20 years to apply.

I want to focus on her interest in the poorest in our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member mentioned the very correct notion that the government through its tax structure has been unfairly penalizing the poor and those who are struggling in an environment that is becoming increasingly more difficult as time passes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the member a simple question.  Would she support changes to our tax system that nobody making less than $20,000 a year would pay any federal income tax?  In my view people cannot survive on less than $20,000 a year.  Why is the government taking money away from them with one hand and then expensively giving money back to them with the other?</p><A NAME="Int-481739"></A><a HREF="#Int-481741"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-481737"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais: </b>Mr. Speaker, I do not think there is any question as to the reason why the government does that.  It has to keep raking in money because it keeps giving breaks to someone who is a whole lot higher up on the income scale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When corporations that literally make billions of dollars are given tax breaks, then the government has to get that money back from somewhere.  It gets the money back from the people it can harass to death for owing the government 50 bucks.  However, the corporations that owe the government $200,000 or $300,000 or a million dollars are allowed to get away with it because it is too much trouble to get the money from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government gets the money from a lot of little people down the road.  There is no question that it is unacceptable.  There needs to be changes to our tax system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the position the New Democratic Party had taken was $15,000.  I am glad to hear my colleague from the Alliance who thinks perhaps it should be $20,000.  There is no question, there needs to be a change. People have to be able to make a living, not a great living but a living to provide things for themselves such as heat, water, food, rent, clothing, basic needs.  I am not talking about  buying a huge television screen or a new car every other week.  That is not about what we are talking.  We are talking about the basic necessities of life that people need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good number of these people are seniors.  They are the same seniors to whom the government refuses to give that money back.</p><A NAME="Int-481741"></A><a HREF="#Int-481744"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-481739"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I do not know if I can do justice to this issue in such a brief period of time.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one simple adjustment that the Minister of Finance could have announced that would have given relief to thousands of Canadians.  The time of the year that is the most costly for ordinary Canadian families is when they have to pay to heat their homes with the high fuel prices.  Many of those same families pay EI and CPP contributions from January 1 for about eight months.  Then  they have a holiday at the time they have made the maximum contributions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it not be sensible to shift the period of time that the government collects EI and CPP contributions to coincide so that the most expensive months for heating and fuel costs would be the tax free months in terms of payroll contributions?  The government could begin collecting those contributions on April 1 instead of January 1.  In the most expensive months of the year people would not be making any of those contributions to EI and CPP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the member agree with that?</p><A NAME="Int-481744"></A><a HREF="#Int-481747"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-481741"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais: </b>Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent plan.  It is proof that the NDP is not always out there, as people would say, just to give a break.  There are sensible ways of doing things that will not decrease the amount of dollars coming into the federal government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say the government just wants to get some extra interest and again from the people who can least afford it.  In a country such as Canada, we know the heating costs will be that much greater through those months.  Climate change has not come to the point where we are sitting in 70° weather throughout the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is some things could have be done.  They are not major changes.  The government did not like the fact that it would benefit a good number of ordinary Canadians, rather than the ones at the top of the scale.</p><A NAME="Int-481747"></A><a HREF="#Int-481752"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-481744"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Brandon--Souris.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to comment  on the remarks just recently made by my colleague from the NDP and also on the question asked by the member for Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca. They talked about raising the exemption level in relation to the payment of income tax.  That is something which not only will we support but we have also recommended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have too many people living on fixed incomes and very low incomes who quite often have to turn to the government for social assistance. The government takes away, as the member for Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca said, on one hand through the income process, only to give back through some social program. It does not make any sense. It would be much better for the psyche of the individuals involved if they could go out, make a living, and hold on to the amount of money that they need in order to make a basic living.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of living in this country and right across the world has gone sky high. We have not adjusted our exemption level in tune with the expenses and the needs of the average family in our country. Certainly, the government must look at that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP member for Churchill talked about seniors. They are perhaps one of the two groups in the country completely ignored by the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I spoke earlier on the budget, I talked about the need to invest in our youth, to invest in education, and to educate our young people so that they will be contributors to society, rather than going out into the field without an education and forever taking from the system. It is a no-brainer. A young, educated population will be a contributing population</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any statistic we look at shows that individuals with a post-secondary education, plus any extra degrees at a higher level they might want to pick up, have a better chance of employment. If they cannot afford to go to a post-secondary institution they have no other choice except to go out and try to find some work in the workplace. These days such work is quite often intermittent, and therefore they end up on social assistance or drawing employment insurance, and because of the inability to look after themselves, their health costs escalate, and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have two choices. We can invest up front and have a population that contributes, or we do not invest and have a large portion of our population who,  through absolutely no fault of their own but because of geographic or economic circumstances, will be taking from the system more than they will be putting in for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group includes our seniors. Many of them, especially in the rural areas, live on fixed incomes and old age pensions. Many of them have absolutely nothing else. If they worked in the private sector they probably do not have any extra pension except a small Canada pension which would be minimal. Many older people, particularly women, basically stayed home in their day, raised families, and consequently do not have Canada pension benefits. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are on a low fixed income which has not been increased for a considerable amount of time to any degree at all to meet the rapidly rising costs of living in this country.  Yet, we expect them to maintain their residences, buy food, clothe themselves, cover the horrendous costs of health care that they face, in particular drugs which are not covered by medicare, and we do nothing to assist them. These are the people who built our country. These are the people we should be helping. We have not been doing it and it is about time we got around to doing it.</p><A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about a few other concerns. The last time I spoke I gave the  government credit for some of the new innovations in the budget. However, one of the concerns I have with the government, and I am sure others share it, is that we see all kinds of fancy announcements, but when we analyze them we realize they would be implemented over the next 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years. By that time the amount of money would diminish considerably in relation to value. When we look at the implementation process, the bureaucracy, and the money that must go to the advertising companies to advertise such programs, there is little left for individuals who are supposed to be the beneficiaries of such programs. It is not what is in the budget; it is what is not in it that is probably more important. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the interesting things when we talk about programs and the money going into new programs is that while the government is telling people it is doing this to a certain program and bringing in that  new program, it is immediately telling its departments that they must cut $1 billion from programs.  It did that, in fact, a couple of days ago. It gave the departments a deadline. The promises are extended over a considerable amount of time with all kinds of dollars that can be moved, taken out and changed. A lot of it has been double promised over the years and promised every time the government makes an announcement. However, the $1 billion is coming out today. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some programs, for example, within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans are being cut by $17 million. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been begging on its knees for money for the past 10 years.  The government has made these cuts from day one. The Coast Guard is at rock bottom. Boats cannot even afford fuel to do their jobs and are tied up in port. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have security concerns in the country and nobody to address them. We have infrastructure problems and people within the department openly telling the government and the country at  hearings that it would take $400 million to bring our facilities up to par.  About 21% of our wharves are not safe to walk on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, we have the science branch. Two days ago the FRCC made recommendations on the cod stocks and yesterday in relation to the northern cod. It is basically saying to the government that these cod stocks are not growing. In fact, the northern cod is practically non-existent, less than 1% of the biomass that was there 15 years ago. It will also tell us we do not know very much about what is going on in the ocean simply because we have no science. That is inexcusable. As we run into these problems we need an increase. We do not need the government, telling departments behind everybody's back, to cut and cut from such things as science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things the government can do to help this country prosper, to help small business, to help business generally and  to get out there and create the money that can help seniors, students and our science is to cut out some of the red tape and bureaucracy. We have too much bureaucracy. The more complicated the system the longer the bureaucrats have their jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must  streamline delivery. We must have one stop shopping. We do not need 13 stops to get permits to start developing our minerals or the offshore. We need to cut down on bureaucracy and let the private sector get out there to create jobs, and create the type of economy that can help those who need help.</p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-481752"></A><a HREF="#Int-481755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-481747"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I would agree with the hon. member that cutting red tape is a continuing issue for government. The  government is developing a new culture of accountability and transparency.  The more we can do in that regard the better it will be for all Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has brought in a budget with no deficit.  The national debt continues to go down from 71.5% five and a half years ago to 44.5% and is continuing to fall.  We are able to contribute significantly with our partners in the provinces to health care, $34.8 billion over five years.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are infrastructure issues.  I would agree with the hon. member that it was the government that picked up on the Federation of Canadian Municipalities' infrastructure program and provided funding for St. John's Harbour, Halifax, roads or whatever it happened to be. The government took a program that lay dormant under the fifth party when it was in power and brought in three consecutive national infrastructure programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are leveraging that by working with our partners in the provinces and municipalities.  The leveraging is important.  It is not simply federal dollars; it is provincial and municipal dollars.  I would like the member to comment on the positive impact that the national infrastructure program would have on St. John's Harbour which I know has been a concern of the mayor of that city.  I have spoken to the mayor before about it.  I am sure it something that the member will see as an improvement for his community.</p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-481755"></A><a HREF="#Int-481759"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-481752"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn: </b>Mr. Speaker, let me first talk about the positive aspects of the question.  He talked about the funding for St. John's Harbour.  It has been long fought for, long needed, and is now promised.  Hopefully it will be delivered upon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to the member though that the funding came through a special program because former ministers had been telling us in the House that it must come through the regular infrastructure.  One cannot  take $100 million out of regular infrastructure funding for any project and expect to be able to do everything else that has to be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member would check <i>Hansard</i> there is one member who recommended to the Minister of Finance, months before he brought in the new program, that we needed a new special infrastructure program to deal with major projects.  He would see that I made that recommendation here and so I do take some credit for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member talked about transparency and accountability.  These are great words.  The government   would be transparent and accountable.  We saw what it did a couple of days ago in getting $59 million more to put into the administrative side of the gun registry, not counting the other associated costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was quite transparent that the Prime Minister cracked the whip and forced people on their knees to come here under threat of expulsion from caucus, or that he would call an election where a lot of them would know that they would not be back here, and forced them against their will and against the wishes of the country to vote for that kind of funding.  It was very transparent but certainly not accountable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also talked about balancing the budget and giving money to health care.  The government is only giving back a portion of what it took away and that is why it balanced the budget in the first place, along with raking in money from free trade and the GST.  At present, HRDC is reducing services in rural Canada and playing games with the local bureaucrats because it has been told to cut programs.  It is transparent but it is certainly not accountable to Canadians.   No wonder it balanced the budget, but it did so on the people in the country who really need to be helped. </p><A NAME="Int-481759"></A><a HREF="#Int-481761"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-481755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, my friend from the Conservative Party brought up one of the essential bugbears of the House, which is the efficient use of government expenditures.  We have seen from Groupaction to regional pork-barrelling expenditures where taxpayers' money is spent for the benefit of the governing party to invest in politically sensitive ridings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, that must change because at the end of the day the money is taxpayers' money.  It is not our money.  What would the member do to ensure greater transparency, effectiveness, and efficiency of  taxpayers' money and how the House spends it?</p><A NAME="Int-481761"></A><a HREF="#Int-481763"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-481759"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn: </b>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's  very good question is one  that has to be answered by the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two words that are being used are “accountability” and “transparency”.  We are elected by every individual in this country who is of voting age to come here and make the proper rules and regulations and the laws that govern this country. We are also here to administer the funds that we collect from them and which are spent for their benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways this could be done and should be done, is as it used to be done.  When a government brings forward a budget, that budget should be built upon the needs of the people of the country as collectively input by the people who sit in this place.   The estimates should be fully scrutinized and debated right here in this chamber or thoroughly at the committee level. What happens now is the government brings in a budget, rushes through the estimates, and forces its members with the threat of expulsion to vote for funds such as for the gun registry. Nobody has any input.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place to thoroughly debate these issues is right here so the people of Canada can make the government accountable as well as the members who represent them.</p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-481763"></A><a HREF="#Int-481767"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-481761"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the speech made by the hon. member for St. John's West. He raised   many good points.  I would like to get his view on a point I raised earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if he would agree with me that it  was  an oversight or an omission and   the Minister of Finance could have done a very simple administrative thing. In order  to provide some relief to the thousands of Canadians who are suffering under the spiralling out of control home heating costs, he could have  staggered the months during which EI and Canada pension plan contributions are made so that they would begin to be collected on April 1. Everyone  knows full well that many people  make contributions for approximately eight months until they have reached their maximum contribution. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that simple administrative change could be made, would it not provide some relief to families? Would the member join me in urging the government to do so?</p><A NAME="Int-481767"></A><a HREF="#Int-481771"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-481763"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn: </b>Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member and certainly have absolutely no problem asking the government to do that.  It is only a matter of adjusting when it takes out the necessary funds or the percentage of CPP or EI benefits.  There is  always a three or four month break.  Why not give it to people  when it is really needed, especially to  people on low or fixed incomes? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go a bit further.  I am sure that by  looking at government programs such as those and by readjusting them, we could find many ways to help people across the country, especially people on low and fixed incomes.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other reasons people suffer with the  high costs for fuel is because of government taxes.  There  should be a  ceiling. The government should not be able to rake in windfalls because the price of home heating fuel and gas goes up. There should be a limit which would give the government the same amount of money, but would also give a break to the people who need it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Red Cross Society is a volunteer based humanitarian organization dedicated to preventing human suffering across Canada and around the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When disaster strikes, it is the quick response of the Red Cross that lessens the hardship suffered by survivors. In Canada alone there are approximately 65,000 Red Cross volunteers who provide for people's basic needs following a disaster, including food, clothing, shelter and first aid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take this opportunity to recognize this organization and urge all  members to support the Canadian Red Cross Society. I urge all Canadians to volunteer their time and to financially support the Red Cross programs.</p>

The most common complaint I heard was that the price of fuel and natural gas was too high.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers trying to keep their vehicles and machinery running are especially hard hit. The price of natural gas is driving up the cost of fertilizer making it even more difficult for those struggling in the agricultural sector. High fuel prices, driven even higher by taxes, are nothing short of highway robbery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year Canadians pay $4.8 billion in fuel taxes but instead of most of that money being put back into roads, it goes straight into general revenues. The Liberal government siphons $375 million in fuel taxes out of Saskatchewan each year, but since 1992 only a total of $26 million has come back. The sudden announcement that $39 million will be spent on roads in Saskatchewan this year is an obvious attempt to buy votes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the government robbing struggling farmers to fund corporate welfare?</p>

Thanks to the decisive action of Mayor Bob Pilot and county health officials, a potential crisis has been averted, though the advisory remains in effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that years of federal cuts to provincial transfer payments have taken their toll on all Canadians. From the tragic deaths of Canadian Forces pilots flying 40-year-old helicopters, to  the tragic deaths of school children near Owen Sound, Ontario because the Liberals cut the funds for safety inspectors,  to the sad tragedy of dirty water in Ontario that led to loss of life, the policies of the federal government are literally killing Canadians. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legacy of the Prime Minister and the former minister of finance has been a continual erosion of Canadian values. How many more Canadians must die thanks to the failed policies of a government that can spend $1 billion chasing duck hunters but refuses to protect children?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kidney disease is a serious public health concern in Canada and costs the lives of more than 3,000 Canadians each year. Kidney disease has a significant effect on the quality of life of those affected.  More than 22,000 Canadians rely on dialysis to survive. There is no cure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Canadian population ages, the number of people who will be affected by kidney disease is expected to rise.  Kidney failure primarily affects the elderly and people with diabetes and heart disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last decade medical research has increased the success rate of kidney transplant operations to over 85%.  Through research we hope to one day prevent some forms of kidney disease and develop more effective treatment options for others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that kidney month will draw attention to important concerns related to kidney disease.  Please join me in lending support to the Kidney Foundation of Canada during National Kidney Month.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six years ago, she and an associate acquired the Laurentides Ford dealership located in Saint-Jérôme. What makes her stand out is that she is one of a very few women car dealers. In fact, out of 851 members, there are only 43 women. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Aubé's  passion for cars did not come about overnight. As a young girl, she spent much of her time playing with her Fisher Price garage. She was constantly organizing parking lots and moving her little cars around. Later she set herself the goal of owning a car dealership by the time she was 30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She achieved that goal and now she is striving to become an exemplary dealer who will be known for quality. Congratulations Marie-Josée Aubé. Your determination does businesspeople and the women of Laurentides proud. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, we have heard from friends all over Canada that the great Canadian symbol has returned. The Canada geese are flocking back to their nesting spots. There are no doubt some golfers who will not welcome that news. Here in Ottawa we have heard that a cardinal was spotted yesterday and that warms our hearts as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All hon. members should pause and think about something other than politics. We should think about the two ducks spotted yesterday on the front lawn of Parliament Hill. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Mr. Speaker, two ducks.  A mallard and a drake hen were wading in a puddle left by the quickly melting snow. Keen wildlife observers said that it appeared they were testing this location as a possible nesting site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we regret that the ducks did not stay long enough for someone to bring their presence to the attention of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the belief of many political observers that the Prime Minister should have known about them and even strolled out to look at them. It might well have been mood lifting for the Prime Minister to see a duck that was not lame.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government says that  it does not support the war in Iraq  but we have troops there on the land, at sea and in the air.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government says that it does not support regime change  but apparently believes Saddam should be tried in an international criminal court.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will not expel the Iraqi ambassador  but Liberals over there want to kick out U.S. Ambassador Cellucci.</p>

<p>[<i>Text</i>]</p>
<center><b>Question No. 102--</b></center><b>Mr. John Cummins</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to agreements since 1992 between the
					 Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) and various aboriginal organizations
					 that contain provisions for the sale of fish on an annual basis under the
					 Aboriginal Fisheries Strategy: (<i>a</i>) what quantities and species of salmon
					 caught for aboriginal food, social and ceremonial purposes in British Columbia
					 were stored in cold storage, processing or other facilities in British Columbia
					 on an annual basis since 1992; (<i>b</i>) in what year were the salmon being
					 stored caught; (<i>c</i>) what quantities and species of salmon caught for
					 aboriginal food, social and ceremonial purposes in British Columbia were stored
					 in cold storage, processing or other facilities in the United States on an
					 annual basis since 1992; (<i>d</i>) in what year were the salmon being stored
					 caught; (<i>e</i>) which agreements required the collection of royalties by the
					 aboriginal organization on the sale of fish caught under the agreements to
					 support management or other activities of the aboriginal band or DFO and which
					 did not require the collection of royalties; (<i>f</i>) what is the value of
					 the fish sold under each of these agreements; (<i>g</i>) how much was the
					 required royalty, both in terms of a percentage of the total value of the fish
					 sold and in dollars; (<i>h</i>) in terms of percentage and in terms of dollars,
					 how much royalty was collected in each of these agreements; (<i>i</i>) who
					 collected the royalty; (<i>j</i>) by what means was the royalty collected;
					 (<i>k</i>) was a special fishery required to catch the fish to pay the royalty;
					 (<i>l</i>) for what was the royalty expended; (<i>m</i>) who spent the royalty
					 monies; (<i>n</i>) in cases where the royalty was not collected or was less
					 than the amount required by an agreement, what were the reasons for the
					 shortfall; (<i>o</i>) what action was taken by DFO to recover the shortfall;
					 (<i>p</i>) if no action was taken, what were the reasons for not taking action;
					 (<i>q</i>) in cases where no royalty was required to be collected, what was the
					 approximate market value of the fish sold; and (<i>r</i>) in cases where no
					 royalty was required, what was the reason for the absence of a requirement to
					 collect a royalty?</p><b>Mr. Georges Farrah (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.)</b>: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)	Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) does not collect this particular statistical information on the food, social and ceremonial fisheries. Fish stored in freezers are stored in the name of a company or individual and not by fishery or species.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)	As per the answer to a) above, DFO does not collect this type of data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)	As per the answer to a) above, DFO does not collect this type of data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)	As per the answer to a) above, DFO does not collect this type of data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e)	In the early years of the Aboriginal Fisheries Strategy (AFS) program (1992-1997), two AFS agreements on the Fraser River, the Musqueam/Tsawwassen First Nations joint agreement and the Sto:Lo First Nation agreement, required a percentage of the landed value of salmon harvested under the pilot sales fisheries and then sold to be returned to the fisheries management program of the aboriginal organizations. Pursuant to the AFS agreement, from 1993 to the present on the Skeena River, 10% of the landed value of salmon harvested under the pilot sales fisheries and then sold under the AFS agreement is required to be returned to the Skeena fisheries management program during years when there is an excess salmon to spawning requirements (ESSR) fishery in place. No funds were required to be returned to DFO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f)	DFO cannot determine the value of fish sold under the pilot sales fisheries.  DFO does not record the portion of pilot sales fisheries that is retained for food as compared to the amounts sold.  With respect to the ESSR fishery on the Skeena River, due to concerns from the Skeena first nation regarding commercial confidentiality, available information regarding commercial catches and values for individual bands and companies has not been provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g)	According to the AFS agreements noted in the answer to e), the percentage of the landed value of salmon harvested under the pilot sales fisheries and then sold, which was to be returned to the fisheries management program of the aboriginal organization, varied between 5% and 15% on the Fraser River; and 10% of the landed value of salmon harvested and then sold for the Skeena ESSR fisheries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h)	The aboriginal organizations reported the following amounts collected under each of the agreements, which was to be returned to their fisheries management programs. (The requirement for a percentage of the landed value of fish sold under the AFS agreement to be returned to the fisheries management program of the aboriginal organization was not applied to fish caught for food, social and ceremonial purposes.) In 1992, the Musqueam and Tsawwassen first nations reported $4,996 was returned to their fisheries management program.  In 1993, the Musqueam first nation reported $11,891 and the Sto:Lo first nation reported $25,457 (which was a payment instead of returning a percentage of the landed value of salmon sold under their AFS agreement to their fisheries management program).  In 1994, the Sto:Lo indicated that $178,036 from a one-time only specific fishery was returned to their fisheries management program.  In 1995, the Musqueam first nation reported that $48,373 was returned to their fisheries program.  The Sto:Lo first nation did not have a pilot sales fishery in 1995.  In 1996, the Musqueam first nation reported that $60,550 was returned to their fisheries management program, while the Sto:Lo first nation again did not have a pilot sales fishery.  In 1997 the Sto:Lo reported that $67,053 was returned to their fisheries management program.  With respect to the Skeena ESSR fishery, DFO has not collected this data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i)	On the Fraser River, the buyers of the fish withheld from the fishers the percentage of the landed value of fish sold under the AFS agreement that was required to be returned to the fisheries management program.  Individual first nations or first nations’ groups collected the proceeds on the Skeena ESSR fishery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j)	On the Fraser River, the buyers of the fish withheld proceeds of the fish from the distribution of the sales and then provided them to the respective first nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;k)	In 1994, a specific fishery was provided to the Sto:Lo first nation as noted in the answer to h) above.  There have been no special fisheries provided for the Skeena ESSR Fisheries for which the percentage of the landed value of fish sold under the AFS agreement was to be returned to the fisheries management program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;l)	Revenues from the proceeds were to be used for the fisheries management programs of the aboriginal organizations in question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m)	The first nations in receipt of the proceeds spent the monies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n)	There were three reported instances concerning the Sto:Lo first nation where the percentage collected was less than the amount required under the agreement: in 1994, where DFO determined there were inconsistencies in some of the reporting of the fisheries; in 1995, when the salmon runs were poor; and, in 1996, when the pilot sales fisheries were severely hampered by protest fisheries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o)	In the case of the Sto:Lo first nation, with respect to the specific fishery in 1994, DFO contracted KPMG to undertake an audit because of inconsistencies in some of the reporting of the fisheries. As a result, the amount reported by Sto:Lo from this fishery as well as the amount of the shortfall, was deducted from the total DFO financial commitment to the group under their 1994 AFS agreement.  In 1995, DFO was satisfied that poor salmon runs prevented the Sto:Lo from harvesting the amount set out in their agreements.  In 1996, DFO was satisfied that the Sto:Lo first nation made every reasonable attempt to harvest their quota but were unsuccessful, and, therefore, DFO did not require Sto:Lo to collect the proceeds which were to be used for the fisheries management programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p)	With respect to the years 1994, 1995 and 1996, see the answer to o) above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q)	Where there was no requirement for a percentage of the landed value of fish sold under the AFS agreement to be returned to the fisheries management program of the aboriginal organization, DFO did not collect this data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r)	The main reason for the non-requirement was the fact that the run size did not support a pilot sales fishery and thus no fishing occurred.</p>
<center><b>Question No. 128--</b></center><b>Mr. Loyola Hearn</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the seniority of personnel figure in the processes the Department of Fisheries and Oceans use to engage or release employees of the Canadian Coast Guard?</p><b>Mr. Georges Farrah (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.)</b>: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seniority of personnel does not figure into the processes the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) uses to engage employees of the Canadian Coast Guard.  DFO along with all other federal government departments, is governed by the principle of merit as outlined in the Public Service Employment Act (section 10), which reads as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. (1) Appointments to or from within the Public Service shall be based on selection according to merit, as determined by the Commission, and shall be made by the Commission, at the request of the deputy head concerned, by competition or by such other process of personnel selection designed to establish the merit of candidates as the Commission considers is in the best interests of the Public Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), selection according to merit may, in the circumstances prescribed by the regulations of the Commission, be based on the competence of a person being considered for appointment as measured by such standard of competence as the Commission may establish, rather than as measured against the competence of other persons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For releases, reverse order of merit is applied, as outlined in the Public Service Employment Regulations (subsection 32 (1)), which reads as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32. (1) If the services of one or more employees of a part of an organization are no longer required in accordance with section 29 of the Act, the appropriate deputy head shall assess the merit of the employees employed in similar positions in the same occupational group and level within that part of the organization, and identify the employees who may be declared surplus and laid off in reverse order of merit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority could only figure into the process to release employees, in the event of a tie between individuals being assessed in the reverse order of merit.

<center><b>Question No. 164--</b></center><b>Mr. Rob Merrifield</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Minister of Health’s oversight of
					 tissue banks: (<i>a</i>) when did Health Canada first become aware of potential

					 and (<i>i</i>) what actions is Health Canada taking to ensure that problems
					 such as those incurred at the British Columbia Ear Bank do not occur
					 again?</p><b>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Health, Lib.)</b>: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is as follows:

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)	On October 9, 2002, Health Canada received information that the Vancouver St. Paul's Hospital B.C. Ear Bank, under the responsibility of Providence Health Care, may have been processing and distributing tissues which do not meet basic safety requirements. Providence Health Care is a legal entity providing health care services on eight sites in Vancouver, B.C.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)	A question period note was provided to the minister’s office on December 17, 2002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)	Under its authority, Health Canada asked St. Paul's Hospital to recall the products and to notify the physicians who have used tissues from the Ear Bank in transplantation.  St. Paul's Hospital complied.  On February 19, 2003, Health Canada notified acute care hospitals, tissue banks and health professionals across the country of the situation in the B.C. Ear Bank and has recommended that recipients of tissue from the bank be tested for infectious diseases, as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)	  On October 9, 2002, Health Canada received information that the Ear Bank may have been processing and distributing tissues which do not meet basic safety requirements, and that the distribution of tissues had been discontinued.  Within 24 hours, Health Canada acted on the information received and subsequently initiated an investigation.  As part of its investigation, Health Canada obtained from the Ear Bank information on their processing and distribution activities.  Due to poor record-keeping, Providence Health Care provided most of the requested information in January 2003.  Based on this information, Health Canada immediately undertook a risk assessment.  This Health Canada risk assessment was completed on February 5, 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 7, 2003, based on its risk assessment, Health Canada asked St. Paul's Hospital to mitigate the risk that may be posed by the tissues by recalling the unused tissues and notifying the physicians who have used tissue from the Ear Bank in transplantation.  On February 14, 2003, St. Paul's Hospital complied.  On February 19, 2003, Health Canada advised all establishments and individuals in Canada handling and/or processing human cells, tissues and organs for transplantation.  Health Canada’s investigation is still on-going at St. Paul’s Hospital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e)	 Moreover, Health Canada has published three additional documents respecting tissue and organ safety:  Guidelines for Organ and Tissue Donation Services in Hospitals; Guideline for the Prevention of HIV infection in Organ and Tissue Transplantation; and Guidelines for Basic Safety Requirements for Human Cells, Tissues and Organs for Transplantation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Canada also developed and published the standard Technical Requirements for Therapeutic Donor Insemination, which is required, by regulation, to be followed by processors of donor semen for assisted conception.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently many sets of standards available to tissue banks in Canada.  The American Association of Tissue Banks Standards for Tissue Banking, the Eye Bank Association of America Standards and the Foundation for the Accreditation of Hematopoietic Cell Therapies Standards provide comprehensive information on safety requirements for specific tissue types and are used internationally.  These three organizations also provide accreditation services at the international level.  Many tissue banks in Canada are accredited by one of these organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 28 and 29, 2003, Health Canada issued a directive entitled Technical Requirements to address the Safety of Cells, Tissues and Organs for Transplantation (directive and guidance Document) and its corresponding guidance document entitled Basic Safety Requirements for Human Cells, Tissues and Organs for Transplantation to establishments and individuals in Canada who are involved in the handling and/or processing of human cells, tissues and organs for transplantation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the directive and guidance document is to advise these establishments and individuals of the importance of adhering to basic standards of safety with respect to the manufacture and use of these products for transplantation.  These documents are based on the content of the National Safety Standards being developed by the Canadian Standards Association in consultation with medical experts from the field of transplantation and Health Canada.  These are minimum standards that should be met by all establishments and individuals in Canada who are involved in the handling and/or processing of human cells, tissues and organs for transplantation in order to minimize the risk of disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f)	 Safety standards for Canada are available and have been communicated to stakeholders.  In 1996, Health Canada appointed and funded a working group of experts in the field of tissue and organ transplantation to develop a set of standards for the safety of tissues and organs which would encompass all of the requirements of the documents referenced above and address any additional Canadian specific requirements.  A General Standard on the Safety of Cells, Tissues and Organs, and five separate standards for specific tissue types were completed by this group of experts in 2001.  Health Canada subsequently funded the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) to transform these six sets of standards into National Standards as recognized by the Standards Council of Canada.  CSA has completed these standards in December 2002, and it is expected that the national standards will be published in the spring of 2003.  These national standards will be maintained by the CSA under the terms of an agreement with Health Canada, to reflect new technological or safety issues which may arise in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g)	There was no prior Health Canada inspection of the B.C. Ear Bank.  It is important to note that in Canada, the primary responsibility related to product safety lies with the manufacturer which is in this case, the tissue bank/hospital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Canada has an important role in protecting the health and safety of Canadians; however, it is but one component of a complex system of health protection, which includes, among others, various levels of government, government agencies, the health care and medical professions, the academic and health sciences research and development communities, manufacturers and importers, patient groups, and individual Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Health Canada identifies or is notified of a potential problem, Health Canada will take steps to determine whether non-compliance has occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h)	Health Canada is conducting a national review of all establishments handling and/or processing human cells, tissues and organs for transplantation with the objective of assessing adherence to basic safety standards and to take appropriate action to prohibit the distribution of unsafe products.  Health Canada will initiate investigations upon receipt of information of situations where cells, tissues, and organs may not have been handled and/or processed in accordance to basic safety standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, problems may be identified by consumer complaints, industry complaints, referrals from other provincial and federal regulatory agencies, international partners or Health Canada's compliance monitoring program.  Investigations may also be triggered by the identification of problems via other Health Canada organisational units and various post-market surveillance programs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-28, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 18, 2003, be read the second time and referred to a committee, and of the amendment.</p><A NAME="Int-482085"></A><a HREF="#Int-482103"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC): </b>Madam Speaker, the Deputy Speaker allowed me to start my time after question period and I do appreciate that.     I  also appreciate you being in the Chair, Madam Speaker, to listen to this debate. Where else would you rather be on a Friday afternoon than sitting right here in the House debating and talking about and to a budget that was put forward by the government which seems to put as many spins as possible on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after having spent time in our ridings and time visiting the country we now  recognize full well that there is very little support for this budget and  very little that Canadians would like to say in a positive vein about the  budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will   touch on a couple of points but  I first would like to say that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance is deluding himself and  living in a bit of a dream world  when he tries to put the spin of having this budget accepted, not only the majority of priorities within the budget but the one   with respect to infrastructure. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individual himself, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, at one point in time being the president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, certainly would have been singing a different tune. He  would have been suggesting that the government has let down the municipalities and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities with  the absolute sorry contribution that it has made to the infrastructure program. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact,  yesterday  I had the opportunity of dropping into an executive meeting of the Association of Manitoba Municipalities. These are people I know and the member for Oak Ridges knows. The very first thing these local politicians, people who have the real finger on the pulse of what is going on, not only in their communities but certainly within the province of Manitoba,    asked me was,  “Is it  not a travesty that we were perceived to have been promised so much from this federal government with respect to infrastructure and we received so little?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went on to say that there was such a desperate need for infrastructure dollars that they were actually embarrassed with the inability or the lack of funding that came forward in this budget with respect to infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can also say that my leader had a meeting with the mayor of Winnipeg who sits on the big city mayors' caucus. He also echoed the comments of the AMM, where he said that they were led to believe that there would  be  sufficient help in putting the infrastructure dollars into municipalities but that again they were very disappointed. Some $15 billion is needed to put infrastructure back into place. Right now there is $3 billion that was identified over 10 years, but of that $3 billion is a special infrastructure fund, one that is called strategic, which normally, if  one were to look in a Liberal dictionary,   we would see that the special or strategic infrastructure fund usually means political pork-barrelling infrastructure funds so that they can pick and choose perhaps the ridings, perhaps the contractors or perhaps the consultants they want to use for these projects.   Unfortunately, there really is   a lack of control and  accountability on those dollars in the strategic fund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, let us  analyze this: $15 billion just from the cities themselves for infrastructure, but next year for budget year 2003-04, there is $100 million. I understand the Liberals are thinking of bumping that up. I do not know to what levels just yet but I know  there has been some talk of bumping that up. However let us assume that it will be  twice as much, and that would be about enough to do one major project of water and sewer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budgets are important and are necessary  to identify priorities. I have a soft spot in my heart for the infrastructure priorities, not only for municipalities in sewer and water, but we see it now in the issue of what is going on in Iraq. The three  major issues   facing the people of Iraq right now are water, sanitation and transportation. That is what is necessary in our own communities,   safe water, sanitation and sewage, and transportation; the roads, the bridges and the ability to move goods and services and people, not only within our communities but across the border, because that is what our economic lifeblood depends on.</p><A NAME="T1210"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1210"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1210)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government certainly does not see that as being a necessity.  What it sees as a necessity for the expenditure of these dollars are wonderful policy programs such as the gun registry which has wasted $1 billion.  The government says it has not wasted it, that it is an investment of $1 billion in a registry that certainly will not be able to provide any return on that investment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly this is one policy direction  all Canadians would like to see them stop spending the money on, yet it continues to throw the taxpayers' good, hard  cash into that black hole.  It is not prepared to put it into what I consider to be a priority, which is infrastructure, sewers, water,  bridges and the like. The government's priorities seem to be different from  our priorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In talking of infrastructure there is another area that has a soft spot in my heart. I have put forward a private member's bill to the House with respect to  a national highways program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important to understand that the federal government has abdicated its responsibility.  It takes no responsibility, no jurisdiction whatsoever of a national highways program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are  many interprovincial and interconnecting highways,  one in particular being the Trans-Canada Highway.  In my province there are no dollars, zero dollars that go from the federal government into the capital costs for rebuilding or reconstructing that highway into a twinned highway, or for that matter the operating or maintenance costs for  that highway.  Those are totally provincial dollars that go into maintaining a national infrastructure, the national highway system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if members are aware of this but there is a  wonderful  in today's newspaper.  Canada is the only country in the G-8 that does not have a national highways policy.  We are the only country in the G-8 that does not put any money back into a national highways program so that goods and services can move from point to point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is  an organization in this country called the Canadian Trucking  Alliance.  If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance wants to stick his head in the sand, I am sure he will not be happy to hear this, but the Canadian Trucking Alliance has been extremely disappointed with the lack of government direction  on  the national highways policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States has done a wonderful job.  That federal government has decided unilaterally to put dollars into that infrastructure because it is absolutely mandatory that the lifeline and the lifeblood of the federal government in the United States remain open. As a matter of fact, our truckers now are using that highway system in the United States because it is certainly far superior than what ours is here in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put forward a private member's bill  and suggested that  two cents per litre, which is half of the excise tax, be allocated to the funding of that national highways program.  It was defeated on the floor of the House because the federal government obviously does not want to see that as a priority. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government collects in excess of $4 billion in excise taxes on gasoline.  It is probably more now because the price of gasoline  has increased quite dramatically.  It also collects the GST.  However, of the excise tax of $4 billion being collected, none of it goes back into the infrastructure that it comes from.  None of it goes into the highway system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we did not have the highways, as we are seeing now  in pictures from Iraq, believe me,  goods and services would not  be moved to the necessary points.  That is what we are facing right now in Canada.  It is absolutely despicable that the  government's budget does not speak to that infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is so much more  I would like to talk about.  One point would obviously be the mismanagement by the government.  I have already mentioned in passing the $1 billion  that was spent on the gun registry which could have gone into infrastructure, health or something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also  the $1 billion  that has been wasted on the EH-101s which  the government did not purchase.  It has invested $1 billion  into helicopters, but it does not have any helicopters.  The government wasted a $1 billion  of taxpayers' money. That money  could have gone into the highway system, the health care system or the education system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is so much that we could  say is wrong with the budget.  Unfortunately, there is not enough time  to put all of what is wrong on the table.</p><A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1215)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agriculture  probably will be a mere shadow of itself after the government gets through with it. The starting point is  April 1.  The government has failed to deal with that issue.  I feel very sorry for people who are involved in that industry because there is absolutely no assistance from the government.</p><A NAME="Int-482103"></A><a HREF="#Int-482105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482085"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, I cannot believe the comments my friend in the corner has made on infrastructure. He will be sitting in the corner for a long time with the comments that he has made on infrastructure, I can assure everyone. He should be ashamed of himself for standing and criticizing the government on municipal infrastructure.  His party is the one that in 1984 when it came to power did not embrace the Federation  of Canadian Municipalities' national infrastructure program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a former president of the FCM I take great exception. He should know better, being a member of the board for so many years, in our struggles to get the Conservative Party to support infrastructure. I have a letter from the president of the FCM dated March 5 stating that the FCM has enjoyed a long and productive relation with the Government of Canada and that many specific initiatives include the national infrastructure program, working with the homeless, affordable housing, et cetera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that the relationships the government has with urban communities in this country are very strong.  We have had three national infrastructure programs.  We are about  to embark on a fourth, leveraging money with municipalities and the provinces. The member forgets the leveraging.  I should also point out the strategic infrastructure program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask him where his friends are in the province of Ontario now that the government has committed over $430 million to GTA transportation.  We are still waiting for the Conservative government in Ontario to do something to match the funds in order to meet the $1.2 billion.  Perhaps he could pick up the phone and call his good buddies in Queen's Park.  I know they are not sitting but perhaps he could find them. I would  like to know where the money is because this is an important issue.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member  cannot have it both ways.  He cannot criticize the government for not doing anything according to him, and when we are doing things not recognize the valuable contributions being made with our partners.</p><A NAME="Int-482105"></A><a HREF="#Int-482110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482103"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rick Borotsik: </b>Madam Speaker, is that not usually the way the Liberal  government operates. It does not take any of the responsibility itself but always blames someone else. By the way, that government  has been in place since 1993,  10 years ago.  The Liberals  blame someone else because they  do not want to take any of the responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really am sorry that the member, whom I have an awful lot of respect for, is starting to believe the government's own propaganda and spin.  I remember when the member  would look at everything at face value and certainly analyze it to the point where he would look for the truth.  Unfortunately, he is looking for something outside of the truth right now.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have that truth.  I have met with the people.  I have met with the real people who are being affected on the front lines of the municipalities.  I would ask the member to please talk to who used to be his friends and get their opinions on this because their opinions are not the same as the member is putting forward right now. They are ashamed of the infrastructure program that came forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member held up a letter from the FCM. Of course the FCM is going to say, “We are not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.  We will take what is given to us.  We are not going to bite the hand that is giving us this little pittance”. I should also say it is that same membership of the FCM  whom I have spoken to, the big city mayors.  They  are absolutely disgusted with the promises that were made and with what was delivered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get back to realities.  The member and I agree on one thing. Infrastructure, sewage, water, bridges and roads are absolutely vital to the continued growth and the continued economy of this country. I know he agrees with that. What he will not say publicly is that with the pittance the government has put into this priority, it  will be 100 years before the municipalities and provinces  ever get to the level they  should be at. Unfortunately, we are going to be left in the dust by our American neighbours. They  will be far ahead of us economically, head and shoulders above us in the not too distant future, if they are not already today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry that the member has not taken the time to listen to the people whom he serves and hear the real story as opposed to holding up one line of one letter and suggesting that is the fact.</p><A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-482110"></A><a HREF="#Int-482113"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, my question is simple.  Does my hon. friend believe that the municipalities ought to have long term budgetary expenditures on the part of the federal government so they will know what long term moneys they are going to receive from the federal government?  Right now they receive it on a year by year, ad hoc basis and cannot plan for the future.</p><A NAME="Int-482113"></A><a HREF="#Int-482116"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rick Borotsik: </b>Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca for that softball lob.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely, there should be a number of issues if the government was really trying to put something in place.  It should  give a long term budgetary process that  municipalities could follow.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also look at some sort of tax regime where municipalities could have  other opportunities to raise taxes other than just property taxes.  Perhaps there could be tax point sharing, where the municipalities could use the money.  Perhaps the excise tax on gasoline should go to the municipalities to assist in their--</p><A NAME="Int-482116"></A><a HREF="#Int-482117"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482113"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos): </b>I am sorry but 10 minutes does go by rather quickly.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in the House knows that our responsibility is the responsible expenditure of the people's money.  It  is not our money. It  is not the House's money. It is the people's money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I watched the budget being introduced in the House, my heart sank.  It sank because I thought that the government had an enormous opportunity to really close the gap with  our major competitor, the United States.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Bush has been spending money, I would say recklessly. The U.S.  has turned a massive surplus into a massive deficit.  The tax difference between us and the U.S.  has been wide.  Its competitiveness historically has been better.  We had a grand opportunity when we were dealing with surplus budgets to close that gap dramatically, strengthen the  Canadian dollar, improve investment into Canada and reverse the brain drain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly for all Canadians, the government chose to make the budget a political instrument.  It chose to disburse money in an unfocused, shotgun approach, doling out money without firm objectives.  That is utterly irresponsible on the part of the government.  We missed a grand opportunity to strengthen our economy and thereby strengthen our social programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal with just a few points which  I think the government could have dealt with if it had chosen to. There are four major spending priorities  the government ought to have addressed in 2003: health care, education, infrastructure and defence.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good thing  the government chose to split the CHST into two transfers. The Canadian public will know where the moneys are going from a federal perspective.  The way to get around the moneys being spent irresponsibly is for the federal government to ask the provinces what their spending priorities are and to ensure that federal expenditures are congruent with that.  In other words, the money would go to the sharp edge of patient care on the ground.    It is simply intolerable for Canadians to  have to wait a year to a year and a half for essential surgeries or   for poor or middle class Canadians to do without essential health care services, but that is what is happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On education, we cannot build a strong economy without the people of our country having the educational opportunities to be the best they can be.  It is not something that simply ends in their 20s; rather it is a process that will go on throughout most of their lives, given the changing demographics and our changing economy.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should have provided the provinces the flexibility to do that.  It has an opportunity to ensure that workers have a chance to upgrade their skills without leaving their jobs and those who need to acquire skills can do so without being hurt.  If we do not enable people to acquire the skills to be integrated members of our economy, those people will become  a drain on our social programs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People do not want that.  People want to work.  They want to use their talents to the best of their abilities.  They want to contribute to Canada, but the system we have now is so ossified it does not enable them to do that. There is a chance through  EI to provide that.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government had a chance to change taxes.  It had a chance to reduce payroll taxes and reduce personal and corporate income taxes.  Instead  it has  kept them at an unacceptably high level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government  continues to trot out the notion that Canada has a low tax rate.  Anybody who has looked at the tax rates of the OECD or our G-7 an  G-8 partners knows full well that we have the highest tax rates among the G-7 and  G-8 nations.  We are in the highest third of tax rates among the OECD nations. That affects our ability to be competitive. It affects our ability to contribute to the strong social programs that will enable us to take care of those who cannot take care of themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of infrastructure, the pathetic and small investment in infrastructure will only hurt our country. The federal government has a role  to work with the provinces to deal with the acute infrastructure needs of our nation.  Our country has at a minimum a deficit of $130 billion yet the government has put in a paltry $1.2 billion into infrastructure, something that does not even  scratch the surface.</p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder the municipalities were beside themselves, as were the provinces. The chronic deterioration of our infrastructure in terms of our transportation is something that would substantially and significantly affect our ability as a country to have a strong, dynamic and competitive economy. This can be reversed. That is a choice that the government must make. I would suggest that it work with its partners at all other levels of government to ensure it  happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a base in my riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  I can tell the House that the men and women in uniform who give their lives to protect us here at home and abroad have been doing a yeoman's job. In fact, they have been giving much more consideration to our country than the government has given to them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last 10 years the government has underfunded and disrespected our military by not giving our people the tools to do the job. As the PC member mentioned, the helicopter is but one issue. We can go through manpower, equipment and training.  Our people are wanting at every level. They have the desire and the will to do the job, but they do not have the tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Canadian public would be shocked to know that many of our service people are spending upward of 11 out of 12 months abroad, away from their families. Why? Because the government has gutted our military and our manpower is so low that it does not have the ability to put the people that we require into the field to do the job of our nation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important not only on a security level.  If we do not contribute internationally to security issues governed by the UN, NATO, and our partners, then when we come to the table in terms of our ability to negotiate on economic issues, we will be taking a back seat to those who do contribute. That is the cold, hard reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For too long we have been living off the coattails of our allies on the international security concerns that we all share. The NATO secretary general mentioned two years ago that Canada must come up to the plate and contribute. That, sad to say, has fallen on deaf ears on the part of the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been umpteen numbers of constructive suggestions from members across this nation and the military. The top levels of the military have said clearly that we should invest in our military now or we will not be able to do the job to protect Canadians here at home. It will affect us in our pocketbooks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $800 million that the government put forth is but a tiny sliver of what our military needs now.  We will need even more in the future. I would strongly impress upon the government, and especially the Prime Minister's Office where a lot of this is held up, that it listens to the cold, objective analysis of the situation and make the investment that the Canadian public wants, that our military wants, and that our partners want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can we do? Part of the responsibility of the government is to spend our money wisely. Unfortunately, it tends to have ill-conceived objectives or an absence of objectives. It does not know what it wants to do. It does not measure what it is doing. Therefore, it does not know what its  output should be. Furthermore, a lot of moneys are spent to curry favour in certain ridings to make the government look good. This is a characteristic of governments everywhere. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely the government can do a much better job of ensuring that our moneys are spent effectively. The government should identify its objectives, measure its output, and ensure that the moneys will be spent wisely, efficiently and effectively. We have not, sad to say, seen this. From the gun registry to the Groupaction debacle to the HRDC $1 billion boondoggle, sadly Canadians have seen the abysmal mismanagement of their moneys for far too long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not rocket science. The Auditor General, people in the public service, and people in the public who know how to manage money properly have given clear and constructive solutions to the government as to what our objectives ought to be to ensure that the people's money will be spent wisely and effectively. </p><A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have not been listened to.  Moneys are used to curry political gain.  The government looks to see which way the wind is shifting and moves in that direction.  It needs to show leadership and use public moneys wisely and effectively.  Only then will we build a stronger country.</p><A NAME="Int-482126"></A><a HREF="#Int-482133"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482117"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, I rise today to participate in the second reading debate of the budget implementation act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week police officers from all across the country converged on Parliament Hill to deliver this year's demands for improving the safety and security of Canadians.  They had an important list which included: better protection for children, no more club fed style prisons, a national drug strategy, pension accrual rate for public safety occupations, and funding for police services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Police Association, representing some 30,000 frontline officers, is recommending that Parliament provide increased priority funding for local, provincial, national, federal and trans-jurisdictional policing responsibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well over a year ago the Canadian Police Association appeared before the justice committee regarding the anti-terrorism legislation.  During its presentation it said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="15" align="right"></td>

</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, the government has never meaningfully addressed the Canadian Police Association's concerns.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the CPA pointed out in its fact sheet, the 2002 federal budget allotted several millions of dollars in new spending for national security. However, only $576 million spread over six years was dedicated funding allotted to the RCMP. This amounted to only $87 million per year.  Translated into human resources, it allowed for the hiring of only 446 full time employees for the RCMP, not over this year, not over next year, but over the next six years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need I remind the government that its slash and gouging of the RCMP that occurred in 1993 resulted in 2,200 positions being lost, a loss that has never been recouped despite years of protests and requests for increased spending. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the commissioner of the RCMP openly admitted that 2,000 RCMP officers were withdrawn from other enforcement duties to respond to the terrorism crisis.  These officers were taken from assignments previously considered to be priorities, such as fighting organized crime and providing frontline policing in Canadian communities.  Many of those jobs were left unattended.  In the commissioner's own words these files were “put on the back burner” while the RCMP attempted to apprehend terrorists suspected of using this country as a staging ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the CPA, of the complement of approximately 15,000 RCMP officers, 9,000 were assigned to municipal and provincial contracting responsibilities.  Of the remaining 6,000, 2,000 or one-third of them were taken from other law enforcement responsibilities and reassigned to the terrorism file.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimally, 2,000 additional officers are needed to service the deficiencies that are being felt the hardest at the community level. The RCMP provides federal policing to all Canadians as well as services under contracts to all provinces, except Ontario and Quebec, the three territories, 200 municipalities, and more than 190 first nations communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I met with the mayor and town manager of Three Hills which is one of the larger towns in my riding of Crowfoot. Mayor Bauman raised concerns about the national resource methodology used to determine RCMP allocations within small communities and the fact that the municipality had no input in terms of how the contracts were drawn up. At our meeting, the mayor informed me that the town was faced with 20% to 25% of its budget being allocated toward policing, an expenditure that this small rural town could ill afford given all the other demands on its financial resources. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the RCMP stationed right in Three Hills was used by neighbouring municipalities who did not contribute financially for this essential service.  More and more, Mayor Bauman explained that  the services of the police officers were being stretched routinely and there was not a police presence in the community.</p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I took the mayor's concerns to the Solicitor General of Canada, she took them to Alberta Solicitor General Heather Forsyth. At issue was the provincial rule that communities of less than 2,500 have police costs fully covered by the provincial and federal governments, while communities such as Three Hills, with a population greater than 2,500, would pick up the entire tab. Mayor Bauman, saying she is only looking for equity across the province, is threatening to refuse paying for the RCMP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another town in my riding, Drumheller, has expressed similar frustrations regarding the cost of policing. Last December, I attended a council meeting of the town of Drumheller and although it expressed a number of concerns, the most notable was the lack of RCMP resources. Although RCMP policing is primarily a provincial issue inasmuch as Alberta municipalities contract directly with the provinces for police services, I took the Drumheller concern to the Solicitor General. I did so because Drumheller is in a unique situation in that the RCMP is utilized to investigate disturbances and escapes from the Drumheller prison, which is a federal institution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, a riot and murder investigation at the Drumheller prison cost $40,513 in overtime costs, of which $28,359 was the responsibility of the town of Drumheller. As a result of the related trials, the town also incurred significant costs in terms of the overtime and the burden of police services while officers were called to testify. At one time the town of Drumheller had an officer solely dedicated to federal issues such as the Drumheller Institution.  However, that position was eliminated and it is now the responsibility of the town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, the average caseload for police officers in Canada was 42.1 Criminal Code incidents per officer. In Drumheller, the average was 97 incidents per officer. This number is significant in that Criminal Code offences in Drumheller had dropped 24% from 1999 to 2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite obviously, the workload of the RCMP officers stationed in Drumheller is unacceptable. It puts a tremendous strain on police officers who are there, a strain that could jeopardize their ability to effectively do their jobs. Therefore, on behalf of the town of Drumheller, I have requested a review of this matter by the Solicitor General with an end to receiving a dedicated RCMP officer employed and paid for directly by Correctional Service Canada, and deployed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated at the onset of this debate, the RCMP was basically gutted in the early 1990s as the government introduced a program of restraint. This resulted in the loss of 2,200 RCMP positions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just over two years ago, in the wake of 9/11, I wrote the attorneys general and solicitors general of each province to inquire how, if indeed at all, community policing had been affected in their respective jurisdictions. In response, the Alberta solicitor general wrote back explaining:</p>
<p>

<td width="15" align="right"></td>

</tr>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I implore the government to finally do as the Canadian Police Association has asked and that is to provide adequate priority funding for the sake of the children, and for the sake of the nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I wish to express the sentiments of Toronto Police Chief Fantino who said he was:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

I could have started this budget critique by talking about how the Minister of Finance has quite deliberately underestimated, once again, the federal surplus for this fiscal year and next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the new Minister of Finance has done exactly the same thing as his predecessor. In fact, he has resorted to the same trickery in underestimating the surplus. Therefore, to a certain extent, he has distorted the democratic debate we should be having here. We do not have a true picture of public finances. How can we judge the relevance and value of government measures, without knowing the real range of possibilities available to this government to benefit the public and serve the public interest?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could also have talked about those left out of  this budget. The most important such group are the self-employed, who are still unable to take advantage of employment insurance. There are also the workers who have suffered from the softwood lumber crisis. And yet, the other side of the House had proposed implementing measures to at least partially bandage their wounds  following the Americans' refusal to budge for the past few years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could have also mentioned the first nations peoples, who were totally left out. It sounds good to mention them in the throne speech. Aboriginals and their problems have been mentioned in at least three consecutive throne speeches. Each one calls for new arrangements to be negotiated with each nation. But when the time comes to take concrete action, nothing really substantial is offered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, instead, to talk about a new measure found in this budget which no one has said very much about. From the outside, it might seem very positive, but when one scratches the surface, the reality is rather Kafkaesque. It is in true  Kafkaesque tradition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am referring to the new employment insurance benefit for compassionate care leave. We have been talking about it for a long time. Even the last Speech from the Throne said that people who decide to stop working for a short period of time to take care of a sick loved one, deserve the chance to do so without penalty.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last Speech from the Throne gave the example of a mother who has to take care of her sick child. It said that the federal government was prepared to take measures to allow her to provide care without penalty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget includes an initiative  that is quite peculiar when examined more closely, and could lead to very dehumanizing, inhumane and cynical situations. On close examination, it does not measure up to be a good program. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, we are told that this compassionate leave initiative will come into effect in January 2004. That is one year from now, which is too late; it is too far away. They also say  that a parent will have a maximum of six weeks to take care of a sick child, but are quick to add there will be a two-week waiting period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, the parent who takes care of a sick child will be entitled to four weeks of benefits. Why is there a penalty? This is beyond comprehension. In the beginning, when you decide to stop working because your child is seriously ill, you should not be penalized for two weeks. Above all, it should not be set out in writing that there is a two-week waiting period. It is an utterly cynical initiative. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition—and this is where cynicism is added to sarcasm and insult to injury—we are told that the program is for a parent, a child, or a spouse who will very likely die in the next six months. This is the condition that must be met. In other words, Human Resources Development Canada will require proof that the child you are taking care of will die in six months in order  for you to receive net compensation of four weeks of employment insurance, because there is already a two week penalty.</p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have questioned the value of such a measure.  I wondered about the current procedure. The Employment Insurance Act contains a provision allowing a parent to stop work in order to care for a child.  For a number of years now, over-zealous departmental employees have felt this provision entitling people to care for a sick family member was at odds with the one requiring them to be available for work.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had recent examples of this in my riding, which have resulted in unbelievable exclusions.  For instance, there is the case of the mother of a child with a brain tumour.  The child had been ill for a year, but the doctors could not find the cause. The mother herself fell ill from the stress of not knowing.  She applied for employment insurance, and normally would have been entitled to it under the current provisions.  She had to take her case to the board of referees.  The three members were unanimously in favour of her claim, saying she was entitled to benefits to care for her sick child, having fallen ill herself from the stress and worry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Resources Development administration at Saint-Hyacinthe appealed the decision of the board of referees and took it before an umpire in order to have the case reviewed.  Imagine, taking to an umpire a case that had been unanimously accepted by a board of referees concerning benefits to a mother whose child had a brain tumour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, public pressure, and the efforts by my office and by the MAC, a coalition for the unemployed, managed to get the appeal dropped.  That was fortunate.  But is this much effort necessary every time, is public pressure required just to get people to see common sense? That is the way things are at present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this being replaced?  With the program I have just referred to: six weeks, including the two week waiting period, in order to qualify for employment insurance benefits for one or the other parent to look after a seriously ill child, provided they can establish that the child will die within six months.  If a program like this is not Kafkaesque, if it is not dehumanizing, if it is not devoid of compassion, then I do not know what it is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given what has happened over the last seven years, following this government's EI reforms—and the example I just mentioned proves this—we know quite well that when it comes time to interpret the act over-zealously, and for the local Human Resources Development Canada office to  issue cold-hearted correspondence to workers, they are capable of being inhuman. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we be seeing notes like the following:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the type of correspondence we should expect? Those are indeed the eligibility requirements for EI leave to provide care for a child who is seriously ill. That is the type of correspondence that a mother who wants to care for her sick child will receive, because one of the two parents must always make that terribly difficult decision. It is either the mother or the father who will look after the child who will die within six months, but not both. That, too, is incomprehensible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a scintilla of humanity in what was presented; there is not a scrap of compassion. Imagine the surreal, Kafkaesque administrative straitjacket you find yourself in when you are in the grips of a very dramatic situation, when you are dealing with the blow of fatality, when your child is extremely sick and, on top of that, you have to establish that he or she will die in the next six months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be the kind of correspondence you receive in that type of situation:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is no way to run a program, void of any compassion, and then call it a special program that was established for compassionate reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, I ask myself how the government is running the public administration. It would have been so simple to produce a short memo to HRDC officials and tell them, “from now on, if parents are providing care for a  sick child, they will qualify for EI benefits for the maximum number of weeks” rather than coming up with a program that is as Kafkaesque as this one, which tops cynicism with sarcasm.</p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

I was not here then and I am not prepared to take issue with that statement.   However without question, it is a spending budget, much to the great disappointment of Canadians who have been hoping for a budget of restraint and tax relief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the budget did  was the opposite of what taxpayers wanted.  Instead of fiscal prudence, taxpayers got an astounding 20% increase in federal spending over the next three years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was called a legacy budget by some at the time of the tabling.  If the Prime Minister and the Liberals clustered around him consider a 20% increase in spending a legacy, perhaps Canadians should start thinking about changing this regime government into a democratic government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression “nickel and dimer” comes to mind.  It is used to describe individuals or operations which think and act small.  Another expression, “chump change”, comes to mind.  Both have application here when it comes to the Liberal government and its budget. The Liberals are nickel and dimers and dealers in chump change as far as the budget is concerned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was chump change when they set the EI premium at $1.98 in 2004.  Why wait until 2004?  Why not lower the rate by much more and do it much more quickly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will answer my own question.  The Liberals will not lower it by any more or any quicker because they want that money.  They need that money to continue funding hare-brained schemes like the gun registry, to make up for losses from GST fraud or for  new hare-brained schemes that they have yet to come up with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would never occur to a Liberal that surpluses are not for spending.  No, a Liberal believes that once a taxpayer has sent that money to Ottawa, it belongs to big daddy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side believe that surpluses belong to the people and that the people deserve some of their money back.  We know as well that Canadians  will agree to some of it being used to reduce the debt.  That should not be a difficult thing for anyone to understand.  Even a Liberal should be able to grasp it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money belongs to the people who sent it here to fund the programs that they want.  Anything left over, oftentimes referred to  by the government as surplus but is in fact gouging, is not to be used to fund new programs about which the Canadian people have not been consulted. However  the Liberals refuse to acknowledge that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberals believe in the divine right  of kings  and  little guys from Shawinigan to do whatever it is they want to do with the public purse.    They will vigorously defend the concept of the divine right to spend however much they want, whenever they want, on whatever they want, as long as it reaps them votes at election time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Canadians want, on top of fiscal responsibility, is creation of an economic climate in which businesses and individuals can thrive and grow and, with their success, create an even more receptive climate for others to do the same.  Tragically, the Liberals believe government is the engine of success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side, we favour deep and broad based tax relief, a stable monetary policy, funding for essential national infrastructure and stimulating medical and scientific research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over here, we lament the millions being stolen from Canadians through GST fraud.  We lament even more the attitude of the Liberals, as personified by the member for Mississauga West.  He said recently at committee on GST fraud that he actually contemplated moving that the meeting be adjourned.  Why would he do that?  Because the percentage being stolen was so insignificant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over $150 million stolen out of taxes is not insignificant to Canadians.  Only a Liberal, or perhaps a New Democrat, would consider the theft of over $150 million an insignificant matter.  Is it any wonder Canadians are in despair?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course Liberals also consider tax fairness for families to be too insignificant for consideration. We in the Alliance disagree.  We believe that it is essential that there be greater tax fairness for families and we provide that by eliminating inequities between single and dual income families.  We believe that there should be equity in choices regarding child care arrangements, including child care at home.</p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alliance believes as well that there should be integration of the tax system and social programs to better meet the needs of low income families and individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to equity and equal treatment, Liberals have a philosophy, believe it or not.  Liberals believe that every hard-working Canadian or Canadian family should be gouged to the max.  Spare the rod and spoil the taxpayer is the Liberal mantra.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question Canadians have is why the high cost of vehicle and heating fuels was not addressed in the budget.  There is something the Liberals do not want Canadians to know about and that is the huge windfall that comes from increasing crude oil and natural gas prices. If high wellhead prices continue, and there is every reason to believe that they will, the Liberals will have additional hundreds of millions of dollars to use to buy votes.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For every litre of fuel purchased, the Liberals gain millions through the GST that they once so despised.  They get it because they put the GST, the goods and services tax, on a commodity that is already taxed.  In other words, Liberals simply do not get it.  They believe in sucking every last penny they can from the pockets of hard-working Canadians.  They believe in taxing the taxes that Canadians already pay.  It is the Liberal way: take as much as one can get and do not worry if it creates hardship for lower income Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was there no consideration from either the present finance minister or his predecessor for lower income hard-working Canadians in terms of the tax on gas?  They are too busy fighting.  One prepares to be the emperor and the other is busy squandering what he believes to be the rest of his money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike those two, we in the Alliance believe that taxes imposed for a specific purpose should actually be spent on that purpose.  Is that not a funny concept?   Not surprisingly, the vast majority of Canadians believes that too.  Like the Canadian Alliance, the majority of Canadians believes that when a specific tax for a specific purpose is no longer needed, that tax should be cancelled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberals shiver in horror at that suggestion.  “Cancel a tax”, they ask in disbelief?  They say that we must be insane for wanting to cancel a tax and ask if we do not realize that it is not the Liberal way.  They say, “No, never.  We need that money.  We need that money to buy votes”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If too many Canadians complain, the Liberals have a solution.  They suggest that the complainers join a special interest group and apply for a federal grant. Canadians are ahead of the Liberals on that one.  They already have joined a special interest group, under the endangered species category.  They believe it is the only way taxpayers can seek and get protection from the Liberals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are also thinking about joining another special interest group called the tumbrel troop.  These are people who believe the tumbrels should be rolling down Wellington Street in front of Parliament, bearing as passengers those responsible for the billion dollar firearms registry scandal or the HRDC billion dollar boondoggle.  If there are some elected Liberals among the passengers on those two-wheeled wagons, Canadian taxpayers will applaud and cheer and happily do their knitting while they wait for the blade to fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough is enough.  The government does not address the needs of Canadians.  It addresses the needs of the Government of Canada.  That is not the way this is supposed to work.</p><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-482154"></A><a HREF="#Int-482164"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482151"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, I am delighted to be able to add critique to the budget that the Liberals are pushing upon us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, of course, that the legislative process, the parliamentary democratic process in the House, is severely limited.  It is very unlikely that my speech today is going to change any of the  minds of the Liberals.  I just wonder how carefully they are listening over there and whether or not my appeal to their reason is going to say, yes, we should change this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, it came to me very early in my elected career why we have had such fiscal disasters in this country.  Soon after my first election in 1990-93, I was asked by a member of  my constituency how come, with all the best economic and accounting minds in the country available to the Department of Finance, we had sunk into such an extremely low level of economic prosperity and such a huge debt. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Madam Speaker, that in 1993 it was a great issue. We had so many people who were really concerned that our annual deficits were severely hampering the ability of the government to deliver programs when one dollar out of every four was being spent just on interest.  That continues to be so, despite what the government tries to spin in our direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasize that the call for deficit reduction and elimination came from us.  As a matter of fact, if one were to check the record, one would see that when we first arrived here as Reformers in 1993 and in the next few years while the government continued to add to the debt, it regularly made all sorts of scurrilous comments to us because we had the gall to suggest that there should be balanced budgets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, having done it, the government endlessly gloats about it. I am glad for it.  I am glad that we are no longer adding to the debt of our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I am very glad and--in a way I do this often in the House--I give the government a sort of reluctant compliment for having resisted the temptation to spend it all, because that is what Liberals do.  It is just part of their nature.  I do give them reluctant congratulations for at least not being able to figure out how to spend the billions of dollars  coming their way, mostly because of the issues they were against.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will recall that in 1993, 10 years ago, the Liberals ran that election on two big issues. One was that they were going to kill the crazy free trade agreement.  Today it at bigger risk due to the Liberals right now because of their way of engineering the deteriorating relationship with the Americans.  One billion dollars a day of our economy depends on that trade.  They were against the policy in 1993, but it did work, and now it has brought such prosperity to the country that even the Liberals could not figure out how to spend the money that came our way because of it.  Yet they were against it philosophically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue they ran on in the election was the GST, saying, “We will kill it. We will nullify it.  We do not want that tax”.  Well, Madam Speaker, we still have it.  It is still there. And it is bringing in a lot of money.  In my view, it is a huge brake on our economy. I would like to see it reduced.  In fact, that is what we have been saying all along.  We would like it reduced in stages until it is zero, because it is a huge administrative nightmare for every employer in the country and for every business person. It is a drain on the economy on that account but it does bring in a lot of net revenue to the government, which has used it in order to stop borrowing. That is okay. The government is not borrowing anymore.</p><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Liberals also like to say--and  I believe the parliamentary secretary over there can hardly resist heckling and  I appreciate that he is so good at resisting--that the government has brought the debt down. The parliamentary secretary himself likes to say, “We have brought the debt down”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is curious when we look at the numbers. Despite the fact that revenues are way up, the amount by which the Liberals have reduced the debt is actually less than two of the thefts it has been involved in.  I use that word advisedly, but generally when one takes money to which one is not entitled we call it theft, so that is the word I am using.  The government took money to which it was not entitled.  It took over $40 billion from the EI fund.  That is how much it has taken out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has it reduced the debt by $40 billion? As a matter of fact, the debt increased from, as I recall, around $508 billion to $583 billion after the Liberals came to power.  They reduced the debt, all right, but not by the amounts they took from the EI fund and the  civil servants' pension fund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a little aside, if you will indulge me, Madam Speaker, I read in the paper the other day that the ex-finance minister, now seeking to become the prime minister, is divesting himself of his shares in his shipping company.  I read a little article that said before it happens he wants to get back his pension fund surplus there and have it paid to him as a cash payout.  I forget the amount.  I think it was around $80 million or something.  It is chump change for him, but for most ordinary Canadians it is an astronomical amount of money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was done to the federal civil servants while he was the finance minister.  The government unilaterally said, “We have a surplus of $30 billion there and we will just take it”. I searched in vain to see where that entered into the public accounts and how it was used to pay the debt.  There was no direct connection. Yet between the EI overpayments and the theft of the civil servants' pension surplus, we had $72 billion.  If it had all been applied to the debt, then the debt now would be close to where it was when the Liberals took office.  Instead, it is still considerably higher. I am disappointed in the budget and in the implementation act we are debating today because of the fact that there is no specific plan to reduce the debt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently read about what happens in this intergenerational transfer. It is very embarrassing to us in our generation.  Let us say that I am taking my children and grandchildren out for a picnic. We are on the way to the picnic with my son driving the car while I am in the back with the grandkids. While they are  not watching, I reach into their little lunch buckets and eat their sandwiches and take their chocolates and things like that, so that by the time we get to the picnic their baskets are empty. If I were to do that, everybody would say, “What a nasty grandfather that is. Two weeks ago he was bragging about his new grandson and now he is eating out of their lunch and leaving them nothing”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collectively, we in our generation, with the government continuing it, by having this huge debt, this is what are we doing to our children and our grandchildren: We are eating their lunch.  We are saying that we will enjoy the benefits of all these programs and we will let them pay for it for generations to come, plus interest. I think that is unconscionable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that this government, being given huge amounts of money as a surprise, could not figure out how to spend those amounts and therefore had to apply it to the debt. And now it is gloating because it reduced the debt, the debt that it had allowed to grow to such a hugely astronomical amount.</p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one thing, but for it not to have a plan to reduce and eliminate the debt is a tremendous failure on its part. It is the biggest failure because the servicing of the debt is still the biggest expenditure of our government and it is saddled onto the next generations.</p><A NAME="Int-482164"></A><a HREF="#Int-482169"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482154"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, yesterday the hon. member at around 5:25 p.m. raised a question and did not have a chance to get an answer to it in response to a statement that I made indicating that 70% of our revenues went toward paying the interest on the deficit. The reality is 30% of the revenues go toward paying the interest on the deficit. He was quite right and I wanted to tell him that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all  that, being an engineer, like all engineers around the world, I always have a tendency to go right to the point and I have done that. I wanted to just point it out for the record.</p><A NAME="Int-482169"></A><a HREF="#Int-482182"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482164"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. David Anderson (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, we are here today to discuss the budget and the implementation act regarding that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a quote from Ronald Regan that reminds me of some of the facts about budgeting and governments.  He said at one time that the government was like a baby's alimentary canal, with a happy appetite at one end and absolutely no responsibility at the other.   We see some of that in the budget we are addressing now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about some of the issues that really have not been addressed much. Those are agriculture and how it fares in the budget.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been misled once again by the government in terms of the promises it made to farmers. Over a year ago the minister had made a commitment that farmers would get some funding over the next few years toward their farm programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have watched farmers fight over the last year to get a program in place under the new agriculture policy framework, which has not worked well.  There is    very little co-operation from  any of the farm organizations.  The government has been unable to put the program together so the details are in place, and that program has to be put in place by April 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we are a week before implementation is supposed to happen and the government after 18 to 20 months of consulting and talking about the new agriculture policy framework has been unable to put a program in place that producers can agree would be of any use to them.  I may come back to that a little later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about the money which was promised specifically in the budget.  The farmers were once again given a balloon that looked like it was blown up to be quite a big thing and once we started looking at it, the balloon popped and we realized there was nothing there but more hot air. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister told us that there would be $465 million in new spending for producers. We took that at face value, went back to our offices and started to look over what he had promised farmers. It turns out that of that $465 million, $220 million is called an advance for crop insurance spending.  Over the last couple of years the crop insurance programs in a couple of the provinces have basically gone to zero or have gone into the hole because of claims. Rather than put money into that, the government has given farmers what it calls an advance. We have found out that this is not money at all; it is a loan that producers will have to pay back to the government over the next 15 years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the $465 million, the first $220 million will not even go to farmers.  The government  calls it an advance. Producers themselves and the farmers will have to pay it back.  To tell people they are getting money under those circumstances is to mislead them.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the government said that it would give $20 million to FCC.  That is not going directly to producers. It is a stand-alone institution.  It has been given to it for some specific projects and specific things that the government wants to do. Once again, that money is not available to the farmer who is sitting on his farm wondering what he will to do this spring to get a crop in the ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government also mentioned that $113 million would go to the vet colleges.  It is great that this money will go to the veterinary colleges, except this was announced six months ago.  The agriculture committee travelled last year and heard regularly and often from the veterinarian colleges that they needed some help.  They were in danger of losing their  accreditation which allowed them to credit veterinarians for international standards.  In every presentation they made, the veterinarian colleges made that same plea for money to upgrade their facilities which had been left  to deteriorate by the government for the last 10 years.  The government announced last year that it would put that $113 million into the colleges.  Then it announced it again in the budget, trying to convince people that it was new money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government also announced that there would be $100 million for the CFIA.  That was only partially true because it was spread out over two years.  I guess I am like most Canadians.  It annoys me when I hear the government is to put huge amounts of money into a project and then I find out that  it will be divided by two, three, four or five years.  All of a sudden money that it said it would put into these programs basically amounts to virtually nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As someone who is interested in agriculture and is committed to agriculture and our farmers, it is frustrating to see a government across the way either be incompetent in its programs or mislead farmers about the support it says it will give them.</p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the $460 million that has been announced, not one cent will go directly to farmers.  Basically, most of this will go toward an expanded bureaucracy.  It is hypocritical for the government to mislead farmers by pretending to give them support and money when in fact it is not doing that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk a bit about the APF and the struggle the government has had to find a successful program.  It was set up under five pillars.  Farmers do not really know what is going on with this program.  The government is coming forward now with different aspects of it.  From the beginning, it  looked like it would be a bureaucratic nightmare for farmers.  In so many of the programs over the last few years, like AIDA and CFIP, the accountants and the bureaucrats did very well.  We know for the AIDA program alone, between $150 million and $200 million worth of program money was spent on bureaucrats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the top bureaucrats told a member of the agriculture committee a month ago that we should be happy for this new program because it would  mean more jobs in Winnipeg.  The point of the program is to help farmers.  It is not a make-work project for urban areas. Once again the government has failed in its ability to come up with a program that is easy to use, that will backstop farmers and give them some success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see the government committing $100 million to environmental farm plans.  I guess I would have to ask the members around me this.  How can $100 million be spent to come up with a farm plan for farmers to use so they can explain what they are farming and whether their farms are safe and secure?  That is appalling.  It is ridiculous to think that much money can be spent on a bureaucratic device so that farmers can say what they are doing with their sprays, chemicals and gases. It is crazy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other things like renewal.  The government talks about renewal and trying to get younger farmers onto the land to renew the rural communities, but it does nothing that directly affects those communities. It has massive bureaucracies and meetings here and there with their rural secretariat and those types of things but it never comes back and touches the rural people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned the risk management part of the APF earlier.  It is extremely frustrating to have to deal with a bureaucracy that gets billions of dollars a year, but has taken two years to come up with a program that will not be ready when it needs to be.  Farmers do not know what kind of coverage they have.  They do not know what kind of triggers will be used to trigger coverage.  Farmers are expected to take between $2 billion and $3 billion out of their own pockets to get this program off the ground and make it viable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The really frustrating part about that is they have between $2 billion and $3 billion in the NISA program already. It is sitting there.  It is in a program that has worked reasonably well for farmers and the government has persistently said that one of the things it wants to do is shake that money out of the NISA accounts. It is going to do that, but then it is going to turn around and force farmers to put that money back into the new programs which the government has set up. It seems to go on and on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another frustration is this.  We were told a $45 billion EI surplus existed. It supposedly existed up until just before this budget.  Then all of a sudden we are told that it is not there.  We know someone is attempting to take the prime ministership away from our present Prime Minister.  He is the person who has been responsible over the years for building this fund, putting it in place and letting us believe that it was there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I am reminded, as I think about him, of a quote from George Bernard Shaw, which says that a government which robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul.  Unfortunately, the problem is that the one who is named Peter in this country is the taxpayer, it is not the other prime minister. The government took $45 billion from taxpayers under the guise of putting it into an EI system.  Then it turned around, applied it somewhere else and told people the money was gone; it has  completely vanished. If anyone in the House did that, I think we would find ourselves in some serious difficulty with the legal authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will close with another quote from P.J. O'Rourke, who is  a well known civil libertarian from the United States. He says that giving money and power to government is like giving whisky and car keys to teenage boys.</p><A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-482182"></A><a HREF="#Int-482183"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482169"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, I thank the Canadian Alliance speaker who raised many valid issues on behalf of prairies farmers about the situation they face and the lack of any relief or deference to their issues in the federal budget.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was my intention to ask the hon. member to expand somewhat on the NISA program and the $4 billion that he maintains  could be put to better use or put into the pockets of farmers instead of being lost to the bureaucracy. Even though I represent an area of downtown Winnipeg, I would not want to see an agricultural assistance program being used to create bureaucratic jobs or to do anything other than to provide much needed income maintenance for beleaguered prairie farmers.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciated the hon. member's comments. He was bang on. Perhaps in another speech he will be able to enlighten us more about the five pillars  he made reference to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak at some length to the last point  the Alliance member  spoke  about,  the EI program.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government is very proud of its announcement of $100 billion in tax cuts. As the member pointed out, it seems that any of the government's  good news announcements are sequenced and timed to come into play over a period of three years or five years.  The amount is not as huge an amount  of money as people might expect when spread out over that timeframe.  The erosion of that amount of money during that period of time due to inflation also has to be factored in.  That $100 billion will not really mean as much five years from now as it did when it was announced.  The government is trying to get the maximum political bang for its buck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should point out to people who are  listening today where that $100 billion  the government has put into tax cuts came from.  I can say that  $45 billion of it can be traced to the pockets of hardworking Canadians and their employers.  As people should know, the EI fund is strictly made up of contributions from employees and employers.  The federal government puts nothing into that fund. Canadians have clearly overpaid into the EI fund to the tune of $45 billion cumulatively over the last couple of years.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a surplus in the EI fund, there are two ways of looking at it.  One legitimate argument was put forward by the Alliance that premiums should be reduced.  We are paying in too much in terms of what is being paid out in benefits.  The flip side of that coin, the NDP's argument is that benefits should be increased or the eligibility requirement should be lowered so more people who pay in would be eligible. Either one of those arguments is legitimate.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is not legitimate is to use  that money for some purpose other than income maintenance for unemployed people.  I would go further and say that to deduct something from a person's paycheque for a specific purpose and then to use that money for something completely different is out and out fraud. At the very least it is a breach of trust.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trust relationship has been created with that individual.  When that individual allowed the government  to deduct money from his or her paycheque for a specific purpose, a trust relationship was formed. That person  trusted that the government would hold that money  until such time as he or she became unemployed and needed it.  To do anything else with that money is a breach of trust. To use money paid into the unemployment insurance fund to build roads, or for health care, or to give tax cuts to somebody, is a breach of the fiduciary trust entered into with the Government of Canada as employees. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot emphasize enough our continued disappointment, shock and horror at the flagrant misuse and abuse of what was supposed to be an insurance program for unemployed workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate  that there are still MPs in the House of Commons who raised that as an aspect of their comments on the budget.  To not do so would be  to resign ourselves to the fact that the Liberals have managed to get away with something again. Some of us are not prepared to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put in context the size of the surplus, I am fond of reminding people that the EI program is running a surplus of $700 million a month, not per year,  per month. Every month that ticks by, people are contributing $700 million more than is being paid out in income maintenance to unemployed workers.  Talk about a cash cow.  Talk about the gift that keeps on giving.  </p><A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government cannot believe how lucky it is. It seems to have gone under the radar on this one. Most Canadians are not upset about it. We are upset. Those of us who know about it in the House of Commons are upset. We are trying to alert Canadians to the fact that they are being gouged, but seemingly the public has not really got up in arms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unemployed people are up in arms, but unemployment is relatively low these days with 7% unemployed. That is not enough to form a mass movement of people to object to the abuse of the fund. Unfortunately when Canadians do find themselves in the unfortunate position of being unemployed, they will also learn that under the current EI rules, less than 40% of them will be eligible for any income maintenance whatsoever. The EI rules  are structured in such a way that only 40% of unemployed people qualify. What kind of insurance fund is that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What  if   people  were obliged to pay into a house insurance fund with mandatory contributions and if their house burned down, they would have a 40% chance of  collecting any benefit?</p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1330)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-482191"></A><a HREF="#Int-482192"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482184"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos): </b>It being 1:30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the consideration of private members' business as listed on today's Order Paper.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from February 10, consideration of the motion that Bill  C-314, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act, be now read the second time and referred to committee.</p><A NAME="Int-482192"></A><a HREF="#Int-482197"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482191"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ): </b>Madam Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me today to speak on Bill C-314, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act—and I am quoting from the summary of the bill—“in order to make it more difficult for adults and non-custodial parentsto abduct children by means of air transportation”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation is also aimed at reducing the incidence of child abduction and kidnapping in Canada, by requiring all adult passengers travelling with young persons to produce written proof of the consent of their parents or of other persons who have lawful custody over them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that it is a great pleasure for me to speak, but it is also a very emotional moment for me because this House will remember that on May 28, 2001, it adopted a motion that I had introduced. I am referring to Motion No. 219, which was unanimously adopted and which aimed to get the federal government to force as many countries as possible to sign and ratify the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Motion No. 219, which I sponsored, also aimed to ensure that the federal government take the necessary steps to fight against international child abduction. This was the objective of this  motion, unanimously passed on May 28, 2001. I am pleased that my hon. colleague in the House has introduced a bill to implement the object of  this motion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that this motion was initially the result of a personal matter. In fact, on Sunday, January 17, 1993, my wife's son was abducted by her ex-husband, an Egyptian-born Canadian. So, one Sunday, she learned that her ex-husband had abducted her son and left for Egypt. From that moment on, she lost all contact with them, although she had been granted legal custody of her child by Quebec courts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We knew then that legal proceedings would commence and that the necessary steps would have to be taken. However, what this case showed us is that, inevitably, the border controls were somewhat lax when a child was accompanying one parent who wanted to leave the country and travel abroad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will remember that I asked a number of questions at the time. I asked how my wife's son, Karim, who was three, could have left with his father, who does not have custody of the child, without permission from the mother, who had a custody order. What document checks were made, particularly in terms of issuing the child's passport? Another question I asked at the time was whether customs officers and airline personnel have the authority and training to prevent such a situation. We already knew that roughly 200 or more children were alleged to have been abducted in the year 2000 alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, a certain number of questions were raised at the time. We felt then—and still do—that Canada must take action, but that international action must be taken as well. That was also the finding of the report by a subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, which reached a number of conclusions in April 1998 on what action should be taken to prevent international abduction, but also abduction in Canada.  </p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, my colleagues had studied the impact of abduction on extradition, and the measures to take for passport control or in the case of  divorce and custody proceedings. Would it not make more sense when there is a custody order and a clear risk of abduction that we make it mandatory for customs officers to require documents approved by the parent who has custody, before authorizing the child to leave Canada?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also reviewed the issue of travel documents and the financial assistance we should provide parents who are victims of international abduction. This fight against international abduction, is above all a fight for the rights of the child. Many countries have signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child, but unfortunately, in practice, too few countries—even among those who have ratified the Hague Convention on the civil aspects of international abduction—agree to apply this convention. In my opinion, we must take action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thinking about  recommendation 12 the committee made in April 1998, and I quote: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Review the feasibility of creating a process for verifying documentary proof that both parents have agreed to international travel of children under 16 years of age before airline tickets are issued.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, the committee proposed document checks be carried out.  The government's response a few months later, in January 1999, was that actions should be taken.   It said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The departments taking part in the “Our Missing Children” program will be discussing the international child abduction issue with Transport Canada, and in particular the role that can be played by control and security agents at airports  in recognizing cases of child abduction and reacting appropriately. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government was therefore proposing nothing more than “working in collaboration”.  I have always called for legislation, for the necessary changes to be made to the  law. Such was the essence of my motion No. 219, which was passed in this Parliament on January 17, 2001.  Its purpose was to ensure that the necessary steps were taken against international child abduction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I hope that this House will vote in favour of this bill.  It seems fundamental to me that, if child abduction by a parent is a priority, we must be consistent and take the necessary steps, particularly since my motion was passed unanimously by this House. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot merely settle for the Hague Convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction, which came into effect on December 1, 1983 and was ratified by 54 countries.  Why not?  Because, although Canada is trying to sign bilateral agreements with certain countries, Egypt among them, we are forced to realize that these international conventions are not being applied seriously.  As a result, international abduction continues to be a scourge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still maintain that international child abduction is primarily a children's rights issue.  It is a battle to ensure that children have the right to remain with their parents,  particularly when custody has been awarded by the court.</p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore extremely pleased to support this bill.  I feel that it represents a concrete adaptation, a concrete measure, consistent with my January 17, 2001 motion against international child abduction.  </p>

<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, while I support fully the intent of the bill and its objective of trying to reduce the incidence of child abduction and kidnapping, I cannot support the proposed amendment to the Canada Transportation Act.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a far too sweeping and heavy-handed amendment that would impose onerous obligations on Canadian airline carriers and be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to effectively implement. The effect could be that anyone attempting to travel with a child, even a parent in an  intact family travelling with their own child, would be required to provide written proof of consent and prevented from getting on the plane if this is not produced.  To someone unaware of this requirement, a planned trip at Christmas with their child to visit out of town family could end up being a nightmare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bill that is trying to accomplish something that the government takes very seriously.  Unfortunately, sometimes children are taken by a parent, relative or caregiver without the consent or permission of the other parent.  This can occur in the context of a divorce or separation, for example, and may be done for a variety of reasons, including revenge or a legitimate concern about the child's safety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 annual report on Canada's missing children indicates that in 2001 there were 387 parental abductions.  In some of these cases where the children are reported missing they are only missing temporarily because a parent is late in returning the child from an access visit.  In other cases children remain missing for many years.  Although children are rarely physically harmed by their parent, there is no doubt that these actions have a detrimental effect on the well-being of the children involved and, in some cases, are extremely traumatic for the child.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is strongly committed to protecting children from all forms of abduction and kidnapping.  The “Our Missing Children” program is a key example of this commitment.  Five government departments—the RCMP, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, Citizenship and Immigration Canada, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and  Justice Canada work in  partnership to prevent adudctions, locate and recover missing children.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although each department has its own function, the “Our Missing Children” program operates as one unit.   The National Missing Children Services is Canada’s clearinghouse for reports of missing children and provides investigative services.    It is linked to all Canadian police and related agencies through the Canadian Police Information Centre,  and most foreign police agencies through Interpol.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These connections allow investigators to link and trace quickly and expeditiously the whereabouts of an abductor or missing child.  In addition, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency places border alerts and detects and recovers missing children at international airports and border crossings.  </p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program also provides a photo-aging service, as well as investigative research and ongoing development and distribution of information related to missing children for parents, children and police. It has connections with not for profit search agencies and collectively provides a unique and powerful program to prevent, locate and recover missing children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mention all this  to reinforce the point that the government is already doing many things to address the problem of child abduction and kidnapping; important things that are well planned, well coordinated and effectively assist in protecting children from abduction and kidnapping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, unfortunately, while I support fully the intent of the bill and its objectives, I cannot support the proposed amendment. One of the problems is that the provision is too vague and is directed to the airline companies that hold a licence to operate a domestic air service.  The bill does not provide any guidelines about how this should or could be done.  It does not explain what form written proof of consent should take.  It does not indicate how this provision should be practically enforced.  In fact, each licensed air carrier could implement this requirement differently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many different questions arise about the bill.  What proof of consent would be required if one parent is deceased?  What costs would be associated with implementing this requirement and who would bear those costs?  Would  there be a liability associated with not doing so?  This statutory amendment only impacts on domestic air carriers and it might not in fact even prevent a true abduction.  The abductor could simply choose a different non-Canadian airline.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable measures to protect children from abduction are already in place.  The Canadian passport system, for example, already imposes specific requirements respecting the issuing of passports for children, to respond to concerns about parental child abductions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “Our Missing Children” program that I mentioned earlier provides many examples of law enforcement measures, programs and tools that can and do work to address the problem of child abduction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our missing children program,  which  I mentioned earlier, provides many examples of law enforcement measures, programs and tools that can and do work to address the problem of child abductions.  I do not think, however, that amending the Canada Transportation Act is the right response.  I cannot support Bill C-314.</p><A NAME="Int-482208"></A><a HREF="#Int-482213"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482199"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC): </b>Madam Speaker, I echo the comments of the previous speaker.  My colleague from Gander—Grand Falls, who sits on the transport committee, has spoken previously on this proposed legislation and has indicated that, from the logistical aspect  of the airlines themselves,   he cannot  support the legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,   in saying that, I would like to thank the member for Lethbridge for  putting forward  legislation that is legitimate.  The  issue  of  abductions is a serious one,  with non-custodial parents  looking for  ways to have access to the children.  We   have heard that in a number of cases this has been achieved. Children have been abducted and taken far from their homes and their custodial parent.  We recognize that there should be, and in fact  are, certain protections, certain abilities, certain attempts to   resolve this issue and stop them at the onset.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is  our  party's opinion  and   our transportation critic's   opinion that this, unfortunately, is not the vehicle by which a lot of this will be corrected.  If anything, the enforcement of this would be almost impossible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a father I   have travelled alone with my children,  as has my wife when she was bringing them    to points where I was located.  It would be very simple for her, if she did not have the right  to have my children,   to   forge notarized documents that said  she had total custodial rights.   I suspect that would be one of the ways anyone could get around this  legislation.  If  people were doing something of that nature   they would  not be terribly honest at the best of times, so I am sure  they would try to circumvent the law and the legislation in any way, shape or form that  they could. Enforcement would almost be impossible.  Any  document provided by an individual to the airlines would have to be scrutinized, and that in itself is almost impossible.  The enforcement, the logistics would not make that possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also,   to circumvent this legislation, it would be very easy for a parent to simply go by vehicle, by rubber tire, across the border  or fly overseas or to other points on American airlines  which  would not have this type of  legislation in place.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it would be difficult to enforce  and   difficult to restrict  the  kinds of movements that the hon. member legitimately, as I said, is trying to prevent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also put a lot of the onus on the air carrier.  I read the legislation and it says “the holder of a domestic licence”.   The air carrier itself, under this legislation, would be responsible and  would have some liability attached to it.  Even though there may well be a forged document, there may  be one circumstance where in fact someone could slip through. This  legislation, in my opinion, would then  hold the domestic licence holder liable.  It is difficult enough currently, under the circumstances of the world, to operate an airline under our current regulations.  To have the airlines now anticipating these kinds of issues and   problems would be very difficult and it would be something else stacked on   to the operations of the airlines that would make it most unprofitable.</p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  will not  take a lot of time in the House on this.  I simply wanted  to be on the record of saying that  I appreciate the member's concern. I have a lot of respect for the member for Lethbridge and I do know that his heart is in the right place when he brings forward this kind of legislation. However sometimes one has to think with one's head as opposed to  one's heart and, unfortunately, the head says that the legislation is not enforceable and  not something that we can put into place and make work.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not to say that we should not put in  place other measures.  That is not to say that  the custodial enforcement procedures that we  currently have should not be enforced in another fashion. That is not to say that we condone non-custodial parents abducting their children and moving them outside of our jurisdiction. That is not the case. We have to firm up the consequence. We have to firm up on our  ability to stop that from happening in this society  but  this is not one of the tools that I and   my party believe  is available to us to stop this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the House for the opportunity to speak to this on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party. We will not be voting in favour of it when it comes forward. I look forward to helping the member perhaps draft something else that may be more workable for this circumstance.</p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-482213"></A><a HREF="#Int-482214"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482208"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, I want to begin my speech on this topic with a confession.

I hope not, but could it be that the people who are writing these speeches are somehow involved in these crimes and that is why they want to protect them?

Every time we try to do something about it what we get from the other side, and now even from the member speaking on behalf of the PCs in the corner, are all the reasons why we cannot do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just love to see that attitude changed. I would like to see the people on the government side say, yes, our children are important, as she said, and yes, we want to take measures to protect them, as she said, but then, instead of saying “we cannot do it, we cannot do it”, I would like them to say, “And we will leave no stone unturned until it is done. We will work on it to find a way that will work instead of making excuses as to why it cannot”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be rather specific here on some of the reasons given for not supporting the legislation. One of the things both speakers talked about was that it was unenforceable. That is just not true. The member from the PCs just said that someone could just get into a car and drive into the States and then go to another country. Lots of luck: Getting across the border into the United States these days is not that easy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a number of years already, people have been required, if going on an international trip by airplane or across the border into the States at the border by car, to prove that they have legal custody and that their possession, if we want to use that term, of the child is valid. That is done right now, so why is it so difficult to say that if people are boarding an airplane they will have to show some documentation to prove that they are the legal custodial parent or legally entitled to have the custody of this child?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I might get on an airplane with my little grandson. There is nothing wrong at all with me having a certificate or a letter or something that says, “Yes, grampa can take his grandson to Vancouver”. That is fine. There is nothing wrong with that. I have to do that if I want to take the kid to Seattle, so why not to Vancouver? It is not that big a deal. Instead, we get a bunch of excuses that the government will not do it. We get the same thing with the sex registry. The government says it is going to have a big sex offender registry but it is not going to put anybody on it. This is stupid. What is a computer going to do? It is a giant paperweight if it is not used for a reasonable purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We always are given all of these reasons for why we cannot implement procedures to protect our children from attack. This is doubly important nowadays because of the fact that we have such an intrusion into our lives and into our homes by things like television and the Internet, which are very, very evil, and  I am going to use that word. They are evil. We have totally lost the moral perspective on how we deal with each other with regard to sexuality and now we are getting it with children. I cannot believe it. Adults who want to have sex with children are getting onto the Internet. It is being used to lure these children. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is so easy because children are so trusting. The other day I was standing with other people milling around and suddenly I felt something on my leg. It was a little toddler, probably about two years old, who did not realize that he had grabbed my leg instead of his dad's. How trusting. Those two year old and three year old children totally trust the adults in their life. When they get to be five or six they start generating a little bit of the self-protective mechanisms, but in that interval it is our responsibility as adults and as parents and as legal custodians to protect them from people who would betray that trust. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not doing it in this country. We are not doing it with our legislation. We are not doing it and we are not serving those children and their protection when a member like the one from Lethbridge brings forward a step, just one, that is going to improve the protection of children and all we can do is stand up and say that we cannot do it. What a pathetic response. I am really totally disgusted with it.</p><A NAME="T1400"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1400"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1400)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it cannot fix everything the government will do nothing.  I admit that if this were implemented there would probably still be some abductions.  There would still be some people who would engage in forgery and other things that are illegal, but at least two things would happen.  First, it would reduce them and we would save some children. Second, there would be a serious breach against persons who broke the rules in order to abduct a child.  There would then be another thing on them and they could have the book thrown at them.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need these people in our society, the ones who would steal our children, and use and abuse them.  It is time to clamp down on them hard, not continue to say we cannot do anything, let them be and that is okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not speaking just about my own children and my precious five grandchildren.  I am speaking of millions of children in Canada who are looking to us for protection.  It is time that we give it.  If I were the Liberal government I would not wait for the next election.  I would resign.  I would say that I am so inadequate at my job that I am quitting to let someone do it who can do it.  It is time for it to happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say with respect to the Internet that, unfortunately, I am aware of at least one person who was lured by the Internet.  I wish I did not know it but I do.  The results are totally devastating to that family.  In this particular case it was not a child who was lured, it was an adult.  A mother was lured through the Internet to go and meet a guy.  What a sad thing that was.  If it can happen to an adult, one can bet it can happen to children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had better start thinking of all sorts of ways to prevent these predators from getting onto an airplane and moving that trusting child to another location, even within Canada.  These excuses we got are lame.  The procedures are already in place for international flights.  All we have to do is apply them to domestic flights.  To say it cannot be done is just the lamest of lame excuses. The fact is that it is very necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that some of the members present who have heard my speech have recoiled against it and I apologize.  I was very hard on members opposite, but I am challenging them.  I am saying to them, for the sake of our children, to vote in favour of this.  If it is not good enough let us get it into committee.  Let the committee improve it and make it better but let us do something.  Let us not just say that this is no good and we will not do it.  We will betray our children, let them down, and we will say that here is another success to put on the wall for the predators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are on the wrong side of this issue if  we say that in debate.  Yet, this is exactly what is happening.   I appeal to all the Liberal members over on the other side, about 170 of them.  They are the ones who have the numbers to control the outcome of these votes.</p><A NAME="T1405"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1405"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1405)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-482224"></A><a HREF="#Int-482225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-482215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos): </b>Is the House ready for the question?</p>
