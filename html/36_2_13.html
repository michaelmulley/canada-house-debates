</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-276, an act to amend the Competition Act, 
1998 (negative option marketing). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to give first reading this 
morning to this bill, which would amend the Competition Act to 
deal with negative option marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that this bill dovetails with a report 
released by Industry Canada under the office of consumer affairs 
which identifies this type of marketing as being the area in 
which a number of industries have targeted growth.  This is 
simply intended as a measure of consumer protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that this bill is in the same form as 
Bill C-393, which existed on the order paper at the time of 
prorogation.  I would ask, pursuant to Standing Order 86(1) and 
92(1), that it be reinstated at the same stage at which it 
existed at the time of prorogation.

is in the same form as Bill C-393 was at the time of prorogation 
of the first session of the 36th Parliament.  Accordingly, 
pursuant to Standing Order 86(1), the bill is deemed read a 
second time and referred to the Standing Committee on Industry.

citizen-initiated referenda on specific questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this bill, which would provide for the 
holding of citizen-initiated referenda on specific topics, took 
about two and a half years to prepare during the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduced it during the first session of this parliament.  It 
was drawn but made non-votable and, therefore, I refused to have 
it debated.  I have put it back into the system again to wait for 
my name to be drawn and, hopefully, next time it will be made 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is constructed from the best experiences of California, 
other United States, and New Zealand, which has a similar 
democracy as our own and allows citizen-initiated referenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this time around the committee will see fit to make it 
votable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-278, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act 
(appointment of election officers). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, one of the most distressing aspects of 
the present elections act, and frankly the new Bill C-2 which is 
presently before the House, is that most of the field officers 
for Elections Canada are political appointees of the parties.  In 
other words, it is patronage ridden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elections Canada does not even advise emerging democracies or 
third world countries to work under such a system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, when adopted, would get rid of the patronage in 
Elections Canada and allow the chief electoral officer to select 
his own staff.

(election expenses). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this bill, when adopted, would remove the 
ability of political parties and candidates to get the taxpayers 
to subsidize their election activities.  Consistent with Reform 
policy, it would remove the reimbursement provisions of the 
elections act which returns taxpayers' money to political 
candidates and parties.

Currently in our education system when a teacher wants to use a 
document to teach his or her students and they need to photocopy 
it they are in violation of the Copyright Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the objective of this bill is to declare 
that a child who has reached the age of majority is not a child 
of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act by reason 
of only being enrolled in a program of studies at the 
post-secondary school level.  Accordingly, a court would not be 
able, except for some other reason, to make a child support order 
in order to cover all or part of the child's post-secondary 
expenses if the child has reached the age of majority.

have been doing for the last few days, I am presenting yet 
another petition from people in North Vancouver and West 
Vancouver who point out to parliament that the recent arrival of 
ships bearing illegal Chinese migrants to Vancouver Island has 
underscored how illegal immigration is one of the most serious 
issues facing Canada today and that bogus refugee claimants cause 
undue hardship for honest bona fide refugees fleeing genuine 
political persecution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I would 
like to draw it to your attention that the hon. leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois will share the time allowed him with his 
colleague from Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question we are debating at 
this time is a very important one: the future of air 
transportation in Canada.  On November 8, Air Canada 
shareholders will be asked to vote on a purchase bid from Onex 
Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to properly understand the present situation fully,  we 
need to go back a number of years, to seven or eight years ago. 
The government of the day, and the one that followed it—the 
current government—told us over and over again how important it 
was to have two national air carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois indicated on numerous occasions that the 
policy being pursued by the government was doomed to failure, 
leading possibly, potentially, to bankruptcy for one, if not 
both, of the companies. 
Yet the government continued its market intervention policy, 
sinking millions of dollars into it, but was still unable to get 
one of the two carriers, Canadian, out of the mess it was in. 
It was a waste of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister we have today, he who had already done enough 
damage at National Defence, committed the same errors of 
intervention.  He committed the same error of not making a stand 
and he did not propose a solid, logical and rational framework. 
So money was wasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He promised us a business plan.  We have seen what happened. 
Only this past August did he finally say “We need only one 
carrier if we are to be competitive”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1020
<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet all those years he intervened, blocking Air Canada's access 
to routes to Air Canada when the demand was there, always in the 
name of healthy competition, which was being maintained 
artificially by the investment of millions of dollars in 
Canadian International Airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time we said the real danger was most definitely that 
American carriers would seize control of all air travel in 
Canada, for one company as much as for the other.  The outcome 
has proven us right.  American Airlines intervened in Canadian 
International, and even has a veto on major company decisions, 
thus proving that the true control of Canadian is indeed in the 
hands of American Airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had said that such a policy would be disastrous for regional 
transportation in small communities throughout Canada and 
Quebec.  Once again, we have turned out to be right.  Service is 
not, is no longer, what it was.  Prices have gone up, despite 
this supposed competition, at an alarming rate.  It costs more 
to fly from Montreal to the Magdalen Islands than it does to fly 
from Montreal to Paris.  It is downright ridiculous and it is 
hurting regional economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the need for just one national carrier was apparent if we 
looked at what other countries were doing.  There are only two 
countries without such a policy: the United States—and everyone 
will agree that the economic, geographic and demographic 
situation, especially in the United States, is very different 
from ours—and Japan, which also has a very different situation. 
In all other countries, there is a single national carrier for 
international flights because there is already competition 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional competition must be maintained, of course, perhaps by 
changing the charters of certain companies.  I am thinking of 
companies such as Royal and Air Transat, which could handle 
regional transportation and would encourage the involvement of 
small companies providing entirely satisfactory regional 
service. I am thinking of Air Montréal, which is now offering 
fares from the Magdalen Islands to Montreal at half the cost of 
the major carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But now the minister is changing his tune.  He is telling us 
that we must follow market rules.  He now worships market rules, 
and we have seen some divine interventions.  The hand of God has 
taken on a Liberal form, and we have a Liberal puppet being 
operated by a corporation, which just happens to be contributing 
heavily to the Liberal Party. 
Here, we see the Liberal hand at work, and instead of talking about 
market rules, they should talk about speculators' rules, because 
this is what it is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people do not care about the quality of transportation, 
about American control, about the importance and the development 
of regional economies. They are only interested in their stocks, 
they want what will bring them the highest return after the 
minister's divine intervention. This minister now wants to 
change the rules in mid-game. We were told yesterday that there 
are rules. A minister is responsible for rules. But this 
minister, through meetings with Onex attended by himself or his 
subordinates, is suggesting that the rules might be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as if a referee in a hockey game were to change the size 
of the nets to accommodate the team he favours. We see it this 
morning—the editorial cartoons in the newspapers are very 
eloquent—this is not a minister, it is a corporation's puppet. He 
makes astounding leaps of logic when he tells us about what will 
come after the shareholders' decision—and let us not forget that 
the current offer made by Onex involves two corporations with 
more than the 10% limit, namely American Airlines with 14.99% 
and Onex with 31%. People will vote on that proposal even if the 
rules provide a 10% limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the minister asks us to think about the need to change the 
rules. 
Logic—I would say honesty—dictates that we debate the rules, 
we establish the rules before the game beings, so that 
subsequently all of the players may be on the same footing, 
instead of telling them “Begin the game, my friends, and if 
things do not go well for you, I will change the rules along the 
way”.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what the minister is doing at the moment.  The 
scenario was written ahead of time.  The government had 
discussions with Onex; it intimated that they could go ahead and 
make their bid, since it would change the rules to please them. 
The minister can then play hero here, saying that 31% is far too 
much and perhaps it should be 15% or 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Onex will then say that the minister has the public interest at 
heart, an interest that, more often than not, is confirmed at 
benefit suppers. The rules are being bent, so the company will 
accept the minister's decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is hypocrisy at its finest, especially since, in 1981, if 
memory serves, on the rule of 10%, those opposite were opposed 
to the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec owning more than 
10% of Canadian Pacific shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument raised by Pierre Elliott Trudeau was that it was 
unconstitutional for a provincial corporation to have more than 
10% of the shares of a national corporation.  The same thing is 
happening today, and what would have been unconstitutional for a 
province is apparently no longer so for a private individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, other companies like Petro Canada and Via Rail have 
such rules. 
Last year, during the debate on the banks, this same government 
said “Do not touch the 10% clause, it is in the public 
interest”.  And what about the public interest today?  What is 
parliament's role?  Is this a “cronies' republic” or are we 
under the control of the people's elected representatives? There 
is democratic icing over a layer of nepotism in this matter. 
That is what the minister is doing now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are proposing the rule of 10% be maintained.  We 
can debate it later on.  And, if the rules have changed, there 
may be other offers, but changing the rules in mid-game is 
unacceptable.  This is giving preference to one offer over the 
other, whereas one is legal and the other is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to speak on this very important motion brought 
forward by the Bloc Quebecois, to the effect that this House 
reaffirms its desire to maintain the provisions of section 
6.1(<I>a</I>) of the Air Canada Public Participation Act limiting 
ownership of the capital stock of Air Canada by any person or 
group to 10% of the voting shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know and as, in my opinion, the leader of my party 
explained in great detail earlier, it is up to us, the 
parliamentarians directly elected by the people, to those who 
received a mandate from the citizens of Quebec and of Canada, to 
shed light on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is up to us to shed light on this issue, as the 
transport minister himself has deliberately kept us in the dark, 
especially since August 13, when he announced, with his 
colleague, the Minister of Industry, by his side, that he was 
suspending section 47 of the Transportation Act, hence keeping 
the Competition Bureau out of the picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk about democracy. I think it has to be pointed out that, 
with this decision, the federal government put the review and 
consumer protection roles of the Competition Bureau on hold for 
90 days. 
Instead of that, the situation has become extremely confusing 
for the ordinary person because of this suspension.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, we heard about certain memos in a question addressed 
to the minister in the House. We heard particularly about a memo 
from Onex management to the company's directors dated August 11, 
two days before application of section 47 was suspended. I will 
not read that memo, but it said basically that the company had 
to get a clear commitment from the government before going any 
further with its plans, particularly with regard to various 
administrative constraints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A close look at the minister's presentation before the Standing 
Committee on Transportation, on Tuesday, and a close look at 
this memo helps us understand. I will say a few words about the 
minister's presentation, where he talked about encouraging 
competition. Basically, nobody is against good principles such 
as encouraging competition, nobody is against sainthood. 
However, people do not always behave on this earth in a way that 
will lead them to sainthood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, through the Minister of Transport, tells us it 
wants to encourage competition as much as possible. “As much as 
possible” is pretty vague. In the end, the government may say it 
was not possible to do more than it did and we will just have to 
be satisfied with that. It also said it will take legislative 
and regulatory measures to this end. 
Then it goes on to say “The Competition Bureau will undertake a 
thorough examination of any proposal in terms of competition”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which means what?  This suggests—and we will see the relevant 
legislation and regulations—that the government may be tempted to 
reduce the Competition Bureau to a mere advisory role, a simple 
role of offering an opinion, rather like some others, for 
example the ethics adviser.  Everyone is familiar with the 
ethics adviser. When we did things up, the answer we get is “Oh 
yes, we have checked it out with the ethics adviser”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By seeking extraordinary powers, the minister wants to downplay 
the role of the Competition Bureau, which has already proven 
itself in connection with certain decisions the government 
wanted to take. 
Let us not forget that the Bureau blocked Ultramar's planned 
acquisition of Petro Canada.  It was blocked because we had a 
competition watchdog that said “The interests of Canadian 
consumers might be affected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, a most interesting letter by former minister Marc 
Lalonde was printed in <I>Le Devoir</I>. I need not tell you, Mr. 
Speaker, given your years of experience in this House, that Mr. 
Lalonde does not have the reputation of being a sovereignist, or 
a supporter of the Bloc Quebecois or the Parti Quebecois.  Marc 
Lalonde is a former Liberal minister.  The title he gave to his 
article in <I>Le Devoir</I>, which has a reputation as a most serious 
newspaper, was the following “The 10% rule: in the public 
interest”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the Minister of Transport, yesterday, tried to 
downplay Mr. Lalonde's intervention in the debate by commenting 
“Yes, but he is the counsel for Air Canada”. Nonetheless, Mr. 
Lalonde has considerable parliamentary experience and can see 
very clearly that there are two bids before the Air Canada 
shareholders, one from Onex and the other from Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important to clarify at this point that the Air 
Canada offer complies fully with current legislation and 
regulations. The Air Canada offer calls for no changes to the 
level of foreign investment, the 25% rule, or to the 10% limit 
on individual ownership of Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, there is the Onex bid, which would require 
both the 25% and the 10% rules to be raised.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Onex's offer, which is now on the table, American 
Airlines' share of Air Canada would increase from 10% to 14.9%. 
I would like the members of this House and those listening at 
home to remember this figure of 14.9%.  This is no coincidence, 
and perhaps the Liberal majority on the Standing Committee on 
Transport would be seriously tempted to come and call for 15%, 
since this has been allowed elsewhere, such as in the case of 
CN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another feature of the Onex—American Airlines proposal is that 
the president of Onex came right out and said that American 
Airlines would be putting up $750 million to buy Air Canada. 
The president of Onex would like us to believe that, even though 
it is offering $750 million, it will not be trying to exercise 
control and will not have a right of veto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is this:  Is American Airlines a philanthropic 
institution?  Is it a charitable institution?  Do those 
listening to us today think that a capitalist, American company 
is putting $750 million into saving Canadian Airlines for the 
sheer pleasure of it?  Is that likely?  I think the answer is 
obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one believes the minister.  He is the only one who believes 
what he is saying.  The leader of my party quite rightly 
mentioned Bill S-31.  We will be coming back to this bill again 
during this opposition day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since time is moving along quickly, I would like to point out 
that we see Liberal members from Montreal's West Island, 
particularly the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis and the hon. 
member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges, who opposed the Onex proposal and 
supported Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know why they do not come to the Standing 
Committee on Transport and say so.  This committee is sitting 
right now.  Today was our eleventh meeting since early last 
week.  Why do these members not come before the committee?  The 
simple answer is that they have been gagged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to move an amendment.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK48">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by adding after the word 
“reaffirms” the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“clearly” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The debate is now on the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate on a motion 
moved by the hon. member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion deals with one of the components of the policy 
framework on the restructuring of the airline industry in 
Canada, which I have tabled before the Standing Committee on 
Transport and the Senate Standing Committee on Transport and 
Communications two days ago. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tabling of the policy framework that I made available the 
other day marks the beginning of the second phase of the 
government's effort to ensure that any eventual restructuring of 
the Canadian airline industry takes place in an orderly matter 
and with adequate means for ensuring that the public interest is 
met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since August 13, when the governor in council put in place the 
section 47 order, both Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, and any 
interested third parties, have had the freedom to develop and 
discuss any proposal which might lead to a conditional agreement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this special process, three proposals have been advanced 
and two of them are currently on the table.  Both these proposals 
present a private sector solution to the problems facing the 
airline industry. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document I have tabled earlier this week lists a number of 
issues on which I seek the advice of my colleagues. The first 
issue is the one we are discussing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is asking the members of these committees to 
examine whether increasing the present 10% limit on Air Canada 
shares would contribute to a more vibrant Canadian 
controlled airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today is to the effect that this 10% limit 
should not be changed. 
The government has not decided yet whether it should be changed 
or not. We believe the question should be a matter for debate in 
Parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy framework which I made available this week situates 
the debate in a larger context.  I think the hon. member for 
Laurier—Sainte-Marie has forgotten that.  There is little doubt 
that we face a consolidation of the airline industry and the 
emergence of a dominant carrier, whether by means of a merger 
through common ownership or by other means.  This has given rise 
to widespread concerns regarding the lessening of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason I solicited the advice of the commissioner 
of competition on August 30.  He gave that advice this week.  I 
would publicly like to thank him again for the consideration he 
has given to our proposals and to tell him, through you, Mr. 
Speaker, that we are guided by his report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vision that we have for the airline industry as we enter the 
21st century is one that is safe and healthy, one that is owned 
and controlled by Canadians and one that serves all parts of 
Canada at fair prices and that is capable of competing with the 
biggest and best airlines in the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our vision for the next century is that of a Canadian airline 
industry that will be safe and vibrant, owned and controlled by 
Canadians, serving all parts of Canada at fair prices and able 
to compete with the biggest and the best airlines in the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In articulating this vision and delivering this vision to 
Canadians, I want to make one point absolutely concrete here 
today, and that is the safety standards of the Canadians airline 
industry, which are admired throughout the world, will not be 
compromised one inch by the proposal that we have before us. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another very important factor in this debate. 
Fundamental to the identity of Canada is its linguistic duality. 
It is a reflection of Canada's unique culture and values that 
Canadians be able to rely on the national air carrier for 
service in either official language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will ensure that the Official Languages Act 
continues to apply in the case of Air Canada or any future 
dominant carrier, and that the Act is effectively implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn to some specific elements in the policy 
framework. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy framework that I outlined clearly affirms that the 
government will ensure that the Canadian airline industry remains 
owned and controlled by Canadians.  There will be no change to 
the legislative framework in this area.  The 25% limit on foreign 
voting shares in any Canadian carrier will not be changed.  The 
requirement to be controlled in fact by Canadians will not be 
changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Transportation Agency has the statutory obligation 
to carry out an examination as to whether or not any proposal 
that comes forward does in fact meet effective Canadian control 
requirements. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy framework recognizes that Air Canada is subjected to 
another limit that only applies to that corporation, namely the 
10% limit on Air Canada's voting shares that a single 
shareholder, Canadian or non-Canadian, can own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this provision has ensured that this former crown 
corporation has been widely held, some have argued that this 
reduces shareholder influence. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said on Tuesday, the government is prepared to consider 
increasing the limit—and only to consider increasing it—to a new 
level to be decided following input from parliamentarians—after 
debate here, in this House and in the Senate, for example—if such 
a measure contributes to achieving a healthy, Canadian 
controlled airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased to take part in today's debate. However, we hope 
that the issue will be thoroughly reviewed by the committees of 
the House and the Senate in the weeks to come. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would want the debate to include the question of whether 
preserving the 10% limit is part of the consideration of the 
public interest.  One could argue that the best means of ensuring 
that the public is protected is through legislation and 
regulation, and not through the 10% rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy framework puts emphasis on addressing the issues 
which are of paramount concern to Canadians.  In addition to 
Canadian ownership and control there are competition concerns, in 
particular predatory pricing, airport access, ticket pricing, 
continuation of service to small communities, and the rights and 
concerns of employees.  All these matters must be taken into 
consideration.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I remind you that the government intends to introduce 
legislation very soon which will give it permanent authority 
over the review of any merger or acquisition affecting Air 
Canada or Canadian Airlines which is concluded from now on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This formal review process, which is being put in place because 
of the importance of the airline industry to Canadians and to 
our economy, will involve the three elements of government 
oversight which are needed to fully capture the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Bureau will review specific proposals with 
regard to competition issues; the Canadian Transportation Agency 
will review proposals to ensure air carriers remain controlled 
in fact and in law by Canadians; and the government itself will 
ensure that transportation public policy concerns are addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process puts the final decision to approve a merger or 
acquisition with the governor in council on the recommendation 
of the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a merger or acquisition is found to comply with the 
requirements to be owned and controlled by Canadians, as 
determined by the agency, the Minister of Transport will 
formulate the recommendation for approval, taking into account 
the extent to which the carrier has made undertakings to address 
the remedies negotiated with the Competition Bureau, and the 
conditions necessary to meet public policy objectives. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the cornerstones of the framework, but some work 
remains to be done before this framework can put into effect. 
That is why we have the debate in the committees.  It is going on 
right now.  It is going on in the Senate.  We want to know the 
views of parliamentarians and we want them to reflect upon the 
conditions that we will extract from any new entity to protect 
the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the leader of the New Democratic Party took issue with 
the 10% rule.  We have this today with the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois.  I want to know why they are taking sides in a 
corporate debate.  This government is not taking sides in a 
corporate debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the shareholders of public traded companies in the 
private sector to determine what is in their best economic 
interest, and then the government and parliament will determine 
if that agreement is in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will look at service to small communities.  We will look at 
pricing.  We will look at competition.  We will look at Canadian 
control.  We will look at how it affects the rights of workers, 
but I can assure the House that the government will protect the 
public interest so that all Canadians have an enviable travel 
system with strong air competition as we go into the 21st 
century.

nevertheless, it is stretching credibility to be told that the

parties are interfering.  Let him just read this morning's 
papers and look at their political cartoons, he will see how 
things really are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him whether it is not a bit illogical to 
allow this offer, this debate among shareholders, to take place 
under a certain number of rules, while telling them that they 
could be changed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not raising share prices at this time?  What if the MPs 
decided the 31% in the Onex bid was way too high, and that the 
limit would be 15%, and what if Onex could not comply with that, 
does the minister not realize share prices will drop drastically 
as a result, and people will make a quick profit?  Does he not 
realize that speculators will be able to gamble not once but 
twice, provided they get rid of their shares before such a 
decision is reached? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point, there will be a dramatic drop in share prices and 
some people will pay dearly as a result. 
Does the minister not realize that it is more logical to debate 
the 10% rule—as I am prepared to do—before the offers are made, 
not at the same time as they are being made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to ask the minister to give me an example of 
a case where such a thing has happened. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
kindly referred to cartoons.  We in public life are used to being 
the butt of criticism.  I know that the hon. leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois has had the same experience with cartoons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said for the last year that we would consider any 
regulatory or statutory change if it improves the health, 
viability and stability of the Canadian airline system.  We 
repeated that on August 13 when my colleague, the Minister of 
Industry, and I brought forward the section 47 order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon us to give every flexibility for the 
private sector to come forward with a solution.  That is what we 
are doing, but we are not pronouncing on that particular issue. 
We are saying that we will consider raising that particular 
limit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the minister about the 
changes he is anticipating to transfer the powers from some 
agencies to himself in making these decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is he not using parliament's authority for that rather than 
the minister's?  I take exception that he is leaving parliament 
and parliamentary committees out of the decision making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with great 
respect, my friend has it all wrong.  The fact is that the 
Competition Bureau will be very much involved in examining any 
merger and in negotiating with any successful applicant in the 
normal way.  The Canadian Transportation Agency will be doing its 
statutory duty in seeing whether or not any proposition meets 
Canadian control regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other issues that the agency and the bureau cannot 
deal with.  They do not have the legislative competence to deal 
with these issues.  Only parliament can deal with them.  That is 
why we are proposing, in the sanctioning of any new agreement 
with respect to a dominant carrier, to have that enshrined in 
legislation so that the protections the Canadian public want will 
be in legislation which will be debated in the House. Parliament, 
on this entire issue, will have the last word. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have two very serious questions to put 
the minister.  I appreciate his speech this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I have not heard in the discussions of the proposed 
merger is the people of Canada, through the Government of Canada, 
taking an equity position in a new airline to ensure decision 
making at the board.  Is this something the minister would be 
open to?  If not, why not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if there is a concern across the country it has to do 
with the jobs that will be lost.  What safeguards would the 
minister provide us today that those jobs will be protected to 
the extent which is humanly possible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have no 
intention of taking an equity stake in any of the airlines.  The 
government got out of the airline business in terms of ownership 
some years ago, and we do not intend to go back.  We intend to 
create the framework so that it can be a private sector solution 
which we will sanction through parliamentary measures and statute 
to ensure the public interest is maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key elements of that is to extract conditions in any 
deal that comes forward so that workers are indeed dealt with 
fairly and their rights are respected. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to shed what I would 
suggest is the light of day on the motion of the Bloc to reaffirm 
the maintenance of the 10% limit on ownership of the Air Canada 
Public Participation Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear to be a straightforward motion, but there seems 
to be a lot of emotion and intrigue behind why the Bloc would 
choose today to put the motion before the House.  I would like to 
look at some of the reasons the Bloc might have done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whether the Bloc is putting the motion 
forward because of its strict adherence to the laws of the land. 
I would assume from comments given by the Parti Quebecois justice 
minister recently that Quebec would simply ignore the supreme 
court's decision on separation if it chooses.  We know that 
separatists do not really have a lot of attachment to the laws of 
the land, so that cannot be it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if it is because they truly believe it is in the best 
interest of the Canadian travelling public.  I sincerely doubt 
that, because if the current situation were identical, with the 
exception that Air Canada was headquartered in Winnipeg, members 
can rest assured that the Bloc Quebecois would either be in 
favour of changing it or indifferent to the 10% limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real reason, I would suggest, that Bloc members are so 
concerned with this 10% ruling is that they see its removal as a 
threat to Air Canada.  If the elimination of the 10% rule would 
be acceptable, what would be next?  Would it be the clause that 
requires the headquarters of Air Canada to remain in Montreal? 
Even though the Onex proposal has ensured that the new Air Canada 
headquarters would be in Montreal, the BQ knows that it cannot 
trust what a boss who is based in Toronto has to say.  The BQ 
wants to ensure that the status quo remains with Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only with Air Canada that the BQ wants the status quo to 
remain.  The BQ makes no secret of the fact that it wants Quebec 
to separate from Canada, that it wants Canada's national airline 
to remain untouched in Montreal, but it does not want Montreal to 
remain in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about this.  Canada may have one national airline 
situated in a city that does not want to remain in our country. 
Let us think of the chaos that would be created if the Bloc got 
what it wanted and Quebec no longer was part of our country.  We 
have two national airlines today and all of a sudden we would end 
up with no national airline.  That is the ludicrousness of this 
kind of argument and this kind of emotional attachment that the 
Bloc seems to have to the 10% rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to Canadians and to the Bloc that the 10% rule 
should never have been there in the first place.  It is not the 
government's role to dictate to corporate Canada and to a 
private-public shareholding company in Canada, a domestic 
company, what limit shareholders should have.  It is not the 
government's role to put those kinds of attachments to any kind 
of arrangement.  Nor should any other control be placed there 
other than foreign ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crisis today is a drop in the bucket of what the crisis 
tomorrow will be if the Canadian government and the Parliament of 
Canada do not deal with the situation of trying to maintain the 
status quo.  The status quo will not work.  We have to look at 
options and we have to be open to look at all options.  That 
means the government has to remove those things that should not 
have been there in the first place which restrict the ability of 
the private sector to look at the options and to give different 
ways of solving the situation we find in the Canadian airline 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question, as members can tell from some of my previous 
comments, the sincerity of the Bloc Quebecois in putting the 
motion on the table today and the reasons why it feels it is 
important to restrict the choices of the House of Commons, 
parliament and the government in looking at a solution to the 
crisis in the airline industry and to moving into the 21st 
century with a positive vision of what Canada and what Canadian 
airlines can offer the international community.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that kind of narrow-minded vision that the Bloc Quebecois 
has of Canada and its role internationally and its position with 
one another and how we can work together.  That narrow-minded 
vision creates the situations we face day in and day out in the 
international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great concern that the Bloc has brought forward a motion 
of this nature now to complicate what is already a complicated 
situation.  I hope the House will determine not to support it and 
to move on with the discussions over this industry's situation. I 
hope we will look at all options and not limit it to one simply 
because of a mistake that governments in the past have made in 
trying to control private enterprise in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly as a free entrepreneur, as somebody who believes in 
the open market, I find that any control that a government places 
is not good enough. I hope in future deliberations on how we we 
will help the industry through regulations and legislative 
change, that we will not move backward to a regulatory industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
really, we have heard our fair share of contradictions from the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague said that the free market had to be considered and 
that business decisions had to be made on the basis of cost 
effectiveness.  I would remind her that, again this morning, it 
is being said that, with its financial difficulties, Canadian 
would have a hard time making it to next spring if the situation 
did not change.  For years now, the government has been trying, 
through various ploys, to help Canadian hold on, while it kept 
sinking every year.  This is the first point I want to make on 
what my Reform colleague said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is as follows.  Could she explain—because 
Reform members are not short of contradictions in their 
speeches—how it is that last 
year, in the debate on the reform of 
financial institutions and the banks in Canada, no Reform member 
on the Standing Committee on Finance opposed the retention of 
the rule on 10% of the stocks of a financial institution being 
held by one shareholder? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that, in the case of the banks and financial 
institutions, the Reform members fought with the Bloc Quebecois 
to retain the rule of 10% in order to prevent Canadian financial 
institutions from falling into the hands of Americans, among 
others, and that today it does not apply to air transportation? 
Is she picking up the failings of the Minister of Transport and 
supporting Canadian at all cost? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not trying to promote 
any airline.  The member confuses foreign investment and 10% 
rules in domestic markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree with the 25% foreign limit.  That should be open 
as well.  There are other Canadian controls in place that would 
allow it.  They have been used in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot confuse a 10% limit in a domestic investment with a 
25% limit in a foreign investment market.  The member is 
confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says that the Canadian government has tried to 
support Canadian, and I will not argue that.  But if he is trying 
to suggest that there has been a level playing field, then he is 
way out to lunch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada was a government owned airline.  Air Canada had the 
taxpayers build it tarmacs, hangars and provide it with 
equipment.  Until 1979 Air Canada controlled 75% of the 
continental traffic.  It was controlled by legislation for Air 
Canada.  It had a preferred airline status until 1979 and beyond. 
Canadian taxpayers made it possible for it to operate in a 
somewhat efficient manner and it not need government help to the 
same degree that Canadian did.

Canadian government and the Canadian economy which the Americans 
do not have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the member's comments which imply that 
Canadian is getting favoured status do not acknowledge that Air 
Canada has been a favoured airline for generations in this 
country. There never has been a level playing field.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
colleague comments on the Bloc preference for Air Canada. I do 
not think there is any question in this issue that once again we 
have drawn east-west lines within Canada.  One thing I can 
honestly say with regard to the Bloc members is that at least 
they are up front about separation and about standing up for 
Quebec. I have a really hard time listening to Reform members who 
are willing to sell out Canada at every single turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10% rule was put in place to ensure broad participation in 
Air Canada after it was taken from being a public company and 
privatized.  Even the U.S. would not go about doing the things 
which Reform suggests.  The Americans would not allow total 
takeover of their systems.  They do not allow cabotage within the 
U.S., but the Reform Party thinks it is totally okay in Canada 
and would allow the U.S. to come in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want Quebec to remain a part of Canada, but at least the Bloc 
members are up front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party has never 
excluded Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to suggest that the member is out of line in saying 
that we think the United States should come in and take over our 
airline industry.  That has never been our comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our comment is that there have been instances internationally 
which show that a foreign company can offer competition.  The 
commissioner of the Competition Bureau has offered that as a 
suggestion he felt should be considered for competition.  It was 
not the Reform Party.  Other people have looked at this and have 
put those options on the table for consideration.  We should be 
looking at all options, not looking at it from a narrow-minded 
singular position. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise on behalf of the New Democratic Party in support 
of this motion.  I hope in this debate today that we can convince 
the Liberal government to support this motion as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is not about which airline merger, if any, is the 
right thing for Canada.  It is about something much more basic 
than that.  It is about ethics in government.  It is about 
getting the government to uphold the laws of this country. In 
effect this motion is asking the Liberal government to uphold the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a law in Canada called the Air Canada Public 
Participation Act.  The law prevents any Air Canada shareholder 
from owning more than 10% of the company's stock.  It is 
perfectly reasonable to expect the government to uphold the law. 
That is what governments are supposed to do; that is their job. 
Normally we would not think we would need a motion in the House 
of Commons just to get the government to do its job, but in this 
case we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this airline crisis in Canada began, the Liberal 
government has not done its job. The airline industry is vital to 
our country.  In a country as large as Canada with a population 
spread from coast to coast to coast, a strong, healthy, 
affordable airline industry is a necessity.  It is the 
government's job to make sure the airline industry serves the 
public interest, not the shareholders alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's job to stand up for Canadians, Canadian 
communities and Canadian jobs.  The government is not doing that. 
Instead, the Liberals have been flying by the seat of their pants 
making things up as they go along.  The Liberal government's slow 
reactions have created uncertainty and made a bad situation 
worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians should be able to count on the government for one 
thing, they should be able to at least count on it to uphold the 
law.  It should be a given that everybody in Canada has to follow 
the same set of laws, the same set of rules, but the Liberal 
government has not been doing that and has not ensured that that 
is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are talking openly about changing the laws to 
accommodate their friends.  I wonder if it has something to do 
with the $74,000 which Onex gave the Liberal Party and Liberal 
candidates, including the Prime Minister, in the 1997 election. I 
wonder.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I do know is that so far Onex has not played by the same 
set of rules as everyone else.  The whole situation is 
incredible. First Onex tabled it complex takeover bid just days 
after the Liberal government conveniently suspended the 
Competition Act, removing the Competition Bureau's power to 
review a merger.  We heard the Competition Bureau yesterday 
indicate that the reason this was done was that more than likely 
it would not have met the test of the Competition Bureau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how Onex knew that the Liberal government was 
going to suspend the Competition Act.  Maybe Onex consulted a 
psychic.  More than likely Ronald Reagan's is no longer busy now, 
so it is taking up some Reform and getting into that type of 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible that this company is making a takeover bid, all 
the while assuming that the Liberal government will change the 
law for it.  Think about it.  The Onex takeover bid is 
technically illegal under the Air Canada Public Participation Act 
but Onex has just said, “That's okay.  The Liberal government 
will just change the law for us”. That is like saying we are 
going to steal something because we expect the law to change to 
make that legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have known for a long time that the Liberal government is 
under the thumb of some big businesses but this is a new low even 
for it.  I said earlier that this debate is about ethics. 
Obviously the Liberal government has none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is supposed to be a neutral arbitrator.  It is 
supposed to be the one to stand up for Canadians.  Instead it 
suspended the Competition Act to pave the way for its friends and 
campaign contributors. Now the government says it is going to 
change the law to make an illegal takeover bid legal.  It is 
completely unethical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to sound like I am being critical of Onex.  I am 
critical of the process the Liberal government has followed. 
Instead of being a neutral arbiter and putting the interests of 
Canadians first, the Liberal government has bent over backward to 
change the rules for one bid.  First it suspends the Competition 
Act and now it is threatening the 10% ownership limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are probably asking why we need the 10% ownership limit. 
Think for a minute about the name of the act we are talking 
about, the Air Canada Public Participation Act.  The two key 
words are public participation. The whole point of the 10% 
ownership is to keep any one shareholder from getting a 
stranglehold on the company.  Air Canada is supposed to be a 
public company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember that for years Air Canada was an extremely successful 
crown corporation. The taxpayers of Canada paid for Air Canada. 
It is clear now that privatizing it was a terrible mistake, a 
mistake driven by the Mulroney government ideology instead of the 
public interest.  Air Canada belonged to the people of Canada and 
it was thrown away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is throwing away the principle of public 
participation.  Public participation is basic democratic value. 
No wonder the Liberal government is trying to get rid of it. It 
is in the business of eroding our basic democratic values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Raising the ownership limit above 10% will open the door for one 
investor to get a stranglehold on the airline.  We cannot allow 
this to happen.  We cannot allow something as important as our 
national airline to fall under that kind of control.  We must 
keep the ownership of our national airline as broadly based as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, we must bring in a modern regulatory regime to 
protect the interests of Canadian communities, Canadian jobs and 
the travelling public.  Deregulation got us into this mess and 
only reregulation will get us out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 10 years of deregulation we have been left with higher 
ticket prices, lower wages and less service to remote 
communities.  It is unthinkable that we could allow deregulation 
to continue in a monopoly situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I was shocked to hear the Competition Bureau indicate 
that one of its success stories was that of Canadian Airlines 
prices and the American Airlines investment.  That was its 
success story.  Here we are today, because of the situation 
Canadian Airlines is in, and that is because competition was all 
that was looked at. There are things more important than just 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One group the Liberal government has completely ignored in the 
whole mess is the airline employees.  The transport minister's 
policy framework was vague on the issue of protecting workers. 
All it really says is that workers should be treated fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen how the government treats workers fairly in Canada. 
In spite of pay equity legislation we have had to spend 15 years 
fighting the Liberal government fighting the law on pay equity. 
That means nothing coming from the Liberal government which, as 
we have seen over the last six years, does not know the meaning 
of the word fair.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Workers in the airline industry do not trust the Liberal 
government.  They deserve concrete commitments that there will be 
no involuntary layoffs.  No worker should have to lose his or her 
job because the Liberal government has run our airline industry 
to the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again the Liberal government has put the interests 
of friends ahead of the interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have touched on many issues in my limited time here today, but 
the debate comes down to one crucial question: is the Liberal 
government going to uphold the law or not?  Is it going to do its 
job as the government?  This is the moment of truth for the 
Liberal government.  It is a chance for it to stand up and say 
“Yes, we will uphold the law.  We will stand up for Canadians. 
We are going to stop the special treatment”.  The Liberals can 
do that if they support the motion and commit not to raise the 
10% ownership limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of those moments when each and every Liberal MP is 
going to have to look in the mirror and ask themselves who they 
were elected to serve.  For the sake of the Canadian airline 
industry, I hope they make the right decision and join my fellow 
New Democratic Party MPs in supporting the motion to keep the 
public in the Air Canada Public Participation Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member for Churchill very 
carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is not of upholding the law.  It is whether 
parliament, in its wisdom, should change the law.  What we said 
the other day was that we were asking parliamentarians whether we 
should even consider changing the law.  We should put the entire 
debate in the proper context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is my hon. friend saying that all laws are immutable and should 
never be changed to reflect changing circumstances in society? Is 
she saying that we should not even consider changing the law? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out that Air Canada itself was the first to put in 
a proposal on August 22 under the auspices of section 47 of the 
Canada Transportation Act.  We then had another offer which is 
currently on the table.  This shows that the process the 
government has followed has worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not suggesting for 
a second that at any point there may not be a need to change laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think it is totally correct to say that we abide by 
the laws that are there.  If the laws change then those laws go 
into place.  In this case there is no credibility in the whole 
process that is taking place because the law that is in place is 
not being recognized by one of those offers. It is the process 
that is the problem.  It is going outside the realm of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the law should change and there is a bid that comes in to 
that effect, so be it, but that is not the case here.  There are 
too many things that are inconsistent here and leave some 
question as to whether there has been some influence that is not 
in the best public interest. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my question 
is similar to the minister's in that my understanding is that we 
have not decided to change anything yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member does not want us sitting in this place 
simply reading old laws and saying that they will do.  We will be 
changing the law in the Nass Valley for the Nisga'a people who 
have made an agreement after 20 years.  If we stay with the 
Indian Act we will not be making that change.  We will have to do 
that.  We will have to do the same thing with the airline 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is my hon. friend saying that there is not a problem with one of 
our national carriers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no question 
that there would appear to be a problem with one of the national 
carriers.  For that reason the transport committee was studying 
it prior to the June recess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated to the minister, let us be very clear, I 
recognize fully that at times laws will have to change.  It is 
not acceptable to anybody that somebody will play outside the 
rules of the law before the law is changed.  Imagine if we have 
not signed the Nisga'a treaty and we allow everything to happen 
that is in the treaty before it is passed through legislation. 
How on earth is there any credibility to the laws of Canada if we 
allow those things to take place?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to stand in support of the motion to prevent the 
government from changing the 10% Air Canada Public Participation 
Act to increase the available participation by any single entity. 
This is all being done in the middle of one of the most 
controversial issues we have going on in Canada and we should not 
be discussing this.  This should not be thrown into the middle of 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a great debate now about the future of our aviation 
industry and the process we are using is nothing short of crazy. 
This industry involves thousands of employees, dozens of 
airlines, hundreds of airports and communities.  They will all be 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though this industry has evolved over 60 years, the 
minister established the criteria on August 13 that we have 90 
days to restructure an entire industry that affects thousands of 
people and many communities in the country.  It is absolutely 
ludicrous that we could even get a handle on the situation. In 
the middle of that, he throws in a proposal to maybe change the 
10% public participation act on Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not make sense.  The process has been mismanaged from 
the beginning.  It must be ratcheted down so we can get a handle 
on this very serious issue that affects so many people, so many 
communities, so many airports and so many employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the 90-day process, the minister has been changing 
the rules.  First, he brought in section 47 which changed the 
rules completely for the first time and removed the Competition 
Bureau from the entire debate.  He then changed the rules again 
and invited the bureau to come back in, only he gave it a very 
narrow focus, not the focus it was supposed to have and not the 
ability to do the job it was legislated to do which was to 
analyze competition in the interest of consumers and businesses. 
He wanted it to just analyze the one dominant airline theory.  He 
did not give it the opportunity to look at all areas or to come 
up with other suggestions, he just focused on his one proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We missed a tremendous number of proposals and we missed all 
kinds of opportunities to hear other proposals that might be more 
effective and more practical than the two on the table now.  The 
whole thing has been mismanaged from the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We missed great opportunities when the minister confined the 
Competition Bureau to just look at his vision of the future for 
the aviation industry in Canada.  He did not tell the Competition 
Bureau that he wanted it to look at all the possible permutations 
and combinations for restructuring the aviation industry in the 
interest of consumers and business.  He took that legislated 
right away from it and instead instructed it to confine its study 
to only one dominant airline theory, and that is his theory. We 
again missed a number of opportunities there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Bureau did an incredible report but it was 
confined and restricted only to the parameters allowed by the 
minister.  If he would have opened up the parameters and allowed 
the Competition Bureau to consider all options, we would be 
looking at more options today.  If at the beginning of the 90-day 
process the minister had announced that he was going to change 
the 10% public participation act, I believe we would also be 
looking at more proposals and other options would be on the 
table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to August 13.  When the minister announced he was 
invoking section 47, we had 90 days to come up with an answer. 
On day one, if the minister had announced he was going to change 
the 10% public participation act, I believe there may have been 
other investors, other aviation companies and other proposals put 
on the table.  However, when they looked at this they said that 
because of the Government of Canada law they would not put a 
proposal on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On day 74 of 90 days, incredibly, he announced that he was going 
to change the 10% rule, or at least consider it.  That left 16 
days for a company, an investor, a group of investors or 
consortiums to come up with a package involving $6 billion.  That 
was not possible in 16 days.  They could not get the approval of 
the boards of directors.  They could not even meet their legal 
requirements.  By not announcing the 10% proposal in the 
beginning, he precluded a whole lot of options.  By announcing it 
on the 16th, he left it too late for anybody to respond to it or 
take advantage of it except for one of the applications or 
proposals that was already in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very strongly that the minister has failed to manage this 
process right from the very beginning.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition is the number one issue we hear about from consumers 
and people who have appeared before the committee that is 
reviewing the situation.  The two proposals on the table now do 
not provide the discipline supplied by competition, the 
discipline for competitive air fares, air flights and schedules. 
Neither one of these proposals provides that competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may have missed opportunities that could have supplied that 
competition.  The Competition Bureau was restricted from 
analyzing that aspect of it and looking at other options that 
might be available.  The Competition Bureau was restricted to 
only looking at the dominant carrier approach, which is the 
minister's approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another serious issue is regional service.  In the minister's 
five principles that he brought out on day 45 of the 90-day 
process, one of the principles he stated very clearly was that 
regional service must be guaranteed.  The problem is that even if 
the airlines agree to provide regional service, some of the 
airports that have recently divested under the divestiture 
program are not viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had testimony at our committee that 10 to 15 airports in 
Canada now are not making ends meet.  They are no longer viable. 
We also had testimony from the Onex-American Airlines-Canadian 
Airlines proposal to say that revenues to those very airports 
that are not viable now will be reduced.  How can we assure 
regional service if the airports cannot survive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that there is no policy on this.  There is no 
policy on anything.  We asked the minister the other day in 
committee if he had a dual airline policy.  There is no dual 
airline policy nor is there a single airline policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked about the 10% increase, although on August 13 it was 
not discussed or mentioned.  There was no policy then.  On day 74 
of the 90-day process, he came up with a proposal that maybe 
there would be a policy on the 10% increase, but again, no 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the standing committee and ad hoc committee we have had 
academics, flight attendants, airline representatives, travel 
agents and consumer groups.  Every one of them complained that 
the cart is before the horse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The academics say that any organized government would have an 
aviation policy, especially a country like Canada where aviation 
is so important.  The government should establish policy and the 
private sector should make its proposals to meet those 
parameters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the government wants the proposals first and then 
it will establish policy.  It is exactly backwards.  In my 
opinion it is complete mismanagement of a transportation system 
that is absolutely critical to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday at committee we an executive from one of the airlines. 
He commented that he could not believe that a G-7 country like 
Canada was debating a proposal that was, in effect, illegal. He 
made an excellent point.  We are debating and considering a 
proposal that breaks the Air Canada Public Participation Act.  We 
are debating this even though it is illegal.  He was perplexed by 
that, and I can only share that confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My position is that the whole process of determining the 
restructuring of the aviation industry in Canada is grossly 
mismanaged.  We are in a pressure cooker.  We have a 90-day 
window of opportunity.  We are supposed to deal with thousands of 
employees, hundreds of airports, dozens of airlines, communities 
right across the country and economic development, and we have 90 
days to do it.  A person cannot even buy a house in 90 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not sensible to address this, but we have this incredible 
pressure cooker atmosphere created by a false 90-day window of 
opportunity which we think was inappropriately instituted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are voting in favour of the motion, not because we are 
against the 10% increase but because of the way it is being 
handled.  It should not be injected into the debate when it is 
surrounded by controversy and all these peripheral effects. The 
issue should be addressed in the clear light of day.  It should 
not be addressed when it is attached to so much controversy, this 
bid and that bid, and all the accusations that are being made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supporting the motion.  I compliment the Bloc for 
bringing it to the table.  We would look at it again some time in 
the future without the pressure and without the undue influence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member for 
Cumberland—Colchester a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there not an inherent contradiction in what he just said? He 
has lamented the fact that under section 47 allegedly the 
Competition Bureau has been sidelined, yet in the next breath he 
praises the very report that we asked them to produce under the 
auspices of section 47.  That is a contradiction.  The fact is 
that the Competition Bureau is very much alive in this process, 
as I have outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the 90 days the bureau will be able to examine any 
proposal that comes forward with its full powers.  Therefore, 
there is no question of the Competition Bureau not being involved 
in this debate.  It will be doing its work and it will be doing 
that work very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, the 
Competition Bureau was sidelined from its legislative 
responsibilities by section 47.  That is what it is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the minister asked the Competition Bureau, in a strange 
way, to address a very narrow parameter of proposals.  The 
minister did not say “Competition Bureau, go find the best 
proposal for restructuring the industry that addresses 
competition for consumers and the industry”.  He did not do 
that.  He said “Just look at this one little narrow idea that I 
have.  I have a great idea, just look at it”.  It is effectively 
sidelined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we just had testimony from another airline this 
morning.  When I asked the president of the airline why section 
47 was invoked, he said “It was to circumvent the airline merger 
review process”, contrary to what the minister just said. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to verify something with my hon. colleague for 
Cumberland—Colchester.  Is it not true that right now the only 
real assurance that the government may not be able to increase 
foreign ownership to 49% of Air Canada is as long as this 10% 
rule is in place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this 10% rule should be thrown out the window, so to speak, 
then the government would have the opportunity under regulatory 
powers to increase foreign ownership and in essence turn over an 
additional percentage of Air Canada—our national airline, or at 
least it once was, which had a huge amount of taxpayers' dollars 
in it—to another company outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
her question.  The problem is, if we change the 10% rule, under 
the NAFTA agreement there is a very specific exemption to the 
regulations and it lists specifically the 10% rule for the Air 
Canada Public Participation Act.  If we change that rule it 
changes the whole agreement.  We cannot just say that we will 
take this out of the agreement and this out of the agreement; we 
would have to renegotiate the whole deal.  That could also change 
the percentage of foreign content which the hon. member has 
brought up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we break the agreement open, which this will do, then we 
break the whole agreement open and it is subject to complete 
negotiation again, and it is impossible to predict what effect 
that will have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
heard Mr. von Finckenstein yesterday at committee.  I would like 
to ask my hon. friend if he thought the Commissioner of 
Competition gave an impression of a man who had been sidelined, 
of heading an agency that had no effect and no real power.  The 
fact is that no proposal has come forward in the 90 day process 
which therefore would have bypassed the bureau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I announced the other day was the fact that the bureau will 
indeed examine any proposal that comes forward and have its full 
rights under merger review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, absolutely, Mr. von 
Finckenstein made a very impressive presentation and his report 
was excellent.  However, on the first page of his presentation 
there was a letter from him to the minister.  I do not have the 
letter here with me, but it said something like “Further to your 
instructions, I am making all my studies or my presentations on 
the assumption that there will be one dominant carrier”.  If 
that is not a restriction, there never was one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister, in his instructions, said “Do your report based 
on my criteria, to address my proposal that I like the best”. 
At best, the Competition Bureau was handcuffed and prevented from 
doing an open study.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased today to take part in the Bloc Quebecois opposition day 
devoted to the airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason my party has had to devote one of these opposition 
days to this topic is that the government has refused to hold 
its own debate.  In the case before us, the government seems to 
want to keep its actions hidden, withholding information from 
parliamentarians and not allowing all stakeholders in the 
airline industry to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 13, the federal government announced its decision to 
suspend section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act, a section 
having to do with the Competition Act, supposedly to make it 
easier to restructure the airline industry. At the time, the 
Minister of Transport said he wanted to allow the two Canadian 
companies to reach a mutually advantageous agreement.  But a few 
days later, on August 24, 1999, Onex, in partnership with 
American Airlines, made a public offer to buy Air Canada and 
Canadian International and merge them.  This is the real reason 
that the Liberal government decided to suspend the competition 
rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the government turned down a request from the Bloc 
Quebecois and other opposition parties to hold an emergency 
meeting of the Standing Committee on Transport in order to study 
the matter. 
The Liberal government also prorogued the session, delaying the 
resumption of parliament and thus sparing the government from 
having to answer questions on this subject that it would find 
very embarrassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Bloc Quebecois is today taking— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to point out that something might not have been made 
perfectly clear this morning during our party leader's first 
speech.  Throughout the day, Bloc Quebecois speakers will be 
dividing their time into ten minute periods.  I am sorry for 
interrupting the member for Jonquière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I know that members are always sorry to have 
to interrupt a colleague.  I thank the hon. member for pointing 
this out to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was saying that, today, 
the Bloc Quebecois is using one of its opposition days to speak 
of this.  Why?  Because the Bloc Quebecois is concerned first 
and foremost about public interest and the interests of Quebec 
in this matter, unlike the federal government, which appears 
concerned only about the electoral interests of its friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any restructuring, including a possible merger, should comply 
with current legislation. Recourse to section 47 and to various 
other considerations poses a great threat to the continuation of 
healthy competition in this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois considers that competition is vital, because 
air transportation is an essential public service, especially in 
remote areas.  There is no guarantee that control of air 
transportation in Canada will not fall into foreign hands. 
Finally, the Bloc Quebecois feels that American Airlines has a 
real veto on any proposal to restructure the airline industry in 
Canada, which runs contrary to the spirit of the Transport Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also oppose it because there are thousands of strategic jobs, 
including many in Quebec, that are at risk in this matter.  The 
Bloc Quebecois refuses to consider the loss of thousands of jobs 
a matter of fate and proposes that other scenarios be 
considered.  The role of a responsible government is to take all 
these elements into account in order to serve the general 
interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The offer to purchase contravenes the Air Canada Act, which 
prohibits a single shareholder or a group of shareholders from 
owning more than 10% of the voting shares of the company.  If 
the Onex/American Airlines group is making such an offer it 
means that either they are ignoring Canadian legislation or 
their friends in the government have allowed them to change the 
law to their satisfaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My interest in the air transportation issue arises from my 
awareness as the member for Jonquière of the importance of these 
changes for remote communities. 
While the merger of international routes could give us a sound 
national carrier, the merger of regional subsidiaries might 
eliminate competition in local markets, with the consequences 
this can have on prices and the quality of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The airline industry has a responsibility to serve communities 
across Canada. This merger would include regional subsidiaries, 
and the new entity would control 84% of the domestic market. 
Would this be good for remote areas and how would competition be 
affected? Even the strongest advocates of capitalism will say 
that a monopoly will almost certainly lead to higher prices, 
deficient services and a slow degeneration of the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want my region of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean to lose out 
on this merger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet it is these same company owners who want to change the rules 
who are asking the government to suspend the application of the 
Competition Act and who want to change the rules regarding 
ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I support my colleague, the member for Charlesbourg, 
and I remind the House that the Bloc Quebecois has asked the 
federal government on several occasions to pass legislation on 
political party financing similar to that which exists in 
Quebec. Until such a law is enacted, the federal government will 
continue to protect the interests of those who contribute to the 
election fund to the detriment of the general public, as seems 
to be the case in the area of air transport.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting that the member for 
Jonquière would make a comment like competition is essential. 
The very nature of the motion that the Bloc has put before the 
House today would restrict competition and would remove 
competition from the proposals of a merger.  The member suggests 
that competition is essential, when her party has brought forward 
a motion which would prevent competition.  I ask her, why the 
discrepancy? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
know whether the hon. member has understood that I was defending 
the position of the isolated regions.  As hon. members may be 
aware, in distant regions such as mine we would be penalized if 
there were only one carrier.  Healthy competition is important 
to my region.  At present, even with two companies competing, we 
have to pay very dearly for our air travel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just getting to Montreal costs an extraordinary amount.  A 
person can get from Bagotville to Florida cheaper than to 
Montreal.  I believe that we would be penalized if there were 
only one company.  I was referring to this very specific aspect. 
This does not mean I am not behind the Bloc Quebecois motion, 
but I am simply giving the point of view of a distant region. 
That is why it is important to have a debate, but there has not 
been one because the government was opposed to any true debate 
on this issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no debate at this time, and there are even government 
members who oppose this proposal by their own government who are 
not here to speak on this issue; they are not speaking out.  On 
the other hand, we, in the Bloc Quebecois, are allowed to say 
what we think and to speak on behalf of our respective 
constituents. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak this morning on an issue that seems to be 
dragging on, since we have been hearing about Air Canada and 
Onex for months now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, during the summer, we were able to follow the 
reactions of both Air Canada and Onex in the papers and in the 
news, if we followed current events. Through it all, the 
government said nothing, did not take part in the debate, except 
briefly during the month of August, when the transport and 
industry ministers, with almost unhealthy complicity, quietly 
let it be known that the competition rules were being suspended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suspension of the competition rules had the desired effect, 
helping the government's friends from Onex to submit a proposal 
with the complicity of American Air Lines, in order to get their 
hands on Canadian International Airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Bloc do during the summer? My friend, our critic 
for transport, the hon. member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, asked on a daily 
basis that the Standing Committee on Transport be convened to 
listen, comment and collect information that would be useful to 
the Minister of Transport. In my view, that is what a committee 
is supposed to do: give legal advice to the appropriate 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government refused to discuss the 
issue; it even boycotted meetings. 
Finally, the Bloc Quebecois and all opposition parties on this 
side of the House demanded that an ad hoc committee hold 
meetings.  This committee was boycotted by the members opposite 
and dismissed as illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we went ahead and sat—during the summer, during our supposed 
holidays—here in Ottawa so that we could hear what groups such as 
the Airline Pilots Association and Air Canada's machinists 
association and many others thought of Onex's bid to buy Air 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, a few days ago, the Minister of Transport simply told 
us that that was that, that everyone would have to decide, that 
it might well be necessary to change the 10% rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this is unacceptable. 
This morning, the leader of my party, the member for 
Laurier—Sainte-Marie, gave a good summary of the history of the 
10% rule, and we in the Bloc Quebecois think that this rule 
should not be changed.  In fact, that is the reason for our 
motion this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does this 10% rule apply to Petro Canada?  Last year, in all 
the discussions about the bank mergers, why was the existing 10% 
ownership rule enforced?  Why, this morning, does the government 
want to scrap it in the case of the airline industry?  That is 
what we are wondering. This proposal strikes us as a bit 
strange.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Would its purpose be to help a friend, the president of Onex, 
who is part of the inner Liberal circle?  It is a question one 
is entitled to ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else I find really strange.  In my view, this 
issue of Air Canada and Onex is a major one, with particular 
consequences for those living around airports.  This morning, I 
have some serious questions.  What about the members for Laval 
West, Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Verdun—Saint-Henri, Pierrefonds—Dollard? 
What about the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport and the 
member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies?  Are they unable to speak? 
We have not heard from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admire the courage displayed by the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis, who sits on the other side. At the risk of being 
reprimanded by his caucus, he dared to tell <I>Le Devoir</I>, on 
October 14, that the 10% limit is appropriate and must 
absolutely be maintained. I admire him for his courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And then there is the hon. member for Vaudreuil who was perhaps 
a little less courageous when he said “Maybe yes, maybe no”. At 
least he expressed a preference, even though he was trying hard 
not to make waves. Again, I admire the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis. He is not here just now, but that does not 
matter, I admire him nevertheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also ask myself other questions. Why would someone like Marc 
Lalonde, a former Liberal minister who must surely be respected 
by the Liberals, want the 10% limit maintained? Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder if you and Mr. Lalonde sat in the House at the same time. 
I believe so, and I am sure you respected him at the time. On 
October 26, 1999, Marc Lalonde stated many reasons why the 10% 
limit should be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with those who say that there are problems with Canada's 
air transportation system. We definitely have to ask ourselves 
certain questions. Is there room in Canada for two international 
carriers, namely Canadian Airlines and Air Canada? We definitely 
have to ask ourselves certain questions. But the issue cannot be 
solved in 90 days or in 90 minutes. A thorough review is in order. 
I certainly agree with most members here, including my friends 
across the way, that we must not let Canadian international air 
transport fall under the control of foreign companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Control over Canadian international air transport must remain 
with Canadians. Regional air transport also must be 
restructured, as the hon. member for Jonquière said. Coming from 
Abitibi, it makes no sense to me that people in Rouyn-Noranda 
should pay more to fly from Rouyn-Noranda to Montreal than to fly 
from Montreal to Paris. It is crazy and ridiculous that a 
55-minute flight from Rouyn-Noranda to Montreal should cost more 
than a 6-hour Montreal-Paris flight. It makes no sense, and we 
must review all that. 
Competition must be reconsidered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Reform member talks about competition, I agree with her 
that we must bring in sound competition in regional transports. 
It is indeed desirable and urgently needed. The lack of 
competition hinders regional development. It is much more 
expensive for business people from Rouyn-Noranda, Jonquière or 
any other region to travel on business to Montreal and back than 
to Paris. What nonsense!

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That adds to production costs and results in products made in 
Rouyn-Noranda or in Jonquière costing more and being less 
competitive than those in the Montreal or Toronto area. The 10% 
rule must not be abolished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I will support the Bloc motion. A major restructuring 
of regional air transportation in Canada is absolutely needed.

<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with my colleague the hon. member for 
Scarborough East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me in opening my remarks to refer to some prior experience 
in this area.  I was the director of the Air Law Institute at 
McGill University for a number of years, and incidentally, 
adviser to the premier of Quebec on air law matters at that 
stage.  One of the recommendations was against the construction 
of the Mirabel airport, the second airport.  I think it was 
correct on constitutional grounds and also on air law grounds, 
although the advice was not taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can move on to other matters where expertise also comes into 
account.  This is not the first time the airlines have been 
before this parliament.  In the previous mandate of this 
government the issue arose, as may be remembered, of aggressive 
litigation between the two airlines, the result of which might 
have been to drive one of them out of existence. This matter was 
settled by the intervention of the then minister of transport and 
in consideration of the use, if need be, of his powers which are 
limited but within those limits have a considerable range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was essentially done was to use the federal power under 
international law through our membership in the International 
Civil Aviation Organization and our participation in the Chicago 
convention to grant or withhold approval of international air 
routes.  A very felicitous solution was reached in this earlier 
problem in 1994 between the two airlines by opening international 
air routes to one as a condition of dropping the litigation.  I 
think it was an excellent example of executive power being used 
imaginatively and producing a consensual solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However at that time I did make some points clear, as policy 
imperatives, certainly for me as a British Columbian but also I 
think for all Canadians, that we have an interest in maintaining 
the extraordinary investment we have in highly skilled jobs in 
the airline industry.  In British Columbia and Alberta there are 
17,000 highly skilled technical jobs with one airline alone.  We 
want those jobs maintained throughout Canada. Therefore any 
approach to solutions here must bear that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want maintenance of reasonable air access to distant 
areas of our large country that might not otherwise be 
commercially viable in a strict market economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want reasonable prices.  If competition will produce 
that, well and good.  If it will not, obviously there has to be a 
degree of government regulation of prices.  But the opportunity 
and the facility is there.  And we do want safe air travel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were imperatives that the transport minister understood, 
that he conveyed to both airlines and in the solution in 1994 
they were realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have looked with sympathy and interest to the motion by the 
opposition Bloc Quebecois, as I say, granted the predisposition 
to examine every motion from the other side.  But I do believe it 
does not really face the realities of the new world community of 
our times, the world revolution of our times which affects 
international commerce, international trade and international air 
transportation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the rules of the game that we have now are posited on an 
economic trade situation that no longer exists today.  We do 
accept the maxim that small is beautiful, but in the world of 
international air transportation even large national airlines in 
middle powers no longer have the weight or the size to compete 
effectively in the international market without considerable 
assistance from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I welcome the intervention by the Minister of 
Transport.  There is here no legislation.  There is an opening of 
a debate.  It is clear that we are on the edge of the necessity 
of examining a fundamental restructuring of the airline industry 
to meet the new realities of international air transportation and 
the cutthroat competition that exists for much larger companies 
outside with much heavier government investment and support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is on this basis that we have joined this debate. I would 
suggest, though, that our national rules of competition are 
devoted to, directed and inspired by national problems.  They do 
not, without some further examination, meet the new realities of 
international air transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's powers are limited in the range of matters he can 
touch but he does have discretion, so that the issue of relaxing 
the national Competition Act, which was designed to meet national 
conditions, to meet new international conditions is one worthy of 
respect and consideration by the House.  We need suggestions on 
how we would use that discretion.  I invite that from the 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that the international rules, even the tidy 
rules of the Chicago convention, those implemented by the 
International Civil Aviation Organization, also need 
re-examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have entered into an national debate.  I have had visits from 
delegations, from Air Canada pilots, Canadian Airlines pilots, 
representative employees of the companies and others.  I am 
gathering my own opinion on what needs to be done in the 
restructuring of the air industry.  I believe, and I say this 
with all respect to my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, the 
motion reflects the past.  It fetters and confines a necessary 
element of national policy making which needs to be directed 
toward the entirely new and revolutionary conditions in 
international air transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is on that basis that I would not recommend to the Bloc 
pursuing the particular motion, an unnecessary restriction which 
hinders the debate that we now need on restructuring the airline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I return again to those imperatives.  Any solution that the 
House may reach must maintain the investment we have in the 
highly skilled jobs in both airlines.  It must maintain air 
access even to uneconomic areas of the country in strict national 
airline terms.  It must maintain reasonable prices with 
competition if that is the case: two international airlines and 
one national or one international airline and two national ones. 
The modalities of development are considerable, but the goals and 
the imperatives remain, and I believe it is within our ability to 
work them out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask a question of my colleague from Vancouver 
Quadra.  He says that the Bloc Quebecois motion is out of date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does his vision of the future include no possibility for 
Canadians to control their own international air carrier?

one giving the orders on international aviation in Canada?  Is 
that his vision of the future? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my problem is simply that 
we are on the eve of a great national debate and we need 
contributions from all sides but not to limit the modalities of 
our choice by focusing on a section that relates to company law 
which needs frankly readjustment review, in the context of the 
new rules of international competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that it is very difficult even for one Canadian 
airline to compete and survive in the international market acting 
by itself.  It will need considerable government help.  It will 
need positive intervention using international law and national 
law rules accordingly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak to the motion before the House which calls on the 
existing 10% individual share ownership rule to be restored and 
retained.  The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House reaffirms its desire to maintain the provisions 
of section 6.1(a) of the Air Canada Public Participation Act 
limiting ownership of the capital stock by any person or group to 
10% of the voting shares. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might mention at the outset that my constituents are greatly 
interested in this matter.  I represent a riding in the GTA which 
contributes directly or indirectly greatly to the health of our 
airline industry.  We find ourselves inundated with various 
viewpoints on this issue and the restructuring of the industry 
that is going ahead.  This is of local importance to my riding 
and my constituents, but it is also of national importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday the Minister of Transport issued a document entitled 
<I>A Policy Framework for Airline Restructuring in Canada</I>. In 
that document the minister announced that the government was 
willing to consider changing the existing 10% limit in the Air 
Canada Public Participation Act, if such a measure contributes to 
achieving a healthy Canadian controlled airline industry.  That 
is a rather important caveat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To determine what role reviewing the ownership restrictions on 
Air Canada might imply in achieving a healthy Canadian controlled 
airline industry, I wish to speak to the cost of this rule, 
particularly the cost of this rule in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What market distortions result from the existence of this rule? 
I would submit there are market distortions and the market has 
reacted in a variety of ways.  The running of any airline is a 
very expensive exercise.  The question always has to be in a 
public policy context:  Are the costs of imposing certain 
desirable public policy goals worth the actual cost in the 
marketplace?  The questions to my mind are:  Are these 
restrictive provisions in place?  How do they distort the cost of 
money?  Do they achieve a proper public policy goal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Air Canada cannot go to the TSE on a free and open basis like 
other industries because of this rule then there is a cost and in 
some measure or another the market reacts to that cost.  The 
question to my mind is an open question.  I am glad the minister 
raised the issue of whether this cost is worth while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the effect?  The market is already mutated to some 
extent.  Consumers directly or indirectly pay for that mutation. 
I draw attention to the Air Canada proposal that is on the table. 
That proposal raises $930 million.  Interestingly enough, at the 
end of the day those who are actually putting in $930 million 
only end up with 7% of the shares.  That in purely market terms 
is a bit of a bizarre anomaly because the market has in some 
respects mutated.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that the value of an airline is not in and of 
itself the infrastructure of the airline.  Rather it is in other 
things.  For instance, UAL and Lufthansa have agreed to acquire a 
new series of perpetual convertible preferred shares in the 
amount of $230 million.  The shares will only pay dividends if 
and when they are declared on the common shares.  It then goes on 
in greater detail.  I would submit that is a distortion of the 
market.  In addition, UAL and Lufthansa will provide a 10 year 
credit guarantee facility to Air Canada of approximately $310 
million.  How much that costs I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIBC will provide a $200 million upfront payment to Air Canada 
to deepen and extend its agreement.  Air Canada will provide to 
CIBC approximately 4.4 million warrants exercisable for class A 
non-voting commons shares at $24 to $28 per share over five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of us in this room are securities lawyers.  It would 
probably take a great deal of effort to explain to us exactly 
what that means.  Although the simple issue is that this is a 
reflection of the distortion in the marketplace, this is in 
itself a reflection that money has to be raised in the airline 
industry other than in a straightforward fashion.  When money is 
raised in a marketplace in other than a straightforward fashion 
some kind of premium is paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question to my mind still is whether the 10% rule the Bloc 
is so desirous of retaining actually distorts the marketplace and 
ratchets up the cost of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first market distortion we see in this proposal is that the 
value is everywhere but in the infrastructure of the airline. The 
value is in the Visa card.  The value is in some shares that UAL 
and Lufthansa want to hold, which are not voting shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second distortion plays out each and every day, every time a 
Canadian gets on an airplane.  Consumers in one way or another 
pay the cost because Air Canada or Canadian Airlines or any other 
entity does not get the cheapest possible money because the 
market has been distorted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third perverse consequence of that an airline, whatever 
airline, that is hobbled by unreasonable share restrictions and 
contradictory public policy decisions will inevitably fail or 
will inevitably be a weak partner.  If we have learned anything 
in this debate, it is that whatever the future is for whatever 
dominant airline that comes into play it is extremely important 
that partner be a strong partner in the alliance.  If it is not a 
strong partner in the alliance, it will be inevitably controlled 
by entities that will frustrate our public policy goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the minister for putting the 10% rule on the 
table.  It did not descend from Mount Sinai.  It is not sacred. 
It is not the Ten Commandments.  It shows a great deal of 
political courage on his part to put what has been an effective 
mechanism to achieve certain public policy goals on the table in 
order that they can be discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister asks me what is the value of this rule, my 
response would be that he should tell me what is the cost of the 
10% rule to the airlines and therefore to their consumers.  If 
there are other ways to achieve the same goal, either de facto 
control or de jure control or effective control, and we have a 
variety of tests for those things, then let us achieve it that 
way.  Let us not ruin the marketplace by putting in artificial 
unsustainable rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reality is that whatever dominant airline emerges it 
will be part of an alliance.  If this “new company” is hobbled 
by some useless public policy initiative, it will inevitably lead 
to difficulties with that airline.  Then we will be back to this 
debate again and we will be back to trying to figure out how to 
bail out the new airline one way or another.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this rule does not stand that litmus test, then my view is, 
let the rule go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10% rule in essence is a share restriction, and a share 
restriction distorts the market.  When market distortion occurs 
it costs money.  The cost goes not only to the shareholders of 
the airline, it also goes to the consuming public. If that cannot 
be justified, then the rule should not stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis of that I suggest that the motion should fail and 
that hon. members should not support the motion.  In fact, the 
minister's positioning on this is correct, it is an area which 
needs to be discussed.  If we can achieve public policy goals by 
other means, then I would be open to that idea.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, representatives of the other parties—the Liberals of 
course, and the Reformers—have said they were opposed.  As far as 
Reform is concerned, one could doubt their consistency, as it 
seems to vary depending on the subject, but in this case their 
point of view is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform member who has just spoken referred to the interests 
of the west.  She did not seem to be upset by the fact that the 
Americans want to get their hands on more shares in the airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois' position is consistent with earlier 
government decisions in certain areas.  In the case of the 
banks, or other sectors of the economy, the 10% rule was 
enforced. The exception was CN, where the government allowed up 
to 15%.  The Bloc Quebecois was not in agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have therefore always been consistent.  If the rule is 10%, 
we are not going to change it to suit the circumstances.  We 
therefore have to wonder why the Minister of Transport said, 
before Air Canada shareholders have cast their votes at the 
November 8 meeting, “Things are changing, and we must too”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why change at this particular time, when we know that not a 
session goes by—at least, not since I have been in parliament— 
that the situation in the airline industry is not discussed in 
one way or another? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been questions from all the opposition parties. The 
government had things to say as well.  Everyone was concerned 
about the future of Air Canada and of Canadian International 
Airlines.  So why, at this particular time, is the government, 
while claiming not to want to intervene, suggesting that, before 
shareholders make their fateful decision on November 8, it would 
now be prepared to change the 10% rule? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the suggestion was not made by just anybody.  Not by an 
official, a backbencher or a parliamentary secretary, but by the 
Minister of Transport himself.  So, he is speaking on behalf of 
Cabinet.  So, they have discussed the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the series of events that have occurred since 
August 13, we can see that, in the end, we are in a context in 
which the government has decided to make a choice. It has waited 
for just the right moment.  Why?  Because Onex is involved.  It 
knew that Onex was prepared to act. The government, according to 
us—at least that is what I think—the government is changing 
its tune, and now it would like to help Onex with its project. 
Since it does not want to do so overtly, it is doing so 
covertly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doing covertly what one cannot do overtly is not being 
transparent.  It is acting.  It is a scenario that would do for 
a great film. 
It is a strategy that does not fool the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois or the media, and commentators who are following the 
story closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is part of a well formulated plan. The way things are going, 
since the parties on both sides are following this debate even 
more closely than the average citizen, it is clear that they 
know how to decode the messages sent them by the government. 
This ability will significantly influence the results of the 
general meeting of Air Canada shareholders.  At least, it can 
change it a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, while the government did not intervene in any way, the Air 
Canada shareholders will have only one option on November 8: 
accept or reject Air Canada's offer, since it is the only one 
that goes by the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is however one principle at stake, the one according to 
which we must act in the best interests of all Canadians and of 
all Quebecers. It is therefore a matter of interest. We must ask 
ourselves in whose best interests the Minister of Transport was 
acting when he made his position known on Tuesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about the position he indirectly took when he 
suggested that he was ready to consider changing the rules. What 
purpose would that serve? To enhance services? To protect as 
many jobs as possible? To promote the interests of some 
shareholders? To promote the interests of a handful of 
government buddies perhaps? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know. We are asking the question. Today's debate gives 
us the opportunity to ask this question. The Bloc Quebecois is 
wondering in whose best interests the government is acting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a rather simple question, at least to us in the Bloc. 
We have always stated, and we keep reminding people, that we are 
here—because we only ran candidates in Quebec—to protect the 
interests of Quebec. We are here first and foremost to protect 
the interests of our province. Air Canada and Canadian Airlines 
International are Canadian companies, and competition should be 
given free reign.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised to see that our colleagues from the Reform Party, 
who always saw the competition rule as a protection for 
consumers, now seem to be supporting the new way of thinking of 
the transport minister, who is announcing in advance what he 
intends to do to encourage certain people who have interests or 
shares in these companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois' position is clear: we want the competition 
rule to be maintained. Obviously, we do not want to see any 
company disappear. 
In this era of economic liberalism, performance and the quality 
of goods and services are the main factors that will make or 
break a company, and that has to remain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we had only one major air carrier, there would still be 
competition because other international carriers fly to Canada, 
and there are regional carriers that are not affiliated with Air 
Canada or Canadian International Airlines. For example, starting 
November 1, Air Montreal will serve Quebec and Ottawa. 
Therefore, there are opportunities for the regions also, and one 
sound company that provides good services is better than two 
that are struggling to survive.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it very interesting to hear the 
member say that he is in favour of free market competition 
prevailing when the very nature of this motion would prevent any 
competition in the merger process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members are trying to say that only one deal can be 
considered by the government, by anybody, by the shareholders.  I 
do not find it competitive when we are saying there is only one 
person or one deal which can comply with the conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that if the member truly believes in the 
competitive nature of the free market he would be willing to open 
up the guidelines, open up the regulations to allow more than 
one.  Perhaps there are two, three or more people who would be 
interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also challenge this member on his comments as to whether 
a company should be allowed to go into bankruptcy.  In the 
interests of all Canadians, the restructuring of the airline 
industry should be handled in an organized fashion rather than in 
a chaotic fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very difficult to believe that the hon. member is 
speaking to and concerned about all Canadians and not just those 
who happen to live in the province of Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I refer to the last part of the 
member's speech, where she says that it would have to be 
organized and that things should be done in the best possible 
way. I completely agree with her on that. The Bloc quebecois has 
attempted to set an example in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government refused to let the Standing Committee on 
Transport hear stakeholders, the Bloc Quebecois created a shadow 
committee to give everybody an opportunity to voice their 
opinions. Of course, the liberals would not have anything to do 
with it. However, when we talk about organization, the 
government decided to suspend application of the relevant 
section of the Act, saying that the situation should not be 
referred to the Canadian Competition Bureau for 90 days. We 
would be very happy if this issue were referred to the 
Competition Bureau.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At meetings of the Standing Committee on Industry, of which I am 
a member, the subject of the Competition Bureau often comes up, 
and that makes sense. So far, however, the opposite has 
happened. The process is not transparent, not democratic at all. 
It is on the Bloc Quebecois' initiative that the subject is 
being discussed today, that there is a public debate being held, 
in the public interest. We hope that the Reform Party will do 
the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the matter was raised in caucus— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am sorry to interrupt, 
but your colleague has a question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, during oral question period, the leader of Bloc 
Quebecois and the hon. member for Beauport—Montmorency— 
Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans both asked questions about an article 
recently printed in <I>Le Devoir</I> and signed by Marc Lalonde. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marc Lalonde is a former minister who, I believe, was respected 
by all parties in this House. He wrote that “A promise or 
commitment to authorize a merger of the two carriers without 
knowing how the act will be amended is pernicious and 
dangerous”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport replied: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect the qualities of my former colleague, Mr. Lalonde. 
Yesterday, he gave his opinion in an article in the daily <I>Le 
Devoir</I>, but I must point out that Mr. Lalonde is a lawyer and 
that his company works for Air Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fine. But we read in the same newspaper that the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis is also opposed to fiddling with the 10% limit. 
Could the minister tell us which company the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis works for? I would like to hear what my colleague, 
the hon. member for Lévis, has to say on this score. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not have the same respect as 
my colleague does for the former minister, but for other 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This former minister, who was a heavyweight in the government of 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, expressed his opinion. But the fact that 
the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis has made his position known 
leads me to making the following comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see an hon. member from the Montreal area who is usually very 
vocal, but she has had nothing to say on this issue. Yet, she 
represents a Montreal riding very close to the airport. I invite 
her to come forward, just as the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis 
did. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. 
member for Charlevoix and a member of the Standing Committee on 
Transport, I believe we have a lot of work to do and a huge 
mandate to fulfil as a result of airline mergers and the 
restructuring of air transportation services in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been going through turbulence for some time now. The 
Minister of Transport has tried to maintain Canadian Airlines 
and Air Canada. Unfortunately, in January, Canadian Airlines 
told the Minister of Transport it was in great financial 
difficulty, on the brink of bankruptcy. Of course, it will not 
go bankrupt as long as Canadian Airlines' suppliers do not take 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reporters will probably write, as they have done before, that 
members of the Bloc Quebecois attend their committee meetings 
regularly and are well prepared. They are in Ottawa to defend 
Quebec's interests and to improve Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as Quebec sends tax money to Ottawa, as a member of the 
Bloc Quebecois, as the hon. member for Charlevoix and as deputy 
critic for transport, I will fulfil my responsibilities.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has decided today, given the urgency of this 
debate, to inform the public by making use of an opposition day. 
The Bloc Quebecois had been asking that the Standing Committee 
on Transport be convened since July. For various reasons, 
including members' holidays, the adjournment of the House, the 
throne speech, we were told the committee could not sit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oddly enough, the committee did meet, with members of the New 
Democratic Party, of the Reform Party, of the Bloc Quebecois and 
of the Conservative Party. The only people who did not show up 
were the Liberals. Yet, for two days, the ad hoc committee heard 
from witnesses who came from all over Canada to raise members' 
awareness about the importance of restructuring air 
transportation services in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the seriousness of all those people, the Bloc 
Quebecois introduced a motion today. That motion reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House reaffirms its desire to maintain the provisions 
of section 6.1(<I>a</I>) of the Air Canada Public Participation Act 
limiting ownership of the capital stock of Air Canada by any 
person or group to 10% of the voting shares. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the Bloc Quebecois explained its position which is 
that the role of a responsible government is to act like a 
referee whose primary concern is protection of the public 
interest. Changing the act would favour one party over the other 
and that is called cheating. 
If the government changes the act to suit Onex or AMR, that 
would send the signal that private companies do not have to 
comply with the law but that the government has to adapt the law 
to suit its friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10% rule applies to Petro Canada, banks and several other 
public interest corporations. Changing that rule would be 
contrary to public interest. The 10% rule was put in place to 
prevent a single group from gaining control of Air Canada, one 
of the two national air carriers. The government wants to change 
the rule to allow a group to gain control of the only remaining 
carrier. That would be putting the future of the air carrier in 
the hands of only one group. By refusing to state its position, 
the government is feeding the uncertainty that currently exists 
in the airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the committee has a clear mandate, witnesses to hear, 
hearings to hold. I hope this time the Minister of Transport is 
going to listen to the committee's recommendations. We know what 
happened when it was time to restructure the shipping industry. 
Every political party had an input and made recommendations to 
the minister. I am convinced unfortunately that he had already 
made up his mind on how the shipping industry was going to be 
restructured, even before the committee sat down to write its 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier in my speech, we are going through very 
turbulent times and Canadians are very concerned. When a plane 
is going through turbulence or a storm, people on board are 
worried and feel powerless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our constituents, who are watching us, who sent us here to 
represent them, are concerned about the future of air 
transportation, especially in the regions. 
Under the bid of Onex or AMR, the merger of Air Canada and 
Canadian could result in the loss of 5,000 to 10,000 jobs. 
According to the president of Air Canada, Air Canada's offer to 
merge with Canadian could mean the loss of around 2,500 jobs. If 
the government does nothing, Canadian will likely go under and 
all its workers will lose their jobs.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we in the Bloc Quebecois want is to maintain as many jobs 
as possible while ensuring the highest quality of service in the 
airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later this week in committee I will ask the Minister of 
Transport the following question “Should there be a merger, what 
do you think the future of air transportation in the regions 
will be?” As you know, air transportation is of paramount 
importance in the regions. And yet, over the last few years, air 
service in the regions has been diminishing. Quality of service 
is in jeopardy, and flight frequency is left up to individual 
carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who have no choice, plane tickets are very expensive. 
In a riding like Charlevoix, on the north shore, air 
transportation is the fastest way to get around, because we have 
no rail transportation and we have only one access road. 
Therefore, the only way to travel fast is by plane, and carriers 
know it only too well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Travellers who have no choice use a particular type of service, 
for professional reasons. They are, for example, business people 
who need to travel within a very short timeframe or people from 
the regions who need to go to Quebec City or to Montreal to have 
access to certain health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The merger of Air Canada and Canadian International Airlines is 
of great concern to us, especially the Onex proposal, because I 
think there is some kind of complicity between the Department of 
Transport, Canadian International Airlines and the future 
company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the future of regional air service, we all know 
that airports are already losing money. 
If the number of flights to regional airports is reduced, we 
will no longer have what we have now, that is a red and white 
Air Alliance plane arriving at 8.55 a.m. and a blue and white 
Canadian Airlines plane arriving at 9.10 a.m. Some will say that 
the blue and white plane was half full and the other one was 
half empty, depending on which company they want to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the number of flights is what makes an airport 
profitable. This means that a merger would reduce the 
profitability of airports by at least 50%. And when I think 
about what happened when the Department of Transport made Nav 
Canada responsible for airport management in order to reduce 
airport deficits, if the past is any indication of what we can 
expect in the future, then I am extremely worried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that Nav Canada cut services at airports by reducing 
the number of air traffic controllers, by closing control 
towers, by cutting airport firefighting services, all at the 
expense of passenger safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time is up. I could have gone on for at least 
another 40 minutes, but I will have the opportunity to come back 
to this later on. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
the Onex project was made public this summer, a number of 
members from ridings close to the Dorval Airport, mainly from 
the West Island, wanted to meet with the transport minister to 
get some explanations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is surprising and I would like my colleague from the north 
shore to comment on what I could call the ominous silence kept 
be some members, like the hon. member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges, 
for instance, the hon. member for Pierrefonds—Dollard, and a 
veteran, the hon. member for Lac Saint-Louis, who was quoted 
recently in <I>Le Devoir</I> as saying that the 10% rule is fair and 
reasonable and should not be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also thinking of the hon. member for Verdun—Saint-Henri, the 
hon. member for Beauce and the hon. member for Laval West. And 
what about the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine from whom 
we have not heard a peep? 
Are the best interests of the province of Quebec being protected 
by the handful of Liberal members from the West Island?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague from the north shore to explain to us 
why these members have clammed up today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, this morning we learned from 
Canadian International Airlines that there have been discussions 
and an exchange of letters since January with the Minister of 
Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet this week the Minister of Transport told us that he found 
out about it in June, that he had to intervene in June.  We 
mentioned some ridings, but there are other Liberal MPs in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were, of course, present when the minister appeared before 
the Standing Committee on Transport, because there were some 25 
to 30 cameras in the room and all the journalists were there. 
As soon as the cameras left the room, the number of Liberal MPs 
dropped by half, and a lot of chairs were left vacant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speeches by the members for Beauce and for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik show that they are out of touch with the 
situation. 
They are just trying to please the minister, without even 
knowing what the consequences of the famous 10% rule will be. 
Why did the minister allow section 47 of the Competition Act to 
be amended? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If either of the two members were asked what section 47 was, he 
would probably not be able to say. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
very quickly, I would like to give the member for Charlevoix a 
chance to finish what he was saying about regional 
transportation in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10% rule issue is about whether we should allow 
concentration of powers or keep things fair.  As for regional 
transportation, I know that the Bloc Quebecois would like 
another, broader debate.>  Small regional carriers do exist but, 
right now, there is at least one Canadian company having trouble 
providing good regional service because of major financial 
difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear whether my colleague agrees that the issue 
of regional air transportation rules should be debated again. 
In my view, this is a truly important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, any discussion about regional 
transportation is a discussion about an essential service.  It 
is not a luxury to travel by air when one lives in the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consideration must also be given to travel agencies and 
passenger safety.  As the Minister said in his speech “Safety 
remains Transport Canada's top priority”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister explain that, just under a year ago, on 
December 7 in Baie-Comeau, a plane registered to Mira Aviation in 
Gaspé crashed, unbeknownst to any air traffic controller? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the minister explain that a Nordair plane flying out of 
Sept-Îles crashed, forcing passengers to walk several kilometres 
through a wooded area to reach a road and obtain help? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the minister explain that, last December 7, an Air 
Satellite plane operating out of Baie-Comeau crashed, and that it 
was a six-year old girl who discovered the plane? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is air service? This is the sort of good service Nav Canada 
is providing?  I would not want to alarm the public, but I worry 
when I take a plane these days.  If it was important to have air 
traffic controllers and firefighters in 1975, it is even more 
important to have them in 1999.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to the motion to affirm the 10% limit on 
individual holdings of voting shares in Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member 
for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House that on October 26 the transport 
minister issued a policy framework for the restructuring of the 
airline industry in Canada in which the percentage limit on 
individual holdings of Air Canada was addressed.  In his remarks 
to the Standing Committee on Transport the minister reiterated 
the government's willingness to consider increasing the limit to 
a new level, to be decided following input from parliamentarians, 
if such a measure were to contribute to achieving a healthy 
Canadian controlled airline industry.

which airlines are financially fit and competing both 
domestically and internationally. However, in view of the 
circumstances in the air travel marketplace, a restructuring of 
Canada's airline industry resulting in one dominant airline 
appears likely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confronted with the probability of major changes to the airline 
industry, Canadians have been very active and vocal in expressing 
their views and concerns, and rightfully so. The transport 
minister and his officials have met with numerous direct 
stakeholders, have consulted with interest groups and members of 
the public and have received views through correspondence and 
other ways of getting in contact.  A wide of variety of important 
concerns have been expressed by Canadians confirming the need for 
a clear government role in any restructuring of the airline 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that the government has listened carefully to 
Canadians and has developed a framework outlining our approach to 
protecting the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect of the public interest that has received substantial 
attention is the predicted lessening of competition as a result 
of a major consolidation of airlines.  Most Canadians want 
Canada's airline industry to be competitive.  We have heard that 
and we have listened.  They believe that competition is an 
effective way to ensure reasonable airfares and good quality air 
service.  The government continues to agree with Canadians in 
this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early in the process the transport minister solicited the 
assistance of the Competition Bureau.  The commissioner of the 
bureau submitted his report on October 22 to the Minister of 
Transport.  The commissioner's analysis and recommendations were 
thoroughly considered by the minister, as a study of the policy 
framework will show. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to fostering as much competition as 
possible in the airline industry in Canada.  That is precisely 
what we are doing.  We are convinced that reducing the barriers 
to market entry for new carriers and encouraging existing 
carriers to expand into new markets will mitigate the expected 
lessening of competition that may result from a consolidation in 
the industry.  That is why the Minister of Transport announced 
the government's intention to take policy and regulatory steps to 
address competition issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frequent flyer programs, for example, that have a significant 
influence on the air services that consumers choose, are a 
concern for competition.  Other carriers would be greatly 
disadvantaged if they could not offer or redeem points in a 
dominant carrier's plan.  The potential negative effects could be 
mitigated by allowing any domestic carrier to purchase points in 
the dominant carrier's frequent flyer plan at a reasonable cost, 
or by the dominant carrier's participation in independent loyalty 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great majority of flight bookings still go through travel 
agents.  If agents are constrained from booking on other airlines 
for fear of not achieving the target set for their override 
commission by the dominant carrier, competition would be 
undermined.  The government will examine ways to address the 
anti-competitive effects of this issue while recognizing the 
potential impact on travel agent revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any restructuring of the airline industry is expected to include 
some rationalization of services, particularly in the domestic 
market, such that the dominant carrier may no longer need all the 
aircraft in its fleet.  These aircraft, already certified for 
safe operation in Canada, might be very attractive to other 
Canadian carriers.  There is a risk, however, that the dominant 
carrier would prefer to divest any surplus aircraft offshore.  If 
rights of first refusal for surplus aircraft on reasonable 
commercial terms were offered to an interested party in the 
domestic market during the restructuring process, this could 
assist in fostering more consumer choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Independent airlines may have little choice but to work with the 
dominant carrier when their passengers need a connecting flight 
to get to their final destination.  A smooth exchange of 
passengers and their baggage, however, requires the co-operation 
of the dominant airline.  If access to feed traffic and 
interlining were offered to unaffiliated regional and chartered 
carriers on commercially reasonable terms, this could help 
regional carriers to continue to function effectively.  This is 
certainly a goal of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both major airlines have developed close commercial relations 
with regional affiliates or partner airlines to ensure that 
smaller communities are well integrated into their network. 
After all, that is what Canada is all about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these arrangements it is common for the larger carrier to 
provide such essential services as airport slots and facilities, 
aircraft leases, reservation systems, ticket processing, revenue 
collection and accounting. However, it is not clear whether all 
of the smaller regional carriers will remain connected to the 
dominant carrier in any restructuring.  If any do not, they will 
need a period of adjustment so that they may replace essential 
services previously provided by larger partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For regional carriers formerly dependent on one of the two major 
carriers for essential services, if the dominant carrier were to 
continue to provide these services for a reasonable period of 
time at prices no less favourable than currently in place, this 
would help ensure continued service. Where feasible, the dominant 
carrier might also continue to provide items acquired through 
volume purchasing such as fuel, spare parts, aircraft leasing and 
insurance for a reasonable transition period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preventing excessively aggressive competition activity by a 
dominant airline will be a priority for our government, as will 
be ensuring smaller airlines reasonable access to airport 
facilities and services and to computer reservations systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made it clear that in the new process the 
Competition Bureau will review any specific proposed merger or 
acquisition with regard to competition issues.  The results will 
be taken into account by the Minister of Transport who will make 
a comprehensive recommendation to the governor in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These government initiatives regarding airline competition, in 
my view, are measured and reasonable to accomplish the policy 
objectives. Certainly they are in the best interests of Canadians 
wherever they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, as stated in the government's October 26 policy 
framework statement, regardless of how things evolve in terms of 
airline industry restructuring in Canada, the government is 
intent on ensuring that the public interest remains paramount and 
is protected.  The government is confident that the 
entrepreneurial spirit of Canada will remain strong and that 
competitive air services will develop and provide real options 
for travellers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also confident that the House and Senate 
standing committees will provide useful advice on the 
implementation of remedies for competitive issues.  As well, 
these committees have been requested to provide their views on 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that parliamentarians in this House should be given a 
chance to provide views on this important issue.  I oppose the 
hon. member's motion to make a decision on the issue today.  We 
need to let the process take its course.  I think that is what 
Canadians want and it is what all of us need.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for his 
great performance in reading his speech. It was written either 
by Department of Transport officials or by Onex bureaucrats, we 
do not know exactly. In any case, we have to admit that he read 
it very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, I also want the hon. member to know that I 
would have liked to direct my question to the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, the hon. member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges 
or the hon. member for Verdun—Saint-Henri, but as my colleague, 
the member for Frontenac—Mégantic, said today, we will not hear a 
peep from them. 
It would be nice if their constituents had the opportunity to 
hear them, here in the House of Commons, or outside, in the 
foyer, or in their riding. One member, the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis<B>, </B>actually did speak out, but oddly enough, we have 
not seen much of him lately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two very simple questions to ask the hon. member. Could 
he give us an example, in Canadian history, of the 10% rule 
being violated? For example, for the banks, did the rule stand, 
yes or no? I am sure that the hon. member looked into this issue 
at length before delivering his speech, and I would like him to 
give us any example in Canada, since 1867, of the 10% rule being 
violated. My second question is this one: as things stand now, 
is the proposal from Onex legal or not?

it, elucidate clearly what we are saying and how we are going 
about this very important process, unlike the sovereignists

all important issue.  I can tell the House that we have nothing 
to learn from those people over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to the 1980s when Quebec Air was nationalized by 
the then Parti Quebecois.  What did it do then? Did it consult 
with the people?  Did it take a look at what should happen?  No, 
it barrelled ahead and did all kinds of outrageous things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now those members on the other side are trying to tell us what 
we should do now.  It is outrageous that they would sit in their 
seats and try to make that kind of pretension because they do not 
practise what they preach.  All they do is flip-flop around and 
make all kinds of nonsensical issues in the best interest not of 
Canada, not of Quebec, but of their own small minded way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will have no part of that because they saw through 
them in what they did with Quebec Air in the 1980s, and what they 
are preaching today is nothing but phony, phony, phony. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have two questions for the hon. member.  He mentioned 
in his speech that the entrepreneurial spirit was alive and well, 
that they were fostering it and all that sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister asked the Competition Bureau to investigate 
the restructuring of the aviation industry, could the member 
explain why the minister did not restrict it to one narrow 
vision, the minister's narrow vision of a dominant carrier?  Why 
did he not ask the Competition Bureau to bring back all the 
options and all the potential possibilities that may include the 
competition which this one does not?  Instead, he just focused on 
one area and limited the bureau's review to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to comment on another matter.  When the 
government called for proposals on August 13, it said that it 
would consider proposals for 90 days.  Why did the government not 
then consider or make public its intention to consider changing 
the 10% rule?  Why did it wait until there were only 16 days left 
in the process when nobody else had a chance to put a proposal on 
the table? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
opposite for the question.  I reject outright his premise that we 
did not have a broad consensus in terms of where we are going. It 
is not a narrow vision.  It is, rather, in the best interest of 
our great country and of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been amazed by the Tories since 1997.  I was doing some 
research on this very important area.  Two years ago the Tories 
called for cutbacks of $35 million from Transport Canada, and 
here they are today wanting to argue the other side.  Can we 
imagine calling for those kinds of cutbacks and now arguing the 
other side? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reading not so long ago in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> that 
the member for Cumberland—Colchester accused the minister of 
changing the ground rules to favour the Onex takeover bid.  It is 
truly amazing that those Tories who wreaked havoc when Mulroney 
was in power are trying to do things today which are totally at 
odds with what we as a government are doing in a very effective 
and promising way for Canadians.  Such nonsense will not be 
tolerated by the Canadian people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the hon. 
member's motion concerning the government's policy framework for 
the airline restructuring in Canada announced on October 26 by 
the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us concerns whether the current prohibition on 
any person or persons holding more than 10% of Air Canada voting 
shares should be maintained.  The government has clearly stated 
in its policy framework that it is prepared to consider 
increasing the limit to a new level after input from 
parliamentarians, if such a measure contributes to achieving a 
healthy Canadian controlled airline industry.  In this context it 
articulated a number of key elements in its policy framework, 
including the desire to foster as much competition as possible in 
the airline industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This framework also clarifies the government's intention to 
review Canadian international air policy in a new Canadian 
airline environment.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A revised international air policy is a critical element of the 
new policy framework for airline restructuring.  International 
air services account for more than 50% of the revenues of 
Canada's two major airlines, Air Canada and Canadian Airlines 
International. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These services are even more important to Canadian's largest 
charter carriers: Air Transat, Canada 3000, Royal Aviation and 
Sky Service.  These carriers operate extensive passenger charter 
services both domestically and throughout the world.  In his 
policy framework announcement the minister clearly stated that 
the government would revise its policies for international 
scheduled and charter air services with a view to removing 
unnecessary restrictions on air services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure members would all agree that such a commitment is 
clearly warranted now that the industry structure appears to be 
changing.  Canada's international charter policies, for example, 
were developed in 1978.  One of its primary objectives was to 
allow charter carriers to compete effectively with scheduled 
carriers like Air Canada and Canadian Airlines for international 
leisure passengers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective has been implemented through regulations 
administered by the Canadian Transportation Agency and effected 
through a series of charter fences such as pre-booking and 
minimum stay requirements.  Therefore a policy approach that 
protects parts of the market for scheduled services from charter 
competition was deemed to be in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an environment where Canada might be faced with one dominant 
Canadian scheduled carrier operating both domestic and 
international air services, the minister has clearly signalled 
that the current degree of protection for scheduled air carriers 
from charter service competition on international routes will be 
reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has also indicated that the government intends to 
review its international scheduled air policy.  This is the 
policy framework by which the Minister of Transport exercises his 
authority to assign to specific Canadian carriers the right to 
operate scheduled international routes to specific countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than the Canada-U.S. market where any number of Canadian 
carriers may be designated, today's policy framework designation 
of international routes states that two Canadian carriers may be 
designated in markets exceeding 300,000 scheduled passenger trips 
per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In markets below that threshold only one Canadian carrier will 
be designated.  This policy framework has developed over time. 
Historically international scheduled routes were granted to Air 
Canada and CP Air, later known as Canadian Airlines 
International.  This approach was known as the division of the 
world approach whereby each carrier was assigned exclusive access 
to specific markets in order to support the broad viability of 
each carrier's operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes have evolved to make the approach more transparent and 
more competitive.  The current policy framework includes a use it 
or lose it approach whereby airlines that are granted 
designations must operate them at a minimum level of service or 
potentially lose them to another air carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the potential changes to the airline structure in Canada, 
the minister has indicated a need to revise these policies with a 
view to removing all unnecessary restrictions on air services. 
This clearly is in keeping with the objective of fostering 
competition as articulated in the new policy framework which has 
formed part of the recently released recommendations of the 
commissioner of competition in his letter to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has stated its intention to reconsider its 
approach to the 60 plus bilateral air agreements the government 
has negotiated with other countries.  We will determine the 
extent to which Canadian and foreign carriers should have more 
international route opportunities.  These agreements or treaties 
guarantee the airlines assigned by each country the right to 
operate specific international scheduled routes, the frequency of 
services permitted, the type of aircraft that may be operated, 
and even the number of airlines that may be authorized to 
operate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's bilateral air agreements are varied in their degree of 
openness.  Sometimes Canada is not able to secure at the 
negotiating table all the rights it may seek.  In the end this 
can have an impact on the kinds of services that may be operated. 
Canada does have considerable experience with open or liberal 
bilateral agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada-U.S. open skies agreement is a case in point.  Before 
the agreement was concluded some 82 city pairs received non-stop 
scheduled services.  After the agreement the number of such city 
pairs increased to 135.  Passenger traffic has increased by 8.5% 
a year.  The Canadian charter industry has remained active and 
has converted many of its services from charter to regular 
scheduled flights.  Furthermore the Canadian airline industry has 
increased it share of the Canadian-U.S. market from 43% in 1994 
to 49% in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of a restructured industry where we want to 
foster and enhance competition and provide opportunities for 
Canadian carriers to operate international scheduled services, 
the government's decision to review its approach to negotiating 
bilateral air agreements, combined with a review of its 
international air policies, will be timely and warranted.  The 
government has proposed an approach that will promote a healthy 
and viable air transport system in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
picked two words from the member's speech.  Those two words were 
transparent and competitive, that the process is transparent and 
competitive.  What is transparent is the strategy used by the 
government to make sure one company and one company only takes 
over the airlines.  It is very transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member stated that on October 26 the minister started a new 
strategy and in a new direction to see how the airline would 
eventually be taken over.  He would make the process more 
competitive by perhaps abandoning the 10% rule to allow an 
airline or a company to own more than 10% of a Canadian airline. 
We must realize that by October 26 there were only 16 days left 
in the process.  There are only 14 days left in the process now. 
Suddenly we are opening it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By some type of a miracle or coincidence Onex puts a bid in for 
14.5% Canadian ownership.  It is a coincidence.  I understand 
that, but the bottom line is that if he wanted to make the 
process competitive, should he not have changed the 10% rule at 
the very beginning of the process?  Probably a number of other 
bidders would have bid on the process at that time.  However, 74 
days into the process they have been cut out.  They will not come 
in now with a new plan so what we really have to do is extend the 
timeframe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou Sekora:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the fact is the rules have 
not changed.  We always hear from the other side some kind of 
breeze, that some miracle has happened or that something has not 
happened.  It is frightening that the member sits on the 
transport committee with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to all sides.  We are reviewing.  We have many 
witnesses to listen to.  I do not know what the intention of 
those on the other side is, but my intention is to get the best 
airline service across Canada and we must save all the jobs we

that this debate did not come to the floor of the House like the 
great historic transportation debates that took place in the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we went back to Confederation and the years thereafter, the 
House and the committee spent months on the great transportation 
debate:  The building of a railway across Canada, the national 
dream.  The only thing in the last 100 years even comparable to 
that was a little bill called the national highway strategy 
program which was a piece of paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the big issue for this century.  In the closing days of 
this century this will be the biggest transport issue since 1900 
until the new millennium comes in.  The most unfortunate thing is 
that the House first learned of everything that was going on 
through the papers.  Most of what Canadians know about this great 
debate and the merger they learned through the papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sit on the transport committee.  I have enjoyed very much 
talking to some very key witnesses.  Canadians phone me and ask 
if the same rules apply to everybody.  They want to know if there 
is a level playing field.  I cannot answer those questions but I 
have my suppositions.  However, whatever happens in this great 
debate that will always remain in the minds of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate my colleagues in the Bloc Party for 
bringing this to the floor of the House.  Whether I agree with 
the 10% increase or not is not the issue.  In the past, when we 
had these great transportation debates, we always brought in 
capital from all over the world to help us.  This happened with 
the railway and originally with the airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is an emergency.  I did not create that

the emergency.  It was going on.  Unfortunately, the story broke 
when the House was not in session.

unfortunately, and I am not blaming anyone, the House will never 
have the time, because of the urgency of this matter, to properly 
debate the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the minister is here.  I believe he has given us a 
timetable of something like November 26.  Our last witness in the 
transport committee will appear on November 24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I failed to announce that I will be sharing my time 
with the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the immediate Canadian reaction?  What are some of the 
questions?  My phone lines have been busy with people asking if 
this is a fair procedure.  The government will have to answer 
that.  Is it a fair procedure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next question they ask is:  Will it keep the regional 
airlines intact?  Coming from the west, they have fallen in love 
with WestJet.  We have received some assurances in committee that 
would take place but I would like to see that on paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental question is:  If there is only one dominant 
domestic air carrier within Canada in the future, could it really 
be said that a monopoly exists given that there is a relative 
freedom of entry into the industry?  I think that is a big 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provided a carrier can obtain a licence and meet the initial 
financial fitness test, should financial fitness be assessed on 
an ongoing basis?  We have used the word “dominant” to replace 
the word “monopoly”, with the exception of some regional 
carriers.  I submit that we will, even if it is not a necessity, 
go to a dominant, monopoly carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask if that is really necessary at this time.  I am 
not so concerned about where we get the money.  I would suggest 
to my friends in the Bloc that I do not care where the money 
comes from for these ventures, whether it comes from Germany, 
France or the United States.  In the history of the United 
States, when it developed much of its money came from Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any one time we have always had about 10% of the population 
of the United States.  We have heard from witnesses that our 
major role and major profit in this industry goes south.  That 
part does not worry me.  I do not think we should have 
limitations. That is where I disagree with the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I was in a position today to make some guarantees about 
the future of the airline industry in Canada.  Unfortunately, we 
have only had but a few weeks with just a few hours left before 
the decision is made.  Let us hope for the travelling public, 
those who must use the airline, that it is a good decision and 
that the House will in the future be notified in plenty of time 
to have a debate on this great issue, as it did with the railways 
and other great transportation issues, on the floor of the House 
and in no other place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
brief to give other members an opportunity to ask questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from the Reform Party talked about 
consultations and the short time available for consultations. I 
would simply like to compare that to the prebudget 
consultations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to him that the auditor general has found a 
$25 billion surplus in the employment insurance fund and that it 
is up to the minister to decide what to do with that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all the prebudget consultations we have had since 1993, I do 
not recall the government asking people if they agreed with the 
way the finance minister intended to use the surplus. That is a 
good indication of the government's philosophy with regard to 
consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, the Minister of Transport said—and his colleagues 
read speeches prepared by his officials—that we were initiating 
an important debate. I want to point out that the Standing 
Committee on Transport will be studying this issue until 
November 26. It was said that, within the committee, the 
majority is Liberal and does as the minister says. In the House, 
the majority is Liberal and does as the minister says. In the 
Senate, the majority is Liberal and does mostly as the minister 
says. What does the member think about consultations in that 
context? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would have liked to have 
had a pre-consultation.  I think we had plenty of time before the 
House opened in late September. I could not see any reason for 
not calling together the Standing Committee on Transport.  We 
could have had the same witnesses as we are having now.  At least 
those people assigned from each of the political parties in the 
House would have had a chance to update this.  We would have been 
able to spend more time discussing the matter with our colleagues 
who do not happen to be on the transport committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the major flaw in the whole process was that the 
government did not see fit to ask the Standing Committee on 
Transport to meet as early as possible after the gates were 
opened. 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member said that the number one issue on people's 
minds was whether the process was fair.  On August 13 the 
minister announced a 90-day window of negotiation during which he 
would receive proposals to restructure the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On day one the law of the land was and still is that the maximum 
that anybody could own of Air Canada was 10%.  Two days ago, with 
only 16 days left in the process, he has announced that he may 
change that regulation to allow any bid to maybe considerably 
more of the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering it is a standard operating procedure for government 
to call for proposals and give a window of opportunity to receive 
them, does the member feel it is fair for the minister to change 
the rules with only 16 days left when obviously nobody else has 
an opportunity to put together such a comprehensive plan that is 
required for the issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like the member's referral to the dominant monopoly carrier. 
It is very appropriate.  When the minister asked the Competition 
Bureau to review the industry, he did not ask it to look at all 
possible options, he said “Just look at my favourite option,” 
the dominant monopoly carrier theory”.  Does the member feel 
that was fair? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the basis of what I have 
learned in the papers prior to coming back to the House and on 
the basis of what I have learned from asking questions, there is 
an element there that says it was an unfair situation.  I do not 
think there is any question about it.  I think the general public 
agrees with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big question that should be asked and one that only the 
minister can answer is whether this was necessary.  If we ever 
get an answer to the question of whether it was necessary to 
change the 10% at this time, I suspect we will find that maybe 
the 10% was put there for an obvious reason.  However, it appears 
that it is being changed at this time because there is an unfair 
situation for one of the people who are presently bidding.  I do 
not think there is any question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing I want to mention about the dominant 
carrier.  I have great fear that without some discussion and 
debate in the House, we will need to have some regulatory 
legislation in this industry in the years ahead.  If that will be 
the case, and I fully suspect it will be, I hope it will come to 
the House.  I hope it does not take place as this issue has in 
the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the motion put forward by 
the Bloc Quebecois.  It is a very interesting motion, which 
affects most of us because of the employees of both Air Canada 
and Canadian Airlines who live in our ridings.  This issue is 
exceedingly important to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of their concern is that they want to know the truth about 
what is going on.  Unfortunately what we have seen is a 
polarization amongst the employees of both companies, so much so 
that it is causing an extraordinary amount of acrimony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say, and I am sure many members would agree, that 
Canadian carriers, both Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, have 
the finest staff, as well as some of the best planes in the 
world.  Oftentimes Canadians wonder what we can do, as opposed to 
the rest of the world, and we need not look any further than 
those two carriers to see Canada excelling in the airline 
transport industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, there are things we need to do to ensure we 
are not left with an airline industry in disarray, which would 
affect the employees and especially consumers who want the 
assurance that whatever comes of these discussions they will be 
protected and not left with a monopoly and the possibility of 
price gouging.  They want a fair and equitable decision for the 
employees of both airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the issue put forth by the Bloc Quebecois, which 
concerns the 10% limitation on ownership of Air Canada.  We 
already have a 25% foreign restriction on the ownership of a 
Canadian carrier.  That is a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one professes to believe in allowing the market to decide, 
and allowing strong competition, why should we prohibit any 
individual or group in this country from having greater ownership 
of Air Canada?  What is so wrong with having a person or group 
own a larger share of Air Canada or Canadian Airlines, or any 
company for that matter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not right for the government to impose those kinds of 
restrictions upon a private carrier.  It limits and creates a 
barrier to that company becoming as effective as it could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of competition, as I am sure most people here would 
agree, we would like to see two carriers, competitive, healthy 
and profitable, being able to take on not only other groups 
within Canada but also around the world, and win, which they can 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad state of affairs today, with both of these companies 
having trouble, is that we are looking toward a merger.  As my 
colleague, our critic, has mentioned before very eloquently, 
rather than having a merger take place in an environment of 
chaos, let us do it in a relatively controlled fashion so that 
market forces can take place, but we can be left at the end of 
the day with a merger that will strengthen the airline industry 
in our country.  I think that is what we all agree ought to 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a level playing field, so that both groups can compete 
or both groups can merge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth must come out about what is really going on.  The 
issue of debt levels is very important in terms of how investors 
look at both companies and there has been a lot of misinformation 
about what the debt levels are in both companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the most recent information we have, Canadian's 
debt is around $1 billion and Air Canada's is around $9 billion. 
Many of the employees of both companies do not know that.  They 
have been fed different lines as the political battles take place 
over the merger of the two companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our eloquent transport critic has mentioned, we want to 
ensure that if we are left with a single carrier there will not 
be price gouging and there will be legislation in place to 
protect the public from it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of service to small communities, given the nature 
of our country, its broad scope and sparse populations, we need 
access to adequate transportation facilities, in particular by 
air.  We want to make sure that people in remote areas will be 
serviced properly and we will press the Minister of Transport to 
make sure that whatever comes of this there will be consideration 
in the legislation to ensure that those people living in remote 
areas will be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employees of Air Canada have a legitimate concern about 
their rights.  Because they have a younger staff, if or when they 
merge with Canadian Airlines, they fear they will be taken over 
and put at the bottom of the barrel.  That would not be fair and 
it would not be equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, Canadian Airlines' workers fear that if they 
are to be merged with Air Canada, which has a larger number of 
employees, their numbers will diminish and they will lose 
employees, which would be equally unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask the Minister of Transport to ensure that there will be 
fair and equitable treatment of the employees of both Air Canada 
and Canadian Airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the proposed legislation to review the airline 
merger, there are a couple of points that we would like to put 
before the Minister of Transport.  First, we take offence to and 
oppose the Competition Bureau being reduced from its legislative 
role to an advisory role.  We would also like to see the 
transport committee take a larger role in this and advise the 
minister as to how this should take place.  Members of that 
committee should be involved.  The Competition Bureau, with its 
rules and regulations governing competition within the country, 
should not be suspended for this particular merger.  That is not 
correct.  It also adds an element of partiality which I know the 
minister would not like to see in this particular merger, given 
the well known connections that he and the government have with 
Onex Corporation.  However, that should not preclude Onex from 
having a fair go at being able to merge these groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I would like to say that members on all sides of the 
House are very much in favour of ensuring that whatever comes out 
of the Air Canada-Canadian Airlines trade war, which is what it 
is, we will be left at the end of the day with a strong airline 
industry which will be profitable and able to continue to take on 
competition and win in the aggressive airline transportation 
industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I realize that my friend was not particularly 
enamoured with the fact that under section 47 the bureau was 
given an advisory role, but I think he will agree that the report 
which has come from the bureau in the last few days is a 
comprehensive one and certainly has helped us, helped me, in 
developing the guidelines which I brought before the committee on 
Wednesday of this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not now fully appreciate the fact that 
under the framework that I announced the bureau will very much be 
back in the picture, approving the merger, every aspect of the 
merger, negotiating with any proposer who comes forward and that 
this is a very crucial safeguard on the very essential issue of 
competition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. Minister 
of Transport for his question.  Yes, we would like to ensure that 
the Competition Bureau will have significant input.  What the 
minister said is obviously true, and we would definitely support 
that.  We also want to make sure that members of parliament who 
are on the transport committee have a strong voice in what takes 
place.  As members of the House are representatives of the 
people, the people should have a role to play, an understanding 
and a vote on what takes place in this competitive merger.  The 
people, by virtue of the members who are in the House, should not 
and cannot be excluded from this process.  They must be involved 
in it as well as the Competition Bureau.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, during question period, in response to a question put 
by the hon. member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, the transport 
minister said that Marc Lalonde works for Air Canada. Today, 
Michel C. Auger maintains that the transport minister is working 
full time for his friends from Onex, who are being very generous 
toward his political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my Reform colleague if he also believes that the 
transport minister has put his cards on the table and is not on 
the payroll of Onex. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that the 
member ask the Minister of Transport that question himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would refer the member to the following:  Why did the Bloc 
Quebecois say today that Canadian Airlines is being 
discriminatory against francophones?  That is an insult to the 
60,000 employees, both francophone and anglophone, who work hard 
for Canadian Airlines.  It is an insult to every francophone who 
works for Canadian Airlines that members of the Bloc Quebecois 
would say that Canadian Airlines is somehow anti-French.  That is 
nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would like to make is, why is there an 
obligation for Air Canada to have its headquarters— 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply asked the hon. 
member from the Reform Party for his opinion. Neither I nor a 
member of my political party have ever insulted Canadian 
Airlines International. I regularly fly with this airline and my 
language rights have always been respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to withdraw his remarks. They were 
insulting. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is obviously a 
point of debate, but the hon. member for Frontenac—Mégantic has 
had the opportunity to put his words eloquently on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to speak 
to my hon. friend from the Bloc Quebecois.  I was not accusing 
him, but there are members of his party who said that today and I 
will prove it to him privately after this.  I will show him the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I wanted to make is, why is there an obligation 
in the law of this land to ensure that Air Canada is forced to 
have its headquarters in Montreal?  Air Canada should have the 
same flexibility as any company to have its headquarters where it 
likes.  I think it would be fair to allow Air Canada to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the point of whether the minister is or is not involved in 
any of this, that is an issue for the member to ask the minister, 
not me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Unfortunately, the 
time for questions and comments has expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a point of order should not 
be taken from debate time.

made that the point of order should not be taken from debate

is my pleasure today to speak to the opposition motion.  I will 
share my time with the member for Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion reminded me of what happened in the early days of 
aircraft flying.  I am reminded of a story told by Bishop Wright 
one Sunday in church when he was lecturing to the congregation. 
At that time there were two significant things happening.  One 
was that there were to be blood transfusions coming out of 
Stanford and he thought that was not a good thing.  There was no 
mention of it in the Bible.  As well, he said “I hear that some 
people have developed some of these metal things that can fly”. 
He said “Ladies and gentlemen of the congregation, I want to 
tell you that flying is only reserved for angels”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is here to make legislative changes, but those 
changes have to be what is best for Canadians.  The country is 
large and has a northern climate.  There are airports in many 
remote areas.  Canadians would like to be able to get across this 
country as often as they can and as cheaply as they can.  Every 
once in a while when it gets a little cold they want to go south. 
As a member of the transport committee, the question I have is 
what is in the best interests of the public and how can we get 
there?  The minister has outlined five points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the debate today is that it is being clouded by 
extemporaneous things.  We have our own little nuances and little 
enclaves because we are a federation. We have to look beyond the 
federation to see how the system can be better while being 
reminded that this is a Canadian institution.  None of us in the 
House, including members on this side, will ever give that up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to have full control of the Canadian airline industry. 
So far we have done well.  We started with Air Canada which had a 
lot of help from the government.  The government helped Air 
Canada get on its feet.  As always happens in this place, when 
Air Canada started making money the opposition did not like it 
and we had to privatize it.  We said it was okay, that it could 
fly on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on we did the same thing for Canadian Airlines in a 
balanced approach.  We gave it some international routes and 
allowed it some slots in British airports.  It is working quite 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transport committee heard from the Canadian Transportation 
Agency.  It heard from the Competition Bureau.  They have a lot 
of resources, skills and experience.  They told us that we have 
benefited from deregulation over the last number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the Minister of Transport got up one morning and 
decided that the industry had a problem.  We ended up with this 
problem because of the changes in the international market, in 
international allegiances and alliances and because things do 
change in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Too much bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson:</B>  A member of the opposition says 
there is too much bureaucracy.  We want to get rid of that too 
and that is what we will try to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are repair facilities in one part of the country and head 
offices in other parts.  Pilots on both sides are lobbying. 
Members of parliament are getting antsy.  They are being pushed 
in one direction or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main point is what is in the best interests of the public. 
Can they get access to their communities?  Will the fares be as 
cheap as possible because there is enough competition in the 
marketplace?  Can they have better flights and faster routing 
using other systems?  That is what we are examining.  As far as I 
know, every time the government has changed regulations it has 
been for the better.  That is what I hear when I am in the 
transport committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc is trying to tell us that we should stick to the 10% 
rule.  It may be what we end up doing.  However, it must not be 
in the legislative framework as the Bloc is trying to do here 
today, to force us to make a decision based on something that we 
do not know anything about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two airlines are competing to see who is going to take the 
position when the dust has settled and the shareholders have 
decided.  These are corporate moves.  We will be faced with 
having to make a decision.   The minister has listened to public 
forums and gathered all the needed information. He asked the 
Competition Bureau to look at it.  He asked the regulators to 
look at it.  When this offer comes before us we want all our 
options open.  We will make a decision and the decision will be 
that Canadians will still effectively have control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is will there be effective control?  Will small 
communities be serviced?  Will the rights of the workers be 
respected and looked after?  Will their contracts be looked at so 
they do not lose benefits they are currently getting?  Will that 
be handled in a proper fashion?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the

let the public interest be handled by Canadians and people who

more and more regularly and at the best rate possible. However, 
I have difficulty with his reasoning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot see how this will be possible with only one airline

there is no competition for prices. Right now, we can choose 
between two or three airlines the one whose schedules and prices 
suit us best.

that plane tickets will be cheaper and service will be better 
when there is only one airline left. That does not make sense. I 
cannot understand his reasoning. If there were only one 
restaurant in his hometown, it would cost him a mint of money to 
eat there, he would not get any service and he would have to 
wait for hours before being served.

I think he has been to some of the transport committee meetings.

will be a dominant carrier, there are ways and means to make sure 
we keep that competition, that the small areas are looked after 
and that the pilots are looked after. 
We are looking into all of that.  We cannot reach the 
conclusion that the technique we are going to use is good or bad

was just under $5,000.  His take home pay was just under $3,000. 
Over $2,000 was deducted for transportation, handling and the

grain marketed by this hardworking husband and father who is 
trying to make a living for his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can farmers survive under these conditions?  Their input 
costs are enormous.  The price they get for their grain is

Canadian farmers are not being left alone to face the current 
income crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has moved to the aid of Canadian farmers by 
providing $1.5 billion over two years through the agricultural 
income disaster assistance program, or AIDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far 16,000 farmers across the country have received over $200 
million in aid.  This amounts to an average of $15,000 per 
farmer.  However, we need to do a lot more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Liberal MPs from Manitoba met an all-party delegation 
where we discussed changes to the AIDA program with the intention 
of getting urgently needed resources to the family farms.  Over 
the next few weeks, we will be working closely with that same 
delegation to ensure that urgent resources move quickly to those 
farms in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

quit and retrain, a TAGS program for farmers.  We know how well 
that worked.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the applications do not come in they cannot be dealt with. We 
are dealing with them at the rate of 1,500 applications a week. 
Over $220 million has been put out to farmers already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the hon. member and the House that the $900 million in 
the AIDA fund will go to farmers.  The applications are 
indicating that it will.  They say $900 million is not

meaningful when the $600 million of provincial money goes with 
it, to make $1.5 billion.

the Reform Party would bleed Canadian families dry; not one penny 
of EI cuts for Canadian families.  The only people who would 
benefit from the Reform Party tax plan would be corporations and 
rich Canadians.  We will simply not adopt that agenda.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday a British judge ordered seven jail terms ranging 
between seven and fourteen years for the crime of people 
smuggling which has been likened to the new day slave trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995 out of 12 convictions for the crime of people 
smuggling in Canada, not one jail term was handed out. I repeat 
that of the 12 convicted of people smuggling, not one of them was 
sentenced to a single day in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>England got tough.  The United States got tough.  Australia got 
tough.  This government by its lack of action has made Canada a 
primary target for people smugglers. Why? 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to put out to the member and 
to all Canadians that Canada has among the world's toughest 
legislation to deal with people smuggling, with up to half a 
million dollars in fines and up to 10 years in jail.  It is up to 
the judges to determine what sentences are appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that we have among the toughest legislation, we are 
also proposing to increase those fines and jail terms to send a 
message to our courts that we will not tolerate people smuggling. 
We want those individuals who are found guilty to be prosecuted 
to the full extent of the law and for the courts to do their part 
as well.

Jeannine Basile, of Telefilm Canada, admitted in a letter she

that companies that were “largely bogus (firms) could have 
existed at the time when programs to deduct depreciation costs 
were still around”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has said that he takes every opportunity to 
tell the Europeans and the Americans that they are wrong, and we

cannot afford to be dead right about this. Canadian farmers 
cannot be expected to pay the price for Canada being dead right 
about this.

peaceful means for murder will not produce peace, killing will 
not build reconciliation and violence will not secure a common

recently that they gained freedom and built a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few years ago Armenia was hit by a terrible earthquake.

Minister of Armenia and several parliamentarians were killed 
while carrying out their parliamentary duties.

following this tragedy, which will mark their history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also wants to express its dismay at such 
brutal acts, which have no place in a democracy. We all remember 
that a similar event occurred in Quebec's national assembly 
about 15 years ago.

Armenian parliament yesterday, in expressing our condolences to 
the families of those who were assassinated and to the people of 
Armenia, and in saying that I think it particularly reprehensible 
that this kind of thing should have happened in a parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me, and I am sure for parliamentarians around the world, 
parliament is the antithesis of violence.  It may be a place 
where we exchange views in a spirited way, but it is a place

non-violent way by talking to each other and by observing the 
rule of law. 
For this kind of thing to happen inside a parliament is 
particularly deplorable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
raise a point of order about a very grave matter, indeed.  Racism 
has no place in the House, as I am sure you will agree, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During debate last night I made the comment, and I quote “we 
see that one has been in chains for years and years”.  One MP 
from the Reform Party benches immediately said “Like him”, 
referring to me.  The official record of the House, 
<I>Hansard</I>, has recorded those words forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Racism is no laughing matter.  Certainly the suffering of black 
slaves in chains is a terrible thing.  I raise this point of 
order not only as a black MP but on behalf of the dignity of the 
House and all Canadians fighting racism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disreputable and unparliamentary language has no place in the 
House.  As we set an example for children and families throughout 
the country, racism can neither be overlooked or condoned, 
especially within the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the MP who said those words to set a positive example 
for our youth and for all of us.  I call on the MP to have the 
conscience and fortitude to admit his words, withdraw his 
comments and set an example by apologizing to people of colour, 
to his colleagues in the House, and to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, through this we can move forward and use this as a 
example of how to fight racism in our workplace.  I hope through 
this point of order to have some good come out of something very 
bad.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Halifax West has not 
named another member of parliament so I find I am a bit at a loss 
to have someone withdraw unless I know who the hon. member is 
referring to.  Does the hon. member have a name that I can 
address so this person can tell us what happened? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, I was in 
the midst of a very important speech and did not look at the 
member who said it.  I know it was a Reform member.  The fact 
that it is recorded means that the individual doing the recording 
must know who this person is.  More importantly, I believe the 
member himself knows who he is and what he said and I would hope 
that he, in good conscience, would come forward, admit and 
apologize. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member made a very serious accusation.  Equally serious is 
the fact that he does not know who said it or particularly where 
it came from.  How is it possible to stand up in the House and 
make an accusation not only against one of our colleagues in the 
House but against a party when in fact he does not even know if 
it is in fact from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member, in all fairness, that if he does not know then 
he should actually retract his comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I find the suggestion that somehow the hon. member for Halifax 
West should withdraw his remarks ridiculous on the face of it 
when <I>Hansard</I> actually records the fact that this was said. 
The member has said that he knows full well that it came from the 
Reform Party.  He has made that claim and will stand by it.  The 
fact is that somebody in the House said this.  Whoever that 
person was ought to own up to it and withdraw it for all the good 
reasons that the member for Halifax West elucidated in his 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party, instead of trying to defend this and trying to 
avoid the reality of this, should show a little more shame and 
say they will find out who among their members did this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
somehow appeal to not only you, but also to the member making the 
accusation, that perhaps he has jumped ahead in an interpretation 
of what was said.  It seems to me that when he says that we are 
in chains, he in fact is very free.  Could the meaning not have 
been that the members are not now also physically in chains as 
this member is not?  That would be the charitable interpretation 
of this statement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as a member of the Reform Party and somebody of mixed 
background, I find it personally offensive that the member from 
the NDP would make such a claim on this party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read <I>Hansard</I> and <I>Hansard</I> clearly states that 
an hon. member made a claim “Just like him”.  I would put to 
the member, who is also of mixed background, that he cannot claim 
at all that the comment was made by this party.  As a member of 
this party, I can tell the House right now that there is not a 
single racist bone in this party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will recognize the hon. member for 
Palliser, but I ask him, is he prepared to identify the hon. 
member? 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was in

</I></B></P><P align=left> The House resumed consideration of the motion, and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be dividing my time with the Liberal member for 
Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking today in the context of the policy framework made 
public earlier this week by the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must thank the minister for appearing before the Standing 
Committee on Transport and all of its members. 
His vision of a Canadian airline industry that is not only safe 
and prosperous, but also meets the needs of Canadians in the XXI 
century is clear and lucid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That vision identifies the issues requiring government action 
and the areas in which such action will make it possible to 
strengthen this industry on the eve of the new millennium.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the questions being debated is the possibility of 
amending the Air Canada Public Participation Act.  Under this 
legislation, no individual or group of individuals may hold or 
control more than 10% of voting shares in Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Air Canada was privatized in 1988 and the Air Canada Public 
Participation Act came into effect, the view at the time was 
that Air Canada shares should be spread over a large shareholder 
base.  Whether that point of view is still valid in 1999 is 
debatable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his statement on his policy last Tuesday, the minister 
indicated that he was prepared to increase this limit, if, and 
only if, doing so would help achieve the objective of a 
prosperous airline industry under Canadian control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end, the minister asked the two Standing Committees on 
Transport to examine the question of the 10% limit and, after 
consulting the main stakeholders and considering the future of 
the industry, to make recommendations on a possible change to 
this limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the members of this House know that the airline industry 
must undergo major changes; they are inevitable. 
The broad policy for the restructuring of the airline industry 
in Canada the minister presented to us establishes guidelines 
for the transformation of an industry, currently comprising two 
main carriers, into an industry in which a dominant carrier will 
emerge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, the public at large, consumer associations, 
independent carriers, travel agents and other stakeholders have 
raised serious concerns about the impact of consolidation on 
competition in the airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, in my big region of Abitibi—Baie James—Nunavik, with over 
36 airports, and airlines such as Air Inuit, Air Creebec, First 
Air, Air Boréal and Air Wemindji, First Air is the third largest 
regularly scheduled airline in Canada and its Inuit owned parent 
company, Makivik, is paying close attention to statements and 
actions by the various groups in the reorganization of the 
airline industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fear is that a dominant carrier could, by design or 
inadvertently, act unfairly.  Such action would eliminate or 
limit competition with the intent of controlling air traffic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August of this year, Canada's Minister of Transport wrote to 
Konrad Von Finckenstein in his capacity as Commissioner of the 
Competition Bureau.  In particular, the minister called on the 
commissioner and the bureau to help the government develop a 
position that would take the interests of Canadians into 
account, while giving the private sector the necessary leeway to 
develop proposals for the structure of a viable industry. The 
bureau's response, dated October 22, was made public last 
Tuesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes to examine certain issues 
having to do with domestic competition that were identified by 
the Competition Bureau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring here to the issue of predatory pricing and to the 
issue of airport access. 
The Competition Bureau notes that a dominant carrier will have 
both the incentive and ability to engage in various types of 
anti-competitive behaviour, including predation. Within the 
airline industry, predatory behaviour can take various forms, 
including predatory pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Predatory pricing occurs when an airline temporarily sets low 
fares to inflict losses on one or more rival airlines, or 
matches fares while adding additional capacity. Once it has 
eliminated the competitor, the carrier restores higher prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy framework announced by the federal Minister of 
Transport deals with this very issue.  The document states that 
“Small and new entrant carriers are potentially vulnerable to 
excessively aggressive competitive attacks from a larger, 
established airline. 
Small carriers run the risk that a dominant carrier may try to 
drive them out of a market or out of business by substantially 
lowering fares and increasing capacity in the short run with the 
intention of recovering the short term losses with price 
increases in the long run”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially, consumers might seem to benefit from lower prices, 
but the long term result will be a narrower range of choices and 
higher prices.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Minister of Transport stated that predatory prices 
will not be tolerated. According to the overall policy, the 
Government of Canada must ensure that effective measures are 
taken to deal with abuse in the air transportation industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner recommended that some sections of the 
Competition Act and its regulations be amended to grant him the 
authority to act in this area. Under the overall policy of the 
federal Minister of Transport, the government recognizes that 
this is a key issue which must be dealt with decisively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has asked the House and Senate committees to make 
recommendations on the best way to reach this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, small or new air carriers have trouble gaining access to 
airports. This is a complex problem that was also examined in 
detail by the Competition Bureau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to be competitive, new Canadian carriers must get 
reasonable access to departure and arrival slots as well as 
various airport facilities, such as boarding gates, loading 
bridges and ticket counters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government intends to come up with innovative ways 
to facilitate access to airports. I would like to elaborate on 
this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A “slot” is an expected time of departure or arrival that is 
available or allocated to a specific airline, for a specific 
date, at a specific airport. Take, for example, Toronto's 
Pearson airport. It is the only Canadian airport that is 
currently operating at full capacity. It is also the airport 
where most new entrant carriers will want to land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A carrier created by merging Air Canada and Canadian Airlines 
would use up a large portion of the slots at Toronto's airport, 
particularly during peak hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the slots are reserved for carriers as long as they need 
them, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for other 
carriers to get enough slots to establish new services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy framework announced by the federal Minister of 
Transport deals with this specific issue. 
It notes that independent carriers and airport authorities have 
identified access to airport facilities at the large congested 
airports as a potential barrier to competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without being able to offer services at Lester B. Pearson 
International Airport in Toronto and other major airports, new 
entrant carriers and other small carriers will not be able to 
compete effectively against a dominant carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy framework states that the dominant carrier may need 
to give up some of its access to congested runways so that other 
airlines can add to their domestic services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guidelines or regulations to ensure fair and competitive 
allocation of slots may be needed at Toronto and at any other 
airports where slot control proves necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines would ensure that a reasonable portion of the 
surrendered slots comes from the most congested times, days and 
seasons, as these slots are the hardest to obtain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, in a restructured industry with a dominant 
carrier, it will be necessary to promote competition. The 
government intends to put in place the necessary mechanisms to 
encourage the arrival of new entrant carriers and the growth of 
existing ones, such as First Air, Air Inuit, Air Québec, Air 
Canada, Air Wemindji, Canadian Airlines and others in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
colleague from Abitibi—Baie James—Nunavik comes from a region 
similar to the north shore. It is served frequently by two 
airlines, but services are very limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will have to convince me that the level of air 
transportation services depends on the merger. Will a merger 
ensure efficient air transportation services in the regions, be 
it through Onex, Air Canada or Canadian? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quality of services at airports is already in jeopardy. 
Services in the regions have been diminishing. The frequency of 
flights is left up to the carriers. The price of a ticket is 
very high for travellers who have to fly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member for Abitibi—Baie James—Nunavik to reassure 
me that the transport minister's involvement and his being in 
connivance with Onex on this issue will in no way hinder any 
possible agreement between Canadian and Air Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Onex were to acquire Air Canada and Canadian, I have my 
doubts, I fear, and I am almost convinced that this company 
would serve American interests first and foremost. I would 
rather we maintain our autonomy with regard to air 
transportation, with Canadians keeping control of the airline 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien: </B>Madam Speaker, I have taken careful note of 
the hon. member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am indeed from a large region encompassing Abitibi, 
Témiscamingue and Nunavik. It is the largest region in all ten 
Canadian provinces, with an area of 802,000 square kilometres, 
36 airports, a population of 100,000, and 68 mayors, counting 
the aboriginal chiefs and mayors in Nunavik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee, the Minister of Transport spoke several times of 
northern communities and small communities.  On October 12, I 
introduced Motion M-129 to the House, to protect northern Quebec. 
On October 19, I asked some questions in a transport committee 
meeting.  I also did so on October 26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I made a statement in the House, precisely to send a 
message about the north to the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Davis, the President of First Air, is asking the minister to 
oppose any agreement that does not specifically guarantee the 
interests of northern consumers, the people of the Arctic and of 
Northern Quebec, and those of the aviation industry and its 
employees, airports and investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of Makivik, Peta Aatami, said the same thing I 
have said several times here in this House: AThe federal 
government is legally and morally responsible for protecting the 
interests of the Inuit covered by the James Bay and Northern 
Quebec Agreement who could be affected by any reorganization of 
the Canadian air industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the member's question, the Government of Canada 
stated, as outlined in the minister's speech, that it was going 
to respect small communities, both those in the south and those 
in major centres such as Val d'Or and Amos, as well as the 
airports at Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Matagami and Radisson. I could go 
on, there being 68 in all within my riding.  Particularly in the 
Sept-Îles sector and other parts of Northern Quebec, the 
Government of Canada must respect the progress that has been 
made in air transportation to date. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as a 
member of the previous Progressive Conservative government, 
which brought us deregulation and astronomical increases in 
fares, including for our region, while promising us that this 
deregulation would promote competition and thus lower fares, the 
member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik is not worried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He must know that the basic fare for a flight from Rouyn to 
Montreal and back is over $600.  In addition, does the fact that 
an American company, namely American Airlines, will indirectly 
become the owner, and that this will be a quasi-monopoly, or just 
about, not worry him even more? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should rise in his place and denounce the Onex proposal, 
which will have a disastrous impact on a region such as ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member has asked me 
whether I should not be speaking out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have nothing to learn from the separatists and the péquistes. 
We need only mention Québec Air.  What did they do?  The PQ 
government never held any hearings before the transport 
committee.  It signed orders.  It did not protect northern 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I am here to protect northern Canadians, and that is what 
I am going to do.  My message is that I am here to defend my 
constituents. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today to my party's motion to maintain the 
provisions of section 6.1(a) of the Air Canada Public 
Participation Act limiting ownership of the capital stock of Air 
Canada by any person or group to 10% of the voting shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that this government's conduct is disturbing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everywhere I have been—last night, I attended two meetings and 
200 people came to the first one—I can tell you there was 
unanimity within the community and among groups, and the Bloc 
Quebecois is leading a fierce battle and will continue to do so. 
Looking at what the government is doing today, I would never 
have believed a democratically elected government could stoop so 
low in its loyalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think transparency is being dealt a terrible blow and this 
government does not have notion of what justice is. This is 
purely and simply a dictatorship. I indicated earlier that there 
was unanimity within the community and the business community in 
particular, but the media are unanimous as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who paid attention to the media, both print and 
broadcast, this morning, noted that they were hard on the 
government. I would like to quote two articles, because if I had 
to quote all those I read this morning, I could go on all 
afternoon, and if we had to record everything that was said on 
television last night and this morning, we would not get out of 
here tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article I will quote is from the <I>Journal de Montréa</I>l and is 
written by Michel C. Auger. It is entitled “Alas, he is a 
minister.” It reads: “If David Collenette were a judge, we could 
easily—” 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I must interrupt the hon. 
member. The member knows full well that a minister or a member 
of this House cannot be named and that quoting something cannot 
be used as an excuse to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier:</B> Madam Speaker, that is how the article 
reads, and I asked permission to read the article, but I will 
refer to the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could easily have him disqualified for being biased in the 
matter of the airline merger. Unfortunately, he is a minister. 
For quite some time we suspected the Minister of Transport— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the Bloc Quebecois speaking. That is what was 
written in the paper this morning. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—of being biased in favour of the Onex proposal, if only because 
of the remarkably close ties that exist between that company, 
Canadian Airlines International, and the Liberal Party of 
Canada. Tuesday, before the transport committee of the House of 
Commons, the Minister of Transport provided the last piece of 
evidence proving that he is indeed biased with regard to this 
issue. 
He announced that the federal government was prepared to 
suspend—without asking for anything in return—the application of 
the act that prevents an individual or a company to hold more 
than 10% of Air Canada shares. The 10% rule is important because 
it is the only legal obstacle to the Onex proposal, which is the 
only proposal that requires such a change. Such a rule limiting 
concentration of ownership was included, mind you, in 
practically all transactions to privatize Crown corporations 
over the last few years. While in the public interest, this 
limitation will be waived by the government in support of a 
proposal made by a private company. 
Most importantly, it was the only lever available to the federal 
government to have a direct influence on this transaction, which 
will determine to a large extent the future of air 
transportation in Canada. It is a rather unique situation. Onex 
made a proposal that could not even be considered without an 
amendment to an act of parliament. Practically at the first 
opportunity, the government announced that it would agree to 
this request and not ask anything in return.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the transport minister means by “parliamentary 
consultation”. It is a kind of consultation that is completely 
meaningless because it comes after the fact, after the vote on 
Onex's offer by Air Canada's shareholders. 
We might as well say that the transport minister works for Onex. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not say it, it is in today's paper. The article goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, if we do not allow the government to modify the 10% 
rule, Onex's offer will die. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could always believe that the government does not want Air 
Canada to win by default. However, there must be an amendment to 
an act of parliament to make Onex's offer legal. That must be 
justified by saying that the Canadian public will gain something 
from it. Better guarantees for air service in remote areas could 
have been required. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in my riding, on the north shore, the distance 
between Ottawa and Sept-Îles is 1,200 kilometres. And the price 
of tickets is very high. A trip from Ottawa to Sept-Îles costs 
more than $1,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know of many corporations that have got, with nothing in 
return, such favours from a government, when their bids were 
contrary to the law and could not have been made to the 
interested shareholders? But the Minister of Transport had 
nothing to ask for in return. We might as well say right away 
the minister works for Onex. 
Meanwhile, it has to be noted that this same government and this 
same minister did not lift a finger to help Air Canada, the more 
profitable of the two corporations, but the one that is 
unfortunate enough not to have friends in high places among the 
friends and the bagmen of the Liberal Party of Canada. 
What is even more ironic is when the minister states that once 
the airlines merger is completed, the government intends to be 
very watchful of the new monopoly, that it intends to protect 
the rights of consumers and the rights of official language 
minorities and that it will deal severely with any attempt to 
inflate prices. 
In short, the government intends to watch closely the new 
monopoly, but it claims that it has no role to play in the 
creation of the new monopoly and that it is letting market 
forces determine everything. As long, of course, as the market 
sees to it that the friends of the government end up the 
winners. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really wanted to quote this article. I think I will only skim 
over the other one. I will not read from it, but comment on it. 
I will defend the position of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this morning's issue of <I>Le Droit</I>, we see that on air 
transportation “The Liberals do not agree with each other”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But where are the Liberals? During the last campaign, a Liberal 
delegation came in my riding and told us not to stay behind the 
boards, but jump on to the ice instead. Where are the Liberal 
members for Quebec now, when they should be jumping in and 
exposing the unfairness of this government? We know for a fact 
that, in this government, only one vote counts, the Prime 
Minister's vote. If he votes yea, all Liberal members vote the 
same way. If the votes nay, they all say nay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do have a spokesperson. But the parrots all keep repeating 
what their boss says. They have marching orders. That is how the 
government views democracy. 
Did members ever see the hon. member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges 
stand up for Quebecers in the House and disagree with the 
government? Where is he? He keeps repeating the same old story 
and he tries to come up with a defence for the transport 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry, but the hon. 
member's time has expired.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the minister told the transport committee “Safety 
remains Transport Canada's top priority”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes some nerve on the part of an MP or a minister to say 
such things. 
How can the minister explain that, in Quebec's north shore and 
Gaspé region, we have had three plane crashes in eight months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Mira Aviation plane crashed on landing in Gaspé.A Nordair plane 
crashed in Sept-Îles, in the riding of Manicouagan. People were 
injured and the passengers had to call for help, because no one 
had seen the crash. Finally, an Air Satellite plane crashed in 
Baie-Comeau on December 7. That accident was witnessed by a 
six-year old girl, from her parents' residence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government delegated to Nav Canada 
responsibility for transport safety, Nav Canada made cuts at the 
expense of passenger safety. It reduced the number of air 
traffic controllers, shut down control towers, and eliminated 
firefighting  services at airports. Now, the federal government 
wants to privatize those airports, which already are not viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My questions to the hon. member for Manicouagan are as follows. 
Does he think that, in the region of Manicouagan and 
particularly in Sept-Îles—which is currently served by two 
airlines, namely Air Alliance and Canadian Airlines—the airport 
will be more viable? Will there be better customer service? Will 
travel agencies in his riding gain anything? They create jobs in 
his riding and provide ticket, reservation and checking 
services. The number of passengers will increase. Since 1996, 
travel agencies have been losing money. Yet, they create jobs. 
Could the hon. member tell me about his concern regarding 
current versus future airline services in Sept-Îles, which is the 
largest city of his riding of Manicouagan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my 
hon. colleague from Charlevoix. I congratulate him on the 
excellent work he is doing on the transport committee. His 
question gives me the opportunity to tell the House about a 
scandal that occurred at the Sept-Îles airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is not spent on enhancing security in the transportation 
industry, as the hon. member for Charlevoix pointed out. When I 
was city councillor, we were told that the airport was being 
transferred to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was against the project, because the airport, which was 
located in my ward, came with an annual deficit of $2 million, 
$2.2 million to be exact. However, the city council met and I was 
there when we were told “Give us five minutes and we will 
explain how you can get rid of the $2 million deficit”. I said 
“You have been running a $2 million deficit every year for 30 
years now. That is $60 million. Why were these measures not 
taken before today?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They started by saying “We have a firefighting service with 
trucks and 9 firefighters that we pay for year round and have 
never been put to task. Besides, if there were a fire, there 
would not be enough pressure, as there is not enough water. We 
have a pumper, but it is not powerful enough. We have to get 
help from the Sept-Îles firefighters. There were two fires and 
both times the firefighters from the city of Sept-Îles were 
called to do the work. So we will get rid of the firefighting 
service and save almost a million dollars”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told that there were three airstrips and only one was in 
use. It is 1,000 feet longer that the average strip and 50 feet 
wider. It can handle a departure and a landing every ten 
minutes. We could save $800,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a restaurant that took up a whole floor and cost 
$300,000 in heating bills. We were told it could be moved 
downstairs, that service would be better and the savings would 
be $200,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, they reduced the deficit and there will even be a small 
surplus this year. 
This goes to show how the money was utterly wasted at Sept-Îles 
airport. However, security services are being cut, even though 
we have had fatal accidents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, we are 
debating today a motion tabled by the Bloc Quebecois asking the 
House of Commons to reaffirm its desire to maintain a provision 
of the act limiting the ownership by any company or person to 10 
per cent of the voting shares of a corporation, especially in 
the case at hand of the eventual purchase of Air Canada by Onex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very seldom do we see a government intervene in a battle for 
control between private sector corporations by loading the dices 
as it has done in the present case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody will succeed in convincing us today that the government 
was not in league with Onex from the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at each stage of the process leading to the present 
situation—Onex' last offer was made only an hour and a half 
ago—and see how the actions of Onex and the government add up to 
what the member for Roberval described during today's Oral 
Question Period as “the crater we are inexorably headed for, 
which is the acceptance of the Onex project”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, Onex is the company which will take control, and 
which has a particular interest in this acquisition. One wonders 
about its long term intentions for the companies that it is 
trying to buy, Canadian Airlines and Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very strange to note that, on the subject of these two 
firms, Canadian Airlines and Air Canada, the one in the greater 
financial difficulty today is Canadian Airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If no changes are made at this point, Canadian Airlines' ability 
to carry on business in the coming quarters is very limited.  It 
will probably have major problems—and this will not be the 
first time, because it has already had them—and, surprisingly, 
on a number of occasions, this very government, the federal 
government has come to its aid.  Whether by providing foreign 
routes, or by providing funding when American Airlines arrived 
on the scene the first time, the federal government has always 
helped to bail out Canadian Airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time, however, it is becoming a bit too indecent to 
artificially support the company.  Accordingly, a new player has 
arrived—Onex—which intends to join Canadian, with American 
Airlines behind the scenes, to take control of Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada is the more profitable of the two companies, is the 
only potentially profitable one of the two and is being taken 
over by the other because of this intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if last minute information gives the impression of a 
certain number of parameters being changed, it is not in fact 
the case when we look at the long term, the change to the rule 
of 10% is not insignificant in what is going on.  It serves to 
give the advantage to the player or the hand holding the strings 
behind Canadian and behind Onex—American Airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is making fine speeches about “allowing the 
shareholders to speak, and when a definitive scenario has been 
decided upon—”, that is what the government is saying, “when it 
is all over, we are going to look after the interests of 
consumers and everyone else.” The government is setting out 
broad principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one point, this government suspended part of the Competition 
Act and decided or announced that the 10% limit would be 
changed. All of a sudden and as if by chance, the very week of 
the deadline—the companies wishing to make a take-over have until 
midnight tonight—the minister announced his intention to review 
the 10% rule and demonstrate a very open mind.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to believe that the people from Onex, who seem to 
have a great familiarity with the people in the Liberal Party, 
the Prime Minister and the Minister of Transport, who are great 
pals, were not kept informed of the government's intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course that would be very hard to prove, but the actions, the 
outcome and the progress of this matter demonstrate very clearly 
that there is a very close collaboration between certain people 
in government—those with influence and decision makers, anyway—and 
the people from Onex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where will all this take us? It will lead to a situation where 
the strongest of the two companies will find itself in a weaker 
position. In this case, Quebec, where Air Canada is well 
established, will suffer more job losses because of the federal 
government's involvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This also makes us wonder about a number of other issues in 
terms of the future, if the airline industry were to become 
predominantly influenced and controlled by a foreign company 
such as American Airlines, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that air transportation in the 
Abitibi—Témiscamingue region is not a top priority for American 
Airlines. What will happen to our regions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We Bloc Quebecois members represent the regions of Quebec. 
I want to clarify something. Here in Ottawa, people talk about 
Quebec as if it were a single region. But the regions of Quebec 
include the North Shore, Lower St. Lawrence, 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and Abitibi—Témiscamingue regions. When we 
talk about regional air transportation, we are not referring to 
Montreal-Toronto, but to air transportation to and from our 
regional centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned. Earlier, my colleagues mentioned that 
airports had been taken over by the communities. If passenger 
and freight volumes go down, it will change the 
cost-effectiveness figures for the organizations that manage air 
traffic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many things to consider. I am not even talking about 
airfares, which have already increased drastically since 
deregulation, with the result that it is now very difficult for 
people living in regions to travel at an affordable price. 
A traveller who did not plan his or her trip between Rouyn and 
Montreal well ahead of time to take advantage of a major rebate 
is looking at a round trip fare of more than $600. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contrast, those flying out of Montreal or Toronto can travel 
quite far for the same $600. There is something indecent about 
this, particularly when you think that, because of the 
specializing that is taking place in the health sector, patients 
travel by plane wherever they can get treatment, which generates 
huge costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional development probably does not mean a lot to members 
opposite. It makes me laugh when I hear the Liberal member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik congratulate and thank the Minister of 
Transport for his work. He made this statement in a meeting of 
the Standing Committee on Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no congratulations for the minister, far from it, and 
particularly not with regard to this issue. 
This same minister who closed the military college in 
Saint-Jean—let us not forget that—is now working to ensure that 
Quebec will come out a loser in this biased process in which the 
federal government has a hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is obviously some disagreement within the government on 
this matter, and it is perhaps worth pointing out.  There are 
some interesting quotations.  In the October 26 edition of <I>Le 
Devoir</I>, Marc Lalonde, who is cut from the same cloth as the 
members opposite, had this to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is odd that a public bid for a hostile takeover of the 
country's major air carrier should be launched on the assumption 
that the existing legislation will be changed to allow that 
takeover to occur. 
In all my years in the public sector, I have never seen a more 
disturbing challenge to the rights of parliamentarians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>God knows, Mr. Lalonde has been around for a long time.  So this 
is one of their friends speaking, not a nasty separatist from 
Quebec.  He says that the process has been biased from the 
start, because one of the players has the advantage of 
privileged information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the fact that it will be possible to amend legislation, 
if necessary, what message does this send for other private 
transactions?  The message it sends is this:  “Stay on the good 
side of the members opposite and, if you are having trouble with 
a particular issue, worry not because we will take care of the 
legislation in due course, depending on our interests, the party 
coffers, and 56 other variables”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members from Quebec in this government and others 
elsewhere who can also see through this transaction, and I am 
certain that the lobby was limited to a few government insiders. 
The policy must be changed, and the government must not agree 
to change the rules of the game mid-stream to the advantage of 
one player and one carrier. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as I said 
this morning in my speech, the Bloc Quebecois has contributed 
and will keep on contributing to the improvement of air 
transport in Canada, especially in Quebec regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Journalists will report again that Bloc Quebecois members are 
well prepared, that they attend every committee meeting, every 
sitting of the House. Aware of the urgency of the situation, 
today the Bloc Quebecois moved an opposition motion with a view 
to informing Canadians of what an airline merger will mean for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After putting questions to Air Canada officials, the minister, 
officials from the competition bureau, and Canadian Airlines 
yesterday, the committee will have the opportunity to hear from 
Onex next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what Air Canada and Canadian Airlines were able to tell us 
in response to our questions, we have learned that Canadian 
Airlines has been talking to the transport minister since 
January 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going through turbulent times. The air transport industry 
is going through a storm. The minister took it upon himself to 
amend section 47, essentially telling the competition bureau: 
“This is none of your business, I am using section 47 to give 
the airlines 90 days to prepare their bid and come to an 
agreement.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the minister not ask Canadian Airlines and Air Canada to 
sit at the table as early as January? Why did he not ask both 
major Canadian carriers to sit down together? Instead, he waited 
and opened up section 47 at the request of Onex. Then Onex 
tabled its bid. Air Canada made another bid. Onex had no choice 
but to make a higher offer. 
The decision will be up to the shareholders, those who own 
shares in Air Canada and Canadian Airlines. They will accept the 
best proposal with no regard for which offers the better 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will not look to see whether Rouyn-Noranda, Témiscamingue, 
the north shore, Manicouagan, or Gaspé have improved service. 
They will look to see which is the better deal. Shareholders 
will decide, not parliamentarians, and they will do it according 
to the proposals put before them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister made promises to Onex. Onex said “I have a problem. 
If I become the major manager, if I put in a lot of money, I am 
taking a risk with the 10% rule”. So the minister replied “Well, 
we will increase it, we will change the Competition Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member for Témiscamingue tell me why the 10% rule 
should be changed in this case, when it was not changed for 
Petro Canada? The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec was 
prevented from investing in CP Rail, and was told: “No, it is 
10%”. The federal government said, about the bank mergers, “No, 
it is 10%”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, the Minister of Transport is saying “Onex will 
serve American interests, I will not have to subsidize anymore, 
to prop up an air carrier. It makes no difference if 10,000 jobs 
are lost. It does not bother me. You deal with the problem. Tell 
us what you need to buy both airlines. As for section 47, it is 
a done deed. We will amend the Competition Act. And as for the 
10%, we will increase it to 25%”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the minister prepared to do so in this case, when it was 
not allowed in other cases? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, the answer to that is quite 
simple: it is to favour its friends. There is no other reason. 
The government is far more sensitive to political affinities 
than to regional economic development, particularly in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy my colleague raised this issue. In the past, this 
section was used to prevent Quebec portfolios from acquiring too 
many shares. In Quebec, we have a number of development tools 
such as the General Investment Corporation, the Caisse de dépôt 
et placement, the Fonds de solidarité, major players that can 
become significant shareholders in various projects. The federal 
government did not like the 10% rule in some cases. Sometimes it 
suited the government, sometimes it did not, but we will have to 
see the consequences this will have in the future.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will it be possible now to justify this in the other sectors 
still subject to this rule? If the government wanted a debate on 
whether the 10% rule is important or not, we could have had that 
debate outside the context of the Onex, Air Canada and Canadian 
transaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the government now wants to change the rules in mid-game, in 
a specific case, to favour one player in particular. This is 
totally unacceptable. That is why the House must support the 
motion to reaffirm that the rules will not be changed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be delighted to share my time with my hon. 
colleague and good friend from Mississauga Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested to hear the debate, particularly from the Bloc 
members when they talked about the various issues surrounding the 
10%.  What I have not heard them talk about, and I am a little 
puzzled by this, is the real motivation behind them putting this 
issue before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I talk about that I want to thank them for bringing this 
forward.  Frankly, I think it is a good opportunity for many of 
us.  I have many, many employees of Air Canada and some of 
Canadian Airlines living in my riding who have been calling me. 
This gives me an opportunity to put my views on the record and 
discuss the issue here in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite say that there is no debate.  What are we doing 
today?  Everyone is being given an opportunity to express their 
views.  In fact, what the Bloc has done is exactly what the 
Minister of Transport asked parliamentarians to do; to give their 
views to him, to give our best advice to him, and obviously to 
reflect the feelings and opinions of our constituents so that he 
indeed can deal with a number of the issues involving this 
potential merger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has not changed the rules.  For members opposite to 
say so is nothing more than misleading.  Maybe it is intentional, 
perhaps to get around the real underlying issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the problem the Bloc has, which I think I 
understand, is that the head office of Air Canada is in the great 
city of Montreal.  We all know that in recent history there have 
been dozens of major corporations move out of the city of 
Montreal, which I think is a tragedy.  Why have they done so? 
They have done so because of policies put in place by the current 
provincial government, and other provincial governments before 
it, led by separatists.  They have done so because of the 
separatist policies of the Bloc.  They cannot do business with 
the uncertainty that exists in the province of Quebec.  I think 
that is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, one member opposite made a remark that Bloc members are 
working hard at committee and that they participate in debate in 
the House.  Let me tell the House that he is right.  I have been 
quite impressed with the number of members of the Bloc who have 
come to the citizenship and immigration committee and to the 
public accounts committee to make good quality contributions to 
the committee and to the democratic process.  It is because they 
do not discuss the issue of separation.  The one flame that 
continues to burn in the heart of that party is to separate the 
province of Quebec from the rest of Canada.  We know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could leave that issue aside and take it out of the body 
politic of the Bloc, we would find some very decent, hard-working 
men and women who can contribute to this place.  However, as long 
as that is there, I submit that it clouds virtually every issue 
which they address.  It also leads to hidden agendas, which is, 
frankly, what we are seeing here today.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I believe the Bloc has done us a favour in at 
least bringing it forward.  The Bloc members know the government 
is not going to support them but that does not matter.  What 
matters is that as parliamentarians we have the opportunity to 
stand here and to tell our constituents exactly what is going on. 
If we simply want to read the newspapers, as the hon. member 
earlier did, we can get any kind of distorted view we wish to and 
we can put it forward as having some sort of credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister had changed the rule unilaterally without 
discussion in this place, I too would be upset.  That is not what 
he has done.  I sat at the committee meeting.  I am not a member 
of the transport committee but I wanted to hear firsthand what 
the minister's plan was.  He said that he wanted our views, that 
he wanted some consultation, that he wanted to hear from members 
of all parties in the House of Commons. Imagine opposition 
members complaining about that.  It is really quite remarkable. 
They must get up in the morning and ask “What has the government 
done that we can twist and turn around so we can oppose it?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give some credit to a couple of members and they might 
go into apoplectic shock.  I heard speeches earlier today from 
two members of the Reform Party, the member for Esquimalt—Juan 
de Fuca and the member for Souris—Moose Mountain. Both gentlemen 
gave thoughtful, reasoned, intelligent remarks, something I am 
not used to hearing from the Reform Party.  I was quite amazed. I 
will give credit where credit is due. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the comments do not seem to match other comments made 
by the leader of the Reform Party at a fundraiser in Calgary. Let 
me share those with the House because they are somewhat confusing 
and somewhat contradictory to the remarks made by the two members 
I just referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Reform Party said:  “We want to wait until 
all the final offers are on the table.  Our aim is to get the 
best deal for the air travelling public”.  I would have thought 
the Minister of Transport had said that.  I would not have 
thought the Leader of the Opposition actually came up with 
something that seems to be a rational policy. He said: 
“Whichever deal is accepted we want a free enterprise market to 
deal with this.  That could involve the government encouraging 
greater foreign and regional competition”.  What does he mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that he wants the skies of Canada to be opened 
up to the extent that foreign airlines, be it American, be it 
United, be it whatever, can come into Canada and transport 
passengers between Winnipeg and Toronto, between Montreal and 
Vancouver, while ignoring all of the very difficult routes.  They 
would simply cherry pick the best routes so those foreign 
carriers can make a profit on the best, easiest, most economical 
and efficient routes in Canada.  They would be sucking the 
lifeblood out of whatever airline becomes the dominant Canadian 
airline.  Let me stress clearly that is what is going to happen 
in my view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the shareholders vote to accept either the Onex deal 
that is on the table now or some other deal that is put forward, 
and I guess it has to happen soon, or whether they decide to 
accept the offer put on the table for Air Canada, there are pros 
and cons to both sides of those issues.  But in my view there 
will only be one major airline by this time next year. It will be 
running the major routes in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we going to do what the Leader of the Opposition has 
suggested and allow foreign airlines to come in and destroy that 
company?  That could happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has stood in his place and has said he will not 
change the foreign content issue.  Foreign ownership of Air 
Canada will not increase beyond 25%.  He has said that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not believe it so I had to verify it in <I>Hansard</I> 
but I heard the Reform Party critic ask the minister why he would 
not even consider allowing foreign ownership content to increase 
to 49%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as there is a hidden agenda by the Bloc, members of the 
Reform Party seem to be driven and motivated by a need to 
Americanize this country.  They do it all the time.  They stand 
and say “Do it the way they do it in the United States. They do 
it better”. They confuse issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is consulting.  He wants to hear the views of all 
parliamentarians and all Canadians.  I have great confidence that 
he will make the right decision.

<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened to my colleague and associate. He said that we had 
introduced this motion on an opposition day today because we 
want sovereignty. I would have liked him to be a little more 
logical. I would have liked the House to stick to the issue at 
hand, because it smells to high heaven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of their own, Marc Lalonde, said “Look, I do not think we 
should go that route”. And now my colleague says “The minister 
is carrying out consultations, but calm down, that does not mean 
he will change the regulations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he be able to assure me sometime in the future that the 
minister will not make any changes? He will not be able to give 
me any assurances. He will skate around the issue. He will say 
anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that this is dangerous. Can we have the assurance that 
security will be enhanced and that the air rates will not go up? 
Of course not. They say almost anything. When we ask questions, 
they do not even answer. Such behaviour in the House of Commons 
goes against the spirit of democract. And flouting democracy in 
the House of Commons, that is serious business. What was said 
earlier about the Bloc was an insult to the constituents not 
only of Matapédia—Matane but of each and every riding. There are 
44 of us here. It was an insult to all the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleague opposite to apologize, because my 
constituents will just not take it. 
I ask him if he can assure us that the 10% rule will not be 
changed. Can he confirm that security will be enhanced, that the 
rates will at least remain the same and that in remote areas the 
level of service will be maintained? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, constituents in my 
riding find it insulting every time a Bloc member talks about 
taking a major part of the country out of confederation.  I do 
not apologize for a single thing I said in this or any other 
speech in regard to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me answer the question.  The member talks about servicing 
small communities.  I can tell him that my province of Ontario 
has many small communities as he would well know, as does the 
province of Quebec.  I can tell him that the government is 
concerned that those communities continue to be serviced by air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The airline industry is part of nation building. We cannot leave 
the people of Nunavut without that kind of service. We cannot 
leave northern Quebec and remote regions in Labrador or western 
Canada without some kind of access to affordable quality service. 
The minister has laid that out in his program which he presented 
to the committee.  Pricing is absolutely a concern. 
Service to small communities is a concern.  Jobs are a concern, 
not only for Air Canada employees, but for Canadian employees.

of those issues need to be addressed. I agree with the member 
that they are extremely important.  The government is committed 
to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, the government is committed to ensuring that we 
continue to have one of the finest, safest airline industries in 
the world, which we do.  We have terrific people who work in them 
and we have two quality airlines.  We just have one that is in 
serious financial trouble and that issue must be addressed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to share my time with my colleague the member 
for Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise to speak against the motion raised by the Bloc today.  In 
his policy framework for airline restructuring in Canada, the 
Minister of Transport indicated on October 26 that the government 
was prepared to consider increasing the 10% limit to a new level 
to be decided following input from parliamentarians, only if such 
a measure contributes to a healthy Canadian airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of a healthy airline industry in Canada cannot be 
overstated.  Canada's airlines provide employment to thousands of 
skilled workers and are important contributors to our economy. In 
a country as large as Canada, they help support the very fabric 
of our society by connecting communities separated by hundreds, 
sometimes thousands, of kilometres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As international trade and travel increase, our airlines provide 
Canada with critical links to the rest of the world.  Canada 
needs a healthy airline industry to continue to enjoy these 
benefits and to create even greater benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleagues are aware, the government has been very 
closely monitoring developments in the industry.  It has assessed 
the implications of a major restructuring in order to form its 
policy framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to protecting the public 
interest in issues such as pricing, service to small communities 
and the rights and concerns of airline employees.  I and my 
caucus colleagues have been made intimately, sometimes 
forcefully, aware of the concerns of the employees of both 
Canadian Airlines and Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member of parliament for Mississauga Centre, I represent 
a riding that is home to hundreds, sometimes it feels like 
thousands, of airline employees.  It is the employees of both 
airlines as well as the Canadian traveller that I remain most 
concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Travellers are justifiably concerned about airfares. Competition 
encourages lower airfares and increases the affordability of air 
travel.  Currently almost 90% of air travel within Canada is on 
discounted fares.  Seat sales allow families in Vancouver to 
visit relatives in Montreal.  They allow small business people on 
restricted budgets to travel more easily. They encourage tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is reasonable to be concerned that a major restructuring of 
the Canadian airline industry could lead to higher airfares for 
all consumers.  The government is very much aware of these 
concerns and the importance of affordable air travel to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated in the policy framework for airline restructuring in 
Canada, clearly the best way to promote affordable air travel is 
to have an air industry that remains healthy as well as 
competitive.  It is competition rather than government 
intervention that will be most effective in moderating airfares 
in the long run.  However, we must consider that competition may 
not exert sufficient control on prices in all circumstances.  It 
is for this reason that competition concerns have been addressed 
at such length by our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government already has tools at its disposal to address 
pricing concerns, including section 66 of the Canada 
Transportation Act which allows the Canadian Transportation 
Agency to act on complaints regarding basic fares on monopoly 
routes. As the Minister of Transport has stated, the government 
will go further and assess whether these provisions should be 
broadened to address market dominance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the government will require commitments on pricing from 
the dominant carrier during any restructuring process.  The 
government will consider adding relevant conditions to its 
approval of any restructuring. The government will not tolerate 
any price gouging of Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of air travel to small communities is also a very 
serious concern.  Our airlines help support the fabric of our 
nation by providing crucial air service to hundreds of domestic 
destinations, many of them accessible only by air.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small communities rely on air services often more than large 
communities.  Airlines provide links to larger markets, help 
attract investments and provide an indispensable lifeline to the 
rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleagues can appreciate, a major restructuring of 
the airline industry could lead to a rationalization of some air 
services.  In this regard the public, consumer representatives 
and northern residents have expressed their concern that air 
services to smaller communities could decrease or even disappear. 
As set out in the government's policy framework, the key to 
addressing this issue is to ensure that barriers to entry and to 
growth in the market of small regional airlines are reduced to 
the greatest extent possible and that there are protections from 
possible predatory behaviour on the part of a dominant carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History has demonstrated that where there is a demand there will 
be entrepreneurs willing to provide service, even in small 
markets.  There must be an environment that will allow 
competition to exist.  With this in mind our government has 
indicated that it will work to ensure that the necessary 
conditions for attracting competition are in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my hon. colleagues to note that the Canada 
Transportation Act already requires the last and second last 
carrier serving any community to give notice of their intention 
to stop service so that there will be adequate lead time for any 
other carrier to prepare to offer replacement service.  These 
sections will be reviewed to determine if they remain adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the government has stated that it will require 
commitments on service to small communities from the dominant 
carrier during the restructuring process and will consider adding 
more conditions before restructuring is approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, I would like to address concerns regarding employment. 
The Canadian airline industry employs thousands of skilled 
workers directly and indirectly.  These employees have worked 
diligently.  Many of them have made significant sacrifices to 
ensure the success of their companies.  They have endured 
economic downturns and have witnessed corporate downsizing.  They 
have agreed to pay freezes and to pay cuts.  They are important 
contributors to the Canadian economy.  I believe they merit the 
consideration of our government in any airline restructuring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has already consulted various groups on the 
issue.  Labour leaders have expressed the concern that employment 
levels may be substantially affected by a restructuring of the 
airline industry.  They want to ensure that job impacts and 
dislocations are minimized and that any employment adjustments 
are handled exclusively through normal retirement, attrition and 
voluntary separation packages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Airline employees are very concerned that airline consolidation 
will cost them their jobs.  They fear forced relocation and 
layoffs.  It is for this reason that the government will insist 
that employees be treated fairly and will require commitments 
from a dominant carrier to this effect.  The government will 
encourage labour management discussions with a view to reaching 
an agreement which is satisfactory to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that Canadian consumers want and deserve 
the benefits of competition, that small communities require air 
service and that airline employees deserve to be treated fairly. 
At the same time the government believes that these objectives 
are consistent with a healthy, Canadian controlled airline 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my hon. colleagues believe that these are laudable goals, 
then they should agree that we must be prepared to take the 
necessary steps to manage a major restructuring of the Canadian 
airline industry.  I call on my hon. colleagues to support the 
government initiatives presented by the Minister of Transport on 
October 26, including a provision for the government to consider 
increasing the 10% limit on individual ownership of Air Canada's 
voting shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport has been very clear on his willingness 
to consider a legislative change right from the beginning.  One 
has to look no further than the minister's news release of August 
13, 1999, in which he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will also consider what further action 
might be required, including the possibility of introducing 
legislation to facilitate the implementation of an acceptable 
proposal and making any necessary changes to the policy and 
regulatory framework governing airlines. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the government has stated its openness to legislative 
change from the day the use of section 47 was announced, which 
was August 13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue will only be decided following input from 
parliamentarians and then only if such a measure contributes to 
achieving a healthy, Canadian controlled airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat this for the sake of all here.  The government has 
stated that a change to the 10% limit will only be considered if 
it will contribute to achieving a healthy, Canadian controlled 
airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make a decision prior to proper consultation, as is 
effectively proposed by the hon. member's motion, would not only 
deprive the government of the benefits of the advice of the 
parliamentary standing committees, it would also be unfair to the 
proponents of the private sector proposals that are seen to be 
addressed by shareholders.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, I oppose the motion.  I also appreciate, as my 
colleague did, the opportunity to state my position in the House. 
Perhaps it will relieve me of the millions of phone calls I have 
been getting. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the debate today.  I heard the 
minister's speech and my colleague's speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talked about having an open debate, which is right.  She 
talked about certain issues like regional communities being 
serviced, employees and the excellent airlines that we have.  I 
agree with her.  There is no question that we have great 
airlines.  She made a good point.  We do not oppose that; we 
agree with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do have differences.  We know there is a definite 
need to restructure the airline industry in Canada and that we 
are facing the prospect of one airline.  If the ownership rule 
was raised, as the Competition Bureau chief said, we do not see 
any danger in that.  We see that as meaning that jobs will be 
protected, the excellent service will continue and the skills in 
the aviation industry will remain in this country.  We do not see 
a danger.  As a matter of fact, we see our two airlines growing, 
providing Canadians with more opportunity for jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we becoming restrictive?  The Minister of Transport 
would like to raise it to 25%.  What is the problem in 
restricting this to 49% to improve competition?  We would have a 
healthy aviation industry in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to 
respond to my friend from Calgary East.  I too read the 
recommendations and found that what was lacking was practicality. 
The Competition Bureau suggested that we could bring in all kinds 
of new airlines.  It did not really matter who owned them, we 
could raise the ownership portions to astronomical heights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has to be understood, which the minister understands, is 
that this country was originally connected by railroads.  Now its 
lifeblood is being pumped through the airlines.  The heart of the 
country and its regions are being fed through the airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a gross miscarriage of justice if we lost some 
control over Canadian ownership and some control over the 
direction this new mega airline will go in.  It would be a very 
sad situation if we, as parliamentarians, stood back and let the 
market forces take over.  We have to understand that some of us 
really believe this will keep the country together.  It is 
important to control it to a certain extent and to monitor it so 
that it is the best airline it can be and one which will continue 
to make Canada proud.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, recently I 
met with representatives of Air Canada, its subsidiary Air 
Alliance and Canadian International Airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem facing the managers of these two companies is that 
their service is expensive in the regions because they do not 
have enough passengers.  If so, it is also because prices are 
high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleague if she would support, in the 
restructuring of airline services in Canada, having a carrier 
for international flights and an interprovincial carrier and 
having unrestricted competition to serve the regions. Local 
carriers would serve them and feed into the hubs for 
interprovincial and international flights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we would then have more and better service regionally.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Madam Speaker, I hope I am not 
misinterpreting the member for Charlevoix.  My impression is that 
he is willing to relegate Canadian Airlines to be the little 
local server, which would provide a lot of nasty competition to 
very successful small airlines which are out there right now, and 
that he is willing to allow Air Canada to continue to be the 
international carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My perception of what has been going on between Air Canada and 
Canadian Airlines for a long time is that it is like the big 
brother and the little brother fighting each other, but they are 
not prepared to take on the bully from across the road.  I think 
our real competition lies offshore and that international 
airlines from other countries are taking a lot of the lifeblood 
out of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, I do not agree with the member's position. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
happy to be splitting my time with the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to the question surrounding the airline 
industry.  It concerns many people in my riding of Dartmouth and 
they are looking to Ottawa for leadership on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a symbolic issue for Nova Scotia and Canada, a debate 
which shows how the Liberal Party has moved from being a 
proactive force in Canadian politics to being a caretaker 
government which equates the corporate good with the public good. 
It clearly shows how out of touch members opposite have become 
with the reality of most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents have approached me on the issue of the travel 
industry.  It is an industry which employs many people in 
Dartmouth.  They fear for their jobs.  We have heard about the 
more than 25,000 direct jobs involved in Air Canada and Canadian 
Airlines, but I have also heard from people who make a living 
selling seat sales.  They worry that they will have no jobs when 
there are no regional carriers, no national competition and no 
more seat sales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A retired Air Canada worker was in my office yesterday.  He is 
concerned about the future of his pension.  He is not a direct 
employee, but he is scared because this process may threaten his 
income.  Many direct employees, be they pilots, mechanics or 
flight attendants, have told me or my staff that they will be 
forced to move to keep their jobs due to the restructuring. 
These people are being brave, but they are worried.  Consumers in 
Dartmouth are also worried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Atlantic Canada has a sad history of watching our young people 
go down the road.  I do not think I am exaggerating when I say 
that most families in my riding have a close family member in 
central or western Canada.  I also know that many people have 
moved to Dartmouth from Cape Breton, rural Newfoundland or from 
the Acadie to find work.  Most of these peoples' families are 
still down home.  A major force which helps to connect these 
families are airplanes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the former Conservative policies there is no real train 
service left for most people in the maritimes.  The Trans-Canada 
highway system has been abandoned by the government and motorists 
now face tolls throughout my region, so that option is becoming 
less and less a factor as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I hear people talking about over their coffee in the shop 
next door to my constituency office is the next seat sale to 
Calgary, Sydney or Gander.  I am also amazed by the anger people 
express over the fact that it seems to cost more to fly from 
Halifax to St. John's than it does to fly from Toronto to London, 
England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People do not talk about the relative merits of the Onex or Air 
Canada offers.  They are not concerned about the share price. 
They want to be able to see their kids.  They want to know they 
can fly to see their parents and be by their side in an 
emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These anxieties should have been addressed by the government. 
It had the opportunity.  The government started the ball rolling 
by invoking section 47 in the summertime, but there were no 
assurances from the minister for Dartmouth consumers.  A throne 
speech was delivered, but again silence on this issue.  There was 
nothing for maritimers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister did say at one point that this was a matter for the 
private sector, a position I believe he still stands by.  He has 
mumbled vague words about price protection, but nothing specific. 
This week the minister has given assurances that the company will 
be accommodated and that the 10% ownership rule could be changed, 
but no such specifics to protect consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will do nothing to protect consumers because he is 
part of a party and a government which does not believe there is 
a role for government in the marketplace to protect consumers. He 
is protecting the choices of shareholders, not stakeholders and 
not the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad that we have come to this.  Canada was not built this 
way and Canadians have never wanted it to be this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Halifax harbour has had a proud and vital part in the 
development of my country and our community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should always remember that its piers, its rail links and 
equipment did not arrive with this pretty setting.  It was 
largely built by public money.  In large part, Canada was created 
based on promises of a public investment in a cross-Canada rail 
link. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our airline industry was also built by public money.  These 
investments were visionary in their recognition that accessible 
transportation links in Canada are not a frill but a necessity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy allowed for the concept of the Canadian government 
acting for the public good.  This tradition was gutted by the 
Conservative government in the last decade and it has been 
continued by the current Liberal regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad that the Liberal government has lost that vision of 
the public good.  It seems that at every turn on questions of 
trade, culture, the environment, health protection and 
transportation, the government feels that the corporate good 
outweighs the public good.  The government has said that after 
shareholders have finished carving up the current air carriers it 
will bring in a law to allow the carve up.  For the rest of us, 
the government has said “trust us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still remember the Liberals saying “trust us” for a national 
child care program, and the Liberals committing themselves to 
scrap the GST.  I cannot trust them in any good conscience but I 
can call on them to remember the concept of public good in 
transport policy and do the following before bringing in any new 
law:  Protect the maximum number of jobs and ensure that any job 
loss be offset through attrition and incentive packages; put in 
place a regulatory framework to guarantee fair prices and equal 
service to the consumer; explore all policy instruments at its 
disposal, which might include an equity partnership, to ensure 
that the public good is protected in a restructured airline 
industry; have all affected stakeholders participate in any 
eventual decision about the future of our air transport industry 
prior to it being taken; and, keep foreign investors in a small 
minority interest and do not allow them to obtain a controlling 
position in the affairs of Canada's national airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is our national tradition.  That is what I believe 
constituents want to see.

<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I >have a 
little more time than before to put my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, after meeting with Canadian and Intercanadian, 
the numbers are not there because it is expensive and it is 
expensive because the numbers are not there, in short, it is a 
case of which came first, the chicken or the egg. Or it is the 
case of Maple Leaf sausages, the more we eat, the more we like 
it, and the more we like it, the more we eat.  We live with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put my question by citing an example.  There are 
two sorts of travelers.  There are those obliged to travel and 
those travelling on holiday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first type of traveller may be a business person who must 
get from point A to point B, for example from Baie-Comeau to 
Montreal. That person must be in both places on the same day, 
then come back the next morning to be at work. Another example 
is a person who leaves Baie-Comeau for treatment in Quebec City 
or in Montreal, and who comes back the same day or the next day. 
The return trip between Baie-Comeau and Montreal for such a 
traveller not leaving the country costs $900. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a person travels from Baie-Comeau to Montreal on his or her 
way to Paris or Florida, or anywhere outside the country, for a 
holiday, it will cost that person $285. Where is the problem? 
The problem is that people in the regions pay for the air miles 
that frequent flyers collect. 
Some airlines give air miles and access to the V.I.P. lounge, 
but the person who must travel on business, or for treatment, 
helps pay these promotions from major airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That should be abolished. I said earlier that we should help the 
regional carriers that bring passengers to hubs and to 
interprovincial or international carriers, so as to have lower 
airfares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After talking to people from the chamber of commerce—and all 
chambers of commerce make representations at that level—one 
realizes that they are penalized, in terms of the airfare, 
because they leave from a region to go to a major centre. They 
are told that this is because the aircraft is half empty, or 
half full if one is an optimist. But the problem is that it is 
not profitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? Because it is costly. Let us eliminate the gadgets and the 
promotional items and let us provide competitive prices for the 
regions. In order to do that, the Minister of Transport must 
promote regional development in the context of the air 
transportation industry. I would like to hear the hon. member's 
comments on this.

fee structure in terms of transportation across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know members of the House find themselves having to make 
ridiculous detours through Toronto to reach another location, 
perhaps in the maritimes.  Sometimes when flying from Calgary, 
one has to go through a place like Winnipeg to get to somewhere 
in the north.  There are a lot examples of erratic and irrational 
detouring going on.  I believe all of that has to be taken into 
account in terms of it being a system that will meet the needs of 
Canadians.

how difficult that is.  The cost of flying from Cape Breton to 
Halifax, a 40-minute plane ride, sometimes exceeds $700 or $800. 
It is cheaper to go from Halifax to Europe and back again, or at 
least one way, than it is to get from Cape Breton.  With the 
decline in hospital services and so many other services that 
rural communities face, this is becoming an increasing burden on 
people in rural communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the surprises never cease.  I also want to say a few 
words in the debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the motion proposed by the Bloc Quebecois this 
afternoon on the future of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines in 
our country, Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I really am in support of the motion put forward by 
the Bloc Quebecois today.  I am surprised that some of my Liberal 
friends are not supporting it as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember, for example, my hon. friend from Prince Edward 
Island, when he used to be a progressive left-wing Liberal, would 
get up and make all kinds of speeches about Canadian nationalism 
and how we had to look after our own country and stand up for 
Canada.  I remember that before he became power hungry and ran as 
a Liberal in Prince Edward Island.  I wonder where those speeches 
are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the Bloc Quebecois is doing today is moving a motion that 
respects existing Canadian law.  I am sure you are surprised by 
this, Madam Speaker, but the Liberal Party is going to vote 
against it.  What the Bloc is saying today is that we should 
respect the current law that says that no single entity, 
including someone as wealthy as the member from Prince Edward 
Island, can buy more than 10% of Air Canada.  That is the law and 
that is what the Bloc is saying today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the Liberal Party say?  It says “No, we are not going 
to support that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You haven't been listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  If I have not been listening, I will 
be very interested in watching the member stand in his place here 
later on today and vote in favour of the motion put before the 
House.  We will then see who is going to be listening, myself or 
the hon. member from P.E.I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Air Canada was privatized, parliament in its wisdom, and I 
think it made the wrong decision to privatize in the first place, 
decided that no entity could own more than 10% of Air Canada and 
that a maximum of 25% of it could be owned by foreigners.  We 
were paralleling the Bank Act in many ways where nobody could own 
more than 10% of a bank and no more than 25% of a bank could be 
owned by non-Canadian entities, institutions, pension funds, et 
cetera.  That is what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Liberal Party is considering increasing the 10% rule.  I 
wonder why.  It think it is doing that because the Minister of 
Transport is favouring the proposition put forward by Mr. Gerald 
Schwartz who is the president of Onex.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to talk about Mr. Schwartz.  Mr. Schwartz is 
one of the most effective fundraisers in the Liberal Party 
anywhere in the country, contributing and raising hundreds of 
thousands of dollars for the Liberal Party and for candidates in 
that party, in particular in the province of Ontario.  I think 
this is part of what the debate is about.  If it was not about 
that why would the government want to change the 10% rule?  Why 
does the government not say to Mr. Schwartz or anyone else, “If 
you want to make a proposal, do it in the context of existing 
law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend in the Reform Party says, it is like changing the 
rules in the middle of a game.  That is what the Liberal Party 
wants to do.  I am surprised at the hole that the Minister of 
Transport and the Prime Minister have on the backbenches.  Some 
of these people will not rise in their place and say, “All this 
motion is doing is supporting the existing law in the country”. 
Why will they not get up and do that?  It is because there is 
another agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister from Toronto is favouring his buddy, Gerald 
Schwartz from Toronto, who is a big fundraiser for the Liberal 
Party of Canada.  That is the kind of politics that we have here 
today.  It says an awful lot about the need for more free votes 
in the House of Commons where a member can get up and voice his 
or her concern without fear of losing a job as a parliamentary 
secretary or chairmanship of a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to many members of the Liberal Party in the House 
who are dead set against what Gerald Schwartz is trying to do, 
who are not at all happy with the minister from Toronto and who 
are unhappy that the minister is talking about changing the rules 
to favour one airline over the other.  Where are those people 
today? They are not going to get up and speak in support of the 
motion that is before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important issue.  I come from Saskatchewan.  I 
come from a smaller market where we do not have many flights.  We 
have very few flights by Canadian Airlines.  We have a few more 
by Air Canada.  We have very few flights in all.  It is a captive 
market. The prices are very expensive in a small market like 
Regina or Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.  People are very concerned 
about the future of the airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the 10% rule goes through, how high does it have to go before 
in effect we lose control of an airline industry in the country 
to big financial institutions or big American airlines in the 
United States?  I want members to think about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Conservative Party of Brian Mulroney, when it 
privatized Air Canada, brought in the 10% rule for a purpose.  It 
was to make sure the airline remained in Canadian hands.  That 
was the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a Liberal Party that is now more conservative than 
the Conservatives and more conservative than Brian Mulroney.  It 
is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see members across the way nodding their heads in 
agreement that it is a real shame.  If this rule goes through, we 
are going to lose the airline industry and people know that.  It 
is only a matter of time before the big airlines buy out the 
Canadian airline industry, buy out Air Canada and Canadian 
Airlines.  Big institutions in the United States will invest 
money and buy out these Canadian airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the issue today.  If we had a true parliamentary 
democracy in the country, the vote this afternoon on this motion 
would, I think, be overwhelming in terms of support for the 
motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois.  That is why we need 
change in terms of how the House governs itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before my time expires, I have a couple of other things to say. 
One thing the government should consider is the federal 
government itself taking an equity position in a new national 
airline.  I would suggest about 15%.  I think 15% would give the 
people of the country, through the federal government, enough 
control to make sure that the industry stays in Canadian hands, 
that we have jobs here for Canadians, that rural communities and 
smaller communities will to be served, that the price which 
passengers pay when they fly on an airline will be reasonable 
regardless of the size of the Canadian market. I think that is 
one thing that can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that sooner or later, probably sooner than later, we 
are going to end up with one national airline. 
We do not have the market to support two big national airlines. I 
do not think any other country in the world, except the United 
States and perhaps Australia, has more than one national airline. 
Of course Australians have to fly almost always when they leave 
their country.  I do not think we have the market to have two big 
national, successful, economic airlines in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to have one airline, the government should 
seriously look at the possibility of an equity stake in that 
airline.  The public should have some input and some clout.  The 
public should have a couple of people on the board of directors 
of the airline and have some say over the direction in which that 
airline will go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the important issues we have to be debating 
today. I end by saying once again that we support the motion put 
forward by the Bloc.  I think that the 10% rule will have to 
stay. If it goes, we are in danger of losing not only Air Canada, 
but Canadian as well within a few short years into the hands of 
investors from the United States. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it was 
an interesting speech by the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle. There 
were a lot of words but not much substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear.  I too am in favour of the 10% rule, but I do 
not not want to see the government tie its hands so that we do 
not have some flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One remark the hon. member made which did make some sense is 
that people are concerned about the future of the airline 
industry in this country.  That is true.  The government is 
concerned.  The minister is concerned.  That is why the minister 
outlined the five principles.  That is why the minister dealt 
with the Competition Act in order to try to solve this problem in 
a very managed way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member took one personal shot at me which I should mention 
and that is that I am a little bit left.  Yes, and I am proud of 
it.  The difference between my party and that party over there is 
that we are willing to look at some flexibility for the good of 
the country.  We do not bury our heads in the sand as does the 
New Democratic Party which does not look at all the options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the member's view on the five principles that the 
minister has outlined? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I learned a long time 
ago that there is a difference when a Liberal talks about 
principles and when a Liberal puts something into action and into 
effect.  Sometimes there is a long distance between the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember my grandfather telling me many years ago about the 
Liberal Party promising medicare in the campaign of 1919.  I did 
not see medicare in this country until about 1965 after it was 
brought in by a CCF government in the province of Saskatchewan. 
There is a long distance between the principles of the Liberal 
Party and the action of the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very well the Liberal Party campaigning in this House 
against the GST.  Does anyone else remember that?  I was here. I 
saw the Liberals filibuster on the GST in the House of Commons. 
They spoke in committee hour after hour, “If we are elected to 
government in this country, we will abolish the GST.  We will get 
rid of the GST”.  About the only one who stood by her word was 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage who resigned her seat and ran 
in a byelection because of her commitment on the GST. I remember 
those debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember my friend from Prince Edward Island when he was the 
national president of the farmers union based in Saskatoon.  I 
remember going out to his retirement and cheering him on as a 
good progressive left-wing thinker. Part of the reason was that he 
campaigned against the free trade deal.  He was campaigning 
against NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His Liberal Party was campaigning against NAFTA and the free 
trade deal. The Liberals were sitting in these benches calling 
Brian Mulroney a sell-out.  They were elected and what happened? 
We are still part of the FTA.  We are still part of NAFTA.  There 
have been no changes, no amendments, nothing. We are now talking 
about selling our water.  We are now part of the WTO.  That 
former Canadian nationalist, Sergio Marchi,—I can use his name 
now as he is at the WTO—was campaigning against those deals. 
What is he doing now?  He wants to expand them more and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the Liberal Party. Madam Speaker, I am sure if you were 
not in the chair you would get up and agree with me, because that 
is the history of the Liberal Party.  Liberals say one thing and 
they do something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members of the Liberal Party campaign in the opposition, 
they campaign for the left and they sound like New Democrats. 
When they are in government they sound like Conservatives, except 
for the last few years when they have sounded like Reformers. The 
Reform Party has set the agenda for them. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, we are of 
course pleased to have the support of the NDP, the Conservatives 
and the Reform Party.  The Bloc Quebecois will back them one 
hundred percent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be a few Liberal MPs who support this motion, such as 
the hon. members from Lac—Saint-Louis, Vaudreuil—Soulanges and 
Thunder Bay, and I trust Mr. Lalonde will stir up some Quebec 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary intent of the Bloc Quebecois' motion was to inform 
the public on issues relating to the future of air 
transportation, as well as to ensure that this situation was 
treated fairly and in the same way as the Caisse de dépôt et de 
placement du Québec when it was told that one could not invest 
more than 10% in the CN.  The maximum for Petro-Canada and the 
banks is also 10%.  Why should it be different for Onex?  What 
complicity is going on between the Minister of Transport and One x? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B> Madam Speaker, this is not a very difficult 
question and the answer is that Onex president is Gerry 
Schwartz, and that he gives a lot of money to the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the member from Prince Edward Island does not dare 
stand up in this House and vote in favour of the Bloc Quebecois' 
motion. Mr. Schwartz contributed to the election funds of 
several Liberal candidates in the Toronto area during the last 
election campaign. This is one of the reasons why the Liberal 
Party will not support the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to enter the 
debate on the restructuring of Canada's airline industry, not 
necessarily to speak to the Bloc's motion.  Usually when the Bloc 
brings something to the House it is a sort of myopic view of 
public policy.  Here coincidentally, Air Canada's head office is 
in Montreal, Quebec and Air Canada does not want to see any 
change to the 10% rule.  Therefore the Bloc has come in here 
supporting no change to the 10% rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak on the key issues here, which are the 
amount of Canadian ownership and control in any industry in 
Canada and the question of competition and service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10% rule should be put in context.  When Air Canada was 
privatized however many years ago that was, the policy intent was 
to ensure that the shareholdings were broadly held across Canada. 
The government brought in a 10% rule to ensure the shares were 
widely held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question now before the government is whether the 10% rule 
should be relaxed.  It makes eminent good sense to have a look at 
that. That is all our government has said, that we should not 
rule out any options, that we should have a look at the 10% rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10% rule does not apply to Canadian Airlines. What is the 
magic of this 10% ownership rule?  It has to do with how widely 
the shares are held.  It has nothing to do with foreign 
ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To argue, actually to cheat, to say that we should not bring any 
policies forward that do not comply with legislation, the next 
time Air Canada or any interest group phones me and says that we 
need to change these policies or legislation, I will tell them 
that I am sorry because the legislation is here and that is what 
we are working on, so we will not consider any proposals.  That 
is what I would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our role is to legislate.  We have a proposal in front of us 
which someone has asked us to look at.  We must debate it. It is 
a good debate.  Our government has said that parliamentarians are 
going to debate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will certainly be voting against the Bloc motion.  In a public 
policy sense it does not make any sense.  Why would we close down 
that door at this point in time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the other hypocrisy I have seen in this 
debate.  On the one hand the Reform Party says let the market 
decide, that the market should control these things, that it 
should determine what the best mix of air service and air 
structure is in Canada.  Then the minute the government lays down 
some public policy principles, the Reform Party says that the 
government is interfering.  The minute the government says that 
we should really look at the 10% rule, the Reform Party says we 
are creating favouritism.  In fact we are creating favouritism 
the other way if we do not open that door because Canadian 
Airlines is not governed by the same 10% rule, not at all. 
We need to get serious in this debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the government's role, we came out with a set of 
five principles. To my mind that was what we needed to do, had to 
do and it is what we did.  We said that rather than nickel and 
dime every single proposal or alternative that is out there, we 
are going to set a framework.  The government has embellished 
that somewhat since the first five principles were set out.  No 
matter what proposal we look at, the government should weigh it 
against these five public policy objectives.  That is what our 
government did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reiterate those five policy principles.  The 
government said that no matter what proposal comes forward, and 
by the way, we do not have any firm proposal right now because 
nothing has been approved by any shareholders.  Once a proposal 
is approved, we will evaluate that proposal against these 
criteria:  Do we have Canadian control and ownership?  Will we 
have good competition and service to consumers?  Will we have 
good pricing in Canada?  Will we be able to serve small 
communities?  What about the rights of employees?  Will they be 
protected as best as they can? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course safety underlines everything. That is the mission of 
Transport Canada.  That is its number one objective. Safety is a 
concern in the context of any proposal that would come forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government laid out the five principles.  In fact, when the 
government relaxed section 47 of the Competition Act, I thought, 
naively perhaps, that maybe the airlines would start talking to 
each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the government's policy purpose may have been to have 
Canadian and Air Canada talk to each other to try to rationalize 
some of this excess capacity out of the system.  It is no secret. 
People in Canada recognize that when there are two flights at 
the same time from Toronto to Calgary, one Canadian and one Air 
Canada, at 7 p.m., 8 p.m., 9 p.m, and 10 a.m.  It is called wing 
tip to wing tip flying on the same routes.  We cannot have the 
luxury of that kind of excess capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some pilots will say that the planes are sort of full. Probably 
they are, but at what price?  We know the way the pricing is done 
these days.  There are about 60 different prices. About 80% of 
the people sitting in that plane are covering the variable costs 
maybe, but that is about it.  Airlines cannot survive that way, 
Canadian or Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know Canadian Airlines is in deeper trouble, but Air Canada 
really has not performed that well over the last 10 years either. 
We have excess capacity and we have to deal with it.  We cannot 
hide.  We cannot run.  We have to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian ownership is an issue that is important to all 
Canadians.  Frankly, I do not think we should compromise on the 
25% rule at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the proposals we have in front of us, at least in 
terms of propositions, the question becomes how do they stand 
against that test?  There has been a lot of misinformation about 
that in my view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Onex proposal is really proposing that American Airlines 
would have about 15% of Canadian.  In fact, its shareholding goes 
down.  In terms of its equity participation I think it is one 
member of the board of directors, or two out of thirteen, 
something in that order. We know that is not effective control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Transportation Agency will rigorously look at any 
proposal that comes forward.  It will deal with the question, is 
it effective Canadian control? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ringer, the hook, is in all the side agreements.  There are 
side agreements with American Airlines and Canadian.  We know 
about the reservation systems, maintenance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Transportation Agency will look at any proposals. 
It will study them and come back to the government and say that 
it has looked at them in some detail.  The agency will say that 
it has looked at every single agreement that Canadian Airlines 
has with American Airlines and that from a policy perspective it 
is either effectively controlled in Canada or it is not. However, 
it is a valid public debate to have notwithstanding that we do 
not have all those facts in front of us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect is the Competition Bureau.  Its criteria is what 
does it do to competition.  It does not have to worry about 
effective control or Canadian control.  It just has to answer the 
question what is in the best interest of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very valid question but the bureau does not have to 
worry.  If we look at cabotage, it means that we would open up 
our doors and allow foreign airlines to come in, pick up 
passengers in Toronto and take them to Calgary.  It could be 
American Airlines, United or whatever.  The bottom line in my 
view is that with the economies of scale of some of the huge 
American airlines our airline or airlines would be hard pressed 
to compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we allow cabotage in Canada without getting the 
reverse, for example, in the United States?  That would be folly. 
I do not think the Americans are prepared to allow cabotage in 
the United States.  That to me is not an option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Bureau clearly has a role to play.  We are 
essentially looking at a one airline policy in Canada.  Anyone 
who thinks that we cannot do anything about that is not really 
thinking through the facts.  As a government we have a lot of 
options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at reregulating the industry.  It is not an option 
that I would support, but we could do that in some limited way. I 
am very concerned about service to remote areas of Canada and 
some areas that might be marginal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we give an airline a chance to rationalize some of 
that capacity, instead of 12 flights a day into certain centres 
by Air Canada and 12 by Canadian Airlines almost at the same time 
maybe we would end up with 8 in those centres but we would have 
service to other areas on a much more frequent basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we structure that?  We cannot structure it on the basis 
of hope.  We have to put some policy meat on those bones.  Our 
government through debates and discussions with all 
parliamentarians should consider that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like either of the deals that have been proposed the 
way they stand right now.  I understand that Onex has come back 
with something today.  It is trying to limit the perception of 
American Airlines effective control, but until we see all the 
side deals I do not know if we can really deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad these companies are at least thinking of how they can 
try to meet the public policy objectives of the government.  I 
looked at the Air Canada proposal.  In my mind I saw one proposal 
that was a heavy, dominant American Airlines proposal and another 
one with Lufthansa and United.  It was sort of like pick our 
poison. We have some work to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to have seen one airline do the major 
financing in Canada.  I am not convinced that it cannot be done. 
Why can it not be financed in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure that the Air Canada proposal deals effectively 
with excess capacity.  They are going to run Air Canada.  They 
are going to run Canadian Airlines as a separate entity.  They 
are going to throw in a computer discount airline into Hamilton. 
What does that do to our capacity?  By the same token, unless the 
new Onex deal has some interesting propositions with respect to 
American Airlines effective control I think that proposal is 
problematic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember being at the transport committee one day when we were 
looking at the competitiveness of the air transportation sector. 
I asked a pilot group or some group about code sharing on 
domestic routes.  All the airlines do code sharing 
internationally.  Instead of having both a Canadian Airlines and 
an Air Canada flight leaving Toronto at 7 p.m. to go to Calgary, 
why would they not code share that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naively I thought when the government relaxed section 47 that 
the airlines would talk. 
All they have done is gone off their own separate ways and now we 
are into mergers.  Maybe a merger is the only solution.  The 
airlines say it is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was hoping that while they had this opportunity they could 
actually talk about rationalizing some of the excess capacity. On 
the notion of cherry-picking routes, Air Canada proposed to 
Canadian Airlines that it would take its international routes. 
That is where Canadian Airlines makes its money.  Is that really 
working toward a solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The airlines have to get serious about dealing with this issue. 
I would like to see a little more creativity and imagination 
because at the end of the day we will have some very tough policy 
questions in the House.  I am not sure that we are getting much 
closer.  I really hope that we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada pilots have been to see me in my riding of Etobicoke 
North, which is very close to the airport.  The seniority issues 
are very serious for Air Canada pilots.  Whatever happens I would 
like to see the airlines, if merger has to be the solution, deal 
with it in a very complete and concrete way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If merger is the only answer there are some exciting 
possibilities.  For too long in Canada we had Canadian Airlines 
and Air Canada beating each other up, sometimes deliberately, 
while at the same time the international carriers were coming in 
and picking up our business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we end up with one airline with some rules and benchmarks in 
terms of competition and service, it will be our job as 
legislators to put that into play.  I think the prospects are 
incredible exciting.  We can then take on the world with whatever 
airline comes out of this and actually create a very profitable 
airline that serves all Canadians very well.  We are not there 
yet and still have some more work to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the question of providing a regulatory framework.  We 
have Canadian Airlines and Air Canada with regional carriers. 
Some of the regional carriers like Air Nova, Air Ontario and 
Canadian Regional are owned by the major airlines.  Somehow there 
has to be some rationalization of that capacity.  I am not quite 
sure how that will work without ending up with a monopoly 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look back to an experience in Toronto of a few years ago when 
we had a neat little airline called City Express.  It was flying 
out of Toronto Island, Montreal and Ottawa.  Some entrepreneurs 
put together the airline using Dash 8s.  It was a great service. 
It was going very well.  Suddenly Air Ontario came in with deep 
pockets and priced City Express out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about that.  How do we make sure that if we have 
a monopoly type situation there will be competition.  I am 
hopeful we can reach some sensible conclusions around that.  We 
talk about the rhetoric of a two airline policy but in Canada we 
have about a six airline policy.  There was a time when it was 
Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, but now we have some very 
serious players in the market; Air Transat, Canada 3000 and the 
WestJet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as we can create an environment that is friendly to them 
and if we end up with one airline, perhaps that will be part of 
the solution on competition.  We really have to apply our minds. 
The airline industry has to be much more creative.  I do not want 
to pick on Air Canada, but frankly I am not that keen on the Onex 
bid either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To line up Lufthansa and United and flow the money through to 
the shareholders, throw something into Hamilton and not deal with 
the capacity issue, would not be highly constructive.  I am not 
sure that what is on their minds is picking up the pieces of 
Canadian Airlines.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we have talked about it but I will put it on the floor 
here.  I do not think Canadians have a big appetite for that. The 
Government of Canada assigns the international routes.  The other 
day I asked someone from Air Canada whether Air Canada presumes 
the international routes, if Canadian Airlines flounders, would 
be allocated without any question to the new Air Canada.  It 
seems to me that our government would have options. I do not 
know.  I am not privy to those considerations of the government. 
We could take Air Canada's international routes and give them to 
Air Transat or Canada 3000.  Why are we obliged to give them to 
any surviving airline?  We have options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that all the players in the industry would stop playing 
games, apply their minds, be creative and try to come forward 
with propositions that meet our public policy objectives and the 
concerns and needs of all Canadians.   As legislatures let us get 
down to the business of setting the policy framework that will 
make this happen in a way that is acceptable to the Government of 
Canada and to all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to my colleague's address.  He raised all the problems 
that exist in the airline industry and put all the issues on the 
table.  However, he did not say what should be done.  He is 
leaving that to the airlines to sort out.  He touched on some 
very good points, the biggest being competition.  He talked about 
a regional airline that priced the other one out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to my colleague is about increasing the foreign 
level as the Competition Bureau has indicated.  Most people point 
out that it would go to the so-called new airline.  I am looking 
at it another way.  I am looking at airlines like WestJet that 
has done a tremendous job for services in the west.  These 
companies are growing bigger and are taking over and providing 
that competition for Canadians— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not know if there was a question there, 
but the hon. member can address himself to the statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite is a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleague, always address your statements 
to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my apologies.  The role of 
government is to set a policy framework against which proposals 
will be weighed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as foreign ownership, as I said before the sole 
perspective of the Competition Bureau is competition in Canada. I 
wish the Competition Bureau would be as rigorous on this as it is 
about gasoline pricing.  I have certainly been involved in that 
discussion.  It does not have to look at the question of whether 
it is Canadian controlled.  That is a serious issue for 
Canadians. I would have problems going above 25%.  From a 
strictly economic point of view one could argue that it might be 
more efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As policymakers we have to look at things other than economic 
efficiency.  In fairness to the Competition Bureau that is its 
mandate, but as legislators we have to look at it more broadly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he remember Bill S-31, which limited ownership in a Canadian 
company to 10%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was passed, of course, to prevent the Caisse de dépôt et de

surprised to see that today the government is willing to set 
aside the act to accommodate the Liberal Party's bagman, the 
Onex president, and increase the 10% limit to allow Onex to take 
over Air Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said in my remarks, 
when Air Canada was privatized the decision was made to limit 
single shareholders to 10%.  That was done so that the shares 
would be widely distributed across Canada.  I was not there at 
the time, but it was probably a sensible policy decision.  My 
colleague was there and he agrees with me.  The irony is that 
there is no such requirement for Canadian Airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign ownership is another interesting twist.  In the Onex 
proposal, American Airlines would actually own less of Canadian 
Airlines than it owns today.  I think it owns about 34% or 35% 
today.  That would come down to about 15%.  How can we apply one 
standard for Air Canada and another for Canadian Airlines? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy objective of widely distributing participation in Air 
Canada has been met.  Why do we perpetuate this?  It is a good 
debating point, but to me it does not make any sense to close 
down the option until we have had a discussion about it. 
Frankly, I do not see the public policy objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate thing is that when Canadian Airlines was in 
severe financial difficulty American Airlines came in, put a lot 
of money into Canadian and sewed up a lot of agreements which, in 
the final analysis, as a business proposition, was probably the 
thing that had to be done.  However, at the end of the day, 
Canadian has been strapped with some agreements which have really 
hampered it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not very happy with the extent of control American Airlines 
might have over Canadian the way it is structured now.  However, 
I gather that Onex has come forward this afternoon with a new 
proposal and I will read it with interest. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
listening to the member's speech and, for the life of me, I do 
not know in which direction he is headed.  He started at one 
point in the circle and he chased himself all the way around the 
circle.  I will ask him a direct question which has to do with 
foreign ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 26 the minister said that he would address the 10% 
foreign ownership regulation.  He said that he would take another 
look at it.  That has not happened yet, but there is a lot of 
discussion on it.  The minister is willing to look at it.  We now 
have a new Onex bid, with direct Liberal connections, that is 
apparently proposing 14.5% foreign ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister wanted to open this up for direct competition, 
would it not have been better to open up the foreign ownership 
bid early on when the Competition Act was cancelled?  When the 
foreign ownership part is opened up 78 days later there are fewer 
people willing to put a bid together in the timeframe that is 
left during the 90 days when the regulations of the Competition 
Act have been suspended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are stifling competition.  We are allowing one person to bid 
because they have already done their homework, they have already 
spent millions of dollars, and they already know how much and 
what limit they can reach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will answer on two fronts. 
First of all, the member is in error.  As many Canadians are 
doing, he is mixing up the 10% ownership rule with the foreign 
ownership rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10% rule means that for Air Canada, not Canadian Airlines, 
no single person or body can own more than 10% of Air Canada. 
That was implemented when Air Canada was privatized.  The foreign 
ownership rule is the 25% rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Onex proposal came forward it was in the form of a 
proposition.  Clearly, if the government at that point in time 
had a policy decision that it was not going to contemplate 
increasing the 10% rule, the government would have said so.  Onex 
would not have proceeded up to this point if it did not feel the 
government was open to that discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it amazing that Air Canada would be so dogmatic about the 
10% rule.  I think it is somewhat self-serving.  If Air Canada 
came forward with a proposal which violated the 10% rule, my take 
on that would be that it would be saying that it does not meet 
the requirements of the law of the land now, but it would 
respectfully submit that there is a proposal on the floor which 
now exceeds the rule and it would like its proposal to be 
considered as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are legislators.  When people talk to us they ask us to 
legislate.  Why is it so impossible for someone to say that we 
should reconsider the 10% rule? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At times, when it is convenient, people hide behind these rules. 
No one has actually increased the 10%.  No one has done that.  No 
one has violated the law of the land.  Someone has come forward 
and said that perhaps we should reconsider.  Frankly, if Air 
Canada had done the same I do not know how our government could 
possibly have said “You cannot do that”, because we did not say 
that to Onex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am fully confident that if Air Canada had come forward with 
that proposition we would have had the same kind of policy 
framework that has been articulated more recently by the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we playing games or are we interested in solutions?  Let us 
try to work on this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would indicate at the outset that I will be 
splitting my time with the hon. member for Kings—Hants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to rise to take part in the debate, a debate 
which I think has caused a great deal of uneasiness.  There have 
obviously been even elements of consternation in the debate 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen in a number of instances, it appears that the 
government is now lapsing into crisis management.  We have seen 
it in the fisheries as a result of the Marshall decision.  We 
have seen it in the debate over the pay equity settlement.  Let 
us hope that this particular situation is not going wind up 
before the courts.  The hon. member who just spoke has indicated, 
quite rightly, that we as legislators have to deal with 
situations such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate the Bloc for bringing this motion 
forward.  The timeliness of it is extremely important.  It is an 
issue that is moving along at breakneck pace and one which has 
not been handled particularly well by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be supporting the motion because the motives behind the 
proposal to increase the ownership limit of Air Canada, the 10% 
rule, and the 10% public participation rule, are very important 
and credible and should be considered free of all outside 
influences.  The 10% rule is one of the issues that is at the 
very crux of this debate, as well as the confidence that 
Canadians have in the deals which are being proposed and the 
solutions to this crisis in our airline that are being brought 
forward and supported, for the most part, by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current proposal calls for a change to the 10% rule.  This 
is one change that would be completely influenced by one proposal 
over another on the issue of merger.  It shows and smacks of 
favouritism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process itself is one that has been fraught with a great 
deal of misinformation and a great deal of confusion.  The 
government's timing of the announcement with respect to the 
suspension of the Competition Act was something else that caused 
a great deal of concern on the part of all Canadians and a great 
deal of concern in particular in the business community because 
it has broad, far-reaching implications for all business 
practitioners in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal to change the 10% rule at the beginning of the 90 
day negotiation period might have been acceptable.  It might have 
been acceptable.  It would certainly have been more acceptable 
than what we have occurring in this instance, which is, 16 days 
before the end of the 90 day suspension of the Competition Act, 
we have the government basically moving the goal posts, changing 
the rules of engagement and allowing, without any doubt, a very 
undue and unfair advantage to one of the proponents, one of the 
proposed businesses that looked to engage and take over what is 
our national airline, or our two national airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put this in its proper context, with 16 days to go in the 90 
day window for negotiation, the government suddenly, out of the 
blue, announced a plan to change the 10% ownership rule. 
That left absolutely no time for any serious offer or any serious 
business to come forward and develop, or at least put into the 
mix a bid with respect to this offer.  The new proposal, if it 
were to come, would be at an unfair advantage.  Even if a 
proposal could be made within the 16 day period, it would be 
completely unfair compared to a proposal made by, in this case, 
one of the proponents in the time period it has had.  The timing 
itself is something that is extremely suspect and extremely 
tenuous when it comes down to the issue of fairness and 
competition, which is what is at the very root of this issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the 10% rule, the proposal to change the 10% 
rule at this late date strongly demonstrates that the government 
is flying by the seat of its pants, improvising daily as to how 
to react or respond to the various businesses that are currently 
involved.  As I said before, the crux of the issue is that there 
could have been more.  In a competitive business world what we 
would surely want when it comes to our national airline is to 
have the best proposals and the best options to choose from.  It 
is a very fundamental motherhood issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester put it, in terms 
that Canadians can understand, if we are going out to Canadian 
Tire to buy a toaster, we are not going to buy one brand of 
toaster without looking at the various options that are 
available.  Compare that to having national airlines worth 
billions of dollars and the suggestion that we should simply buy 
this one because it has been proposed and it is the only option 
that is available because the government tells us so. Behind the 
scenes we know that is not the case.  This is not a situation 
where there was fair competition, where the rules that applied to 
one business applied to all.  It is at the very fundamental root 
of the Competition Act that this is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Act was suspended.  The rules were pulled away 
and, very curiously, the minister asked that the bureau look at a 
very narrow part of this deal.  He has chosen to take out of the 
mix the normal scrutiny that would be applied by the bureau and 
he has, for all intents and purposes, emasculated the Competition 
Bureau and given it a very specific mandate as to what it should 
look at in the context of this deal.  He has said:  “The 
minister's option is the preferred option and therefore I am 
going to point you in that direction.  I am not going to ask you 
to look at the entire situation as you normally would if the 
Competition Act were in full force and effect, but I am going to 
suggest that you take this particular aspect of your job and you 
follow it.  In the meantime, I will continue to oversee the 
situation”.  It was a very paternalistic and narrow view taken 
by the minister.  The effect at the end of the day is that we may 
wind up with a dominant carrier approach which will not serve 
Canadians well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other fundamental motherhood issues is how this will 
affect jobs, how it will affect the employment situation in the 
country.  The Canadian aviation industry includes thousands of 
employees in all regions of the country.  Again I congratulate 
the Bloc for bringing the matter forward, but this is not limited 
to any one region of the country.  It has drastic implications in 
the west, in the east, in the north and all over the country. 
More than anything else, this is something the government has to 
constantly have at the front of its mind and hopefully on its 
priority list, as to how it examines, manages or mismanages this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the effect going to be on jobs in this country?  There 
are dozens of smaller airlines that will obviously be affected as 
well, and there are hundreds of airports and hundreds of 
communities, in terms of being isolated in the service that will 
be provided to them, which will be affected in a profound way if 
this issue is not resolved in a fair and equitable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new situation.  It is something the government 
surely should have seen coming down the pike, but again, somehow, 
for some reason which is beyond me and beyond the understanding 
of many Canadians, the government is not reacting.  It is simply 
improvising and reacting in a day to day way, as opposed to 
having some sort of concrete or deliberate path that it is 
following, giving Canadians the confidence they should have in 
their national government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again hearken back to the issue of employment.  The government 
is proposing to completely restructure and revamp our national 
airline in 90 days.  That is less than the gestation period of a 
mayfly.  Somehow the government wants to completely change our 
national airline and asks Canadians to have faith in the process, 
all the while changing the rules of engagement as it goes along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not something that should instil a great deal of 
confidence in Canadians.  It is something we should slow down and 
something we should look at extremely carefully.  We should 
ensure that those who are in the know are actually making the 
right decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the problem here is that we do not know who is in the 
know.  We do not know what information is available.  We do not 
know when the information was released that the Competition Act 
would be suspended.  We do not what information was exchanged 
between the various airlines prior to the suspension of the 
Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be extremely diligent in the way we proceed in the next 
number of days, months and years because the effect is going to 
be profound and potentially devastating on communities in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish Godspeed to the minister and to the transportation 
committee as they proceed in their deliberations because this is 
a very serious issue.  I am hoping and putting trust in those 
members of the committee that they are going to hold to account 
the government on this matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his last 
comments, in the best of parliamentary spirit, wishing all of us 
well.  This is a very difficult file and it does have 
ramifications for travel throughout the country.  How we handle 
this will define who we are as a country and a people as we go 
into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in and out of the chamber, for which I apologize because I 
missed some of the hon. member's remarks, but I was led to 
believe that he made a statement to the effect that I have said 
that the 10% limit is to be raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said at the committee the other day for the public record 
is that the government is prepared to consider raising the limit 
of 10% if, and only if, there is an interest that will be pursued 
in improving the airline industry.  In other words, if it 
improves the viability or the stability of the airline industry 
then we would consider it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what we are doing is in the best of parliamentary 
traditions.  We are consulting MPs.  We are having a debate 
today.  I welcome the debate as well because I think it has been 
a very good debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member did not unintentionally mislead the House 
with his statement a few minutes ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
attendance of the minister and his participation in the debate. 
I think it is extremely important.  As he said, the implications 
are grave.  This is probably the biggest and most complicated 
file that this ministry has faced in decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be very clear on this.  I would never want to mislead 
the House or misrepresent the facts in the debate.  My 
understanding is that the minister has floated the idea of 
changing the 10% rule.  He has not said that he would or he would 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the crux of the matter is that this causes confusion 
within the industry.  This causes the participants in the debate 
to feel like they are on unstable ground as to what is going to 
happen next.  The lack of policy, the lack of leadership and firm 
commitment as to what the rules of engagement are, is causing a 
great deal of misunderstanding, mistrust and confusion among the 
proponents and among Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the minister to be perhaps more definitive and 
more diligent in making his position clear to Canadians and 
making his government's policy or plan clear to Canadians so that 
we do not have issues swirling out there in the public debate and 
this furore over what is going to happen and the confusion and 
consternation.  That is not what is needed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We need firm leadership from this minister and the minister of 
fisheries on other issues, and many issues that are out there 
right now.  I am certainly glad that we have the ability to 
debate this in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it would have been nice if we had been back here on the 
start-up date that was initially proposed in September.  We would 
have had a better opportunity to look at all of these issues at 
an earlier instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have two 
questions for the member.  First, he talks about a lack of 
policy, has he read the policy framework that I deposited in 
front of the committee the other day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, is he suggesting that we should have said that we would 
not consider raising the limit?  I submit that if we had said 
that we would have been accused of bias by eliminating one of the 
proposals that will be considered by shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, to a large extent, the 
minister has fallen on his own sword with that last comment.  He 
deposited his government's policy the other day; 74 days into the 
situation he deposited his government's policy.  In the middle of 
the game, he suddenly says “Oh, by the way, there has been a 
rule change and here is where we stand on it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the minister himself has suddenly come up with a policy on 
this particular point is not the type of leadership nor the solid 
positioning that those involved in this particular debate should 
draw any sort of solace or comfort from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to whether I have read this particular policy that was 
deposited the other day, the fact of the matter is no.  We have a 
very competent and able member of the committee, the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester who, I am quite positive—and he is 
nodding in agreement—has read it.  He has certainly made his 
views very clear on this and will continue to do so, I might add. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak today on this very important issue.  The 
future of the Canadian airlines industry is at stake and it is 
very important that we take this issue very seriously in the 
debate tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate is about the 10% rule and that being the maximum that 
any one group can own of Air Canada.  I am not defending the 10% 
rule.  The issue before us should not be debated in the last 
stages of a negotiation period or in the last stages of a period 
during which the Competition Bureau has been suspended for at 
least one of the proposed mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10% rule has inherently some flaws.  It can help protect 
mediocre or even bad management.  It can reduce shareholders 
equity and the competitiveness of a company.  Potentially, there 
are even issues whereby the 10% rule could be seen as in 
violation of NAFTA seeing as the 10% rule was utilized in 1988 
and apparently, if one reads the fine print, because of the fact 
that the privatization occurred before 1994 when NAFTA came into 
effect, this 10% rule may not be actually tenable under NAFTA. 
There are some real issues about the 10% rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is why are we not discussing the 10% rule and some 
of these other issues, including the cabotage issue, as part of 
the discussion of a general restructuring of the Canadian airline 
structure when we are not in the middle of a crisis?  The 
difficulty here is that we always seem to get to a crisis 
position before we actually deal with some of the structural 
issues facing Canadians and the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is inappropriate to be trial ballooning significant changes 
in the nature or the structure of the Canadian airlines at such a 
difficult and heated time.  We should have done this long before. 
I would argue that the suspension of the Competition Bureau's 
activities on the Onyx proposal should be considered an admission 
of failure by the government to lead and to actually provide some 
visionary restructuring to the Canadian airlines industry a lot 
sooner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the Canadian airlines industry is having 
difficulty is nothing new. 
We have known this for a long time.  In fact this government, 
which has been in power since 1993, has been aware of the 
challenges facing the Canadian airlines industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The consumers should not be asked to pay the price for the 
government's dilly-dallying, dithering and failure to address the 
major issues in a holistic, forward-thinking and visionary 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stated in one of the papers I read this morning 
that he may be amenable to allowing foreigners to set up shop in 
Canada to provide Canadian based airline units with foreign-owned 
routes and servicing within Canada.  Again, that is another issue 
that should be discussed when we are not in the heat of an 
airline crisis and in the heart of negotiations on at least two 
fronts now with two proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have been discussing the 10% rule, the notion of 
cabotage and all these types of issues during a period of time 
when we were less rushed and when we were in less of a crisis 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of this crisis management, knee-jerk reaction that the 
government is taking now, we could have actually provided a 
framework to the airline industry to allow restructuring to occur 
as opposed to having the airline industry and entities within the 
airlines industry, in this case Canadian and Air Canada, actually 
having to come up with proposals.  The government is effectively 
cutting the suit to fit the cloth on this one.  It is not really 
providing the structural framework that one expects from 
governments for the private sector to respond in a more long term 
and meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's approach to the airlines is very similar to the 
government's approach on the bank merger issue.  Members will 
remember that about a year ago we were very heavily ensconced in 
the debate on the bank mergers issue?   The government had 
ignored, from 1993 forward, some of the structural reforms 
necessary in the financial services sector until, at one point or 
another, there were private sector proposals that forced the 
government to make a decision on those specific proposals.  In 
this case and currently, we are focused in Canada not on the 
holistic nature of reforming and restructuring the Canadian 
airlines, we are focused on two specific mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bank merger situation, the whole focus of Canadians, 
which should have been on restructuring the Canadian financial 
services sector to provide an industry that was more capable of 
competing globally and at the same time meeting the needs of 
Canadians, was suddenly focused on two specific merger proposals. 
Unfortunately, this is not, in my opinion, the right approach to 
develop public policy in the long term interests of the 
competitiveness of Canadian industry and in the long term 
interests of protecting Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government's merger decision in the financial services 
sector, we have seen some of the ramifications or repercussions 
of that decision.  We have heard the Bank of Montreal announce 
layoffs of 1,400 workers in direct response to the merger 
decision.  We have heard the Bank of Montreal announce that 100 
branches will close.  Members should keep in mind that one of the 
conditions that the banks had agreed to if the mergers were 
allowed was to maintain branch operations, to service all the 
rural communities currently being serviced and to maintain 
current levels of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister, dealing with a crisis within his own 
leadership aspirations and trying to shore up support among the 
backbenchers, allowed for a Liberal caucus revolt.  The Liberal 
caucus witch hunt on banks occurred.  What we saw was an uprising 
within the Liberal backbenchers that effectively prevented a 
focus on public policy that would have been in the long term 
interests of the Canadian industry or in the long term interests 
of Canadian customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to realize that there has been a $7.2 
billion loss in bank shareholder capital in Canada since that 
decision. 
During the same period in the U.S. there has been a 7.4% increase 
in shareholder value with U.S. banks.  This is very important 
given that 7.5 million Canadians are bank shareholders, directly 
or indirectly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen 1,400 jobs lost just with one of the banks involved 
since then because of the merger decision.  The Dominion Bond 
Rating Service has downgraded Canadian banks, directly 
attributing its decision to do that to the Minister of Finance's 
decision. There has been a loss of market capital and a 
compromising of the ability of Canadians to save and invest for 
their future, in many cases for their retirement, all because of 
that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is here we are again focused on specific merger 
proposals and not dealing with the issues in a long term 
revisionary way.  It is in stark contrast to the previous 
Conservative government's vision and courage to tackle the real 
issues not just facing Canadians today or tomorrow, but facing 
Canadians in the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government would not have had the courage to pursue a free 
trade agreement.  This government would not have had the courage 
or vision to implement a significant tax reform and some tax 
policies that were not popular but proved to be the right 
policies in the long term.  I do not believe this government 
would have had the foresight and vision and courage to implement 
some of the deregulation policies in financial services, 
transportation and energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, here we are again in the heat of merger discussions 
coming up with policies to try to deal with specific mergers 
proposed by the private sector, having failed to provide a long 
term approach before a crisis situation. The government's 
approach to this issue and most issues it faces is one of crisis 
management.  It is a knee-jerk reaction.  It is analogous to 
someone installing a sprinkler system while the house is on fire. 
It is simply no way to run a railway as one saying goes.  It is 
no way to run an airline either, but it is also no way to run a 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to ask a question of my colleague from 
Kings—Hants, for whom I have the utmost respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same question I asked of the Liberal member opposite. 
He probably was a young student in 1982 and he may not remember 
why Bill S-31, limiting to 10% the ownership of any company by a 
buying company, was introduced at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Caisse de dépôt et placement intended to get substantial 
ownership of Canadian Pacific. 
The prime minister of the day—all the members will recall that 
it was a certain Pierre Trudeau who did not like Quebec very 
much and who feared Quebec's influence in everything—had Bill 
S-31 passed. It was to prevent the Caisse de dépôt et placement 
du Québec from buying Canadian Pacific. I must tell you that it 
was not the loftiest of initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we see that the government, to favour its friends, to allow 
the Liberal Party's bagman buy Air Canada, will use this 
legislation to let Onex become part owner of Air Canada and 
Canadian Airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my colleague from Kings—Hants will remember that. I wonder 
if he would like to comment on that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, in 1982 I was not old 
enough to have a driver's licence.  I do not remember the 
specific legislation.  However, I have a great deal of respect 
for my hon. colleague, and I can say that the types of policies 
that governments implemented in 1982 and in fact in the 1970s 
were very different.  I believe that even the Liberals realize 
that part of the reason is that we are operating in a global 
environment. We are dealing with many global realities which are 
quite different from those which existed in the 1970s and early 
1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult for me to compare those two issues because 
I believe we are dealing with profoundly different global 
competitiveness issues today. 
What may have been appropriate then would probably not be 
appropriate now in a policy sense.  It is also important to 
realize that Caisse de dépôt now owns 10% of Air Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, do I take it from what the hon. member for 
Kings—Hants said that he is in favour of bank mergers and 
against airline mergers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best advice we have is that any change in the 10% rule will 
not abrogate any of our NAFTA commitments.  The Alberta 
legislature did away with the 10% rule on Canadian Airlines last 
year because of course the parent was PWA, a creature of the 
Alberta legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Bureau will indeed very much be at play in 
whatever happens.  It will be looking at the merger in the normal 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member that the government was faced with 
three scenarios in July:  a bailout of Canadian Airlines; a 
potential failure of Canadian Airlines; or finding some other 
way, imperfect as it may be, to find a proper solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, on the first question 
relative to the bank merger issue, our party was not in favour of 
bank mergers. We were in favour at that time of the Minister of 
Finance negotiating the best deal on behalf of Canadians.  He had 
the opportunity to do that because the banks were willing to 
commit to 10% reductions in services charges, services to rural 
communities and branch openings and maintaining jobs with 
Canadian banks.  Unfortunately the Minister of Finance blew that 
opportunity. He was so focused on the short term politics of the 
issue that he forgot about the long term interests of Canadians. 
That is the crux of that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Relative to the crisis the government found itself in this 
summer on the airline industry and Canadian Airlines, I would 
suggest to the minister a more forward thinking and visionary 
approach over the past several years in restructuring the 
Canadian airlines industry in advance of this kind of crisis 
would have prevented this evolution of events. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the discussion has been 
exciting and debate during the day has been very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue to deal with some of the issues that have been 
presented.  I realize that some of the concepts I will present 
will be repetitive but we all know that if we repeat things often 
enough it leads to an effective learning experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Minister of Transport for his presentation on this 
subject before the House and the Senate standing committees on 
Tuesday and the policy framework document he tabled.  He has shed 
a great deal of light on a topic that has been of consuming 
interest to members of the House and to Canadians for several 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government position is now known.  Private sector parties 
will now be able to act with full knowledge of the government's 
policy framework and the process announced by the minister that 
will be used to approve and condition any proposal to restructure 
the airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would particularly like to address two important issues raised 
last Tuesday by the minister.  Those have been the central theme 
for much of today's debate.  The first was the limit on ownership 
of Air Canada's voting shares established in the Air Canada 
Public Participation Act at 10%.  The second was the limitation 
on foreign ownership of any Canadian air carrier and the 
requirement for Canadian control that are established in the 
Canada Transportation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those two issues are often confused.  They sound so similar but 
they address different concepts.  Both issues are very relevant 
to airline restructuring and both were addressed by the Minister 
of Transport in his policy framework and his statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that by addressing them together I will not only be able 
to illuminate two quite technical issues, but also to clear up 
any confusion that may exist between them in the minds of some 
members of the House. 
Some members are quite confused.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 25% limit on voting shares held by foreign investors applies 
to all Canadian carriers, including Air Canada.  It is an 
aggregate figure such that it places an upper limit on the 
ability of non-Canadians acting separately or in concert with 
others to influence the result of any shareholder vote.  This 
quantitative limit is accompanied in the Canada Transportation 
Act by a qualitative test of control in fact by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsibility for applying the ownership limit and the control 
test lies with the Canadian Transportation Agency, a 
quasi-judicial body that operates at arm's length from the 
government and the Minister of Transport.  Those are very 
important points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other feature to note is that both the 25% test and the 
requirement for control in fact are ongoing obligations that are 
assessed before the airline is originally licensed to operate as 
a Canadian air carrier. That can be reassessed at any time based 
on developments with the airline that affect its ownership and 
governance, or on any other new information that may come to the 
agency's attention at any future time, or on the basis of 
complaint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of these two tests, which together I will refer to 
as the Canadian ownership and control rules, is straightforward. 
The purpose is to ensure that all Canadian air carriers are owned 
and controlled by Canadians, that is, that this industry which is 
so key to all Canadians remains Canadian in the full sense of the 
term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving now to a consideration of the 10% rule, this rule applies 
to Air Canada only as it appears in the Air Canada Public 
Participation Act, not the Canada Transportation Act or any other 
federal act of general application.  No other airline in Canada 
is subject to such a rule, although this has not always been the 
case.  Until 18 months ago, Canadian Airlines was subject to a 
similar restriction left over from the time it was owned by the 
province of Alberta.  The provision was rescinded by the Alberta 
government in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10% rule is not aimed at non-Canadians per se.  It applies 
to all shareholders, both Canadian and non-Canadian.  This rule 
applies to any individuals as well as to individuals acting 
together, such that shareholders are expressly forbidden from 
entering into any agreement that would allow any person, together 
with the associates of that person, to own or control directly or 
indirectly voting shares which represent more than 10% of the 
votes that may be cast to elect members of the board of directors 
of Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10% rule was included in the Air Canada Public Participation 
Act when it was passed in 1988 in order to ensure that Air Canada 
remained widely held.  As I understand it, the idea was that Air 
Canada was already widely held in that it was a crown corporation 
owned in equal measure by all Canadians.  So when the airline was 
privatized, parliament was loath to contemplate that this 
national carrier might some day be owned and controlled by any 
individual or group, even recognizing that they would be 
Canadians as provided for by the Canadian ownership and control 
rules. It appears that this idea was sufficiently persuasive on 
its face that it received little debate among Canadians in the 
media or in parliament at that time and became part of the 
legislation that governs Air Canada to this very day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point to be clear on is that the 10% limit is not, and I 
repeat not—
