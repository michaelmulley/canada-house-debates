Speaker, I have the privilege of presenting a petition. I want to 
make it clear that in presenting this petition I do not agree with 
the actions of the person represented in it.
<P>
	The petition has to do with the case of Robert Latimer of 
Wilkie, Saskatchewan. Numerous petitioners ask Parliament to 
recognize that the actions of Robert Latimer were motivated by 
love and should not be treated similarly to actions motivated by 
other reasons.
<P>
	It is a very difficult and very distressful situation. I certainly 
concur with the mood and the feeling of these petitioners that 
there needs to be some recognition in the laws of Canada that 
would allow the courts to provide for sentences with leniency 
for people based on the motivation of their offence.

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-85, an act to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act and to provide for the continuation of a certain 
provision, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, the pension plan for members of 
Parliament has been a matter of discussion and concern by 
members of Parliament and by the Canadian public for quite a 
number of years. In recent times we have received many 
petitions and letters on the subject. Indeed, the House addressed 
the issue previously with a full day of debate on November 22, 
1994. Members had the opportunity to discuss the various ins 
and outs of what needed to be done in terms of the MP pension 
plan.
<P>
	Today, we begin second reading debate on Bill C-85, an act to 
amend the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This matter has been debated publicly for over a decade.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When the Liberal Party entered the 1993 election campaign it 
put forward a policy book of specific recommendations that a 
Liberal government would undertake in its mandate. The 
Canadian public then elected a majority of Liberal MPs to 
govern Canada. That same electorate expected this new Liberal 
government to  follow through on the stated commitments as 
outlined during the election campaign and put into writing in the 
book ``Creating Opportunity'', which is frequently talked about 
today as the red book.
<P>
	The red book preamble on this subject matter began with the 
words:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the pension regime of members of Parliament has been the focus of 
considerable controversy. It is now the subject of an independent review which 
Liberals support. We believe that reform is necessary.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The independent review cited in the red book is the ``Study of 
Parliamentarians' Compensation'' carried out by the pension 
consulting firm of Sobeco. Ernst &amp; Young. This report was 
delivered to the current government in March 1994 with specific 
recommendations on compensation issues for senators and MPs 
that went beyond just the pension plan.
<P>
	In addition to talking about that report the red book went 
further. It said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whatever the results of the independent review, a Liberal government will 
reform the pension plan of members of Parliament to end ``double dipping''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
It was saying, in effect, that MPs should not be able to leave 
office and receive a pension from the federal government if they 
accept a new full time paying job from the federal government. 
It goes on to say: ``In addition we will review the question of the 
minimum age at which pensions will begin to be paid''.
<P>
	The announcement of the government's intention to reform 
the pension plan, which I made previously in the House, and the 
legislation which is currently before us, Bill C-85, will 
implement the specific red book commitments made by the 
Liberal Party during the election campaign of 1993, and in fact 
goes further in this legislation.
<P>
	Having given that background, I would like to take the House 
through a few chronological events which have happened since 
the election of October 5, 1993, leading up to the bill we are 
debating today.
<P>
	The first notable event is the consultations and the eventual 
report prepared by Sobeco, Ernst and Young. The consultations 
which they carried out focused on four groups: present MPs, 
senators, newly retired or defeated MPs from the last House and 
longstanding retired parliamentarians. Focus groups were held 
and a great deal of information came to light on the particular 
role of parliamentarians and how the compensation issues 
addressed their roles.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12152"> 12152 </A></B>
<P>
	I will not go on at length about the methodology or all of the 
specific findings of the report. I would urge members to read the 
report if they have not had the opportunity to do so already. It 
has been made available to all members of the House. However, 
I would like to acknowledge the members who participated in 
the consultative process. It is very important to have 
information about the impact of the compensation and the 
pension plan to help to determine what is the best course of 
action to take, in addition to those commitments which the 
government made during the election campaign.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There were not only government members and senators but 
also members of the opposition parties.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	In March of last year I had the opportunity to table the report 
in Parliament. Each member of Parliament was provided with a 
copy. The focus of the report was to rearrange the compensation 
elements for senators and MPs to more adequately reflect their 
roles as legislators, public policy makers, public advocates and 
representatives of Canadians.
<P>
	The Sobeco study came forward with concrete 
recommendations to decrease the amount paid out in pension to 
former parliamentarians who qualified for such a pension, but 
simultaneously it recommended an increase in the salary for 
members of Parliament; to go up on the salary and come down 
on the pension provisions.
<P>
	Private sector, provincial legislature and international 
pension plans were used for comparative analyses. The 
consultants did not just consult with members, they looked at 
what was happening in other locations and in the private sector 
as well. The specific results of these comparisons are detailed 
extremely well in the study.
<P>
	The report suggested tying changes in the salary component 
with pension plan changes. This recommendation, however, was 
received by the government just one month after the budget of 
February 1994. In that budget the government imposed a salary 
freeze on parliamentarians until 1997, in accordance with what 
we were already doing with respect to the public service. We 
have to get the deficit and the debt under control. We had to 
provide for that freeze because we could not afford to pay 
members of Parliament or members of the public service any 
more in compensation. It is in that light the report came forward. 
The government would not wait to change the pension plan for 
sunnier days. We cannot provide for an increase in wages at this 
time but we need to provide the changes we had promised in the 
pension plan.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	The Sobeco Ernst &amp; Young study had said that the 
compensation level should remain the same. In fact the overall 
compensation level when compared to the private sector was not 
near the top at all. If we cannot increase the salaries, which we 
cannot do, the question is how much do we go on the other side 
of the equation in terms of decreasing the pension plan? That has 
been one of the key considerations that we have had to take in 
this whole process.
<P>
	As I said a moment ago, we cannot wait for the day when we 
can deal with salary increases as suggested. We cannot afford 
them at the moment. While the total compensation approach 
outlined in the study is worthy of further discussion, it is not 
functionally possible at this time. However the pension 
recommendations are being acted on, which is what Bill C-85 is 
all about.
<P>
	The other ingredient in reporting on the question of 
compensation comes from the Lapointe commission, a 
parliamentary commission mandated by the Parliament of 
Canada Act to review the adequacy of compensation for senators 
and MPs. The commission was chaired by the Hon. Charles 
Lapointe, a respected former federal cabinet minister. The 
commissioners who sat with Mr. Lapointe included Jean Pigott, 
a former member of the House and Professor C.E.S. Franks from 
Queen's University, a noted academic expert on parliamentary 
affairs.
<P>
	The Lapointe commission held hearings and I understand a 
number of members of the House testified before that 
commission. The commission reported in July 1994, and again 
all members received copies of the findings.
<P>
	The particular recommendation of interest today that was 
brought forward by the commission, while not totally mirroring 
the Sobeco consulting report, nevertheless was quite similar. 
The total compensation approach was again suggested with an 
increase in salary and a decrease in pension benefits but overall 
keeping the compensation level the same.
<P>
	Although I am summarizing the general scope of the 
consultation process and not going into the finer details of the 
recommendations put forward to the government, I would like to 
again thank the commissioners for their input to this important 
public debate.
<P>
	The last event in this chronological review is the formulation 
of the government's recommendations that culminate in this 
amendment to the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances 
Act.
<P>
	On February 22 of this year I publicly announced the 
government's position and this has been further elaborated on in 
Bill C-85. The Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act 
was first introduced in 1952 to provide pension coverage for 
members of the House of Commons. Senators' benefits were 
added in 1965. While there have been several amendments since 
that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12153"> 12153 </A></B>
<P>
time, the  most recent were in 1992 when the act was brought 
into compliance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	I move now to the question of minimum age. The legislation 
prior to Bill C-85 provides pension benefits for senators and 
MPs after serving six years in Parliament. A member can start 
drawing the pension immediately on leaving Parliament, 
regardless of age. This is the first amendment that I would like 
to address.
<P>
	The Government of Canada will follow through on its red 
book commitment to review the minimum age at which 
members can receive a pension by establishing age 55 as the 
minimum for service earned under the newly amended act. This 
amendment is found in clause 11 of the bill. The public, the 
media and members of the House have sought a minimum age 
for receipt of a parliamentary pension that better reflects what is 
available in the private sector. Private sector and public service 
pensions vary in their minimum age requirements. Many 
include a combination of age and service provisions, while 
many more establish a stand alone age.
<P>
	The government has put forward its amendment to establish 
age 55 based on a number of factors. The first is the adoption of 
the Lapointe commission report. That report also recommended 
age 55.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, the government has acknowledged the relatively 
short length of service for parliamentarians which primarily 
affected the decision to implement a stand alone age and not an 
age and service contribution. Most people who serve in this 
House do not serve long enough to collect a pension at all. 
Obviously the stand alone age made more sense in that regard.
<P>
	Finally, the government has attempted to put forward a 
system that is transparent and fair establishing a clearly defined 
benchmark leaving no possibility of confusion from the very 
calculations inherent in age and service combinations. We are 
saying quite simply it is age 55.
<P>
	The publicity that has been brought to the minimum age issue 
can perhaps best be characterized by a few celebrated cases of 
former members retiring or having been defeated from 
Parliament and receiving a pension when they were in their 
thirties or forties. While these ages are extremely early and do 
not provide retirement funds but an alternate source of income 
originally designed to assist in the transition of MPs from public 
life to the private sector, it is important to note that an 
overwhelming majority of parliamentary pensioners are 
presently over age 55, as high in fact as 87 per cent.
<P>
	When we hear about MPs receiving pensions in their thirties 
and forties, it is really the exception and not the general rule. 
Nevertheless, it is an issue that this government said it would 
address and is addressing. Not all former senators and MPs 
leave Parliament with excessive pensions at young ages. Almost 
half, as I indicated before, do not even get a pension at all.
<P>
	Let me address the matter of double dipping because the 
second amendment, the one which is found in clause 20, deals 
with the implementation of a restriction on double dipping for 
retired senators and MPs. The present pension plan does not 
provide a mechanism that reduces or eliminates salary or 
pension when a member receives income from two federal 
sources.
<P>
	For the purpose of this debate it would be extremely useful to 
put forward a definition of double dipping. Bill C-85 provides a 
very necessary legal definition of course, but I would like to put 
forward my interpretation of double dipping as it relates to this 
Parliament.
<P>
	Double dipping occurs when a former member of this House 
or the Senate of Canada is in receipt of a pension under this act 
and enters into employment, appointment or a personal service 
contract within the federal public sector earning remuneration 
from those activities in excess of $5,000 annually. With this 
definition I would hope that the jurisdictional lines as they relate 
to double dipping are clear.
<P>
	With that said, I would put to the House that this government 
will put a stop to the practice that is unacceptable to many 
Canadians. The pensions of former MPs and senators who have 
left public office and secured paid employment within the 
federal government's jurisdiction will be reduced dollar for 
dollar. A $5,000 threshold will be established to avoid 
penalizing part time income earners.
<P>
	The varied definitions of double dipping that have been put 
forward in public debate over the pension plan is staggering. 
Provincial legislators, public servants, military personnel and 
even private sector pensioners have been thrown into the mix at 
different times. Some of them sit on the benches of the third 
party so I think they would want to be a little quieter during this 
discussion.
<P>
	That is not part of what this mandate was in terms of Bill 
C-85. Bill C-85 deals with the question of members of 
Parliament who go out from here and get another job in the 
federal public service. That is what we said in the election 
campaign we would end and that is what we are ending.
<P>
	I would also like to highlight the leadership the Prime 
Minister has demonstrated in ensuring that governor in council 
appointments made prior to this legislation coming into force 
would be affected. The legislation on double dipping comes into 
effect when royal assent is given to this bill, hopefully sometime 
within the next few weeks or months. However, there have been 
numerous appointments that have been made going back to the 
beginning of this government when elected on October 25, 1993. 
In this case the Prime Minister has asked appointees who have 
served in Parliament, former MPs or senators, and are currently 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12154"> 12154 </A></B>
<P>
receiving a pension to return those benefits to the crown or 
reduce their salaries by the amount of pension received.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	There are a number of examples that have been raised in 
public debate. It is for resolving those instances of double 
dipping that I would like to commend and thank the Prime 
Minister. Even though this bill is not yet in effect, he has ensured 
that it is in effect in terms that nobody appointed to a position 
who collects from the federal purse in the term of this 
government also collects a pension. He has specifically ended 
that kind of double dipping, going back to the beginning of this 
term.
<P>
	An example of the application of the proposed double dipping 
amendment would be that when a former MP in receipt of a 
parliamentary pension of for example, $40,000 and who is 
appointed to a government post which might have a salary of 
$75,000, the former MP would lose all entitlement to a pension 
while employed by the Government of Canada. A pension of 
$40,000 would be reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of the 
salary. In this case, using those numbers, it would leave a zero 
balance in terms of pension while that person was collecting 
elsewhere on the public payroll.
<P>
	It is important to realize that a $1 per year adviser to the 
government should quite obviously not lose any pension 
benefits during service to the crown. That is the reason for this 
$5,000 threshold, to exclude those who are earning very nominal 
sums or very small part time remuneration.
<P>
	Members of the House may not believe that legislation could 
be debated that prevents the $1 per year adviser from collecting 
a pension. Nobody would dispute that. However, I point out to 
all members that private members' Bill C-208 last spring would 
have done just that. In fact, there is a second private members' 
bill currently before the House that would have the same effect, 
preventing a $1 per year adviser to the government from 
collecting an earned pension, not just while employed but 
forever thereafter. I think we are dealing with it in a fair and 
reasonable manner.
<P>
	A final point on the double dipping issue is that former MPs 
and senators who are currently appointed to a position in the 
federal public sector and are then reappointed after the day on 
which our bill receives royal assent will be subject to the double 
dipping provision. The Prime Minister has received from them 
compliance on a voluntary basis, but after royal assent if a 
reappointment comes up they would be subject to the provisions 
of the bill.
<P>
	Let me deal with the question of savings. We are also cutting 
benefits that are available to retiring members. The red book 
speaks of double dipping and minimum age.
<P>
	It is quite obvious in those letters and petitions from the 
Canadian public and pension plan members that they want more 
reform. The Liberal government acted on the need for reform 
and has now put forward additional amendments in Bill C-85 
that will have the effect of going even further.
<P>
	The costs of the pension plan have been significantly 
decreased, by 33 per cent. That is direct savings to the Canadian 
taxpayer of some $3.3 million from a $10 million pension 
contribution. These savings are generated in two ways.
<P>
	First is the establishment of a minimum age which will result 
in fewer former members collecting a pension at an early age. 
The most important element in the savings equation is the 20 per 
cent reduction in the benefit MPs will earn on future service. 
This is the accrual rate reduction, as hon. members will know.
<P>
	Speaking of the accrual rate, the current pension plan 
provides benefits for MPs based on the best six years of salary 
with a benefit rate or accrual rate of 5 per cent. That is 5 per cent 
of an MPs average sessional indemnity, as we call it, per year of 
service.
<P>
	This accrual rate is to be reduced by Bill C-85. Clause 9 of the 
bill will reduce the present 5 per cent accrual rate to 4 per cent, a 
20 per cent cut in benefits for MPs. It will be this 20 per cent cut 
that will provide the lion's share of the savings to the 
government and to Canadian taxpayers, which as I said a 
moment ago totals 33 per cent savings.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	Senators' pensions will not be affected and will remain at 
current levels because senators receive 3 per cent. They are 
already at a lower level of their average sessional indemnity per 
year of service.
<P>
	The accrual rate of 5 per cent for every year of service for MPs 
at present provides for a maximum contribution of 15 years. Not 
too many are here for 15 years, but if a member gets to 15 years, 
he or she can get to the 75 per cent pension level. If an MP serves 
for eight years in Parliament, his or her pension would be 
calculated as eight years times the 5 per cent accrual rate, 
equalling a pension of 40 per cent of salary.
<P>
	The amendment act will continue to provide for a ceiling, 
which as I say not too many will achieve, of 75 per cent. A new 
member under these rules would need to contribute to the 
pension plan for 19 years in order to realize a similar benefit as 
that of the present plan.
<P>
	Members may wish to note that the accrual rate reduction 
applies to future service only, that is, service after the date when 
the act receives royal assent. What members of the House or 
former members of the House have accrued up to the date of 
royal assent, and the rate at which they have accrued it, is an 
entitlement which they have and will continue to have. That is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12155"> 12155 </A></B>
<P>
the way pension plans operate throughout the country. It is part 
of the normal pension regime.
<P>
	Let me deal with the question of tax treatment. Tax treatment 
of the overall pension plan is an integral element of the funding 
mix and thus is a significant contribution to the actual cost of the 
plan. The Income Tax Act prescribes a tax benefit for registered 
plans which does not exceed a 2 per cent accrual rate. This 
would be the amount which opposition members speak of when 
they talk of the legal limits of the pension plan. However, I 
would like to clarify for the House at this point that the Members 
of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act complies with the 
Income Tax Act. I particularly want the members of the third 
party to note that. That is a fact which some members have 
disputed and even raised in members statements or in question 
period.
<P>
	The act was amended in 1992 when the government of the day 
brought the plan into compliance with the Income Tax Act and 
provided that all benefits would be fully funded. It did so by 
dividing the plan into two parts: a registered pension plan 
containing those provisions which fall within the limits allowed 
under a registered pension plan or a plan registered under the 
Income Tax Act; and a retirement compensation arrangement, 
an RCA, which contains those elements in excess of the Income 
Tax Act. That is a common element, a common vehicle, for 
dealing with pension plans in the private sector as well.
<P>
	Part I of the act contains the registered pension plan portion 
and part II contains the retirement compensation arrangement. I 
would stress that both of these parts meet the requirements of 
the Income Tax Act. Amendments in this bill primarily affect 
parts I and II of the act.
<P>
	Contributions to the pension plan are made by members 
currently at the rate of 11 per cent of his or her annual salary 
which is much more than is generally the case in the private 
sector. For senators it is 7 per cent of their annual salary.
<P>
	The contribution rate will be reduced to 9 per cent to reflect 
the decrease in the accrual rate. This reduction is found in clause 
7 of the bill. Senators contribute 7 per cent of their annual salary, 
receive a 3 per cent accrual rate, and that will not change. The 9 
per cent contribution rate for MPs, however, is more in line with 
the new 4 per cent accrual rate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The media and some members of the opposition asserted that 
this would increase compensation for parliamentarians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In fact the total compensation for members will decrease with 
amendments to this act. The claim that members will receive a 
salary increase of 2 per cent is simply not true. MPs will have 2 
per cent more disposable income but they will also have more 
that is subject to tax as a result of that. There is no increase in the 
compensation level. Again, the compensation level for MPs is 
going down.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the 1994 budget imposed a salary 
freeze on MPs, who incidentally have not had an increase for 
some six years. The pension benefits are being cut by 20 per 
cent. There is simply no way a salary increase could be 
extrapolated from what is quite clearly a cut in compensation to 
MPs.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	I should like to deal with a matter that I know is of particular 
interest to some of my colleagues beyond here. That is optional 
participation. The member for Beaver River will be extremely 
interested.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> And the class of '88 too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Yes, they all have the same option as the 
member has.
<P>
	Within days of beginning the current legislative session of the 
35th Parliament, a question was put to the Prime Minister in 
daily question period about allowing MPs to decide for 
themselves if they wished to continue to participate in their 
pension plan.
<P>
	This is not something normally done, I might add, in the 
private sector or other public sector plans. Canadians are 
encouraged by the government and by organizations and 
companies throughout the country to provide for their 
retirement allowance, to provide for themselves when they are 
no longer part of the workforce. It makes sense to save to do that. 
We should be encouraging people to do so.
<P>
	The Prime Minister rose on January 21 and committed to the 
House that members of Parliament would have a choice. Pension 
plans in Canada are supported through the income tax system to 
provide employer sponsored retirement funding for Canadians. 
The Government of Canada is no different from other 
employers. Pension plans are provided for public servants, 
military personnel, RCMP and parliamentarians.
<P>
	The government believes in retirement benefits for its 
employees, pure and simple. However certain MPs have made a 
case that they can better provide for their retirement needs and 
those of their families, or they think they can.
<P>
	I should like to say something about that in terms of families. 
During the consultation period prior to the introduction of the 
legislation I was told numerous stories by present and former 
members who originally entered politics at a young age. Many 
of them were single at the time. They married during their 
political careers. They began families. Their retirement needs 
changed. They were vastly different with families from what 
they were when they first started out as single individuals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12156"> 12156 </A></B>
<P>
	It is important to note in this context that the optional 
participation decision all MPs will make should not be taken 
lightly. Most certainly consideration of families should be 
included in the decision with respect to optional participation.
<P>
	Clause 2 allows members who choose to leave themselves or 
their families without pension benefits once the changes to these 
pension arrangements receive royal assent 60 days to decide 
whether they want to opt into the plan. It is a major change that is 
being made in the plan. The Prime Minister has given the 
opportunity to members of the House.
<P>
	Members who have six or more years of service and who 
choose not to continue contributing to the pension plan will have 
their contributions returned to the beginning of this Parliament.
<P>
	The member for Beaver River may want to hear this point.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> You bet I do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> It pertains to her specifically. Members with 
less than six years will have their contributions returned. The 
government will allow these members a one-time only 
opportunity to withdraw their participation in the pension plan. 
It is something that is not normally done. We have to provide for 
our own retirement allowance and that is what the plan is all 
about.
<P>
	For those who choose not to participate, the government will 
return their contributions with interest calculated in the same 
manner as for any other withdrawal allowance under the statute.
<P>
	Members cannot later decide to join the pension plan if they 
serve continuously as a member of the House or if appointed to 
the Senate without a break in service. Members who after a 
break in service later re-enter the pension plan will not be 
permitted the option of buying back service from this 
Parliament should they exercise their option not to participate 
during this Parliament.
<P>
	In terms of another provision of the plan may I finally 
mention with respect to common law spouses that in clause 4 of 
the bill they will be recognized for survivor benefit purposes as 
they are under federal pension plans for public service 
employees. It will provide common law spouses with necessary 
protection that other Canadian pension plan members enjoy. As 
well, the bill provides that a survivor pension can be 
apportioned between a legal spouse and a common law spouse. 
Where a member is survived by both a common law and legal 
spouse the bill provides for the survivor benefit to be 
apportioned between the two claimants if the common law 
spouse lived with the member while the pension was being 
earned.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion I highlight the net result of the changes. Not 
only have we as a government lived up to our campaign 
promises, the ones clearly defined in the red book dealing with a 
minimum age of 55 and prevention of double dipping for former 
members who get appointments in the federal service, but we 
have gone beyond that in the spirit of the need for cutting 
government spending to get the deficit and debt under control.
<P>
	We have made changes in Bill C-85 to the pension plan that 
will save taxpayers significantly; they will cut costs to 
taxpayers by some 33 per cent. Overall the Government of 
Canada has lived up to its promises on pension reform.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to say a few words on this government 
bill which Quebecers and Canadians have been waiting for. At 
the same time, the public perception of the pension plan is 
sometimes erroneous. Naturally, the most visible irritants often 
make the whole pension system look like it gives greater 
benefits to parliamentarians than to those in similar fields of 
activity.
<P>
	I think that this bill introduced by the government constitutes 
a fine effort and a step forward. Changes were needed. While we 
have questions about certain provisions, such as those regarding 
spouses' pensions and double dipping, that is, being paid a 
retirement allowance and a salary at the same time, we regard 
this bill as a step forward in that it remedies the two main 
irritants for the public, particularly the one concerning 
minimum pensionable age.
<P>
	Let us start by stating a basic fact: every working person is 
entitled to a pension. Everyone wants to make sure they enjoy 
some degree of financial security after having reached fifty or 
sixty years of age. Most companies, corporations and others, 
have set up retirement income security systems in conjunction 
with their employees. Non unionized workers or people working 
for large companies have built themselves retirement funds with 
RRSPs, thanks to the privileges governments grant to those who 
make the effort of investing in RRSPs to build retirement funds.
<P>
	So, the principle of receiving pension benefits must not be 
challenged, and the government did not do so in its bill. We 
recognize that we are entitled to benefits, however, they must be 
comparable to those provided not only in other walks of life, in 
both the private and the public sector, but also in what I would 
call the political sector, in other governments, in other countries 
and in Canada, at the provincial level for instance.
<P>
	Our pension program must provide no more or less to 
members of Parliament, but must be a reflection of the economic 
reality of Quebec and Canada. In that sense, as I said earlier, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12157"> 12157 </A></B>
<P>
bill before us today remedies two major irritants in our plan, one 
being retirement age. We must  realize, however, that this 
concern about retirement age is new, and stems from the 
realization that it is possible for individuals as young as 40 or 43 
years old to retire.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Traditionally, politicians were much older and, generally 
speaking, remained in office much longer.
<P>
	Consequently, when the Members of Parliament Retiring Act 
was originally passed, the legislator did not think about setting a 
minimum age to be eligible for a pension, since most retiring 
MPs were already over 55, or had only served one term and were 
not eligible for a pension. The problem simply did not exist.
<P>
	Elections nowadays are often characterized by a major 
turnaround, which results in large numbers of MPs losing their 
seats. For example, in 1984, the Conservatives won 211 seats, 
which means that several Liberal members left the House of 
Commons at a much younger age than the average for the 
previous 15 years, when we had minority governments that 
would change every two or three years. Indeed, throughout that 
period, a Liberal minority government was almost always in 
office, which means that the same members of the various 
parties were re-elected repeatedly.
<P>
	Western provinces were always represented by large numbers 
of Conservatives and New Democrats, while the number of 
Liberal members from Quebec remained fairly stable, along 
with a contingent from Ontario and also some from eastern 
Canada. Consequently, even though minority governments were 
in office, the members remained essentially the same over a 15 
year period. By the time they left office, most of these members 
had reached the age of 55, 58 or 60. Consequently, the issue of 
early retirement was not raised by the public or the House, since 
it only concerned a very small minority.
<P>
	As I said earlier, because of the Conservative waves of 1984 
and 1988, and because of a new phenomenon in 1993, namely 
the creation of a new party, the Bloc Quebecois, which replaced 
the Liberals in Quebec, as well as another one, the Reform Party, 
which ousted the New Democrats in western Canada as well as 
many old Conservative members who used to get re-elected all 
the time, for example in Alberta, there is now a fairly large 
number of MPs leaving office who are entitled to pensions. The 
example most often heard is that of former minister Perrin 
Beatty who, at 43 or 45, is entitled to a pension as a former 
minister, even though he is at an age where he can still make a 
living by using his skills and knowledge. That example is given 
as being representative of the situation of most MPs, but it is 
not.
<P>
	We should take a close look at the findings of the last three 
reports. Each time a federal election is held, the MPs' pay plan 
and pension plan are reviewed, along with an assessment of their 
work as members or chairpersons of committees, and any other 
additional duties which they may have as whip, House leader, 
etc.
<P>
	If we take the report prepared by the Balcer-McIsaac 
commission in 1980, it says there was no need to tinker with 
MPs pensions since there were no cases of younger members 
who ended up with pensions.
<P>
	If we look at the report produced by the Hon. Gerry St. 
Germain and the Hon. Francis Fox, it says that after considering 
every aspect of the question, the commissioners felt that present 
retirement allowances were adequate. Here again, age was not 
an issue. The last report, produced by a committee chaired by 
the Hon. Charles Lapointe, which included two commissioners, 
Mrs. Pigott and Mr. Frank, made the first reference to age 
provisions, because there was reason to do so. The report 
suggested a minimum age of 55 but did not elaborate on its 
significance.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	If we look at a table, we can see the percentage of individuals 
who receive a pension at a specific age. For instance, we see that 
under 40, three-tenths of one per cent of members have a 
pension. Under 45, one-tenth of one per cent. Altogether, 434 in 
the entire history of Canada. There are not thousands, as people 
seem to think. Only one-tenth of one per cent. Under 50, we see 
5 per cent. Under 55, 7 per cent. This means that those who are 
already receiving pension allowances and are 55 and over 
represent 77 per cent of all pensioners. Over 60, 77 per cent. Add 
to that those over 55, which is 8 per cent, which means 85 per 
cent of those receiving a pension today are over 55.
<P>
	Contrary to the public's perception that parliamentarians get 
their pensions at a tender age, those under 50 account for less 
than 5 per cent and those under 45 for only one-tenth of 1 per 
cent of the total number.
<P>
	As we set our criteria, bearing in mind our democratic 
principles and the current state of our finances, we should also 
consider certain documents, in this latest report, which refer to a 
study of the allowances of members of Parliament, conducted by 
the commissioners mentioned earlier.
<P>
	Let us first look at the picture in terms of salaries. The public 
often thinks that members' salaries are overinflated. However, 
if we compare Canada with other countries in the world, such as 
Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Japan, Sweden, the 
United Kingdom and the United States, we find Canada ranks 
seventh of the nine countries in salary terms. Six countries in 
this list therefore pay better salaries, including Japan, for 
example, which pays $196,000 a year for 43 sitting days. In 
Canada, the figure is $64,000 for 148 sitting days; in Germany, 
it is $102,000 for 66 days; and, in Australia, it is $65,000 for 53 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12158"> 12158 </A></B>
<P>
days. That is surprising. In Sweden, the salary is only $36,000, 
and, in the United States, it is $169,000 for 144 days.
<P>
	Therefore, if we place Canada among the nine countries I have 
just listed, we realize that it is seventh in terms of salaries paid 
to members. In other words, it is well behind a number of 
countries including France, Germany, Japan, the United States 
and Australia. Also, in terms of pay per day, Canada is sixth 
among the nine on the basis of the number of sitting days.
<P>
	That is to say that the salaries of members of Parliament in 
Canada are far from the most generous in the world. Secondly, if 
we compare the salary of federal members of Parliament with 
their provincial counterparts, we find, as with Quebec, for 
example, that they are the same, give or take a few thousand 
dollars.
<P>
	This fact must be taken into account in establishing a pension 
plan. Another fact that must be taken into consideration is that 
the people who sit here have to give up their businesses or other 
duties-this has been my own experience. In teaching, for 
example, I was earning $46,000 a year. In 1984, when I was 
elected, I earned $52,000 or $54,000 a year-not a huge 
difference really. But I had to give up the businesses I owned and 
hire additional staff in order to be able to do my work properly. 
You know when you are elected as a member of Parliament that 
the job is temporary.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	That is why we should be entitled to a pension for the period 
of time that we put our businesses or other careers on hold, for, 
had we not made this choice, we would have continued to 
accumulate retirement income for until we hit the age of 55, 57 
or 60.
<P>
	It is only fair that our salaries be comparable to what MPs 
receive in other countries and that our pensions compare to 
those that public officials and MPs from other provinces and 
other countries receive.
<P>
	Having said this, there were some rough spots, but this bill 
smooths them out. For example, it would change the minimum 
age, although this would affect only five per cent of MPs 
currently collecting a pension. I base my statements regarding 
pensions on the report of the Commission to Review Allowances 
of Members of Parliament, chaired by the hon. Charles 
Lapointe, called <I>Democratic Ideals and Financial Realities: 
Paying Representatives in the Twenty-First Century</I>. The report 
says that, in 1984, 131 MPs were defeated or chose not to run 
again.
<P>
	Of that number, 56 per cent did not qualify for a pension; 44 
per cent did. In 1988, 46 per cent of the 115 MPs who were 
defeated or chose not to run again qualified for a pension. In 
1993, 67 per cent of the MPs who were defeated or chose not to 
run were not eligible for a pension. Therefore, out of the 445 
MPs who left office in the last three elections, 58 per cent or 260 
did not qualify for a pension. However, we must look at this 
system from all angles: some 185 received pensions.
<P>
	Now, let us look at the amounts involved for all MPs. The 
popular belief is that all members can count on the allowance of 
a minister or Prime Minister upon retiring, when the fact is that 
there are only a few ministers and one Prime Minister. The rest 
of us ordinary members of Parliament, commonly referred to as 
backbenchers in both official languages, get a much more 
modest allowance based on our years of service.
<P>
	For example, 12 per cent of members receive less than 
$10,000 per year in allowances; 17 per cent get less than 
$20,000; and 27 per cent, less than $30,000. In total, 75 per cent 
of former members receive under $40,000. These are interesting 
figures.
<P>
	If you add up those receiving less than $30,000 in allowances, 
that is to say 27, plus 17, plus 12, you realize that 56 per cent of 
former members receive a pension of less than $30,000.
<P>
	It is also the same with the age factor. As I said earlier, only 
three tenths of one per cent members who receive allowances 
start doing so under the age of 40, like Mrs. Carole Jacques, a 
former Conservative member, Mr. Champagne, the former 
Conservative member for Champlain, and a few Liberal 
members as well.
<P>
	This needed to be changed and the correction was made. In 
addition, although allowances are not as generous as they seem 
to be when you take a good look at them, the government not 
only removed two irritants having to do with retirement age and 
double dipping-the fact of holding a wage-earning position 
while in receipt of a pension-, but also reduced by 20 per cent 
its contribution to the pension fund. In addition, members have 
to hold office longer to get the 75 per cent maximum. A member 
elected this year would have to sit in this place for 20 years 
instead of 15 to qualify for the maximum retirement allowance. 
This is something that we will have to take into account when 
voting on this bill.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	This bill settles the matters of age, double dipping and 
contribution rates. These rates, which might have appeared 
generous but were comparable, will be reduced because of the 
economic situation. I would also like to look at what is being 
done in other countries, for example with regard to 
contributions.
<P>
	Let us say right off the bat that Canada's contribution rate of 
11 per cent ranked among the top rates in the world. By reducing 
this rate to 9 per cent, we bring it in line with rates in other 
countries. Let me remind you that the Australian rate is 11.5 per 
cent and that many other countries have rates of around 9 per 
cent. We are therefore normalizing the situation and making it 
more equitable for members of the House of Commons.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12159"> 12159 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us now compare the situation in Canada with that in the 
provinces, because the provinces also have pension plans. For 
example, in Newfoundland, which is a small province, all one 
needs to qualify for pension rates of up to 75 per cent is to have 
run in two elections and to have five years of service. Members 
need six years of service at the federal level, compared to five 
years in Newfoundland. As for the minimum age, the member's 
age plus the number of years of service must equal 60. This 
means that a 55-year old member of the Newfoundland 
legislature with five years of service would be entitled to a 
pension. A 50-year old member with 10 years of service would 
qualify for a pension in Newfoundland but not at the federal 
level.
<P>
	That is an interesting comparison. Given the small size and 
population of Prince Edward Island, which has as many people 
as my riding but 32 members in its provincial legislature, four 
members of Parliament, and a house for the Lieutenant 
Governor, one can understand why there is no pension for the 32 
members of the provincial legislature. The minimum 
pensionable age for members of the Nova Scotia legislature is 
50, but it will be 55 for members of Parliament. To qualify for a 
pension, all a member needs is to have run in two elections and 
to have five years of service.
<P>
	Let us look at New Brunswick. There is no minimum age. 
Members only need 10 sessions under their belts.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That, too, should be changed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> It may have to be changed but, for the time 
being, this bill is a step forward. I hope that the other provinces 
will also take this step. A different reality may force us to take 
other measures. The situation facing pensioners today has 
changed from what it was 15 years ago. Adjustments are being 
made.
<P>
	Take Quebec, where the rule is age plus years of service, with 
a minimum age of 50. The same principle is applied in Ontario: 
age plus years of service, with a minimum age of 55. Our 
situation is similar to that of the provinces, which often offer 
more generous plans. Manitoba abolished its plan but replaced it 
with a collective RRSP which will be able to offer more or less 
the same terms. I believe the hon. member for Hull-Aylmer, 
just next door, did a comparative study on the subject which 
showed that after 12 years, a collective RRSP was more 
attractive than our own system.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan, the minimum age is again 55. In British 
Columbia, the minimum age is 55 and the rule is age plus a 
number of years of service. The minimum age is 55 in the Yukon 
and the Northwest Territories, and to be eligible for a pension, 
members must sit a minimum of seven years in British 
Columbia, six in the Yukon and six in the Northwest Territories. 
In other words, our system is very similar to those in the rest of 
the provinces and, in some cases, is less attractive. It is also very 
similar to what is offered in other western countries, and I am 
referring to so-called modern countries, countries with a decent 
per capita income.
<P>
	I must admit that the bill also takes into account the current 
situation and what the taxpayer can afford. Contributions will be 
cut by 20 per cent. There will be a cut of $3.5 million out of a 
total $10 million, which means a correction of 33 per cent. 
However, certain irritants remain in the bill, and I will probably 
suggest a number of amendments when the bill goes to 
committee after second reading.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	I wonder, for instance, about the decision to reject double 
dipping. Everyone seems to agree that when you take a former 
minister-again, the example of Perrin Beatty-and you 
appoint him president of the CBC, he should not get both his 
salary from the CBC and his $40,000 to $45,000 pension as a 
former minister. I think that is pretty obvious, and I want to 
commend Mr. Beatty for voluntarily giving up his pension 
before accepting his position at CBC.
<P>
	I also want to commend Mr. Broadbent who, when his term 
was renewed not long ago, also gave up his pension for another 
five years although he was under no obligation to do so, thus 
complying with the government's intentions and public opinion.
<P>
	However, we may have a situation where a member who has a 
political career in Ottawa is penalized when he obtains another 
position, compared to a former member of one of the provincial 
legislatures. Senator Prud'homme, for instance. He sat in the 
House of Commons, he wanted to sit in the Senate and they have 
to subtract his pension from his salary. Mr. Gauthier sat in the 
House of Commons. He is now sitting in the Senate, and his 
member's pension is subtracted from his salary.
<P>
	However, Mrs. Bacon, a former member of the Quebec 
legislature who has a minister's pension, receives both her 
senator's salary and her minister's pension of $40,000 or 
$45,000.
<P>
	Take the case of Senator Simard. Since I do not want to play 
favourites, I will take a Conservative senator as an example. The 
last two are Conservatives, but Mr. Prud'homme is a former 
Liberal. Senator Simard has been in the Senate for 10 years or so 
and receives a pension of about $40,000 as a former minister of 
New Brunswick. He does not have to subtract it from his salary.
<P>
	Of course, since we are in a federal jurisdiction our legislation 
can only cover the federal level. I am delving into, as will the 
committee, the issues of concern to us. That is why I am not 
tabling the amendment on whether the following 
recommendation would be legal: that, when the Prime Minister 
calls someone in the future to offer him or her a seat in the 
Senate, the Prime Minister stipulate ``I am offering you the seat 
on condition that you fax me a letter giving your commitment 
not to collect your pension as a former provincial MP, so that 
you are at par with the federal MPs''. Then, if ever the person is 
appointed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12160"> 12160 </A></B>
<P>
to the Senate, that person's  entitlements would not be any more 
or less than those of the other senators.
<P>
	Therefore, that is another underlying problem. I was also 
wondering about municipal careers. When you appoint someone 
like Jean Drapeau, the former mayor of Montreal, to the federal 
public service, he receives a generous pension from 
Montrealers. The Mayor of Vancouver, with his experience 
dealing with Asian countries, would also be a potential 
candidate for the federal public service. He would not have to 
subtract his municipal pension from his salary. Of course, we are 
talking about different jurisdictions, but I am pondering the 
issue anyway.
<P>
	I am giving the government and the minister the leisure to 
reflect on this issue and, meanwhile, I will submit it to the 
committee. It seems to me that this is hypocritical. On the other 
hand, we must also take into consideration the fact that someone 
drawing a good pension from Eatons, for example, after working 
there all of his career, who is appointed to the Senate 
subsequently would not have a problem. But if his career had 
been with the provincial government, he would.
<P>
	It must also be said that the double dipping we are trying to 
abolish, to which we all agree in principle, penalizes people 
who, after a career in the federal public service, may entertain 
appointments as ambassadors or members of a task force on 
political party funding, for example. This was the case with the 
Lortie Commission to which former MPs were appointed and 
with the commission on pension reform. This duty to subtract 
pensions, this impediment, would make it easier to recruit 
people with parliamentary experience among former provincial 
MPs instead of federal MPs.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	I do not know how the bill could be amended, I have no 
proposals or amendments to make, but I do think there is food 
for thought here.
<P>
	I would also point out that, in our consideration of this bill, we 
should remember that members' salaries have been frozen for 
three or four, if not five, years and will remain frozen until 1997. 
I will give you an example. I earn $64,000. Eleven years ago, 
when I started here, I earned $54,000. I have therefore had 
increases of less than $1,000 a year, or less than $20 a week 
since I began sitting in the House of Commons. In the years 
salaries were not frozen, all we got was the cost of living 
adjustment. When I talk of salary increases, I am including the 
cost of living adjustment.
<P>
	Real efforts have been made in terms of salaries. Twice while 
I have been a member, my salary has been reduced by $1,000 in 
budget speeches. MPs' salaries are similar to those of MLAs. 
Earlier, I compared our pension benefits with those of MLAs. I 
could also have compared salaries. I did so with other countries.
<P>
	We have seen that the situation of members of Parliament, 
members of legislative assemblies and western 
parliamentarians is comparable. Pensions, with the amendments 
that will be made today, will be comparable, with ours being 
even sometimes less compared to pension plans in the provinces 
or in other countries.
<P>
	This bill is a realistic step forward. It resolves certain issues 
discrediting the role of members of Parliament. It used to be that 
we received our pensions at any age and that they were very 
substantial. It will no longer be the case. These issues, now 
resolved, used to discredit members of Parliament and often 
sent those who might be contemplating a career in this noble 
place running in the opposite direction. The credibility and 
public image of politicians with fat pensions tended to 
discourage people from going into politics.
<P>
	I think that correcting these two irritants can help bring our 
pay and pension benefits in line with those in the public sector 
and with politicians' pay and pension benefits in other countries 
and in the provinces.
<P>
	In closing, may I remind you that one way for the government 
to make further cuts may be to question the need for two Houses 
of Parliament. The other place, since that is how we must refer to 
it, costs $50 to $60 million. Instead of saving $3 million by 
adjusting pensions, you would save 20 times as much by 
eliminating a house which, between us, is totally useless.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The Senate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> We are not supposed to utter the word 
``Senate'' here in this House. We must say ``the other place''. 
My colleague referred to it by name but he is not supposed to. 
We know whom or what we are talking about. We have great 
respect for the people there, but we no longer see the need for the 
institution itself. We tend to think of it as a leftover from 
colonial days, as a big dormitory.
<P>
	Incidentally, a great lady, Mrs. Chaput-Rolland, now retired, 
referred to the other place as a big dormitory in a book that she 
wrote. She even talked about ``the hon. sleepyheads''. I think 
that she went much too far. However, in this era of budget cuts 
and pension review, we should think about the need to maintain 
this refuge for the Prime Minister's political cronies.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Nova Scotia, Quebec and the other provinces with senates 
abolished them. I feel the time has come to think about this and 
save taxpayers $50 to $60 million. We should also think about 
the need to maintain a house for the Lieutenant Governor in each 
of the provinces. Our Lieutenant Governor does not sleep in 
Prince Edward Island or in Quebec City very often. Most of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12161"> 12161 </A></B>
<P>
time, he sleeps in a hotel and not in the house reserved for him. 
We should perhaps think about all these houses we have to 
maintain and turn them into profitable museums.
<P>
	Perhaps we should also reconsider the relevance, especially 
for a government proclaiming from the rooftops its Canadianity 
and its pride in the Canadian flag, of maintaining at the top of 
the parliamentary hierarchy a representative of the Queen, a 
lieutenant-governor. That is another position that could be 
abolished. We could look into that too. There is $10 million 
attached to this position. That is how much we could save today.
<P>
	To conclude, I wonder also about another possible way we 
could save money. We have just adopted a bill on electoral 
boundaries increasing the number of members of Parliament 
from 295 to 301. This is a big problem. If we compare this place 
to the legislatures of other countries, we can see that there is 
something wrong with the Canadian system. Let us see how we 
shape up against our neighbours, the United States.
<P>
	For a total population of 27 million, we have 295 MPs. With a 
population of 270 million, ten times ours, the Americans should 
have ten times more representatives than we do, or 2,950. Yet, 
there are only 495 representatives in the American Congress. I 
think we are the odd ones. Why not take the lead of France, 
England or the United States and bring the size of the House of 
Commons down, proportionally to population, to say a hundred 
or so members?
<P>
	Considering what each member costs-we are talking about 
at least half a million dollars a year-in electricity, stationery, 
clerical support, this would mean savings of 200 times 
$500,000, or $100 million.
<P>
	We should consider this if we really want to get back some of 
the credibility we lost in the eyes of the public and see our work 
in this place regain prestige.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am glad to participate in this debate today.
<P>
	I would like to say by way of introduction that the most 
pathetic thing I have heard today is not a government trying to 
defend this plan, which is still far too rich for the Canadian 
taxpayers' blood, still far too generous, but more pathetic than 
that is what I have heard from a Bloc member who is fully 
endorsing this plan, who says that it goes a long way and that it 
corrects certain irritants.
<P>
	This is a group of people who want to opt into this pension 
plan when at the same time they are sitting here trying to opt out 
of the country. That is disgusting. They cannot defend that. It is 
indefensible in this Chamber. It is indefensible in any one of the 
ridings this member would choose to travel to across the 
country. ``Corrects certain irritants''-let me assure you, 
Madam Speaker, that the only irritant-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	I think that, if you had paid closer attention, you would have 
realized that my right to sit in this place is being questioned. I 
was elected democratically like every other member of 
Parliament.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> And democratically elected he was. Let us ask 
him to carry on in his democratically elected position sitting in 
the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	I talked about correcting certain irritants. The only irritant is 
with the Canadian public, who are paying the bills for this 
pension plan. I suspect this will not correct any irritant for them.
<P>
	We have been trying to do some research during the last 
couple of days since this bill was brought in last Friday and 
introduced to the House for debate today. As I look at the 
figures, the numbers simply do not add up.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	I am going to mention this opt-out clause now and then I will 
mention it several times again. I am going to keep mentioning it 
across this country every chance I get to speak. There is an 
opportunity for the class of '88 and anyone who was elected 
after them, such as myself and my colleagues, to opt out or not to 
opt in. We will look at some of the optics of that later. My friend 
from St. Boniface, for instance, and all the rest of them who 
were elected in 1988 have the option to opt out. I will be 
referring to that later and issuing some challenges to them.
<P>
	Bill C-85, an act to amend the Members of Parliament 
Retiring Allowances Act and to provide for the continuation of a 
certain provision for a pension for members of Parliament, is 
being debated. It certainly has been a long time coming. It was a 
promise in the red book, and I am pleased to see that the 
government is doing something about it. The Liberals are 
fulfilling their promise for age 55 and no double dipping 
allowed, but they do not go far enough to correct the irritant of 
the people who are paying for this pension plan. Of course that is 
the taxpayer.
<P>
	I suspect there has been quite a battle in the government 
caucus about when they would bring this in. It was made clear to 
me by Treasury Board within the last couple of weeks when the 
minister's press secretary assured my office that we would have 
an opt-out clause for me, Deborah Grey, Beaver River, because I 
was obviously so concerned about this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12162"> 12162 </A></B>
<P>
	It looks as though they have gone perhaps one step further on 
that and allowed the whole class of '88 to opt out. I applaud that, 
and I will have my pen out to write down all those colleagues of 
mine who are going to opt out.
<P>
	We have called for pension plan changes for a long time. The 
minister, in his remarks earlier, said that we had an opportunity 
to discuss this plan in the House of Commons earlier, as if that 
were some kind of noble gesture from the minister. In fact that 
was on November 22, when I, the member for Beaver River, 
introduced the motion on our opposition day to talk about the 
MP pension plan. So it was hardly some great initiative on the 
government side.
<P>
	In fact I would love to quote reams out of <I>Hansard</I> of that day. 
People stood in their places, a lot of them from the class of '88 
because that was the day after their trough day, when they 
qualified for the pension and their benefits had become vested. 
They stood in their places and said: ``We do not make all that 
much money''. Compared to the private sector, no. Sobeco Ernst 
&amp; Young proved that in their report. ``We have families and we 
have homes''. Of course we do, and we have to take that into 
consideration.
<P>
	It goes on: ``I just bought a house and I have a mortgage, so I 
need a pension; I had to lose my job from before; I sacrificed a 
lot for public life''. On and on the tirades went. Yet when I look 
at the things they had to say and when I look at how the Canadian 
public viewed that debate that day and then I stand and hear 
something like this today, it makes me pretty sad. It makes me 
pretty mad also, because this is unjustifiable. This plan is 
indefensible and we simply are not able to condone it.
<P>
	We called for changes that would move the retirement age to 
regular retirement age, age 60 perhaps. It is not that we are 
against a pension. We have never made that assertion. We have 
never made the comment across the country that we are against 
pension plans for members of Parliament. It is not in our blue 
sheet of Reform policies anywhere. One would not find that 
Reform MPs are saying we do not want any pension. What we 
are saying is that we want a fair pension, brought more in line 
with the private sector, moved to regular retirement age. Let us 
make sure that we are not getting some sort of special treatment.
<P>
	I talked yesterday on the lobbyists act about two-tier systems 
for lobbyists. I talked about the two-tier health system that 
exists in this country for Canadians from coast to coast as well 
as for regular public servants on the Hill compared to MPs on the 
Hill. There are two tiers on a lot of things.
<P>
	I do not think that anyone in this House today can justify that 
we think we deserve a two-tier pension system. It simply will 
not fly in the public. I go around and speak to various people and 
I am sure government members do too. They hear from the same 
Canadians I  do. They travel around and hear from people and 
take heat on this.
<P>
	I suspect that is one reason why the Treasury Board assistant 
said to me the other day and again today that the minister is 
trying to get this through by the summer recess so that it is all 
done, tucked away, and hopefully everyone will just forget about 
it and keep quiet.
<P>
	The last government hoped that a lot of people would forget 
about a lot of things and keep quiet also. It simply does not 
happen. They did not forget about it. And we will never forget 
what happened to them in the last election. Perhaps it is a sign of 
things to come.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	We want a fair pension plan. But we are calling for a pension 
plan similar to that of any other person in the country who buys 
into a private pension plan. That is, the employer will contribute 
one dollar and the employee will contribute one dollar, dollar for 
dollar. When I was with the Alberta Teachers Association I put 
in <I>x</I> number of dollars a month, and the ATA put in <I>x</I> dollars a 
month to match it.
<P>
	We have seen the numbers. They range from $6 or $7 to $1, 
and now we are being told by Treasury Board that it is down to 
$3.60 to $1. Whatever it is, it is still obscenely rich. There is not 
another person in the country, except this insular group sitting in 
the green chamber and the folks on the other side of course, who 
are going to be able to say: ``I gave up my life for public service. 
This was my sacrifice to the country.'' Well, if it is going to be a 
sacrifice to the country to serve in this place, then let us make it 
a sacrifice, so that we are not spending some obscene pension 
and living on it for the rest of our lives, and we will not feel 
guilty about the dollars we collect that other people have paid.
<P>
	I hear from both sides of the House today, from the 
government and the official opposition, that it is okay because 
we have made some incredible sacrifice. I do not consider this to 
be a sacrifice.
<P>
	I miss being at home, and I can hardly stand to leave my 
husband every week, but when I think about the opportunity we 
have to serve in the Parliament of Canada, it is remarkable. 
Surely we cannot whine and cry and go home to St. Boniface, 
Halifax, or Sherbrooke or wherever and say: ``This was my 
sacrifice for the country, so I am going to collect a heap of cash. 
Sorry about that, folks, but this is what I did for you and the 
country, now this is what you are going to do for me''. It will not 
fly. It is indefensible and unacceptable. So why not a fair 
pension plan? I do not know.
<P>
	It would seem to me that the provision for virtually full 
protection against inflation is totally unchanged. Surely that is 
something that could be brought in. We do not see that in the 
legislation.
<P>
	Many people do not know that at age 60 the present plan will 
be indexed to inflation back to whenever it was the person stood 
for a pension. I qualify right now at age  42. I would get 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12163"> 12163 </A></B>
<P>
everything back indexed for inflation at age 60. That also is 
indefensible. Members across can try to convince me and the 
people who are paying the bills that it is defensible. I do not 
think we would see that anywhere, that any constituents across 
the country who will be putting an X somewhere at the next 
election are going to say it is justified. It is simply not going to 
work.
<P>
	As I have pointed out before, it is something rarely found in 
the private sector. We are not going to find private pension plans 
like this. The husband of one of our members is an expert on 
mutual funds and RRSPs. He works in the insurance business. 
He would never stand publicly and say the private sector has the 
same plan as MPs, fully indexed back to age 42. That will never 
be seen. We all know it, especially the people who are paying the 
bills.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is a double standard.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> There are also some people who would say that it 
is just one way of giving a raise to MPs while avoiding public 
scrutiny. A study that was done by Sobeco Ernst &amp; Young talks 
about that. The minister went on at great length about how we 
are perhaps underpaid and overpensioned. Something has to be 
done with the whole package deal to bring it into line. This 
certainly is not going to address that.
<P>
	Many people would say, and I agree with them, that the 
increase to MPs' pensions, pay, perks, and everything else 
should be debated by the public, the media, and in the House. In 
fact, if we are sitting around as a collective, insulated group of 
people asking what we are worth: ``Charlie, what do you figure, 
how much are we worth?'' We all talk about it and say we are 
wonderful, it is unanimous, and we are such and such. That is 
exactly the way it has been done for years in this place: ``How 
much are we worth, folks? Okay, that is what we have.''
<P>
	There is an inside group determining the rules and regulations 
of MPs' pension plans: Well, we are worth this much pay. What 
do you think we are worth, folks, for our pension? Do you not 
think we should be looked after? The whole country knows that 
we certainly have sacrificed and we are hard done by. So what 
are we worth for our pension, $6 to $1, or $4 to $1, to use the 
government's new figures? Is that what we are worth? Yes, it is 
unanimous again. Are we not wonderful? There we go, we are in 
the cash. We are in the trough.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Nowhere across the country would one find that.
<P>
	Let us have an independent, arbitrary commission that will 
look at this and say that those people are worth <I>x</I> amount of 
dollars for their salary and <I>x</I> amount of dollars for their pension, 
and because we are paying the bills, we will determine what they 
are worth and what their pension plan will be. Let someone on 
the outside of the group who is an expert in this area determine 
it, rather than us sitting around in these hallowed halls saying we 
are worth a whole lot, so there we are, and my friend thought that 
was a great idea; we are here and the  government is looking 
after us. There is absolutely no logic at all to it.
<P>
	This bill establishes the minimum age of 55, which is 
certainly a step in the right direction, I will give them that. At 
least they did not make it any amount, like it was before. The 
minimum age is 55 for benefit eligibility, which is still too 
young. And it only applies to a portion of some members' 
benefits. Many members of this House will still get pension 
payments as soon as they leave politics.
<P>
	For example, my friend from Sherbrooke down the way was 
elected young and is still young. If he leaves tomorrow he would 
still cost taxpayers over $40,000 a year. If he lived to the age of 
75 he could cost the taxpayers $3.5 million. There is no way one 
could go to a town hall meeting and justify that.
<P>
	The Prime Minister certainly is older and has had a long and 
distinguished career in this House. We realize and recognize 
that. Under the old plan, he would collect $90,000. Under the 
new plan, granted he will receive a little less. However, we are 
looking at a total of $2.1 million. That is a lot of cash.
<P>
	My friend from Halifax would collect $19,491 under the old 
plan. If she lived to 75 years old she would collect $1.1 million. I 
am a little younger than her by about three or four years. The 
work done by the National Citizens' Coalition on my pension 
was that if I were to retire now, at age 42, because my benefits 
were vested on March 13, and if I lived to age 75-and 
sometimes in this profession one wonders if they will make it 
that long-I stand to make, gain, profit by $1.8 million. I will 
not use the word steal, because theft is something we do not 
approve of, but I think of other people out there paying the bills 
and being demanded to pay the bills by some select few here who 
think we are worth more than everybody else.
<P>
	Because I am opting out of this plan I have been ridiculed and 
scorned, which I am used to in this House, by somebody who 
says ``Oh, isn't she opportunistic''. That was said to me in 
question period just last week or a couple of weeks ago when I 
asked the question. They said: ``That Reformer from Beaver 
River is such an opportunist''.
<P>
	Money talks, as Neil Diamond used to sing. If I lived to the 
age of 75 and was fully indexed way back at age 60, under the 
old plan I stood to gain $1.8 million, which is pretty close to 
what my friend across the way would receive, give or take a few 
hundred thousand dollars, but what is that when we are talking 
those kinds of dollars?
<P>
	Under this new plan, which is supposed to be so good and so 
effective in cutting down so much spending and so much of the 
taxpayers' dollars-and I hope they are getting angrier by the 
minute, because they are paying the shot for this-I will receive 
$1.2 million. Does this seem like a justifiable savings? I would 
hardly think so. Yes, it will be less. Yes, the government talked 
about the fact that we would be saving taxpayers 30 per cent of  
their dollars. But when we look at the size of the pension they are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12164"> 12164 </A></B>
<P>
paying out, it is going from $1.8 million down to $1.27 million. 
That is what our calculation is.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	In this Parliament they are putting in $3.6 to every $1 that we 
are seeing but we still cannot justify that because of the $1 for $1 
employer-employee contribution rate I talked about earlier 
which every other Canadian would enjoy if they had a private 
pension plan. I stand to gain $1.2 million. There is no way 
people across the country will buy this, red book or no red book.
<P>
	When there was a commitment to save taxpayers money, if we 
are saving them a little cash from $1.8 million to $1.27 million 
we could harp on the savings and make it sound absolutely 
terrific but at the same time we think they are paying way more 
than they would pay if we had a regular pension plan.
<P>
	The income tax rules for a registered pension plan state 
benefits must be reduced by at least 3 per cent per year if 
collected prior to attaining the age of 60, or alternatively has 30 
years of eligibility or attaining age and years of service totalling 
80 years. Lots of pension plans across the country have that, as 
the minister stated, adding age plus years of service.
<P>
	That point is consistent with the recommendations also made 
in the Sobeco Ernst &amp; Young report but this rate at which 
benefits accrue has been lowered from 5 per cent to 4 per cent 
per year. When we look at that we say that is good. It is going in 
the right direction. I draw to people's attention who are paying 
the bills for this that the 20 per cent reduction from 5 per cent 
down to 4 per cent on the payout will only apply to members 
whose benefits do not straddle the existing and revised plans.
<P>
	Most everyone in the House is a straddler. Many of them were 
elected in 1988 and so they are in the old pension plan but they 
also straddle the new pension plan. All of us in the House are in 
the position that we still have one foot in the old and one foot in 
the new because these changes are being brought about in the 
35th Parliament.
<P>
	For far too many Liberal members in the House the reduction 
in benefits will be significantly less than 20 per cent due to most 
of their benefits having been accumulated at the 5 per cent rate. 
Many of us have been in the House for several years now and so 
we are looking at the 5 per cent rate. If we are to say that after 
royal assent it will be down to 4 per cent, we have been paying in 
for years at that rate and the amount will be far less.
<P>
	In addition, under either the existing or the revised plans the 
total contribution of members relative to total benefits received 
will not change significantly, as I mentioned with myself. A 
member will contribute approximately 6.7 per cent relative to 
the total benefits received as they do under the existing plan.
<P>
	I say let people know we are straddling something here. To me 
we have an option. I think of former Prime Minister John Turner 
who said he had no option. There are people across the way 
today who are still every bit as Liberal as Mr. Turner was and 
they cannot say what he said. They have an option. Whether it is 
opting out or opting in we will still discuss the semantics of that. 
It has been said to us that we have to opt out; in other words, we 
have to sign within 60 days if we say we do not want to take this 
pension plan. It has also been mentioned that we will have to opt 
in; in other words within those 60 days people who will say they 
will go on the regular MP pension, they will opt in.
<P>
	I guess the semantics and the logistics of that are if I am to opt 
out I have to take my little trotters out of the trough and that is an 
active move for me to step away from the trough and say I do not 
want it, I cannot justify that back home, I will take my money 
elsewhere and I will invest it in the best way I can.
<P>
	The flip side is if it is to opt in, and these are the semantics and 
the logistics of it, the people of the class of '88 have the option 
to opt out because the government did not put it in for the older 
ones. It says it cannot bring in retroactive legislation because it 
would be unfair. It brought in retroactive legislation, Bill C-22, 
on the Pearson airport deal and brought in retroactive legislation 
on the EH-101 helicopters. It amazes me that for some things it 
says ``retroactive, no problem; it is a red book promise and we 
will do it''. On something else that affects the wallet it cannot go 
retroactively.
<P>
	In any event, here is the picture. I have to take my trotters out 
of the trough and step back and say I opt out. The class of '88 
will have to get their pens ready and make a conscious decision 
to step into the trough on all fours. They say: ``This is it. It is a 
sacrifice. This is my public service. Dear knows I have served 
the constituents of wherever long and hard and, don't you know, 
this is owed to me? This is my money''. There is no way they 
will ever convince anyone in the country that is their money. It 
sounds like the ad on an Edmonton radio station that says: ``I am 
talking about your money'', as he gives financial advice.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	This is not our money. I do not know what it will take to 
convince the government and Bloc members that this is not our 
money to free-wheelingly spend. They have to crawl back into 
that trough, not out. There will be people who will remember 
that. They will have the vision in their minds of people saying: 
``Here is my letter. I am opting into the pension plan. I am really 
sorry but cabinet convinced me to do it. I had no option''. We 
know what happens to people who say they have no option. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12165"> 12165 </A></B>
<P>
People will take the option. If they say someone had the option 
to opt out but copped out, they will make the decision on the next 
election.
<P>
	The members of the 1988 class in Parliament will have to 
make the decision about whose money this is and what they will 
do with it. They either opt out or they will cop out, and there will 
be a price to pay.
<P>
	They will be sanctimonious. They will say: ``Look at the 
member for Beaver River. There goes Deb again. Does she not 
go on and on?'' I am sure my friend who is sitting in the House 
today is taking notes and will have a wonderful time with this. 
However, I would feel far more comfortable going home to a 
town hall meeting in St. Lina, St. Paul, Bonnyville, Mallaig, 
Therien or wherever else and saying: ``That was your money and 
I will not spend it'', rather than going home to St. Boniface and 
saying: ``That was your money but sorry, I will spend it''.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I ask the hon. member to 
please try to control the attacking and use normal parliamentary 
procedure.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Madam Speaker, I stand to be corrected. We are 
talking about debate and I am sure that all of us need to be 
prepared to go into our places at home. If I said anything 
unparliamentary I ask your forgiveness and ask the Chair to 
straighten me out on that and chastise me. If I am debating I 
would like to continue debating.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I have no intention of 
chastising the hon. member, but from the very beginning I have 
noticed that certain comments are bordering on what I would not 
accept as being of the integrity that we have been seeing in the 
House. I hope we would be a little more careful.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Thank you, Madam Speaker. Let me continue by 
asking how the government gets around its own laws in paying 
these extravagant benefits. It uses the retirement compensation 
arrangement. People watching this do not have a clue. They 
know that hopefully we pay a lot of money in, $600 a month, and 
we get a lot more money out. If that is attack, I do beg 
forgiveness again, but those are the numbers and that is the way 
it is.
<P>
	The plan created by the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act is what we pay into but it contravenes the 
Income Tax Act. How do we get to pay more into a pension plan 
than those who are contributing in the private sector? We do so 
by writing our own rules and using the retirement compensation 
arrangement or an RCA account.
<P>
	As we see in section 4300 of the income tax regulations, 
RCAs were originally introduced in October 1986 to prevent 
taxpayers in the highest tax brackets and employees of 
non-taxable entities from deferring the payment of tax, which 
happens across the country. Contributions to an RCA are subject 
to a 50 per cent refundable tax under section 207.5(1), which 
also applies to any investment income plan; most retirement 
plans are invested. It is a very expensive way to fund a 
retirement plan for anybody but the government.
<P>
	As a report produced for the National Citizens Coalition 
points out, the use of the RCA means the government is going 
through the motions to comply on paper with the provisions of 
its own law. In other words, this looks legitimate under the 
Income Tax Act because it is all right under the RCA.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, when I was called opportunistic that hurt me 
and maybe that bordered on something unparliamentary. I would 
have loved it if you had jumped up in my defence because I am 
giving up a lot of cash. As somebody who is opting out I should 
mention the effect Bill C-85 and the RCA account will have on 
me because it is substantial.
<P>
	I trust there will be some opting out from the government 
benches because the full class of '88 is in the same position I am; 
all of us on this side of the House with the exception of a few 
Bloc members who were here before sitting as Tories.
<P>
	The portion of my contributions that went into the retirement 
compensation arrangement, the RCA, or 7 per cent of everything 
I have earned in the last six years I have transferred over. I now 
will have to pay tax on it. It is one thing to think that I am 
somebody who is opting out and will just scoop up that money. 
The government says I can get all the money back that I have 
contributed but with zero from the government. It would be 
wonderful to say: ``I opt out of the rich stuff, please just give me 
my contributions plus matching contributions from yourself''. 
That is all we are really asking. Make it fair. Make it in line with 
the private pension plans. I will only be able to get back my 
money at 4 per cent interest, which is the money I have put in.
<P>
	It would be wonderful to roll that over into RRSPs, mutual 
funds or whatever, but I will have to pay tax on 4 per cent of my 
income which is in a separate fund. The portion the government 
puts into a legitimate registered pension plan has been sheltered 
from taxes.
<P>
	I do not know if I am making myself clear enough. It has taken 
me ages to figure this out and so I do not expect somebody 
watching television to figure it out immediately.
<P>
	The 11 per cent I am putting in is broken into 7 per cent and 4 
per cent, with the 4 per cent sheltered from taxes. The 7 per cent 
we put into the other fund will be taxable. We will have to pay 
tax on that now while we are in a higher tax bracket rather than 
later when we are retired and living at a lower tax bracket. It 
means we will have to put more in.
<P>
	If I had the option I would have taken the entire 11 per cent I 
have been putting in for six years and some months and gone to 
my financial adviser. I would have said: ``Here is this much 
money per month; please put this into mutual funds and I will 
accrue the interest. You invest it wisely and I will be able to live 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12166"> 12166 </A></B>
<P>
on it''. I could have done that. I had the option. Maybe, but no. It 
was law that I had to this and put it into this plan.
<P>
	Really I had no option. I wish I had because I would have 
taken that money, the whole 11 per cent I had been putting in, 
which is $600 a month, and I would have said: ``Please do 
something with this. Put it into RRSPs; put it into mutual funds 
and I will collect the interest on that and I will look after my own 
retirement. This is my money, my salary, not public money. I 
will let regular sources of investment planning look after my 
retirement''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Like most Canadians have to do.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Exactly the same way every other Canadian has to 
do it. Instead I was bound to put 11 per cent in there. It will pay 
me 4 per cent interest. With mutual funds, if I had been investing 
that $600-odd dollars a month, I could have been getting back 
probably 9 per cent or 10 per cent. I would have been sheltered 
from paying taxes on it now. I would be glad to pay taxes on it 
later; it is the way the regular RRSP plan works in this country. I 
would have been able to put all of that money in, but instead I 
was bound by law. Now I have the option. Now I am taking that 
option, although it does seem a little ridiculous that the 
government will not even pay $1 to $1 contributions.
<P>
	Apparently to compensate members for the minuscule 
reduction in their future benefit accrual rate the government has 
also lowered the amounts members contribute toward their own 
pensions. The minister mentioned that. He said that instead of 
11 per cent we will now be putting in just 9 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	There has been all kinds of talk about whether or not it raises 
the salary of an MP. I will not argue about those figures. If I am 
not putting in eleven and I am putting in nine that gives me more 
disposable income. There will be more cash on my monthly 
cheque.
<P>
	Let us think for a moment about reducing accrual rates from 
11 per cent to 9 per cent, what I would have received if I had 
opted into the pension and what I might have received if I opted 
out. I want to look after my own money, my own retirement. I do 
not want to be dependent on the government. When I am older I 
want to look after myself with RRSPs. I do not even want to be a 
burden to the government if I am younger and collecting the MP 
pension plan that is so rich and generous.
<P>
	If I had been given the option of taking the $600 a month that I 
have been putting into the MP pension plan and putting it into 
my own retirement plan, I could have put in $600 a month from 
1989 to 1997. Let me use that nine-year period. What would 
happen if I had put $600 a month into private RRSPs, mutual 
funds, rather than into the MP pension plan? Age 75 is the 
average lifespan. Many people have calculated the average age 
to be 75 and how much they would get by age 75 with inflation at 
age 60. If the variables correlate to each other on par and I were 
to collect about 7.5 per cent interest, which is reasonable and 
fair, I would collect $663,900.
<P>
	If I put $600 a month in for eight or nine years and let it sit 
there accruing interest I would get back at age 75 about 
$664,000. If for some reason I was particularly lucky and 
obtained a 10 per cent rate I would stand to gain $1.29 million. 
Under the pension plan that the government is putting in $3 or $4 
to $1, I would stand to gain about $1.2 million.
<P>
	This is hypothetical because I had to put money into the 
pension plan. I would collect about half what I stand to gain 
under the new plan if I put the money into RRSPs. It is no fun to 
collect only half. I do not think any member in the House would 
ask: ``How stupid do I look?'' Is it more fun to collect $1.2 
million or $660,000? Obviously whatever we get we could live 
into that income, but the fact remains that the $664,000 I 
invested, that somebody went out and invested on my behalf, 
would be my money. At the grand old age of 75 I would be able 
to collect that money and say: ``I did this. I looked after myself. I 
was not dependent on government and I feel good about that''.
<P>
	I would have a hard time collecting the MP pension plan. I 
would feel a little guilty spending the money because it was not 
my money, because I did not earn it myself or look after myself 
financially.
<P>
	According to the Treasury Board, members will now 
contribute $1 for the $3.61 taxpayers contribute. That number 
was a lot richer in the last Parliament. It seems as though there 
was a great sweep of this place in 1993 and a lot of the older 
members left. There are many new members in the House right 
now. That is the largest reason. We were told by Treasury 
Board-it is not some figment of my Reform imagination-that 
it would be $3.61 to every buck we put in. It looks better. It looks 
more noble. It looks like there is a real saving but it has nothing 
to do with any nobility on behalf of the government.
<P>
	It has to do with the fact that generally there are more new 
members in the House. That is what we were told in the briefing 
by the department. The government pays a generous rate of 
interest on this account, which is a cost to taxpayers but which is 
not included in the total cost of the plan that the government 
admits to.
<P>
	My point is that in the public accounts of 1993-94 last year 
they paid interest on $23 million. That is kind of scary because it 
goes into government expenditures. At the same time it does not 
specifically look like it is paying the MP pension. It is just 
amazing. They are spending $23 million on interest and it is 
nowhere in the budgetary figures.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="12167"> 12167 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Many members on the opposite side of the House have spoken 
both during their election campaigns and later in the House on 
the need for changes to the plan. I do not mean to be critical at 
all. In fact I applaud the member for Lambton-Middlesex who 
indicated to her constituents during the election campaign that 
the MPs pension plan should be, and I quote from <I>Hansard</I>, 
``more fair to the general public's pension plan''. I applaud her 
for that. It is terrific.
<P>
	Similarly the member for Waterloo indicated in the House 
that during the campaign he supported the minimum age of 60 
years. The member for Ontario said that he would opt out of the 
plan. This is not something we are trying to make our issue. It 
should be a totally non-partisan issue. We are talking about cash 
and not politics. It will cost money. Anyone on both sides of the 
House who has the nerve should be rewarded and applauded for 
opting out of the program.
<P>
	Let me conclude my remarks by saying that the signal the bill 
sends is more important than anything else. It seems unfortunate 
to me that the signal being sent is that we are reducing the fat a 
bit, that we are sacrificing an incredible amount for the country 
but we will still take a lot more cash than anyone who is buying 
into a private pension plan.
<P>
	This is unacceptable to us. We applaud the government for 
bring in the bill. I am sorry to say it is not good enough. It will 
not withstand the test of fire by the people who are paying the 
bills for it. Therefore I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``that''

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise in the House this afternoon to make some 
comments concerning Bill C-85.
<P>
	Primarily I should like to deal with the issue of fairness in Bill 
C-85, to talk about some alternatives the New Democratic Party 
has put forward in the past which we will continue to put forward 
in the future, and to make a recommendation to the House with 
respect to the bill.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	I have served in the Saskatchewan legislature in the past. I 
have made speeches in public, in legislatures, in private and in 
other places about adequate compensation for elected officials. I 
have always believed, as the majority of Canadians believe, that 
if we pay adequate compensation to elected officials they are 
accountable to us. If taxpayers pay the fare for pay and benefits 
in a satisfactory way, the elected officials will be accountable  to 
the taxpayers who pay the pay and benefits whether they are 
current or deferred.
<P>
	I have made this speech in many forums. I have had support 
from almost 95 per cent of the people who have listened to my 
comments, in particular those in Saskatchewan. They agree that 
elected officials should be adequately compensated so that they 
can do the business of government and provide good, honest 
government.
<P>
	Unfortunately for eight years in Canada we have seen the 
Mulroney government govern in a way that most Canadians 
rejected unanimously. As a matter of fact they only elected two 
members of Parliament as a result of the Conservative record. 
We have seen a government in Saskatchewan under Grant 
Devine Conservative for nine years, driving the province into 
bankruptcy and being totally dishonest with the people of 
Saskatchewan. They are despised by the people of 
Saskatchewan. The latest event in Saskatchewan is that 
one-third of the former government's cabinet and caucus is now 
facing charges before the courts for the type of alleged dishonest 
actions the taxpayers and the voters perceived them to be 
following when in government.
<P>
	The Mulroney government drove our country into debt, gave 
tax breaks to the wealthy, hurt the poor, attacked the middle 
class and served the country in a very dishonest fashion. It is the 
same with Grant Devine, premier of Saskatchewan. Taxpayers 
have the same attitude toward him. People would say that paying 
those politicians a dollar a year would be too much, and I believe 
they are right.
<P>
	Prior to the 1993 federal campaign in Canada and the 1991 
provincial campaign in Saskatchewan, we have seen people who 
are disenchanted and cynical about elected politicians because 
of corruption, dishonesty and incompetence. New Democrats 
have always said, and we are supported by Canadians across the 
country, that if the government is good and honest and provides 
a fair agenda of legislation, pay and compensation will not be 
issues. They would wish to pay elected officials in a satisfactory 
way.
<P>
	J. S. Woodsworth once said: ``What we desire for ourselves 
we wish for all. Elected officials are elected with integrity, with 
common objectives, with individual objectives to serve their 
country''. I think J. S. Woodsworth was saying that to get 
elected to Parliament to serve the country and do to fellow 
Canadians what we would like to have done to ourselves and is 
an honourable approach to government. He worked very hard as 
have the CCF and the New Democratic Party over the years to 
achieve those objectives.
<P>
	We see in Bill C-85 one step forward to perhaps addressing 
the pension issue, the pay and benefits aspect of elected 
officials. However I am not sure whether it goes far enough. 
Canadians will judge that as time goes on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12168"> 12168 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to desiring for ourselves what we wish for all, as 
J. S. Woodsworth has said and as has been quoted by many 
thousands of people over the years, we in the House of 
Commons and in the Government of Canada must show 
Canadians by example that it is a good government, that we are 
parliamentarians with honesty and integrity, and that we will 
introduce and support legislation to benefit Canadians as a 
whole rather than hurt Canadians. If we do this the attitude 
toward politicians will be much fairer and less cynical and we 
will be faced with spending a lot less time debating issues like a 
pension or salary package.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	I also want to make a comment with respect to the Reform 
member for Beaver River who said that she is taking a reduction 
in pension and that this is an honourable thing to do.
<P>
	Public service and serving the public is an honourable thing to 
do. Firefighters, police officers, provincial, municipal or 
federally elected officials are honourable professions in this 
country. It is no different from homemaking, working in retail, 
working in a steel mill, working as a teacher or in other areas. 
These professions are very honourable. They in essence serve 
the good of the country and the public.
<P>
	If I were wealthy, I would gladly do this job for free. Most 
parliamentarians in this House would say the same thing.
<P>
	As a matter of fact in the United States a large number of 
wealthy people govern the country, but Canadian taxpayers will 
say: ``Who will the wealthy govern the country for? Will they 
govern the country for those who are on welfare, those who are 
single parents, those who do not have an education, power or 
pensions or other sources of income to support them? Who will 
they support? Will they support their own kind or will they 
support all Canadians?'' In the American example we see very 
clearly that to be active in politics you have to be a millionaire or 
a multimillionaire just to run for office, never mind serving your 
country.
<P>
	There has to be fair compensation with respect to elected 
officials. Most of us would serve if we were not paid and were 
able to have some other income to sustain an adequate lifestyle. 
As long as members of Parliament set their own benefits, 
Canadian taxpayers will believe benefits are too generous.
<P>
	We see in the Reform Party and others in politics, the former 
Conservative governments, that they play the mugs game. It is 
not a winning game. It does not matter if we get paid $64,000, or 
$90,000 or $15,000 a year, it will still be too much in some 
people's eyes. That is fair. They are entitled to their opinion.
<P>
	The point I am making is that we have to look at this pension 
bill in a very broad way. We have to recognize some of the 
arguments on both sides of the issue whether it is a mugs game: 
``I am going to bid down the pension; I am going to bid down the 
salary; vote for me,  vote for me,'' or whether we are going to 
say: ``I am elected as your member of Parliament. I am going to 
conduct myself in this House on behalf of this country in an 
honest, hard working way to ensure that my constituents have as 
much opportunity as possible for input to government and to 
ensure the decisions we take benefit as many Canadians as 
possible, not just a few''.
<P>
	Canadians have to be aware that it is a mugs game when we 
start bidding down benefits, and who is to benefit? The 
benefactors will be those who are rich and wealthy enough to 
seek public office. They will represent those who are rich and 
wealthy who already in most part influence this country through 
the Conservative Party, the Reform Party and the Liberal 
government of the day.
<P>
	Most of the wealthy corporations contribute to those three 
parties. That is something the ordinary taxpayer has to be more 
aware of. They have to say that perhaps they should elect to 
Parliament people who are not wealthy, who do not support the 
wealthy, who are not on big pensions like many of the Reform 
members are.
<P>
	I question the Reform's tactics and motives. In the Reform 
Party many members are receiving military pensions, teachers' 
pensions, former MLA pensions. They have all sorts of other 
private sector incomes and they are saying let us do away with 
this and let us do away with that.
<P>
	Meanwhile they are ignoring the real problems of our 
country: the lack of jobs; the lack of commitment and resources 
to law and order; the lack of commitment and resources to our 
social programs. They do not care about people. They are just 
trying to make a political point and play a mugs game which 
they may or may not win.
<P>
	If they win one battle they may be happy with that. The 
alternative is that people may not be too concerned about how 
low we go. I think they are more concerned about how hard we 
work and what kind of positive governance and representation in 
this House we give them.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	The second point I wish to raise concerns the positive steps 
Bill C-85 has taken. I want it to be known that I am not 
endorsing the bill. However, I want to say that New Democrats 
have led the country in pension reform since 1979, unlike 
Reformers who have only talked about it since the last election.
<P>
	I refer specifically to Saskatchewan Premier Allan Blakeney. 
On July 1, 1979 a bill was given royal assent in Saskatchewan to 
change MLA's pensions from the defined benefit plan, which we 
are now under in the House of Commons, to a defined 
contribution plan, which means it is a money purchase plan. It is 
like an RRSP. The member puts a dollar in and it is supported by 
the employer matching it with a dollar. Whatever is put in and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12169"> 12169 </A></B>
<P>
earned through various investments is what the member will 
receive.
<P>
	The leader of the NDP, the hon. member for the Yukon, went 
on record in 1991, 1992 and in subsequent years calling for an 
independent commission to review MPs pay and benefits and in 
particular the pension plan.
<P>
	The NDP has been doing this for 16 years. Bill C-85 is a step 
in the right direction. First, it reduces pension benefits by 20 per 
cent. Second, it raises the age of eligibility to 55 years from no 
age before. That is quite positive. Third, it reduces the cost to 
taxpayers by one-third, which is an honourable objective. It is 
on the right track and I believe most Canadians would agree that 
it is a positive step. Further, it eliminates the double dipping 
issue, which the minister spoke of earlier.
<P>
	I would suggest that this bill not be endorsed in its entirety, 
but that it be referred to a standing committee-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There does not appear to be a quorum in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I do not see a quorum. 
Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Quorum is present. 
Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Madam Speaker, New Democrats have led the 
country in terms of pension reform provincially and federally. 
As a matter of fact, in September 1994 I introduced a private 
members' bill which proposed a money purchase plan for 
members of Parliament that was based on the Saskatchewan 
model. There were a fair number of members who considered 
that plan and thought it worthwhile.
<P>
	I also introduced private members' Bill C-314 which is 
calling-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There does not appear to be a quorum in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> There is no quorum. 
Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Quorum is present. 
Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Madam Speaker, I noticed the Reformers who 
are calling quorum do not have any members in the House 
themselves, so I am curious about that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sure the hon. 
member has forgotten that we do not discuss the presence or 
non-presence of members in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-85 has a double 
dipping feature. I might add that I introduced a private 
members' bill which calls for addressing the real double dipping 
issue. My bill on double dipping is not included in Bill C-85 but 
I propose it be considered. Members of Parliament who are 
elected and receive pensions or other income would have their 
MP salaries reduced dollar for dollar with respect to the 
pensions they are receiving.
<P>
	I say this because a host of members of Parliament stand in 
this House from time to time and call for a reduction of this or a 
bidding down of that. They are receiving huge pensions, 
whether they are military pensions like the Reform Party 
members, or MLA pensions like the Reform Party members, or 
municipal pensions or provincial government pensions or 
pensions from companies or government agencies, boards and 
commissions.
<P>
	Those members stand and say: ``Let us cut this and cut that 
because we are already getting $61,000 a year or $41,000 in big 
pensions''. Canadians have to be aware of that. I would like to 
see this bill adopted by this House. If you are receiving a 
$60,000 a year pension, then you can serve your country for a 
$60,000 pension plus $4,000 more to make up the difference 
between the member of Parliament salary and the money already 
being received from the public treasury.
<P>
	However, I do not see the Reform members standing up and 
talking about this, or even the Liberal government members. 
However I would ask members to consider that.
<P>
	With respect to the money purchase recommendation I have 
said the NDP government in Saskatchewan and New Democrats 
across this country have led pension reform. We have had a 
tradition of working toward a fair plan. To ensure fairness the 
Liberal government must appoint an independent commission to 
review this legislation to ensure it is fair for taxpayers and plan 
benefactors. As long as MPs are setting their own benefits, 
Canadian taxpayers will believe benefits are too generous.
<P>
	I might add that Saskatchewan is a model yet again today. It 
has led Canada for 16 years in pension reform but today it 
introduced pension legislation yet one more time. It has 
announced a series of reforms to the MLA pensions which are 
deemed by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and the National 
Citizens' Coalition already to be the fairest in the land.
<P>
	I quote from an article by the Association of Saskatchewan 
Taxpayers:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The pension plan for Saskatchewan MLAs elected after 1979 is one of the 
fairest political pension plans in Canada. For every dollar these MLAs 
contribute to their pension fund, taxpayers match it by $1. MLAs can only draw 
benefits based on what their own fund earns.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12170"> 12170 </A></B>
<P>

<P>
	This is called a defined contribution plan which is forced to 
pay for itself and therefore will not develop an unfunded 
liability. The only province with a more taxpayer friendly plan is 
Alberta which has no plan.
<P>
	The article goes on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Canadian Taxpayers Federation has called on other provincial and federal 
politicians to adopt the 1979 Saskatchewan model of reform, with one exception 
which was noted in the May 1994 issue of <I>The Taxpayer</I>. The politicians of 1979 
refused to lead by example and hoarded the rich old pension plan for themselves. 
This one catch in the scenario keeps growing uglier since we first took issue with 
it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
In response to the last part, the Saskatchewan government has 
rolled back the pre-1979 pension plan for members. It has 
capped the pension for current members who are contributing to 
a defined benefit plan at 70 per cent, based on four-year 
averages. This will expand restrictions as well in the new bill on 
double dipping to include members of the House of Commons, 
members of the Canadian Senate, judges of any court and any 
employment or service paid for by the Government of Canada or 
any other province or territory.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Saskatchewan has gone one step further in double dipping as 
well as the pension plan. It will eliminate the special pension 
allowance for the premier that was introduced in the 1960s by 
Liberal Premier Ross Thatcher.
<P>
	I call on the Liberal government to refer the matter of the 
Prime Minister's bonus of $50,000 at age 65 to an independent 
commission. The Liberal government should take some 
leadership and eliminate the wealthy Prime Minister's special 
bonus, as Premier Roy Romanow has done in Saskatchewan with 
his pension and those of members who served in the legislature 
prior to 1979.
<P>
	In summary, I appreciate the concern and the interest of 
Canadian taxpayers on this issue. Bill C-85 goes a long way in 
addressing the major concerns of Canadians. However, 
regardless of what we do, when MPs produce and pass 
legislation respecting their own salary and benefits, Canadians 
will always perceive it to be too generous.
<P>
	I ask the government to consider this aspect and not to refer 
the bill to the procedures and House affairs committee, which is 
a nice good old club of MPs, but to refer the legislation to an 
independent commission and let it establish once and for all, 
apart from elected members, what our pay and benefits should 
be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I enjoyed listening to the comments of the hon. 
member for Regina-Lumsden. He expressed his concern about 
double dipping which of course I share.
<P>
	Examples of double dipping cross many party lines. The three 
old parties are all guilty. One person who comes to mind is Ed 
Broadbent, former leader of the federal NDP who is double 
dipping at this very moment.
<P>
	However, the member talked about those who have served in 
the military or in other levels of government and then come to 
Parliament as also being double dippers.
<P>
	I would like to give an example. Someone has served in the 
military for 25 or 30 years, or someone has served at a lower 
level of government for 20 or 30 years, has made it a career, paid 
into an actuarially sound pension, not like the MPs pension 
which is funded four to one, five to one by the taxpayers for 
every dollar that we contribute. I am talking about actuarially 
sound pensions. Is he suggesting that these people should not 
collect their pensions after a long and distinguished career of 
service in these areas?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from the Reform House leader.
<P>
	I would like to make two points. First, two months ago the 
former leader of the New Democratic Party announced that he 
would not be receiving his pension while he was employed by 
the government. He terminated his benefits two or three months 
ago. As always, the member is misinformed. The former NDP 
leader is not receiving two incomes.
<P>
	Second, the member is suggesting that military pensions or 
certain government pensions are actuarially sound. The big 
news for members of the Reform Party, to which I would ask 
them to listen very carefully, is that these defined benefit plans 
are not funded totally right now. They have massive unfunded 
liabilities.
<P>
	Provincial-federal plans are short billions of dollars and 
additional revenues have to be pumped into them to meet the 
defined benefit aspect of the plan. As leaders of the country we 
should undertake to change our plan, make it a money purchase 
plan. From there we should go to the various departments and try 
to negotiate that with the various unions to ensure that the public 
sector is doing what the Saskatchewan public sector is doing.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	I might add to the House leader that the Saskatchewan public 
sector has had a money purchase plan not since 1979 but since 
1977. Even though it has had that plan since 1977-that is 
almost 20 years ago now-its defined benefit plan, which was 
well run over the years, is still about $2 billion unfunded in 
terms of future liability on the part prior to 1977. This is 
something that the Reform members should feel quite concerned 
about.
<P>
	With respect to the last question that the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster asked, should people who are 
receiving public pensions serve in the House and receive an 
MP's salary in addition to that? I say not because that is the real 
double dipping. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12171"> 12171 </A></B>
<P>
You are getting a public  pension and then serving the House of 
Commons and getting an MP's salary.
<P>
	Members stand up in the House and say: ``Let us cut this. Let 
us cut that. By the way, let us also cut low income people. Let us 
cut jobs. Let us cut medicare. Let us cut social services. Let us 
cut education. Let us cut everything because I am all right, Jack. 
I have a big income. I have a big pension''. That is the message 
of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Canadians see through this very thin argument which has no 
merit whatsoever. It is good rhetoric when no one else knows the 
facts. When people know the facts, I am sure they will make a 
decision with respect to whether the Reform's argument holds 
water.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, just 
under two years ago Canadians sent a clear message to Ottawa 
that they were tired of the status quo, of hypocritical politicians 
and subsequently voted in 205 rookies.
<P>
	My speech is to those rookies and my message is, let us not let 
the veterans corrupt us. When the voters fired the former 
frontbenchers, the former backbenchers and former prime 
ministers, they took away their power but for most not their pay 
cheques. As taxpayers we will be paying them for life 75 per 
cent of the average of their best six years of salary if they served 
15 years.
<P>
	The issue before us today is the MP pension plan, technically 
described as two separate items, the members of Parliament 
retirement allowance and the retirement compensation 
allowance. This is because the pension plan for parliamentarians 
was excessively generous and would not have been accepted as a 
registered pension plan under the Income Tax Act so the 
politicians split it into two.
<P>
	I will be talking a lot about double standards. That is my first 
example of a double standard, one for politicians and one for the 
rest of Canadians.
<P>
	An MP currently contributes a total of 11 per cent of the 
sessional indemnity to obtain pension benefits. Four per cent is 
applied to their retirement allowance while 7 per cent is applied 
to the compensation allowance. That is a sneaky way of getting 
around it. For additional benefits available, an MP with 
additional duties such as serving as a minister, there is the same 
split of contributions: 4 per cent to basic and 7 per cent to 
additional exists.
<P>
	Under Bill C-85 these percentages and the amount of the 
salary that they can contribute has been reduced from 11 per cent 
to 9 per cent. Here we have the basis for a plan that is fully 
indexed, completely immune to inflation and not available to 
people in the private sector.
<P>
	In the name of justice and fairness, I urge the government to 
go further than it has in Bill C-85 and bring all members, past 
and present, out of the ivory tower, back to earth and back to 
reality. I plead with them to show some leadership by example, 
like Reform Party members.
<P>
	We have pledged not to take an MP pension in its current form 
even if this smoke and mirrors bill is passed. Many of us, 
whether we can afford to or not, have also taken a 10 per cent 
cut, not because MPs make too much money but because as 
leaders we know that Canadians will need to sacrifice in the near 
future and are sacrificing now probably. We are prepared to lead 
by example at the top, no more double standards, one for 
politicians and one for the rest of Canadians. We challenge the 
government to follow our lead because simply put, it is the right 
thing for it to do especially when it asks Canadians to sacrifice.
<P>
	Personally, I would like to thank the government and the 
Prime Minister for allowing Reformers to opt out of the pension 
plan. It is unfortunate it is available only to the class of '93 and 
not the class of '97. This is a one shot deal.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	Nevertheless provinces like Alberta, that eliminated the 
government pension plan altogether, will continue to lead by 
example. It shows integrity. They do not just talk about it. Most 
important, it sets a higher standard for politicians.
<P>
	I would encourage all Liberal rookies, to whom I am 
addressing my speech today, to consider opting out with the 
Reformers. Weigh it against being voted out by the Canadian 
public in 1997.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Human Resources Development 
complain about 25,000 auto workers withdrawing $70 million 
annually from the UIC fund when taxpayers paid out an 
estimated $158 million in 1992 to cover revenue shortfalls in the 
MP pension fund and currently pay in excess of $2 million a year 
to do exactly what he is criticizing auto workers of doing? That 
is hypocrisy.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance nickel and dime RRSP 
contribution limits in his budget without addressing his own 
retirement compensation allowance that taxpayers fund more 
than he does?
<P>
	The hypocrisy of the Liberal government on this issue is truly 
disheartening. Liberals promised to reform the gold plated MP 
pension plan but with Bill C-85 all they have done is nibble 
around the edges. Canadians will continue to fork out millions 
of dollars to former cabinet ministers and backbenchers.
<P>
	The Prime Minister takes great pride in stating that MPs are 
held accountable at election time. That is when Canadians have 
their say about the government's performance. If Canadians say 
that the government stinks and sends it packing like the Tories, 
these members will  still be looked after for life by the Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12172"> 12172 </A></B>
<P>
taxpayers. We may fire them, Canada, but we will continue to 
pay millions of dollars to look after them.
<P>
	That is why we are opting out. We feel there are much better 
ways to look after our futures than this current double standard: 
one for politicians and one for the rest of Canadians. It is as if 
the pension plan is a separate UI program for the aristocrats, the 
select elected few who are better treated than the ordinary 
Canadian and are somehow, because they serve their country, a 
cut above the rest.
<P>
	The Prime Minister scored great political points in opposition 
when he tried to call the Tories back to the House during the 
summer to pass pension reform legislation. At the time he 
stated: ``If she''-Kim Campbell-``recalls Parliament we 
would pass it in one day''. That is how fast he would have moved 
in opposition. It sounds great, but what did he do once his party 
went over to the other side of the House and he became the Prime 
Minister? He waited a whole year for 52 more MPs, 46 of whom 
were Liberals, to qualify for their golden parachutes which this 
bill protects.
<P>
	We have three tiers, which I will get to later, of pension 
qualifiers. Is it any wonder then that some of us on this side of 
the House question the double standard and the arrogance 
surrounding the government on this issue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I call a quorum count.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Adams):</B> The hon. member for 
Regina-Lumsden has made a quorum call. I see a quorum at the 
present time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate it greatly if you 
added the extra five minutes this took on to my speech, please.
<P>
	Let me outline some of the many double standards regarding 
pensions contained in Bill C-85. It is fully indexed against 
inflation. This feature is not available in the private sector with 
the exception of maybe one of the richest companies in the 
private sector. This indexation costs a lot of money. Members do 
not contribute enough for that privilege. There is one standard 
for the elected politician. Yet the ordinary hard working 
Canadian taxpayer who looks after their own future in the 
private sector does not have that same opportunity, that same 
privilege, but a politician does. It is a double standard.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The second point is double dipping will not end for former 
members, past colleagues of the House like Joe Clark who is 
currently on the payroll and is receiving his pension plus his 
salary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, there are no 
Reform members in the House. I call quorum.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Adams):</B> I will ask the clerk to 
count the members present.
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Adams):</B> I do not see a quorum. I 
would ask that the bells be sounded.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Adams):</B> A quorum is present, 
resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, the member 
for Regina-Lumsden made reference to the fact that there were 
no Reform members in the House. There are two things I would 
like to bring to his attention. That statement is completely 
incorrect. There are Reform members in the House.
<P>
	I understand the rules do not allow members to speak of 
members not being present in the House. I want to ensure the 
record will show there are and have been Reform members in the 
House at all times.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Adams):</B> The member is correct. 
We do not refer to the presence or absence of members in the 
House. I ask that all members abide by that regulation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I wish to point 
out that members of the House are in the lobbies, many of them 
having lunch. It is lunchtime, after all. This perpetual set of 
quorum calls is nothing but a delay tactic on the part of the hon. 
member for Regina-Lumsden.
<P>
	The hon. member has flown the coop and there is not a single 
New Democrat in the House and there has not been all morning 
except for him. If those people do not show up for the debate and 
do not participate in the House they should be defeated by their 
electors for their non-attendance which is perpetual.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Adams):</B> I think we are engaged in 
debate. Unless there is another point of order, resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, if this is all intended to get me upset, 
ruffled and riled it will not work. I will continue along pointing 
out and showing the double standard of the government, the 
double standard with which it holds itself in much higher esteem 
than the rest of the Canadian public.
<P>
	I was trying to point out all of the double standards contained 
within Bill C-85 and it should be made the same as the private 
sector. I pointed out the full indexation which protects the 
amount of money politicians get against inflation and not 
available in the private sector.
<P>
	Former members are not touched by this legislation who are 
double dipping. It is only if they get reappointed at the end of 
this term. That is another double standard. Why leave them 
alone? Why leave them untouched? They are the ones who 
started all this. They are the ones who started giving themselves 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12173"> 12173 </A></B>
<P>
these generous benefits. Why is the government protecting 
them?
<P>
	The accrual rate has been reduced from 5 per cent to 4 per 
cent. That is admirable. It is a reduction. It will reflect in 
savings. There is no question about that. It still is double that of 
the private sector. The private sector is 2 per cent limited by the 
Income Tax Act. This defies the Income Tax Act and it goes to 4 
per cent. The Liberal government is bragging now that this will 
increase to 19 years before members get 75 per cent of their six 
best years. In the private sector at 2 per cent it will take 35 years 
to get 70 per cent of their salary. It is a double standard; one for a 
cut above the rest and the other for the ordinary Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Pension income in the private sector is limited to 70 per cent 
of an individual's three best years, but for those in Ottawa who 
are a cut above the rest it is 75 per cent. It is a 5 per cent 
difference, but it is still a difference. It is a double standard.
<P>
	The maximum contribution in the private sector is between 5 
per cent and 7 per cent of an individual's salary, which is 
matched by the employer. Here in the House it is 9 per cent, in 
the Senate it is 9 per cent, and it is matched three and a half 
times. It has been reduced from six to one to about three and a 
half to one. That reduction is good. It is headed in the right 
direction. Come down another 2.5 and I think the government 
might have a plan which would be acceptable to the Canadian 
public. Once again, there is a double standard.
<P>
	Bill C-85 reduces the six-year eligibility rule, which was 
ridiculous. No one should qualify for a pension for life after only 
six years of service. I commend and compliment the government 
for that. In its place it introduced the requirement of the age of 
55 for a fully indexed pension; once again, another example of 
the double standard. In the private sector the age for retirement 
is 65. If a person chooses to collect their pension before age 65 
they receive a reduced amount. That is not so with politicians. 
They are fully indexed at age 55 with no penalties, away we go. 
It is 10 years better than the private sector and that should not be. 
Cabinet ministers have no cap on the level they can contribute 
from their salaries to the pension plan.
<P>
	We now have a three tier plan. We have the trough regular plan 
for all those members of Parliament who were here prior to 
1988, such as the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister. 
We have the trough light plan, which applies to all the rookies in 
the House, the class of `93. If they are dumb enough to take it, if 
they are dumb enough not to force the rest of their veterans to 
follow along with them, then that is the way it is. Then there is 
the trough stout plan. If a member has higher responsibilities 
and makes a little extra money there is no cap. We have trough 
regular, trough light and trough stout. Those are three plans for 
politicians, who are a cut above the rest. There is only one plan 
in the private sector. It is another example of the double 
standard.
<P>
	Why not cut out the previous members' generous plans, or the 
previous members who are untouched? Why have this trough 
stout? Why not reduce it by even 5 per cent to 10 per cent, or buy 
them out rather than paying them $1 million, $1.5 million or $2 
million over 20 or 30 years? Buy them out for $.5 million and be 
done with it. Let us clean it up and fix it properly once and for 
all. It is time to cut our losses.
<P>
	Ministers receive a bonus on top of their salaries; not a bonus, 
it is extra remuneration for their extra workload. There is no 
limit on how big their pensions can become. They are not 
limited to the 75 per cent of the six best years. The Prime 
Minister and people who have been here for 30 years could end 
up getting 110 per cent of their salary when they are finished. 
That is not so in the private sector. That is not so for the rookies 
of the class of `93. That is not so if a member remains a 
backbencher, a parliamentary secretary or chairs a standing 
committee. That is a double standard.
<P>
	I do not understand why the Liberal rookies did not squawk 
more. They do have a chance to lead by example. They also have 
a chance to opt out. I hope they do because Canadians will be 
looking at whether people opt out and try to have a sensible plan. 
They might be voted out if they do not opt out.
<P>
	The bill sends a message that politicians are not ordinary 
people but a cut above the rest. That is why people do not like 
politicians. That is what politicians have come to represent: 
self-serving interests rather than serving the interests of the 
Canadian public.
<P>
	Reformers would end full indexation of pensions. We would 
postpone eligibility for benefits until at least age 65, with 
accessibility at a reduced rate. Eligibility would be further 
postponed by the amount of time in which the person was 
already paid prior to age 65. We would subject the MP pension 
plan to a tax back according to a formula identical to that of the 
old age security program.
<P>
	The Reform caucus has already approved the concept of 
privately purchased pensions under which future RRSP 
contributions for sitting MPs would be matched by the 
government up to the legal limit for contributions.
<P>
	After eliminating the current gold plated pension plan the 
House could agree to a proper and balanced compensation 
package which would be more palatable and compatible with 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Here is my personal recommendation which is certainly 
debatable but which should satisfy our critics. Whereas 
individual citizens from time to time wish to enter the public 
sector to help shape legislation and help make a contribution to 
Canadian society, whereas it is desirable to attract individual 
citizens from all walks of life to Parliament regardless of 
income, a reasonable compensation package should be offered 
to have this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12174"> 12174 </A></B>
<P>
great institution in the hands of members of Parliament more 
interested in serving their country rather than for  the pay, perks 
and privileges without inflicting undue financial hardships.
<P>
	This is an important job. Only 295 people in Canada have it at 
one time and they must balance personal sacrifices with the 
public interest. Given the current job description and people's 
expectations, let us get rid of the impression that somehow MPs 
are special or deserve something better than the private sector.
<P>
	What politicians do is freeze their salaries so they can stand 
up in front of Canadians and say: ``We too have made 
sacrifices''. Then they overcompensate with this high gold 
plated pension plan.
<P>
	Everyone in the House would agree that if we are truly to 
address the pension plan we have to talk about our salaries. That 
option is not open because our salaries are frozen. The 
government has conveniently blocked real pension reform from 
all possible angles.
<P>
	I know that except for Ottawa and area MPs all of us need to 
spend extra money on a second residence and extra 
transportation. Therefore let us come clean with Canadian 
taxpayers and say: ``Here are the costs of being an MP. We need 
a second set of everything. If you want somebody to represent 
you, it has to be paid for or very few will be willing to serve''.
<P>
	The job with its responsibilities compared with the private 
sector is at least at a senior executive level and is deserving of a 
$12,000 per month salary perhaps. Why not get rid of the MP 
pension plan and the tax free living allowance, the tax free 
expense allowance, limit members to two terms and offer a 
taxable salary at $12,000 per month wherein members look after 
their own expenses. These are my personal points of view and do 
not reflect the party's point of view whatsoever. MPs should be 
paid more but once they are removed from office Canadians 
should not be on the hook for about a million dollars per 
member. They should be given a private sector pension plan into 
which they pay 5 per cent matched by the government on a one to 
one basis.
<P>
	What is so hard to understand about that? Why this six to one, 
three and a half to one, 11 per cent, 9 per cent? This is confusing. 
Upon departure, I would get a one time, one-year severance to 
help re-enter the workforce and reintegrate into my previous 
life.
<P>
	This is no different from the private sector and would make 
the voters and politicians happy. It is an honest, clean, simple, 
visible, understandable and, most important, above board 
recommendation. The rookies in the House have to understand it 
is not so much politicians' basic pay that angers Canadians, it is 
the gold plated pensions, the tax free allowance, the junkets, the 
things unavailable and in some cases illegal for those in the 
private sector.
<P>
	The days of pomp and pageantry are over and it is time to start 
paying politicians what they are worth, no more and no less; no 
golden handshakes, no fancy accounting and no more double 
talk. Rookies of the House, it is up to you, it is up to us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, can the member identify a member in the House who 
receives a $60,012 annual pension from Alberta, who receives 
$64,400 MP pension and donates 15 per cent of it? Last year, he 
received $21,300 in an expense account for a grand total of 
$151,052. Can he identify this MP for the audience in the House 
and for the viewers in Canadian living rooms?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, the member's own President of 
the Treasury Board this morning stood up in the House and gave 
the first intervention on this bill. He introduced the bill.
<P>
	In the bill the President of the Treasury Board defined double 
dipping. Double dipping was defined by the government-in his 
own words clearly and specifically, and he did not use the 
legalese language-as a former member of the federal 
government receiving remuneration for a job after they are 
finished serving the Canadian public.
<P>
	The member the Liberal MP asked me about is not guilty of 
double dipping. It is not double dipping. This individual served 
in the provincial legislature. This individual resigned from the 
provincial legislature. This individual offered his services to the 
Canadian public on a federal basis.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	He made it quite clear he was receiving a pension from the 
provincial government. He made it quite clear how much the 
amount was. He was totally above board and open. He did not 
run from this topic. He did not hide from this topic. He asked the 
voters in his riding and constituency. He said: ``You know my 
circumstances, you know where I have been, you know where I 
want to go. If you want to send me there, I will be getting this 
from the provincial government and I will be getting that from 
the federal government''. And they elected him.
<P>
	We came here and we said that the MP pension plan is too 
extravagant, too generous, too gold plated. We are making some 
sense. We are getting to the government, because it agreed with 
us. The Liberals have changed it; they have improved it. But it is 
like everything else: they just go a little in our direction and 
claim they have gone all the way. It is like bragging. They are 
bragging they have done what the Canadians need.
<P>
	Yes, I commend them for reducing the cost of the pensions 
and making it a little fairer. They are saving $3 million a year. 
Nobody's denying that. But if you have something wrong with 
the plumbing or the electrical in your house, fix it right while 
you are there. When you are doing renovations it is expensive. 
This whole process is costing a lot of money. Why waste all of 
that money? Why not do it right? Why not fix it all?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12175"> 12175 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We will have to do it again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Now it will all have to be done again.
<P>
	My point is that now that we have a clear definition of double 
dipping and we know what double dipping is, maybe the 
members of the government themselves had better find out what 
that definition is and stop giving the cheap shots to the hon. 
member for Lethbridge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian: </B>Madam Speaker, it seems to me the hon. 
member agrees that if someone serves this House for six years 
and gets his pension then he can go to the provincial 
government, serve there, and get another pension and it will be 
okay.
<P>
	I cannot follow the logic. A pension is a pension is a pension. 
They always make the point that there is only one taxpayer in 
this country. In this case, the taxpayers of this country are 
paying $151,052 for a member of Parliament who is not even 
here to defend himself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I gather the member opposite said 
he did not understand my logic. I do not understand how that 
could happen. Let me try to be really clear.
<P>
	I talked about a double standard. I talked about a method of 
politicians paying themselves remuneration that is excessive 
and that is different from what is available in the private sector.
<P>
	We are no better than the people we serve. We are only one 
among them who has been asked to serve because we offered to 
serve. That does not then put us at a higher, loftier level where 
we deserve twice or three times the benefits, protecting 
ourselves from the rules of the workplace they have to live with. 
That is what is wrong with this system.
<P>
	Nobody deserves a pension for life after six years of service. 
The government corrected that. That is a heck of a step for this 
government, and I give it a strong thank you and a strong 
compliment for doing that. That is recognizing one of the things 
that is wrong with it. The Liberals deserve credit for listening 
and I applaud them for it.
<P>
	However, they introduced 55 as the qualifying age, fully 
indexed with full payment, when in the private sector it is 65 
years of age. If you want to get it prior to 65, you would get a 
lesser amount. None of that is comparable.
<P>
	Why is it this way for us in the House? It is all from the 
old-line politicians; it is not from us rookies. It is not from the 
Reformers. We came here to clean it up. I am asking the 205 
rookies, why the heck are we not standing up instead of letting 
these cabinet ministers that have been here before push their 
weight around? We know what is right. Let us do that.
<P>
	We are ordinary Canadians serving the public. We should get 
fair compensation, fair remuneration. It is at a senior executive 
level. Pay us $150,000 a year. We will look after our own 
pensions. We will have it matched by government. People will 
accept that. But these two or three triple standards, this trough 
regular, trough light stuff is getting ridiculous. This is all we are 
saying.
<P>
	I am frustrated. I should not have become frustrated, but I am 
frustrated when I try to make sense, I try to give reason and I 
want to work with the government so the integrity of all 
politicians will rise, and they insist on saying: ``No, no, no; we 
deserve it''.
<P>
	It is just like the mileage. Why does an MP deserve 37 cents 
and the private sector businesses with salesmen get 31 cents for 
their travel allowance on gasoline? That is ridiculous. It is 
another example of a double standard.
<P>
	Why can this government not get it through its head that the 
Reform Party is only trying to bring some sanity and integrity 
back into this House? We are on their side, but they will not 
listen.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as I listen to this debate unfold today, and I recognize 
there are good people on all sides of the House, I wonder what it 
is about the pension that leads to good governance. That is really 
what this debate is all about.
<P>
	Does this pension in any way help Canada have good 
governance? Has it over the past 30 years had good governance? 
By any rational score card the answer would have to be no. We 
happen to be $550 billion in the hole and we are increasing our 
debt to the tune of $120 million a day, so that we are in debt now, 
every single Canadian taxpayer, $40,000. That is just the federal 
part of the national debt.
<P>
	Then the question is: What is it about a pension that leads to 
good governance? Does that pension then attract and retain good 
people in the Parliament of Canada? My submission is no, it 
does not. In my view, after being here for a year and a half, I 
think the governance of our country would be immeasurably 
improved in three simple steps. The first is to get rid of the MP 
pension plan. We should be here doing what is right, without 
having this become a lifelong job and then return to the private 
sector.
<P>
	I ask the member for Calgary West if he would respond to this 
question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, there are 
about 30 seconds left. If you would like an answer to your 
question, which will have to be 30 seconds, will you please put it 
now?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12176"> 12176 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> What is there about having a pension that 
would lead to good governance? Does it lead to good governance 
or has it in the past?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, a fair and reasonable pension that 
is commensurate with the private sector with a salary that is 
commensurate with the private sector for the workloads 
inflicted upon these people would attract and would show some 
good governance, and that is what we have to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address this House on the subject of Bill C-85, 
legislation dealing with proposed amendments to the Members 
of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Before presenting my speech, I would like to make a few 
comments. First, although I strongly disagree with the hon. 
member for Richelieu on a number of issues, including Canada's 
future, I want to congratulate him for making a speech based on 
facts. He made comparisons which help us get a better grasp of 
this whole issue.
<P>
	It is not often that an opposition member presents facts and 
tries to help us better understand what we are doing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With respect to the other speakers, it is my opinion that the 
Reform Party is exploiting a situation that I think it has whipped 
up for political gain. For example, there is the suggestion that if 
we take RRSPs this does not cost the taxpayers any money. I am 
sorry, that is terribly wrong. There are not millions but billions 
of dollars that the government is not getting as a result of RRSP 
programs. That is the kind of logic members of the Reform Party 
advance. They do not like to hear it, but RRSPs, those very 
programs they propose, would cost the government billions of 
dollars. They do now. Let us get serious.
<P>
	Another thing that astounds me is when we talk about double 
standards, Reform is the party that said we must shun the 
parliamentary restaurant. I have been to the parliamentary 
restaurant and I have seen Reform colleagues there. These are 
the same people who said they would not go.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Name them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> I do not want to name them. I do not want to 
embarrass them. But if forced, I shall.
<P>
	``We would never go to those lobbies at airports. That is just 
not for us''. Sorry, folks, I have seen some there too.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	They have also said they are not flying executive class. Wrong 
again. They do. These are the same members that say they are 
going to take a cut in salaries. Of course some have, but many 
have not. That is a double standard.
<P>
	When Canadians hear of that party doing that kind of thing, it 
will have no credibility. It has very little credibility today.
<P>
	One of the members said this morning that if the current plan 
had continued that member would have received $1.2 million, if 
that member lived long enough, but if it had been done through 
private investment it would have been roughly half of that, 
$600,000. I stand here today hoping very much that I will be able 
to retire and receive $600,000 over a lifetime. The way I figure 
it, I will be over 80 years old before that happens to me.
<P>
	Those are the kinds of misleading statements that inflame the 
passions of Canadians. It is erroneous logic. They take one 
particular example and try to pretend that it belongs to everyone. 
That is the kind of nonsense we are facing here today. I am 
disappointed.
<P>
	There is another example. A motion was proposed by the 
Reform Party to not have this bill go forward. Is that not 
somewhat contradictory? There are going to be changes made 
that are going to save Canadian taxpayers money, and that party 
wants to hoist it, stop it. If the Reform Party is so concerned 
about changes, let us go forward. Let us move. Let us go now.
<P>
	This is the party that on a very serious matter called for 
quorum, knowing full well that there are members just behind 
the curtain who are having lunch. This is the kind of seriousness 
they apply to this debate.
<P>
	This is the party that talks about opting out. It is not a question 
of opting out; it is a question of opting in. Members can opt in. 
The suggestion was that it was only available to Reform MPs. It 
is available to whoever chooses to do it out of the class of '93. 
Let us get with it. Let us deal with the facts.
<P>
	I am pleased to observe that many colleagues spoke of the 
need for changes to the MP pension plan in the last Parliament, 
both here and outside of the House. I am delighted to note today 
that we are in fact going forward with Bill C-85, which delivers 
on the government's red book commitments to reform MP 
pensions to end double dipping and to set a minimum age at 
which pensions under the plan may be paid. Those were the 
promises that were made, but we did not stop there; we went 
beyond. In fact, Bill C-85 goes further than the red book 
commitments.
<P>
	Of course that is not good enough for Reformers, because they 
want to exploit the situation. They would have exploited it even 
if it had been removed. They would have found something to say 
about it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12177"> 12177 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This bill will also reduce the pension benefit accrual rate 
under the MPs pension plan. In the future, instead of an average 
sessional indemnity of 5 per cent for each year of service, 
members will accrue benefits at a rate of 4 per cent of their 
average income over a 6-year period. That represents a 20 per 
cent reduction. But, of course, Reform members say this is 
nothing.
<P>
	That 20 per cent reduction clearly shows the government's 
firm intention to cut spending, as well as the will of 
parliamentarians to make sacrifices like the rest of Canadians to 
help put our fiscal house in order.
<P>
	I am proud to see that, once passed, the proposed amendments 
will result in a 33 per cent reduction of the cost, for taxpayers, of 
MP pensions. That 33 per cent reduction translates into savings 
of over $3 million for 1995 alone.
<P>
	I want to congratulate the Prime Minister, as well as the hon. 
member for York Centre and President of the Treasury Board, 
for their role in this respect.
<P>
	The proposed legislation includes another important element. 
Some members objected to the fact that MPs' participation in 
the pension plan is compulsory. They suggested that, if allowed 
to do so, they would withdraw from the plan.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister responded by promising MPs that they 
would be free to participate or not in the pension plan. Bill C-85 
follows up on that commitment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is on the subject of optional participation in the pension 
plan that I wish to focus my remarks today. Hon. members have 
asked for that choice and will now be given it. It is a serious 
choice, with long term consequences, and I urge all hon. 
members to give the choice very careful consideration. In 
contemplating their decision, members should bear in mind the 
amendments of the bill will bring about features of the pension 
plan which some have found to be objectionable.
<P>
	We are eliminating double dipping. Pensions based on future 
service will not be paid before a former member has reached 55 
years of age. MP pension benefits are being pared down and 
taxpayers' costs will decrease significantly.
<P>
	When Bill C-85 is given royal assent, a 60-day clock will 
start ticking; a 60-day period for passage of the bill within 
which members of the House will be able to make an option to 
continue their participation as pension plan members.
<P>
	This is a one time opportunity. Hon. members who fail to sign 
and deliver their option to participate form within the 60-day 
time frame will cease to be pension plan members and their 
contributions to the MP pension plan account will be refunded to 
them.
<P>
	In a few minutes I will speak further of the consequences of 
discontinuing plan participation. Now I wish to concentrate on 
the process of maintaining membership under the plan. I am 
informed that administrative officials of the House will contact 
each member immediately following passage of this bill. 
Advice and information on the option process will be provided 
and each member will be furnished with an option form on 
which they may specify their interest in continuing pension plan 
membership.
<P>
	Each member who wishes to stay under the pension plan must 
complete the option form and return it to the House 
administration within 60 days of the royal assent day. This is a 
critical deadline and must not be missed by any member who 
chooses to maintain their status as a member of the MP pension 
scheme.
<P>
	Therefore, I caution hon. members they should ensure they 
receive their option form and complete and return it before the 
deadline if they wish to stay under the plan.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I will complete and return this option form. I will continue to 
participate in the MPs pension plan. I have a wife and three 
children, and I want to ensure their future in the best possible 
way. Given the comments he made outside this House, I know 
that the President of the Treasury Board will also choose to stay 
under the plan. That plan is just one element of the global 
compensation package for MPs.
<P>
	I also wish to point out that, according to independent studies, 
that plan is not overly generous. I am of the opinion that all 
members of this House work very hard and put in long hours. 
They earn their pay. My colleague from Richelieu proved the 
point in his speech this morning when he made the comparison 
between us and other parliamentary jurisdictions in Canada.
<P>
	Let us not forget that past governments have consistently 
promoted retirement savings. Retirement plans are an important 
part of retirement planning. These plans provide substantial 
protection for people against the unforeseen, such as death or 
infirmity.
<P>
	Lastly, the financial protection of MPs' survivors in case of 
death should be a central consideration in their decision whether 
to opt out of a parliamentary pension.
<P>
	In my case, if I did not complete my term, basically, if I died, 
my wife and family would receive 60 per cent of the pension to 
which I would have been entitled. Partners and children must not 
be forgotten.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Notwithstanding the considerations which I have just 
outlined, I know there are members of the House who have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12178"> 12178 </A></B>
<P>
committed themselves to terminating their plan membership. 
Some of these members may already have other arrangements in 
place for their retirement and their survivors. Perhaps some are 
sufficiently wealthy that they need have no concern about their 
economic  security or their family's in later years. There are 
some who will use their termination of plan membership as a 
political statement.
<P>
	Whatever their reasons, I need to respect and I will respect 
their right to choose. The Prime Minister promised them the 
choice and now they will have it.
<P>
	I hope hon. members planning to cease their participation in 
the MPs pension plan will consult with their families before 
making their final decision. This is a decision which will 
directly affect members' families as well as members 
themselves. Members should be aware of all of the 
consequences withdrawal from the pension plan will entail, 
particularly the consequences their choice will leave on their 
loved ones.
<P>
	This will be a permanent choice. Those making a political 
statement with that choice will be bound by that statement. 
There will be no going back. Pension contributions will be 
refunded and periods of service in respect of which those 
refunds are paid or future periods where no contributions will 
have been made may never in future be counted under the 
pension plan.
<P>
	Hon. members who fail to opt into the plan will remain as 
non-members for as long as they continue to serve in Parliament 
without a break in service. This will be the case whether they 
continue to serve in this honourable House or in the upper 
chamber.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would once again advise MPs who are considering opting 
out of their pension plan to look carefully at the other pension 
vehicles available to them. They should also prepare for the 
unforeseen, such as infirmity, and consider the financial future 
of their survivors should they die.
<P>
	If we were to sacrifice the coverage provided for under the 
parliamentary pension plan, what coverage would replace it and 
at what cost? We should all make an educated choice. I must 
insist that we cannot make such decisions without knowing 
beforehand all of the ramifications.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, MPs who opt out of their pension plan 
will receive a full reimbursement of their contributions within 
60 days of Bill C-85 receiving Royal Assent. I will take this 
opportunity to explain the terms and conditions of this refund.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For hon. members who joined the House for the first time at or 
after the beginning of this Parliament, on or after October 25, 
1993, the process is quite straightforward. Members who fail to 
opt into the plan will be paid a refund of all of their pension 
contributions. For members with parliamentary service which 
occurred before October 25, 1993 the process is slightly more 
complicated. It depends on whether as of October 25, 1993 they 
were vested members under the pension plan.
<P>
	To digress momentarily, under our pension plan a member of 
Parliament is considered to be a vested pension plan member 
upon completion of six years of service. Therefore when I speak 
of members who were vested as of October 25, 1993 I refer to 
those of my hon. colleagues who as of that date had been 
members for at least six years.
<P>
	Under the bill a member who was not vested as of October 25, 
1993, that is a member who did not have six years of service as 
of that date, and refrains from opting into the plan within the 60 
days immediately following royal assent, will also be paid a 
refund of all of the pension contributions he or she has paid. This 
would include contributions made both before and after October 
25, 1993.
<P>
	If the member was vested as of October 25, 1993, the refund 
will be restricted to those pension contributions paid since that 
date. In this latter case, contributions paid for the six or more 
years of service which occurred prior to October 25, 1993 will 
be retained in the pension account to provide upon the member's 
eventual retirement from Parliament the vested pension benefit 
earned in respect of those years.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And since our pension contributions are paid into two 
different accounts, I must digress again.
<P>
	The last time the pension plan for parliamentarians was 
amended, this was done to comply with pension plan 
registration rules provided under the Income Tax Act. As of 
January 1, 1992, parliamentarians have contributed to the basic 
retirement account and to an account referred to as the 
Retirement Compensation Arrangements Account.
<P>
	Contributions to the basic account will be used to pay 
retirement allowances earned pursuant to Part I of the Members 
of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act, in other words, that part 
of the pension plan for parliamentarians that complies with the 
tax provisions governing registered retirement plans.
<P>
	As for contributions made to the Retirement Compensation 
Arrangements Account, pursuant to Part II of the Act, these will 
be used to pay that portion of retirement allowances earned 
under the plan which exceed the maximum allowed for 
registered plans under the Income Tax Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12179"> 12179 </A></B>
<P>
	Here I would like to say, in passing, that all employers in 
Canada may offer their employees a non-registered 
supplementary retirement plan similar to the retirement 
compensation arrangement.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In instances where refunds of pension contributions are to be 
paid to plan members, all contributions paid before January 1, 
1992 may, if the member so wishes, be rolled over on a tax 
exempt basis to another registered retirement vehicle such as the 
registered retirement savings plan. For the sake of precision that 
would be in respect of members who had service before October 
25, 1993 but who were not vested as of that date together with 4 
per cent of sessional indemnities paid to the basic account under 
part I of the act since January 1, 1992.
<P>
	Members wishing to roll over the contributions to an RRSP 
should consult administrative officials of the House for 
information on the forms and the process for effecting such a 
transfer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, since the retirement compensation arrangement is 
not an RRSP instrument, contributions paid into the RCA 
account pursuant to Part II of the Act cannot be rolled over to an 
RRSP. Consequently, members who decide to opt out of the 
retirement plan will receive directly the amounts they had 
contributed since January 1, 1992 to the RCA account, in other 
words, 7 per cent of sessional indemnities. Refunds of 
contributions to the RCA account will be taxed at source as 
income, to be declared by the member as part of his taxable 
income for the year in which the refund was made.
<P>
	There is one last point I would like to make. I would like to 
explain another consequence of a member's opting out of the 
retirement plan and the resulting refund of contributions. Every 
year, a so-called pension adjustment is calculated on the basis of 
our regular contributions, and this figure is then communicated 
to Revenue Canada. This amount reflects the value of the 
retirement benefits we have earned through our contributions in 
a given year. This pension adjustment is then used for tax 
purposes, to calculate our maximum annual RRSP contribution, 
if any.
<P>
	However, and this will be my last comment, under the Income 
Tax Act, a member who elects to recover contributions paid into 
the pension plan for parliamentarians will not be able to recover 
RRSP contribution entitlements he could not use during those 
years when he contributed to the pension plan for 
parliamentarians.
<P>
	I am sorry, I would have liked to add certain other things, but 
my time is up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I was very 
interested in the remarks of the member for St. Boniface.
<P>
	It is really quite amazing the passion a member can arouse in 
himself when driven by unmitigated greed.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	I would take issue with some of the remarks he threw this way 
with respect to the consultation of families, for example. I think 
most people in this caucus consulted their families. They also 
consulted their constituents. The net result that obviously arose 
was that people said: ``Thou shalt not steal''. We are in this, and 
we are in it together.
<P>
	The hon. member also made remarks about whether or not 
certain members of the Reform Party had given up this perk or 
that perk or had made certain sacrifices. I gave up my 10 per 
cent. That has nothing to do with this debate, nothing 
whatsoever. I occasionally eat in the parliamentary dining room. 
So what? I never said I would not. So what are they driving at? 
We are talking about a multimillion dollar rip-off of the 
Canadian public and the hon. member is talking about trash.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member, since he is so critical of 
others in saying what did you give up or what sacrifice have you 
made, what has the hon. member given up? What sacrifice has 
he made? Can he name one thing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Madam Speaker, I should note to my hon. 
colleague that I am always passionate in debate. This is no 
exception. To suggest, which Reformers are often prone to do, 
that I became passionate about this subject because of a greed 
factor is really a low blow. I believe it is beyond a member's 
stature, or should be, in the House of Commons.
<P>
	To suggest this is about thou shalt not steal, from the Bible, to 
invoke that in this debate, to suggest this is stealing, is below 
being low. And to use terms such as trough to try to excite the 
passions of people simply for political gain is even lower still.
<P>
	When I mentioned the parliamentary restaurant, flying 
executive class, et cetera, why did I do that? Because that party 
is double-talk; that party pretends one thing and does other 
things.
<P>
	That party is exploiting this issue-not all members, but 
some-because it has no issue. The polls are so bad that it 
virtually does not exist. That party's members are flailing about, 
trying to find something that will capture the imagination of 
people. That is the party which comes forward with a budget that 
has no sense at all, that is absolutely denounced by virtually 
anyone who knows anything about budgets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Name one.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12180"> 12180 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Name one? I stood in this House and I 
mentioned at least a dozen credible sources that denounced that 
pretend budget, which did not even add up. This is why 
Reformers have no credibility.
<P>
	That party tries to use in B.C. the aboriginal land claim 
situation in order to further its political agenda. It is the kind of 
party that will seize upon any issue in order to try to further its 
political agenda. It is not fair; it does not try to be fair. It did not 
listen to our colleague's comments from the Bloc when he set 
out the statistics and showed this particular reduction is an 
important one, which puts us in line with a number of other 
provincial legislatures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> How about Alberta? It is zero.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Oh, Alberta. Okay.
<P>
	That party would not acknowledge that during the last three 
Parliaments almost 60 per cent of the MPs who were here are not 
receiving a pension today. That party pretends everybody is 
getting a large pension. If I were walking out today my pension 
would be in the $19,000 range. If I were to die today, that would 
be one-third less for my wife and three kids. That is the kind of 
party that would like to see that kind of remuneration. I have no 
time for that.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Can you not look after yourself?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. I would like to 
request that the House take a little time and think about some of 
the comments being made to colleagues. It is a very emotional 
issue for a lot of us. I think we have to stop and think before we 
fling comments back and forth across this House.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today we are here to debate an act to amend the Members of 
Parliament Retiring Allowances Act. Canadians know this as the 
MP pension plan. That is what we are really talking about today. 
I am happy to rise and make some comments about the MP 
pension plan that is being introduced.
<P>
	Unfortunately, it is not as good as the model that was brought 
forward by the President of the Treasury Board in December. 
But he was not able to sell that plan to his Liberal caucus, and 
now we see the results: an MPs' pension plan that is being 
introduced today that is still obscene because it is twice as rich 
as any public sector or private sector pension plan.
<P>
	During the run up to the election of 1993, when I was seeking 
the nomination and I was out campaigning I heard from my 
constituents in Peace River over and over and over again on this. 
It was the issue that captured my attention and the attention of 
all other politicians from all other parties who were 
campaigning there. They heard from the Canadian public and 
the public in Peace River that MPs have a pension plan that is a 
double standard with what most Canadians can receive, either in 
the public or private sector.
<P>
	That to me has developed a very cynical electorate out there. 
There were a number of new members elected to the House in 
the election. One reason they were elected is because the public 
is very cynical about politicians. This used to be a noble calling. 
That is not the way the Canadian public regards it any more.
<P>
	I have to tell members a story about one of the first meetings I 
attended as a politician after my nomination. It said a lot about 
how people regard politicians and politics and the reason for it. I 
was speaking at a small community meeting of about 40 people. 
I had spoken for about 10 or 15 minutes and then we stopped to 
have coffee. I was circulating and talking to different members 
of the audience. One fellow about 75 years old, a rancher type 
who had spent a lot of time outdoors, a weathered and very 
interesting fellow, came up to me and we had a very interesting 
conversation for about four or five minutes. Finally, he was 
going to take his leave and wish me well and say goodbye. The 
comments he made I thought were very relevant. He said: ``You 
know, Charlie, I wish I had met you before you went into 
politics. I think I would have liked you''.
<P>
	That says a lot about how people regard politicians these days. 
One reason for that degree of cynicism about politicians is that 
they see we have double standards. The double standard that is 
most obvious, I believe, is the MP pension plan.
<P>
	During the course of the campaign I think I heard only one 
comment about MPs' salaries. It was not an issue. People think 
that MPs should be paid well. But they do not believe they 
should get a pension plan that is five or six times more generous 
than that of the average person in the public. And that is what we 
are addressing here today.
<P>
	This pension plan is a step in the right direction. Like so much 
of the legislation the party across brings forward, this is a step in 
the right direction but it is not far enough.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is a small step.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> I think we have to examine the past plan. Let us 
do a comparison. As I said, we only had to be in the House for 
two terms or six years to be eligible for the MP pension plan 
under the previous plan, which is five or six times more 
generous than the average Canadian private sector or public 
sector plan.
<P>
	So what is introduced in the new pension plan, the one that is 
going to correct the problem? We have a pension plan where we 
are still eligible at age 55. That does not seem to fit with most 
public and private plans. It certainly is not the case with the old 
age security. In fact, we are talking about moving that to age 67, 
since the plan cannot be sustained.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12181"> 12181 </A></B>
<P>
	What else do we have? We still have a plan that is two and a 
half or three times more generous than the average public or 
private sector plan. It does not fit. It is not acceptable.
<P>
	What about the future? We know there is an opting out 
formula in the plan of 60 days for those members who wish to 
opt out. I am one of the members who wants to, and I certainly 
will. But that will not apply to future MPs. They do not have that 
option. Why not? It would seem to me it is a reasonable option to 
put in there. Anybody who wants to look after their own 
retirement should be able to do so, but not under this plan as far 
as future MPs are concerned. They will be obliged to belong. 
There again is a problem.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	We had the minister and some other members stand in this 
House this morning trying to justify the new plan that is being 
brought forward. As I said, there are many reasons why the 
Canadian public is not going to accept this.
<P>
	All of this is happening at a time when politicians need to 
show strong leadership in this country. It is a time when we have 
a record federal debt: $550 billion and growing at the rate of 
$120 million a day. It is time for MPs to stand up and show 
leadership. What would that mean? It would mean accepting a 
plan that is the average of what most Canadians have. Is that too 
much to expect from leadership in this country? I do not believe 
it is.
<P>
	We have Canada's official loyal opposition-what do those 
members intend to do with this plan? It seems very ironic that 
those members, with the expressed goal of wanting to opt out of 
Canada, as they tell us every day in this House, want to opt into 
the new MPs' pension plan. I do not understand the logic. It must 
mean that they plan on staying longer than they originally had 
intended. It seems to me that is a real contradiction. I cannot 
understand why they would not want to take the opt out formula 
along with the rest of us in the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> They want to opt out of the country but stay in 
the pension plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Let us examine the rhetoric from this side of the 
House when the members who are over on the government side 
now were over here. We had the famous rat pack. I think we all 
know who they are. They enjoy some of the front benches over 
there now. What did they say? They called for a change to the 
MP pension plan. My understanding is that when the President 
of the Treasury Board brought in what was a reasonable plan in 
December to the Liberal caucus, they were the ones who led the 
charge against it. So the rat pack it seems has become the fat cat 
pack these days. We see this every day.
<P>
	Who is going to be the judge of this MP pension plan? It is not 
me as the member for Peace River, in the final analysis. It is not 
going to be the member for St. Boniface. It is going to be the 
Canadian public, the voters, our constituents.
<P>
	The member for St. Boniface said that we should carefully 
consider and consult our family members when and if we decide 
to opt out. He would seem to suggest that we have not been doing 
that. Well I do not believe that other members of the Reform 
Party caucus did not consult their families. I know I certainly 
did, and it was a joint decision. However, it becomes more than 
consulting family. I also consulted constituents. I have been 
doing it for a long time. And constituents tell us that this plan is 
still far too generous.
<P>
	The member also seemed to lump the business of pay and 
salary into the MP pension plan. It is all part and parcel as far as 
he is concerned. I do not believe it is. I believe that if we have a 
problem or we do not believe the pay is high enough for a 
member of Parliament, we should deal with that issue up front 
and involve the Canadian public in that discussion. This is a 
separate matter altogether, and it has to be dealt with that way.
<P>
	The member for St. Boniface also talked about the RRSP. He 
suggested that the Canadian taxpayer would be on the hook for 
more money through a loss in taxes if we went the route of all 
members opting out and using the RRSP. There is certainly some 
merit in what he says, but it is not making special rules; it is 
following rules under the RRSP program that other Canadians 
are under. So we are all in the same category. That is talking 
about having the same standard for everybody.
<P>
	I know that many members of our caucus intend to use that 
route once we are able to access our money that is being 
currently collected under the MP pension plan, the 11 per cent 
that is being deducted, to put it into RRSPs. Many of us have 
been doing that for a long time. I think it shows leadership in the 
fact that we are willing to look after our own retirement. That is 
what a lot of Canadians are going to have to do in the future, 
because the old age security plan and Canada pension plan are 
not sustainable. The reason they are not sustainable is that this 
country is in very serious financial problems.
<P>
	I know the Minister of Finance recognized that to some degree 
in his budget when he suggested that we need to cut $4 billion in 
services to Canadians. He also said we should raise a billion 
dollars in taxes. It was very interesting that in doing so we would 
almost expect the federal budget for this year to be decreased by 
$5 billion, the amount of those cuts and the extra money that is 
being raised. In fact, the budget is going to be higher by almost 
half a billion dollars. Why is that? It is because the interest on 
the debt is starting to be a very serious problem in this country. It 
is taking a larger and larger portion of our government budget.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	It is eating into those necessary services we are talking about, 
both the Canada pension plan and old age security. We need to 
encourage people to look after themselves through their own 
retirement savings. That does not mean the Government of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12182"> 12182 </A></B>
<P>
Canada is doing it for them, such as the MPs. It means that they 
look after  themselves through RRSPs and any other private plan 
they can put in place.
<P>
	I am going to wrap up here. To me, the most important thing is 
that the Canadian public will be the final judge of this plan. If 
cautions are going to be issued by members across the way in 
regard to the seriousness of opting out, we should also be 
cognizant that the Canadian public is watching very closely 
what is happening in this Chamber today during this debate on 
the MPs pension plan.
<P>
	The public wants a plan that is reasonable, that is consistent 
with national standards for both the public and private sectors, 
not anything MPs give themselves over and above what is the 
norm in Canadian society. The public will be the final judge next 
election day. I throw that out as a caution to members opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is always difficult to speak on a subject like this, 
especially if you try to defend the pension plan for members of 
Parliament. Your adversaries will always try to paint you as 
being self-serving.
<P>
	I have been in opposition. I know it is very easy for members 
of the Reform Party to stand and accuse anyone who might 
defend any elements of the pension plan as being self-serving 
and greedy. It does not take any bravery on their part to say the 
outrageous things they have said.
<P>
	The previous speaker just said that political life at one time 
was seen in a good light, that it was a noble calling, but not any 
more. I wonder why. It is because people from the political right, 
members of the Reform Party have made it their calling day in 
and day out, month in and month out, year in and year out to go 
around and say how bad politicians are, how bad this institution 
is, how bad democracy is. It is little wonder when a band of 
people like that goes around this country year in and year out bad 
mouthing this institution that some Canadians say: ``Gee, I 
guess it is true''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> It is true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> It is a sad comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> That is why they sent us here. You guys are 
never here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Do you want to listen to me or not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> It is because of you guys that we are here.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. It is unfortunate 
that the level of emotion remains extremely high. I ask you once 
again to remember that we are in the House of Commons. We 
have a high level of integrity toward one another. May I ask that 
we maintain a certain level of decorum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Madam Speaker, it is easy to attack the 
political profession. There are a lot of good people in this 
institution. I do not know the people from the Reform Party very 
well but I suspect there are some very good people over there as 
well. How can we move forward when people over and over 
again do everything they can to besmirch the political 
profession?
<P>
	There is one other point that I want to make. Members of the 
Reform Party constantly chant this line that the MPs pension 
plan is twice what is found in other sectors, particularly in the 
private sector. They never talk about the need for a package of 
remuneration for MPs.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	If MPs had a normal career, if MPs started at age 22 or 23 and 
were in their profession for 30 to 40 years, do we really think 
their pension plan would have to be much different from those in 
other sectors? Of course not.
<P>
	Why is our plan different? It is because most of us come to 
this career in our forties. For example, take someone who is in 
their forties. They have a family. They have children in school, 
perhaps in university. For them to come into public life we want 
them to give up their careers. We want them to give up their 
private pension plan. When they come into public life we want 
them to take all the risks and absolutely nothing will be done on 
the part of the Canadian government to assuage or mitigate the 
risk that they face.
<P>
	When banks arrive at loan rates they take risks into account. 
The Canadian public must do the same. I am trying to put the 
pension plan in context. This is the thing they never do. The 
member who just spoke should reflect on the points I have made 
and should stop bad mouthing this profession. This life is 
difficult enough without the kinds of contributions we get from 
those people over there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Madam Speaker, one of the comments by the 
member for Winnipeg-St. James was that year in and year out 
he has heard the Reform Party being cynical and talking about 
how bad politicians are in this country. It seems to me that we 
have not been around for all that long, but the Canadian public 
has had some cynicism with regard to politicians for quite a 
while. Probably a lot of that was during the time he was on this 
side of the House.
<P>
	The hon. member has a reputation for being one of the worst 
members in terms of attack, yet he is talking about the Reform 
Party. We hear personal attacks every day from him. I think he is 
totally out of line.
<P>
	If he did not want to run for office, nobody forced him. He can 
retire.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12183"> 12183 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak to Bill C-85 
dealing with MPs pensions.
<P>
	I am particularly pleased because it was the very first topic I 
addressed after I was elected, and the first time that I was in 
caucus. I am a strong supporter of reform of MPs pensions. I am 
a strong supporter of the red book commitments to that reform. I 
am also a strong believer in the fact that what MPs do is 
extremely important in a symbolic sense. It is very important 
that we lead by example.
<P>
	I want to speak principally today to the particularly stringent 
double dipping components of this legislation. They are much 
more stringent than I had envisaged when I first read the red 
book.
<P>
	Before I do that I would like to say that to me, one of the most 
critical things in giving some order to the MPs pension plan was 
to establish an age of retirement. It seems to me that no pension 
plan can be fully financially viable unless it has a fixed age of 
retirement. We cannot calculate, for example, how many MPs 
might retire at 25 or 30 or something like that. Therefore, it is 
critical for the financial viability of this plan that there be a 
reasonable retirement age.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I personally favour 65 as the retirement age. That is the 
normal retirement age for the Canada pension plan. I realize that 
in many occupations there are earlier retirement ages, and I 
realize that under some circumstances a person can draw CPP 
benefits before the age of 65. I feel that 65 is the most 
appropriate age for this plan.
<P>
	The establishment of 55 as a fixed age of retirement, as a fixed 
age at which a member of Parliament can draw this pension, is a 
huge step forward in giving the plan financial viability. I am 
very pleased that has been done.
<P>
	I also support the slower rates of accrual of the pension. The 
accrual results in a 20 per cent saving. It is important that the 
cost of this plan to the taxpayer be reduced.
<P>
	During the debate on double dipping it was pointed out that 
strong pension plans are a normal feature of employment in 
government service, whether that government service be at the 
local level, the provincial level or the federal level. It was often 
pointed out for example, that the military has a very strong 
pension plan which is designed to enable its members to retire 
early.
<P>
	It appears that re-employment of public service employees by 
the government after they have taken an early retirement is quite 
common. During the debate on double dipping it was pointed out 
that people in the public service everywhere have the 
opportunity of going back to work in the area from which they 
retired if there is a suitable vacancy. I do not want to open the 
entire question now, but I must say that I have some sympathy 
with that.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, of course, will have the floor 
immediately following question period.
<P>
	It being two o'clock, pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), we 
will now proceed to statements by members.

	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in the House today to congratulate Elspeth Hogg 
of Utterson in my riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka. Mrs. Hogg 
has been selected as one of just 23 recipients of the 1995 Canada 
volunteer award medal and certificate of honour for her 
contributions to her community.
<P>
	Mrs. Hogg is recognized for serving on the first board of the 
Muskoka Women's Advocacy Group and for serving as chair 
from 1984 to 1989. She is credited as instrumental in the 
establishment of Muskoka Interval House, a much needed 
women's shelter, and for recruiting countless volunteers and 
donators of supplies.
<P>
	In addition to this work, Mrs. Hogg served the Elizabeth Fry 
Society, the Hospital for Sick Children, the YWCA and the Boy 
Scouts as well as volunteering on boards such as the Canadian 
Corrections Association and the Canadian Mental Health 
Association.
<P>
	I wholeheartedly congratulate Mrs. Hogg for her tremendous

	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
clearly, the Minister of Human Resources Development has lost 
control of the Atlantic Groundfish Strategy. Not only is this 
strategy not creating jobs, but it is encouraging workers to quit 
their jobs to take advantage of the benefits of the program.
<P>
	Processing plants are complaining about the departure of a 
number of their employees and of the costs this entails. The 
minister prefers to stick his head in the sand and continue 
extolling the virtues of his program. The representatives of the 
fishermen even came to Ottawa last week to complain about the 
program's ineffectiveness.
<P>
	The minister must recognize that his program is not working, 
that he is gobbling up billions and that the federal government 
on its own is incapable of resolving the Atlantic fishing crisis.

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, millions of Canadians have just completed their 
income tax returns for yet another year. Every year families and 
individuals go through the tortuous process of calculating and 
completing their returns in a diligent and timely manner. The 
process has become so complex that millions are now frustrated 
by the exercise.
<P>
	Recently I received a call from a retired constituent who has 
become so frustrated that he has finally had to enlist the help of a 
tax professional to prepare his return.
<P>
	This practice is far from unique. Increasing numbers of 
Canadians seek outside assistance as they battle the ever 
increasing complexities of our national revenue labyrinth.
<P>
	Why should taxpayers, already at the limit of their tax 
tolerance, have to pay additional moneys for assistance in filing 
their tax returns?
<P>
	There is an urgent need to simplify the tax system. Reform's 
flat tax would do just that. It is fair, efficient, equitable, and 
would greatly ease the burden of the long suffering taxpayers of 
Canada.

	<B>Mr. Jag Bhaduria (Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville,

privilege of visiting India to meet with various senior 
government officials.
<P>
	India is a country that is growing rapidly. The economic 
development that I personally witnessed was phenomenal. The 
economy is booming at an extraordinary rate of 8 per cent per 
year. India is rapidly becoming an economic tiger of all 
developing countries.
<P>
	Throughout my meetings with cabinet ministers of the Indian 
government and the chief ministers of several important 
provinces the discussion always centred on developing closer 
trade ties between Canada and India. Canadian expertise and 
technology combined with India's pool of manpower would 
create tremendous job opportunities for both countries.
<P>
	This desire was not only expressed by senior politicians but 
by industrialists I had the pleasure to meet with as well. The 
interest is there, and I call on the government to work diligently 
toward developing an increased trade level with India. There are 
limitless opportunities and there can be no doubt that both 
countries will greatly benefit.

	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
tomorrow national Elizabeth Fry Week is being launched on 
Parliament Hill. It takes place every year, the week preceding 
Mother's Day, to acknowledge the fact that the majority of 
Canadian women who come into conflict with the law are 
mothers.
<P>
	This year the week's theme is alternatives to incarceration, 
focusing on new avenues in corrections for women and working 
to enhance public awareness and education regarding the 
circumstances of women involved in the criminal justice 
system.
<P>
	Most women at the time of their incarceration are the sole 
supporters of their families. When mothers are sentenced to 
prison their children are sentenced to separation. Elizabeth Fry 
Week ends on Mother's Day to draw attention to this reality.
<P>
	Let us show our support for the hard work of the volunteers 
and employees of the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry 
Societies. We are welcome to the Commonwealth Room 
tomorrow between 9 and 5 to talk about these important issues.
<P>
	I thank the volunteers for their dedication to justice in 
Canada.

	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
over 160 nations are currently meeting at the United Nations in 
New York to decide the fate of the most important international 
arms control agreement in force today, the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty, the NPT.
<P>
	Canada supports the indefinite unconditional extension of the 
treaty for three essential reasons. First, the NPT establishes a 
barrier to the further proliferation of nuclear weapons. Second, 
the treaty provides the framework for peaceful trade in nuclear 
technology by establishing a system of effective international 
safeguards. Third, the treaty commits the nuclear weapons 
states to work toward nuclear disarmament.
<P>
	Those who argue that the NPT should not be made permanent 
keep open the possibility of its disappearance at some future 
point. This must not happen. We are now firmly on the road to a 
world with fewer nuclear weapons.
<P>
	On Friday, Canada will table the resolution, joined by more 
than 80 nations, for the indefinite extension of the NPT. The 
treaty has served us well for 25 years. Now is the time to 
permanently enshrine the benefits for future generations.

Casino Band of Stratford, Ontario.
<P>
	Band members have enriched the lives of citizens for five 
decades with their musical talent. These musicians originally 
played for community dances in the 1940s but now perform 
voluntarily for events throughout my riding.
<P>
	The band can frequently be found performing at hospitals, 
nursing homes and various community events, including the 
Stratford Festival's annual garden party. For the past two 
summers the band has performed afloat on the Avon River for 
thousands of tourists who visit Stratford.
<P>
	These men should be commended for bringing such musical 
delight to our community. Not only is it one of the most talented 
jazz bands in Ontario but it is one of the most kind spirited.
<P>
	The members of the 1939 Casino Band include Jack Hayter, 
Jack Smith, Mervin Doerr, Robert Hayter, Bill Fowler, Walter

	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, 
the Standing Committee on Transport submitted its report on the 
national marine strategy. Disregarding the principles of caution 
and prevention with respect to the environment, the committee 
questioned compulsory pilotage, particularly in the St. 
Lawrence and in the Seaway.
<P>
	This proposal is contrary to the worldwide trend to expanding 
pilotage areas and raising safety standards. A catastrophe like 
that of the <I>Exxon Valdez</I> would be an environmental disaster for 
the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes.
<P>
	The Liberal majority on the Standing Committee on 
Transport, with its concern for cost cuts and free competition, 
has completely set aside environmental concerns. We hope that 
the Minister of the Environment will use her influence with the 
Minister of Transport to ensure his decisions reflect the 
principle of sustainable development.

worked hard, paid their taxes regularly and have been 
responsible Canadian citizens. Many of them fought in the 
second world war and risked their lives for each one of us to live 
in peace.
<P>
	These law-abiding citizens have paid their way. We have our 
health programs, UIC, workers' compensation and good 
working conditions today because this group of Canadians 
worked for them.
<P>
	We, the MPs of the 35th Parliament, have the opportunity to 
do what our constituents sent us here to do: to work together for 
the good of Canadians. I am speaking of an issue which is of 
importance to all our constituents, many of whom will be 
closely watching the results of our vote. It is a non-partisan

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is bad enough that the Liberal government is 
planning to privatize rather than rebuild and enhance the 
services of Canadian National Railway, but now we learn that 
the shameful privatization initiative will not have any foreign 
ownership limits imposed upon it.
<P>
	This obviously opens the doors for American ownership and 
control over our national railway, which until now has been the 
main economic link between eastern and western Canada and 
which has been a critically important player in the transport of 
grain to export positions.
<P>
	If Canadians lose control of this vital component of our 
transportation infrastructure, we will be forced by default to 
allow such things as a continental grain market, which in turn 
will lead to the demise of the Canadian Wheat Board, another 
Canadian institution worth fighting for.
<P>
	It appears the Liberals want to get rid of CN so badly that they 
are willing to sacrifice important and economically beneficial 
pieces of national identity. I call on the government to 
reconsider any rail line privatization plans, especially ones that 
do not limit foreign ownership.

mind the body will not thrive. That is why I inform the House 
that this week is Mental Health Week.
<P>
	During this week the Canadian Mental Health Association 
sponsors events across Canada to raise public awareness of 
mental health issues, to reduce the stigma of mental illness, and 
to encourage the acceptance of those who suffer from them. 
Health Canada supports the Canadian Mental Health 
Association through its grants to national voluntary health 
organizations.
<P>
	The theme of this year's campaign is social support. There is 
no denying that positive interaction among family members, 
friends and co-workers will help to prevent both mental and 
physical illness.

highlighting social support relating to stress, youth, physical 
health, the workplace and special needs in rural areas.

Canadian soldiers, sailors, air crew, nurses, the merchant marine 
and all who served in the frontlines in northwest Europe, Italy,

Speaker, yesterday, the Quebec minister responsible for

separation would have on companies with head offices in 
Quebec.
<P>
	The main finding is that 5,000 jobs currently located in these 
head offices could be moved out of the province if Quebec 
became independent. Once again, Montreal would be the hardest 
hit, since most corporate head offices are located in that region.
<P>
	As the study shows, Quebec's independence would be 
extremely costly to Montreal's economy. Quebecers are fed up

	However, since he took office, the Prime Minister keeps

rejected MIL Davie's recovery plan, and his government refuses 
to withdraw from the manpower sector, in spite of the plea made

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
Bill C-88, the Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation 
Act, the government is acting as though it is eager to impose 
sanctions in the case of trade disputes between two provinces. 
The bill provides that the federal government may cut off 
transfer payments and suspend subsidies to any province that 
fails to comply with the internal trade agreement.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Industry confirm that with the powers 
the federal government has assumed pursuant to Bill C-88, it 
will be able to suspend or reduce any contribution for social 
programs financing in the case of a province that does not 
comply with the agreement on internal trade?
<P>

Speaker, I could go along with the hon. member's suggestion, 
but the answer is no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if we 
read subclause 9(<I>d</I>), that is what it says. Since that is not the 
government's intention, I would like to ask the Minister of 
Industry whether he could make a clear commitment to amend 
the bill so as to exclude retaliatory measures in the form of 
suspending or reducing transfer payments for social programs 
financing in the case of a province that did not comply with the 
agreement.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I think the bill is quite clear. It concerns only the 
amendments required in federal jurisdictions to ensure that our 
statutes reflect our obligations under the agreement on internal 
trade.
<P>
	If the Bloc wishes to propose amendments, it will be able to 
do so in the course of the parliamentary process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to make this very clear. This week, when we were discussing 
cuts in social transfers, the Minister of Finance rose in the 
House and said that they were going to change the bill, that it is 
not what they wanted to do, although that is what it says in the 
bill.
<P>
	Today, the Minister of Industry tells us they do not want to cut 
social transfers to the provinces, although that is what it says.
<P>
	Would the minister agree that the retaliatory measures 
provided in Bill C-88 are so broad that they would allow the 
federal government to interfere in disputes that are, first and 
foremost, a matter between two provinces, disputes that are 
none of its 
<P>
<HR>

business, so that the federal government would be able to cut 
social transfers to the provinces as a retaliatory measure?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to make very clear what the federal 
government's position has been throughout the negotiations last 
year on the internal trade agreement and as we bring forward the 
legislation which will implement that agreement with respect to 
the federal level.
<P>
	We have entirely and totally pursued a process which is 
consensual. All 10 provinces signed the accord last July 18. The 
new Government of Quebec stressed at the one meeting which 
has been held since the most recent Quebec election that it is 
fully supportive of the internal trade agreement.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	This has been a process in which some have criticized the 
federal government for not using powers which it is said we 
might have. The fact is we prefer to see the regulation of internal 
trade, interprovincial trade, affected by agreement among the 
partners to Confederation. That is why we signed an internal 
trade agreement. That is the policy of the government and there 
is no further clarification required.

services provided to the unemployed, notably by closing down 
many employment centres in Quebec and Canada.

reform was to provide more effective and advanced services to 
the unemployed, and particularly to foster co-operation among 
all stakeholders, including unions, business people, provinces 
and municipalities, in order to fight unemployment and poverty.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
it is important for the minister to understand that we know about 
a project that will considerably reduce the number of 
employment centres throughout Canada and Quebec. We also 
know that there will be major layoffs in late May and that many 
places will have to make do with automated job banks.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Human Resources Development admit 
that unemployed workers outside the major centres will be the 
main victims of this reduction in services, as many of them will 
no longer have access to expert staff and will have to make do 
with machines?
<P>

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is getting 
highly agitated over a decision that has not yet been made. She 
has built in all kinds of assertions, assumptions, propositions, 
hypotheses, none of which she can bear out by any fact.
<P>
	The reality is that of course we are reorganizing. With the 
advent of new technologies by which we can share information 
much more effectively between centres, by decentralizing our 
programs so that we can work in partnership with local groups 
and not have to deliver through central bureaucracies we believe 
we can achieve a much more effective delivery of services to the 
people who need them.
<P>
	I am surprised. Here is an hon. member who in the past has 
given us grand declarations about the need to devolve and 
decentralize to community control and community operations. 
We are doing it and now she is complaining.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to National Sea Products, 25 of its fish 
processing workers have left full time jobs for assistance under 
the Atlantic groundfish strategy. That is TAGS, the 
government's $1.9 billion temporary aid package for 
unemployed fishermen and unemployed plant workers. National 
Sea alerted the human resources development department of this 
development on February 16 but has yet to receive a response 
from the federal government.
<P>
	My question for the minister is: How many of the 25 National 
Sea Products employees in Lunenburg were accepted into TAGS 
and what is the minister's response to this unsettling 
development?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question. Let there be no misunderstanding. Those who 
voluntarily quit their jobs are not eligible for TAGS. If they do 
so, I will disqualify them immediately.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the bottom line is that it would appear easier to qualify 
for assistance under TAGS than it is for unemployment 
insurance in Atlantic Canada. The fisheries workers with full 
time jobs are being induced to leave gainful private sector 
employment to take a chance on the government sponsored 
TAGS lottery. This effect is precisely the opposite of what TAGS 
was supposed to deliver.
<P>
	What is the minister's explanation for how this program, after 
all the time and thought that was supposedly given to it, could be 
having precisely the opposite effect of what was intended?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's 
question would be greatly helped if he knew something about 
the program and did not simply get his information from the 
front page of a central Canada newspaper.
<P>
	Up to the first nine months of operations we have received 
over 52,000 applications. Thirteen thousand have been rejected 
because they were not eligible. It is not an easy get-on. 
Applicants must demonstrate a long term attachment to the 
fishery, which is a very clear requirement. They have to have 
actual weeks of employment in the fishery to determine it. If 
there are other criteria that are objected to, we will not accept it.
<P>
	I have just told the hon. member that I will not accept abuse of 
the program. If anyone tries to get around the rules and tries to 
apply for TAGS when they are not eligible, I will disqualify 
them from the program. If the hon. member has any actual 
information, I would be glad to receive it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the minister's statements are accurate, one wonders 
how this program can already be $400 million underfunded 
because the demand is higher than what was expected. When 
this program was announced, the minister said it would serve as 
a test case for the government's new approach to social 
assistance from dependence on government to independence 
through training.
<P>
	Price Waterhouse and now National Sea Products have 
provided evidence that this Ottawa originated social 
megaproject approach to unemployment simply does not work. 
The minister has been listening to the voices of 1960s Liberals 
and tired old bureaucrats when he should  have been listening to 
the people of Atlantic Canada and to fresh thinking on social and 
economic development.
<P>
	Given the problem identified by National Sea Products and 
given the advice by the government's own paid consultants, will 
the minister commit to rethinking completely his entire 
approach to the social and economic crisis in Atlantic Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this question comes from 
an hon. member whose party just recently put out a statement 
that it would eliminate about $12 billion from social programs. 
That would force most of the people in Atlantic Canada into 
abject and utter poverty.
<P>
	The program has been in place for nine months. In that nine 
months we have received 52,000 applications; 40,000 people 
have been processed; 26,000 have been given basic benefits; 
15,000 are on well-designed training programs; and over 1,000 
are working on conservation resource projects. This is in the 
first nine months.
<P>
	We do not deny it was an enormous and difficult task to try to 
rescue an entire industry that has collapsed in that region, but at 
least we are trying. We are working with the people of Atlantic 
Canada. We are relying on their resourcefulness, not the kind of 
negative 18th century thinking of the hon. member.

<P>
	In this House yesterday, in answer to my question regarding 
Colonel Oehring's report, the Minister of National Defence 
claimed that he had already answered the same question in reply 
to the Reform Party. Once again, the minister was mistaken. The 
Reform Party was concerned with Brigadier-General Jeffries'

stated that military personnel were consulting chaplains and 
psychiatrists more often and that a lack of leadership had 
resulted in an increase in the number of suicides.

	I know the member for Saanich-Gulf Islands, the Reform

either in question period or in debate. That does not mean to say 
we minimize some of the concerns in Colonel Oehring's report, 
which was not scientific but which did outline some of the 
difficult problems faced by members of the Canadian Armed 
Forces.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is unlikely that this was discussed last autumn, because Colonel 
Oehring's report was only issued in December 1994 while the 
Reform Party's questions date back to March 15, 1995.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that, in this report, of which he was 
obviously unaware yesterday and still is today, one of his

is that the minister is not fulfilling his responsibilities?

<P>
	The report was unscientific, some findings by a colonel who 
had some concerns about problems of morale in the forces. It

the problem. He did not know that all through 1994 immigration 
officials had been identifying people in Sri Lanka who had 
refugee status in Canada.
<P>
	Was the minister aware that bogus refugees were being 
identified in Sri Lanka? If he was, why did he not do anything 
about it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member just said bogus 
refugees in Sri Lanka. The member cannot prove that individual 
refugee claims that may have been placed years ago were bogus. 
People were accepted as refugee claimants, became landed 
residents and ultimately became Canadian citizens. They had 
the ability to travel and with different clans persecuting other 
clans, circumstances changed. Conditions do change.
<P>
	If a person makes a refugee claim, is granted asylum as a 
refugee and immediately turns around and goes into the area 
where he or she had been persecuted, of course I do not condone 
that. In fact applications have been revoked for that very reason.
<P>
	However, one cannot in perpetuity suggest that somehow a 
refugee claimant at one point in time is not permitted to travel to 
any other part of the country. A number of legitimate refugee 
claimants take their security into their own hands. It may be 
because they have to go back to bury their mother or father. They 
may want to go back to take possession of the homes and 
<P>

properties that were confiscated when they were persecuted. 
There are a lot of mitigating circumstances and we should not 
draw blanket conclusions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canada's humanitarian missions should be to seek out the needy 
and weed out abusers. Too bad the minister does not share that 
vision. His compassion extends to special interests and only 
second to real refugees.
<P>
	If the minister did not know about the Sri Lankan abuse then 
what about the 380 Israeli claimants from democratic Israel who 
were accepted as refugees in Canada by his friends at the IRB?
<P>
	When will this minister wake up, stop the abuse and protect 
real refugees who are being bumped back in the queue by these 
frauds? Quit talking and do your job.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask members to please address the 
Chair in all of the questions and in the answers.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the problem with members of 
the Reform Party is they subscribe to jungle justice. Moments 
ago we heard from a member who undermined an entire 
organization operating in Canada because of guilt by 
association. If a person from the legion in British Columbia is 
guilty, does that mean we should say the entire legion is guilty? 
If a Canadian of Italian extraction commits a crime does the 
whole community have to pay?

	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
recently the provincial NDP government in Ontario wrote to 833 
municipalities and alleged the federal government was not 
following through on the financial commitments of the 
infrastructure program.
<P>
	I can tell the House the letter from NDP minister Ed Philip 
created a great deal of concern among mayors and municipal 
councils in the province.
<P>
	Can the minister tell me what steps have been taken to 
reassure Ontario's municipalities of the federal government's 
intentions regarding the Canada-Ontario infrastructure works 
program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the program was progressing quite well until the 
minister of municipal affairs of Ontario put out a letter which 
consisted of scaremongering in the information it put in front of 
many municipalities.
<P>
	As a result of that I have today released a statement jointly 
with the Association of Municipalities of Ontario which 
indicates quite clearly that municipalities in Ontario can and 
should proceed with their projects.
<P>
	The bottom line in the statement is this. No one should be 
holding back on tenders or contracts because they are unsure the 
federal government will live up to its commitments under the 
infrastructure works program. If a project has been approved, 
they can be absolutely sure the Government of Canada will meet 
all of its obligations and pay its share on time.

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a

the Minister of Transport wrote, and I quote: ``At a time when 
restructuring has made it necessary for CN to cut personnel, the 
company could hardly be expected to spend substantial sums of 
money out of mere aesthetic considerations''.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Transport claim that the maintenance 
of a major structure that is part of the railway network is merely 
a matter of aesthetics, when rust is eating away at the structure, 
which is bound to shorten its life expectancy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, to answer the hon. member's question, we would not 
want to give the impression that the bridge is not safe. All these 
structures are checked regularly to ensure they are in proper 
shape to do the job for which they were built.
<P>
	I know there is a problem with the bridge, especially the way 
it looks, and we intend to ensure that, as far as safety is 
concerned, there is no problem. However, I would not want to 
give the impression that for some reason, because of our concern 
about CN's finances or for some other reason, the bridge is not 
absolutely safe.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Transport. Three weeks ago the 
Minister of Transport stated that he was not prepared to put a 
cent into the port of Belledune as far as a grant was concerned 
any more than he would put grant money into the port of Saint 
John or anywhere else.
<P>
	This week we have discovered that a $5.8 million grant was 
transferred from the federal government to the port of 
Belledune.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	How can the minister justify giving a $5.8 million grant to the 
port of Belledune when a loan of $20 million has already been 
authorized to develop the port of Belledune and it has received 
almost $6 million from the provincial government as well?
<P>
	Would the Minister of Transport please tell us how he can 
justify this when it is against his policy as stated by him three 
weeks ago?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what I stated and what I will continue to maintain is 
that Transport Canada is not in the subsidies business.
<P>
	What I want to explain to the hon. member is we have 
responsibilities for ports across the country. The Standing 
Committee on Transport has come forward with some 
recommendations which we will study very carefully.
<P>
	We will continue to make sure ports like Saint John, Halifax, 
Vancouver and others have the facilities required to be able to 
conduct their business.
<P>
	With respect to the situation at Belledune, it is a wonderful 
precedent that the Government of New Brunswick, the 
Government of Canada, Ports Canada and local municipalities 
are all contributing to the enhancement of the facilities at that 
port.
<P>
	While we are making a loan of $20 million through Ports 
Canada to the port of Belledune, I want to reassure the hon. 
member that although the authorities at Belledune believe they 
can repay the loan I will take into account the request from Saint 
John to not have to repay the loan for $20 million we have 
already made to it.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order today arising out of question 
period. I do so with some reluctance. This practice has 
continued now for some time and I want to draw to the House's 
attention and also to Your Honour the rules in respect of 
question period which do apply and which I think are relevant 
when the opposition considers questions it wishes to ask in the 
House.
<P>
	This afternoon, Sir, you ruled a question or two out of order 
and I want to draw to your attention the provisions in citation 
409 in Beauchesne:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1975, the Speaker expressed in general principles in order to clarify the 
regulations and restrict the negative qualifications which traditionally have 
guided the Question Period.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On that occasion the Speaker said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A brief question seeking information about an important matter of some 
urgency which falls within the administrative responsibility of the government 
or of the specific minister to whom it is addressed, is in order.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on under number (12):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Questions should not anticipate a debate scheduled for the day but should be 
reserved for the debate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That view was reinforced by a ruling by the Speaker in 1986 
and which is quoted in citation 410 of the sixth edition of 
Beauchesne:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1986 the Speaker put forth further views in light of more recent conditions 
and precedents. It was observed that-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I need not repeat the entire citation but I turn to paragraph (14) 
thereof:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Questions should not anticipate an order of the day although this does not 
apply to the budget process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I know hon. members opposite would like me to dispense with 
reading these important practices of the House. They have been 
rigorously enforced for many years. I know Your Honour in 
seeking to enforce them today was acting in the very best 
traditions of the House.
<P>
	I can only urge Your Honour to continue to do so with vigour 
and ensure practices outlined in 1975 and 1986 are adhered to by 
the opposition.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very disconcerted by the words of the hon. 
parliamentary secretary for the government House leader.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12196"> 12196 </A></B>
<P>
	There are two points that I would like to make. First, I have 
observed in the House in past debates, one example being a 
question on Bill C-76 about deliberations in committee, 
abrogating the rules, that the hon. member was not concerned 
with that matter whatsoever.
<P>
	Members on the government side have challenged the results 
of votes in the House. That is against the rules and that has not 
been challenged. More important, the hon. member for Beaver 
River in her question did not deal specifically with the bill under 
debate today but rather the agenda of the government which was 
brought forward in discussion papers and in the bill being 
debated today. She did not speak specifically to the bill. She did 
not mention the bill. She talked about something the 
government has been putting forward for debate for some weeks 
or even months.
<P>
	I do not understand why some in the House can specifically 
speak of bills by name which are under debate in committee or in 
the House with no challenge when the hon. member for Beaver 
River spoke in a general way about the agenda of the 
government and was not permitted to complete her question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the two points raised by the 
hon. House leader across the way. First, the citation in question 
in Beauchesne specifically excludes the budget. Therefore the 
allegation that this should have been applied to the motion to 
discuss the main budget bill does not at all have anything to do 
with the issue now before the House.
<P>
	Second, the issue in question is further complicated by the 
fact the hon. member who asked this question earlier today 
specifically about the content, the main subject, dare I say, of 
the bill now before the House being debated this day in 
contravention of the citation has also proposed a motion today in 
the House to amend the bill now before the House. She was 
debating her own motion at the time we are speaking of which 
further strengthens the point raised by the hon. parliamentary 
secretary.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I do not want a debate back and forth. When 
hon. members are on their feet and want to speak on a point of 
order, as much as possible their arguments should be contained 
in the time they are on their feet.
<P>
	I will allow the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster 
to make a brief statement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I do want to 
respond to what the government whip mentioned.
<P>
	We were not talking about a debate on the budget, we were 
talking about a specific bill, the Budget Implementation Act, 
which is a bill like all others, which was specifically mentioned 
in the House and was not challenged by the government side or 
by the Chair. It was much more specific than what the hon. 
member for Beaver River said in her question.
<P>
	I believe the hon. member for Beaver River acted properly 
according to the rules and I ask hon. members on the opposite 
side to recognize that.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, you have left decisions to the 
Chair to be made in the course of question period and in the 
course of debate. I am well aware of the quotations cited by both 
sides from Beauchesne. As much as possible, in the course of 
question period I have tried to give as much latitude as I can to 
members asking questions and to members giving answers.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	If you are to challenge your Speaker every time I make a 
ruling in the House, I make the ruling with the very best of 
intentions, that the rules be followed. If you wish to pursue this 
conversation with me, I invite you to come into my chambers. 
For today from my point of view from what I heard, I permitted 
the first question from the member because although I thought it 
was borderline it was general enough to be asked. In my view the 
second question was out of order. I ruled it as such.
<P>
	If every time I make a decision on our behalf as to make the 
House function we will be coming into these points of order, we 
will be using a great deal of time.
<P>
	On the other hand, I recognize we have legitimate points of 
order, perhaps every day. I am always willing to listen. I beg you 
to give your Speaker enough latitude to conduct question period 
as it should be.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order under Standing Order 37.
<P>
	Today we raised a serious question about the sexual abuse of 
children on a reserve in Quebec. I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to agree 
contempt was shown to Parliament by not only the 
parliamentary secretary who made light of the question but the 
government side members who laughed in derision on this very 
serious issue regarding the sexual abuse of children.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In response to a question an hon. member 
spoke in another language. There is no rule I know of that says 
we cannot speak in other than either of the two languages.
<P>
	It makes it more difficult for us to understand but what I heard 
from the hon. member was that he would take the question under 
advisement.
<P>
	As to any other reaction, the Chair has 294 reactions to 
virtually every question and answer given. I do not find a 
question of contempt of Parliament in this issue. I thought it was 
in the normal course of give and take and that is why I did not 
intervene.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MEMBERSOFPARLIAMENTRETIRING<BR>ALLOWANCESACT">MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT RETIRING<BR>
ALLOWANCES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-85, an act to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act and to provide for the continuation of a certain 
provision, be read the second time and referred to a committee; 
and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Peterborough has approximately 17 minutes remaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
the break for question period I was speaking to Bill C-85 which 
is designed to reform the pensions of senators and members of 
the House of Commons. I was making the point that I was 
pleased by the fact the double dipping provision was so strong in 
the proposed legislation.
<P>
	Previously I mentioned other aspects of the bill which I am 
sure will be addressed by other members. I should like to spend 
the time remaining to me dealing with double dipping. I begin 
by placing on the record a definition of the term double dipping, 
which has become so widespread in recent months.
<P>
	When I speak of double dipping I refer to the practice whereby 
a former member of the House of Commons or a senator 
simultaneously draws a pension under the Members of 
Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and is paid in respect of 
employment or an appointment or a contract for services by the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	In the changes in Bill C-85 the government is carrying 
through on the promise made in the red book to end the practice 
of double dipping. Canadians have made it very clear that they 
find the practice unacceptable. In response to this criticism the 
government announced early in its mandate that amendments 
would be made to the pension arrangements for MPs to put a 
stop to double dipping.
<P>
	Before we look at the actual proposals in Bill C-85 I should 
like to say a few more words about the public's concern about 
former members appointed by the federal government to jobs 
that some might characterize as being in the gift of the 
government. These so-called appointments are within the 
control of every government. The government has recognized 
that the public views the appointment of a former MP in receipt 
of a pension to a position of this nature with a good deal of 
concern.
<P>
	In this context members present today may wish to take note 
of the fact that in the case of a number of recent appointments 
made by the government, appointees who are also former 
members of Parliament have either taken salary cuts in their new 
jobs or have made a gift of their pensions to the crown. In the 
practical day to day sense the double dipping terms of the new 
legislation have already been put into practice by the 
government.
<P>
	The government takes the concerns of Canadians so seriously 
on the issue that it is putting an end to double dipping even 
though some view pension entitlements as an earned or accrued 
right. Viewed as an earned entitlement, some pension experts 
believe that subsequent employment should have no effect on an 
individual's pension.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12198"> 12198 </A></B>
<P>
	However the government accepts the public's concern 
regarding the issue and realizes that pensions for former 
members are and must be viewed in a different light. As I 
mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, I believe the 
symbolism of what members of Parliament do is very important.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	It would be instructive to begin our examination of the double 
dipping proposals in Bill C-85 by looking at what type of 
re-employment will be subject to the new rules. The proposals 
in the bill are very inclusive. If a former MP entitled to a pension 
becomes employed in any capacity by the federal crown or by a 
crown or departmental corporation, the former member is 
required to report that he or she has obtained the employment. In 
addition, the report that is made must also reveal how much 
remuneration will be paid in respect of the employment.
<P>
	Perhaps at this point I should say a few words about the 
reporting system, the system of monitoring whether a former 
member becomes re-employed in the federal sector. The same 
system applies to a former member who is appointed to a 
position or obtains a federal contract. It is built upon 
self-reporting. It is the responsibility of the former member 
appointed or employed to report that it has occurred and how 
much remuneration is attached to the job. The government has 
no desire to see a huge bureaucracy built up in an attempt to 
monitor the activities of former MPs.
<P>
	I should like to make one more digression. When I refer to 
crown corporations and departmental corporations it might be 
useful for members of the public if I gave an example of each, 
just to give some idea of the breadth of the new prohibition on 
double dipping.
<P>
	Canada Post is an example of a crown corporation and the 
Atomic Energy Control Board is an example of a departmental 
corporation. These are the crown corporations that will be 
covered by the bill. As I said, the same reporting requirement 
applies to any appointment of a former MP in the federal public 
sector, that is any appointment under the auspices of the federal 
crown including crown corporations and departmental 
corporations. An appointment to judicial office would be 
included, as would be an appointment to diplomatic office.
<P>
	Any appointment that may be made by the governor in council 
is included. Any appointment to any board, tribunal, agency or 
commission in the public sector is regarded as an appointment to 
which the double dipping provisions of Bill C-85 will apply.
<P>
	Finally, it should be noted that any contract for services 
entered into by a former MP with the federal crown is also 
covered by the amendments in Bill C-85. The former MP will be 
required to report that the contract has been entered into and 
how much remuneration will be paid in respect of the services to 
be rendered under the contract.
<P>
	I should also add a further point with regard to the issue of 
contracts to illustrate how far reaching the pension reforms are. 
The bill goes one step further than just mandating that a contract 
between a former MP and the federal crown, broadly defined, 
must be reported. The bill also includes a provision that seeks to 
prevent a former MP from establishing a corporation, 
association, partnership or other entity which then concludes a 
contract for services with the government for the purposes of 
avoiding the application of the new double dipping prohibition.
<P>
	To that end, where a former MP controls a corporation, 
association or like entity and the entity enters into a contract 
with the federal crown, Bill C-85 deems that contract to have 
been entered into by the former MP. As well, the remuneration 
the former MP must report is deemed, in the words of Bill C-85, 
``to equal the amount of the salary, fees and other compensation 
paid to the former member for or in respect of the services 
provided by the former member under that contract''.
<P>
	Moving on to the subject of remuneration received in respect 
of employment, appointment or contract, it must be said that the 
net under the legislation is cast very wide. All remuneration that 
comes in whole or in part out of the consolidated revenue fund is 
caught by the proposals of Bill C-85.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	In addition, any remuneration paid out of moneys 
appropriated by Parliament is also included as remuneration that 
must be reported if it is paid to a former MP entitled to a pension 
under the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act 
because the former member has obtained employment, an 
appointment or a contract with the federal crown.
<P>
	While the aim of the bill is to cast a wide net in an effort to put 
an end to double dipping, it is not the government's intention to 
eliminate the practice in a way that will be unfair to former 
members in receipt of a pension who obtained employment, 
were appointed to a position, or entered into a contract for 
services prior to the coming into force of the amendments.
<P>
	Perhaps I should mention that the amendments will come into 
force only when Bill C-85 is approved by both Houses of 
Parliament and given royal assent.
<P>
	Another issue of fairness is raised by the amendments. I am 
referring to the trigger that will activate the double dipping 
prohibition as proposed in Bill C-85. Previous private 
members' bills that dealt with the issue of double dipping would 
have caused former members to lose entitlement to their 
pensions if they were in receipt of any remuneration from the 
federal crown.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12199"> 12199 </A></B>
<P>
	This would mean that the entire pension would be suspended 
or abated if a former member earned as little as a dollar a day as 
a result of employment or appointment. One day's per diem 
from a part time position would have had this draconian effect.
<P>
	The government felt that would be very unfair. Therefore the 
amendments proposed in Bill C-85 have set a ceiling of $5,000. 
If a former member earns remuneration of less than $5,000 a 
year, there will be no reduction in his or her pension. If more 
than $5,000 is earned the pension will be abated dollar for 
dollar.
<P>
	The proposal put forth in Bill C-85 is reasonable and allows a 
former member to earn $5,000 before the double dipping 
provision is triggered. This will allow a former member to take a 
very short term appointment or a part time position and suffer no 
pension loss.
<P>
	Bill C-85 provides regulations to be made to facilitate the 
pension reduction. In particular, there will be provision for the 
recovery of pension overpayments since it is quite likely that 
where reductions must be made in a former member's pension 
the actual reduction may not be made at the exact point when the 
former member commenced to receive remuneration from 
employment, an appointment or a contract.
<P>
	I repeat that the government believes the proposals in Bill 
C-85, which will put an end to double dipping, are fair and 
effective. They are not retroactive because it would not be fair to 
change the rules of the game halfway through the game.
<P>
	The proposals also allow a former member to receive a small 
amount of remuneration without pension penalty. I think 
members present will agree that the government has cast a wide 
net in its efforts to put to an end double dipping. It has been 
responsive to the concerns of members of the public who made it 
very clear that they do not approve of the practice.
<P>
	Immediately following the election I followed pension reform 
very carefully. I am glad the government has now moved to meet 
its red book commitments. The double dipping component of the 
legislation, which I have just described, actually goes beyond 
what I envisaged was the commitment in the red book. I am 
delighted to see that.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	For myself, as I mentioned at the very beginning of my 
remarks before the break, I do think that thought should be given 
to the matter of double dipping in the broadest public sector, 
elected and unelected officials at the local, provincial, and the 
federal level. I am delighted that in this legislation we members 
of Parliament in the federal House have moved to set an example 
in that direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
quick comment about the concept of changing the rules of the 
game.
<P>
	I was approached by a gentleman in my constituency who 
would be in his early seventies and who retired from a coal mine 
also in my constituency. In good faith, he had paid into a pension 
plan, as had the company. Unfortunately, the company went 
bankrupt, and due to a number of different issues it turned out 
that the pension plan ended up being completely underfunded. 
Now that was not very fair. Here is a gentleman who was 
enjoying a modest income who suddenly dropped down to about 
$100 a month in his pension, where he had in good faith during 
his working life paid into that. It was absolutely and totally 
outside of his control.
<P>
	I raise that as a point of interest to the member. Very 
frequently we have seen politicians who have said this is out of 
our control, or the people retired previously, so it must be fair, 
and so on and so forth. Well doggone it, unfortunately, in 
Canada, as everywhere in the world, there are an awful lot of 
things that happen that are unfair. So to just dismiss the idea of 
not looking at those who have retired and not asking if there is 
some fair and equitable way to put an end to the countless 
millions of dollars that are being paid out to them and in a fair 
way to reimburse them and then let them get on with their lives 
so that Canadian people can get on with their lives, maybe that is 
something that should be looked at.
<P>
	I would be interested to know what, in his former life, the 
member did for a living. Listening to him, I assume that he must 
have been a professor of very dry subjects or a lawyer or 
somebody who loves to use 75-cent words all strung out in a 
long row when talking about the double dipping and all the 
issues involved in the legislation.
<P>
	This act that is being brought forward by the government is 
attempting to cover every single, solitary eventuality. In fact, I 
believe that what the people in Canada are saying is they do not 
think politicians should be able to put themselves in some kind 
of unique category and unique classification.
<P>
	Would he not agree that the people of Canada would accept, 
instead of a three to one or a four to one or a five to one payment 
on their part to what the politicians are going to be putting in, the 
idea of an industry standard of one for one? If the politician puts 
in $5 the people of Canada put in $5, instead of the politician 
putting in $5 and the people of Canada having to cough up $20, 
which is what this legislation still calls for.
<P>
	Would he not agree that it would be the simplest thing in the 
world to wipe out what is presently in existence relative to the 
pension plans and come back with a program that would say that 
the politicians may, for every $1 they put in, up to a particular 
limit, be matched by $1 from the taxpayer? Then we do not need 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12200"> 12200 </A></B>
<P>
to worry about double dipping, triple dipping, or any other kind 
of ice cream dipping. It does not make any difference,  because 
in fact then the person would be in charge of their own destiny 
and would be out of the pockets of ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great sympathy to 
the first part of the member's remarks about the miner he 
described and the unfairness of that particular case. My 
response to him on that, while I have great sympathy for that 
situation, is that quite simply two wrongs do not make a right. 
Because there has been one unfairness, I think it is important 
that wherever we can we try to avoid creating further unfairness.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	On retroactivity in this case, if we went back to all the former 
members of this House who are now out in the workplace, we 
would find some who have returned to the public service. They 
could be former bureaucrats who have gone back into the 
bureaucracy; they could be people on appointments; they could 
be people on contracts; and so on. Some of those people may 
have moved from western Canada to Ottawa and made 
complicated family and financial commitments. Therefore, to 
undo their financial base at this time would be truly unfair. By 
the way, it would also be a great complication if we were to think 
of complicated legislation.
<P>
	As to his question about my profession and the matter of 
dealing in dry subjects, I was a professor, but not of dry subjects. 
My field of research was ice, and I worked in the area of 
hydrology, so the work I did was really quite wet. My research 
was on ice and I worked on sea ice and lakes in all parts of the 
north. For example, I worked on the effect of ice on fish. 
However, I moved away from that type of work to skating on 
thin ice in this House. I would also say to the hon. member that 
my remuneration has changed considerably, and considerably 
for the worse.
<P>
	Having said all of that, I do not apologize for trying to explain 
legislation as well as I can to members of this House and to the 
people of Canada. We all have difficulty reading bills and 
reading the acts that govern this country. I understand why they 
have to be written very carefully and in very precise legal 
language, because of precedents and the way the courts will 
have to interpret them and so on. I would say to the hon. member 
in all sincerity that I think one of our duties is to try to explain 
legislation to the best of our ability, whatever our abilities are, 
to the people of Canada. That is what I was trying to do in the 
area of double dipping.
<P>
	As all members know, we cannot control the future through 
written legislation. However, as far as is humanly possible this 
legislation with respect to double dipping is written to try to 
prevent people from getting around it, which unfortunately all 
sorts of people appear to do with our legislation.
<P>
	I do not apologize for trying to explain legislation to the 
people of Canada to the limits of my ability.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was not intending to be critical of 
the hon. member's explanation of all of this verbiage that is 
contained in the agreement, although with his reference to ice I 
must say that a lot of people in Canada think that legislation 
typically goes through the House at the speed of a glacier, so 
there is some connection with ice there.
<P>
	However, my question still is that rather than having a whole, 
long, complicated document that the member has to stand up 
and, to the best of his ability, explain, why is it not just wiped 
out? Why do we not just match one for one? Why do we not go to 
an industry standard? Why does he not put down his $5, I will 
put down my $5, and the Canadian taxpayers can put down their 
$5?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do have sympathy with the remark 
regarding this House sometimes moving at glacial speed. I know 
it does. I think that all members have been frustrated from time 
to time. One of the reasons for that is the system of enormous 
checks and balances that are placed on us.
<P>
	I would point out to the member, and perhaps we can discuss 
this afterward, that it is my hope that this legislation moves 
through at the rate of a glacier surge. If the member does not 
know what surging glaciers are, there are about 200 glaciers in 
the world that are moving at a speed that for glaciers is quite 
catastrophic. It is my hope that this legislation will move at least 
at that speed.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not intend 
to talk about glaciers. I do not intend to talk about all of the 
aspects of C-85 either.
<P>
	I heard a number of comments prior to question period, 
particularly from the member for St. Boniface, which I believe 
have to be answered. Accusations were made that many of us on 
this side of the House ran for some fairly questionable reasons. 
We have heard that a lot of times. Maybe we should just go back 
and review very quickly why most of us on this side of the House 
ran and I am sure on that side of the House also ran.
<P>
	Certainly we were concerned about the debt and deficit. It is 
only fair to say that when we looked back at 1984 we thought 
that a change had to be made. We were at $180 billion. We had 
someone who promised he would take care of it. By 1988 he did 
take care of it. We were at $375 billion, and we were told it was 
still a problem. By the time we got to 1993 we were at $489 
billion and then we really knew we did have a big problem.
<P>
	An awful lot of us got involved back in that 1988 period 
because we saw not only this debt and deficit, but we saw 
corruption, mismanagement, waste, and a government that was 
not listening to the people. We saw that by not listening it meant 
that a message would come down from on high and go back to 
the riding and we would be told what was good for us from the 
party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12201"> 12201 </A></B>
<P>
	The message was always going the wrong way, and the people 
desperately wanted to be heard. What they wanted to be heard 
was that they wanted to end so many of those things. They 
wanted to end the perks and the gold plated pension plan, which 
became a battle cry for citizens out there who were looking at 
that and asking what it meant.
<P>
	They also were fighting the arrogance this place had. I would 
say that a lot has improved here, but certainly what we saw in 
question period today was not an improvement. We had a 
question answered in another language and everyone was 
laughing and cheering about it. That is arrogance and disrespect 
for this place. If that sort of thing continues the people will 
speak again. We can count on that.
<P>
	We have problems in this country. The debt and deficit of 
course are getting worse. We have a criminal justice system that 
is in decay. The people are demanding change. They are asking 
about young offenders, parole, victims' rights, the time taken by 
the courts, the crime and the law and order out there. They are 
asking what the government is doing and if it is listening.
<P>
	Instead, the government is fooling around with things like gun 
control and its own selfish, greedy pensions. That is what the 
government is wasting time on in this House. The public is 
listening and evaluating what this House is doing on that matter. 
They demand parliamentary reforms. They demand that we do 
something about that other place over there, that waste of money 
and time that we have. They demand that they are able to recall 
and fire an MP who does not do his job. They demand that they 
can talk on social issues and that we bring them back to them and 
speak for them. They demand in fact that people have the right in 
this place to have free votes. They demand that if they tell their 
member to vote against something a party whip should not be 
able to whip him into shape so that he has to go along with party 
lines or lose his committee position and position in this place 
because they go against the party, the almighty party from 
Ottawa that tells you what you have to do when you get home.
<P>
	The government is not listening.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am quite aware that 
there are some very strongly held views in any debate, this one 
certainly not being the exception. But I would remind 
colleagues on both sides of the House from all parties that all 
interventions be made through the chair and through the Speaker 
and not directly to you or whomever else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I maintain that the 
government is not listening. It is not listening on the young 
offenders, on crime control, on victims' rights. And it is not 
listening on pensions for the MPs.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	We heard them, certainly in the dribble that was spewed out 
by the member for Winnipeg St. James. He talked about why 
politicians have such a low profile. He said that the people on 
this side are the ones that keep talking about it. That is not true. 
It is the people that are talking about it.
<P>
	Ironically, a letter was delivered to me in the House just now 
from a constituent of mine. Parts of it might convey the 
message. It was sent as an open letter to the Prime Minister:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As one of your employers, I expect Canada to be managed by real leaders 
worthy of trust. In the 1993 election campaign you promised to restore integrity 
to government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where's the integrity in your MP pension reform, especially in light of your 
recent budget? You promised to reform pensions, then made only minor changes 
that don't come close to bringing MP pensions into line with pensions like mine. I 
have to save for my retirement and can't even depend on Canada Pension Plan any 
more, yet politicians get pensions that I pay for. Worse yet, many of your cabinet 
colleagues and long-sitting MPs manage to get away with no changes whatsoever 
to their original pensions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think that says an awful lot.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If we must expect less, shouldn't our leaders also expect less? You promised 
integrity, but we see business as usual. Patronage continues, spending is out of 
control, and promised reforms and action plans have only meant discussion 
papers or empty words.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is from someone at that grassroots level and it explains 
why people do not trust politicians. Let us look at other reasons 
they do not trust politicians. We have all read the books <I>On the 
Take</I> and <I>Beyond the Law</I>. We read that stuff and we see what 
kinds of things have happened in this place.
<P>
	In the <I>Hill Times</I> the chairman of the committee I am on, the 
member for Rosemont, although he is misquoted a little, says 
that the joint foreign affairs committee had an $800,000 budget. 
He said: ``Most committee chairs overestimate their budgets for 
the year. You do not know how much you need so you pad 
everything like mad''. That is what people are seeing. That is 
why people are asking questions and that is why politicians get a 
bad name.
<P>
	We are talking about savings and pensions for people. One of 
the biggest problems Canada has is that its people have about 7 
per cent savings to the GDP. Countries like Chile have 25 per 
cent. Many of the countries in the Orient have savings higher 
than that. That is what provides stability for a country. People 
see politicians not taking care of those kinds of things. We 
should be encouraging people to save through RRSPs to build 
that savings level, so that money is invested in Canadians.
<P>
	The GST is a good example of what we are talking about now. 
A party decided the GST was good for people. You MPs that 
were here then should take that home-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12202"> 12202 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I caution the House and I 
remind all members that all interventions must be made through 
the Chair. If I can be more direct, the word ``you'' in reference to 
any other member of the House will not be accepted by the Chair 
in this debate or in any other situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> MPs were told to take the GST back to 
their constituents and tell them how well it would work and how 
it was best for them. Mr. Speaker, you saw what happened when 
MPs went back and told the people that the top down message 
was the way to go. The message was loud and clear. It is not us 
across here that are giving politicians a bad name.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	It is one of many things that have happened. Take the example 
of gun control. Gun control is being dealt with as a message 
from on high. What do the people want? People want crime 
control. They are not asking for gun control.
<P>
	I come now to pensions. What is being done with this 
pension? The people of Canada do not mind paying the salaries 
of those members of Parliament who do the job for them. I have 
not heard much complaint about the salaries. However, they 
expect the pension to be the same as they can get in industry. 
That is all they are asking. If that were the case, I do not think 
there would be a problem.
<P>
	What I really think happened was that a number of senior 
members on the other side decided no, we are here, we have it, 
we are not going to give it up. They demonstrated like so many 
do that they are not prepared to make sacrifices for the country.
<P>
	Why should Canadians make a sacrifice if the leaders will 
not? The people who were elected in 1993 are caught in this 
thing. They know what people are saying because they are still 
in touch with their constituents. That is some 200 plus of us.
<P>
	I am sure it was felt that members on this side would be split 
on this item. We feel so strongly about it in the Reform Party that 
52 of us are going to take that exemption and get out of the 
pension plan. That is a pretty big surprise to the governing party.
<P>
	I bring members to what is going to happen in 1997-98. We 
are all standing on a stage at an all candidates forum. I think 
about the questions from that crowd. I think about them saying: 
``Okay, there is a candidate up there who has opted out of the 
gold plated pension that some 85 per cent of Canadians in a 
survey said must be eliminated. Someone has opted out. All of 
the rest cannot opt out even if they wanted to because their party 
said they had to belong to that gold plated pension plan''.
<P>
	It will be a pretty tough position for other candidates to 
defend. Throw in a bit of gun control. Throw in a few of the other 
major issues and it will be even more difficult. We know that 
governments defeat themselves. They are seldom defeated from 
the outside.
<P>
	It is just amazing that something like this would be dealt with 
this way. I can hardly believe, with all the spin doctors and all 
the professional consultants that the other party has, it would 
even consider gambling with something like this gold plated 
pension unless a lot of members plan to opt in or opt out, 
however it is going to work. It is certainly going to be an 
Achilles' heel in the coming election.
<P>
	The people will be able to speak. The people have shown that 
already. The people have power now. In case members have not 
noticed, they demonstrated it in 1992 with the Charlottetown 
accord. They demonstrated it in the election very strongly about 
the GST and the corrupt items that we talked about. They 
certainly demonstrated it to the cable television companies. 
Members better believe that they are going to display their 
power in 1997-98 or whenever the next election is. The battle 
cry is going to be gold plated pensions. I guarantee it will be at 
the top of the list.
<P>
	This is the sort of issue that to me touches everybody. All 
people think about their health, their old age and protection and 
security for themselves and their families. This is something to 
which every one of them can relate.
<P>
	When you get something that everybody can relate to, Mr. 
Speaker, you now have a very definite issue. Members of the 
Reform Party are not going to let voters forget about the pension 
plan. We might be talking about guns, we might be talking about 
other things but those issues do not touch everyone. When we 
have an issue like taxes, an issue like pensions that touches 
everyone, people will respond.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I suppose the purpose of this House is for us to point out to 
everyone here the issue, the problems and what the people of 
Canada are saying about an issue like this. I respectfully put 
forward this point of view and say this is an issue we must deal 
with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the hon. member's speech.
<P>
	The hon. member has made a comparison between what a 
member of Parliament and someone in the business community 
makes. It is important for him to remember and understand the 
fact that to have credible government we have to have credible 
people here.
<P>
	In my other life I was a poultry producer. I was respected in 
that occupation and 18 months later I hope I am respected in this 
one. Personally I have not changed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12203"> 12203 </A></B>
<P>
	To become a member of Parliament it cost my farming 
operation over $12,000 a year. That was just in workmen's 
compensation payments and unemployment insurance to 
replace me.
<P>
	When the hon. member talks about gold plated pensions and 
so on, a study was done that stated that members of Parliament 
were underpaid. We have by the way frozen our wages again. I 
know it is not an option because we cannot give ourselves a raise 
when we are telling everyone else to hold the line. However, the 
report recommended an increase in pay for members of 
Parliament. I would be more than happy if that happened to see 
the pensions done away with and work within an RRSP program.
<P>
	We know we cannot have an increase in pay. The public will 
not stand for it. I agree with that. Therefore I feel the pension 
reform is more reflective of what that increase in pay would 
have been. I know if a member of Parliament was working in the 
business community he would be making a heck of a lot more 
money than what he is making right now.
<P>
	Does the hon. member think a member of Parliament makes as 
much as a person in the business community does if he is doing 
the same job that we are doing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, we are talking 
about pensions, not salaries. I will answer the hon. member's 
question about salary.
<P>
	The Canadian public does not know what an MP does. I must 
admit that some of us who came here for the first time probably 
really did not know how much work was involved. If people 
knew the number of hours involved I think there would be 
support for higher salaries. In any business there would be some 
MPs who would not qualify but generally speaking MPs are 
underpaid.
<P>
	A pay increase at least is honest. It is straightforward. If it is 
explained properly the Canadian public would understand that. 
They cannot understand a pension that MPs have rewarded to 
themselves that is totally different from other pensions. It is 
three and a half times better than you can get in industry.
<P>
	Canadians cannot accept the dishonesty of that sort of a 
pension. What they could accept would be the honesty of saying: 
``These are the hours, this is the job that is done and this is the 
salary that should have been obtained''.
<P>
	You say you took a salary cut. I took a big salary cut too.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. If we get into an 
exchange of a personal nature by using the words you, me and so 
on, we could be getting into a very dangerous area. By and large 
our debates are conducted in a very parliamentary fashion, to the 
credit of all in the Chamber.
<P>
	I remind members to direct their comments and interventions 
through the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize. This is an 
emotional issue. It is one we feel very strongly about. It is 
certainly one about which my constituents feel very strongly. If 
there is one issue that has been raised more times than any other 
in the four years I have been involved, it has to be the one of 
MPs' pensions.
<P>
	I get emotional about it. It has been four or five years that I 
have been talking about it. It is not something new. It is not a 
matter of just jumping on the bandwagon and saying we oppose 
it, as two former members said we were doing. If they checked 
the record they would find that most of us feel strongly about the 
issue. Mr. Speaker, your constituents feel strongly about it as 
well.
<P>
	We have to put the facts on the table. I respect what the hon. 
member just said about salaries. That is how it should have been 
presented. If it had been done that way it could have possibly 
received all-party agreement. If it had been simply presented as 
a trade-off and package, bounced off the people to find out if 
they agreed, there was a good chance they would have accepted 
it. However I am certain they will not accept this type of pension 
plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of 
the frustrations for Canadians on issues such as this one is not 
knowing how to do something about it.
<P>
	If we reflect on the Charlottetown accord, every politician in 
the House of Commons lined up to try to jam the Charlottetown 
accord down the throats of Canadians, with the exception of the 
Reform member for Beaver River. Canadians saw through the 
Charlottetown accord. They lined up on the cable issue. They 
lined up on a number of issues.
<P>
	I have a question for the member. If Canadians are as upset 
about the issue as we believe they are, does he have any 
constructive ideas ordinary citizens might be able to use to make 
members on the other side aware of how frustrated they are?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would certainly hope 
the Canadian public has learned how to become involved in the 
process. I would go back to the last election and how they got 
involved and made a major change. The major change was a 
response to issues such as this one. They said: ``Do not tell us 
what is good for us. We will tell you what we are prepared to 
have and to pay for''.
<P>
	I would tell Canadians to make sure they talk to their members 
of Parliament. They must talk to them, write to them, phone 
them, and tell them where they are coming from. They must do it 
soon. They must do it before the end of June so they will have 
input. When the bill gets to committee, I hope the government 
will deal with it in that way.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I remind the House that every member has come 
here with honesty and integrity, working their buns off 24 hours 
a day in some instances for seven days a week. I do not think 
many came here looking for the pension. My only hope is that I 
live long enough to enjoy it after the gruelling work days we go 
through.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the 
debate on Bill C-85. I would like to ask hon. members to think 
carefully about some of the issues underlying the design of the 
pension plan.
<P>
	Over the last few years there has been a growing chorus of 
complaints from Canadians about the generosity of the pension 
plan. In general, the complaints focused on two features of the 
plan. The first was the immediate availability of regular 
monthly pension payments from the day of leaving Parliament 
for the rest of the individual's life. The second was the 
frequency with which former members were seen as being 
rewarded, not only with this lifetime benefit but with 
appointments to highly paid posts in public life.
<P>
	The first criticism is certainly understandable. We all 
understand that the purpose of a pension plan is to provide 
income for individuals who have reached an age when ability 
and willingness to work have declined. At that stage of life it is 
reasonable to think that retirement from the workforce should be 
possible without catastrophic alterations in lifestyle 
expectations. That is why our system of taxation includes 
measures to encourage Canadians to save toward retirement 
years during their employment years and encourages employers 
to participate in the goal by providing employer sponsored 
pension plans.
<P>
	While undoubtedly improvements could be made, I cannot 
imagine that anyone seriously questions the importance of 
maintaining a system of tax assistance for retirement savings. 
Obviously the question of when it is reasonable to begin 
receiving what is meant to be retirement income is a different 
matter.
<P>
	We should really ask ourselves if we have in place adequate 
financial arrangements to allow a member of Parliament, who 
leaves the House before what could be considered normal 
retirement, to make the transition back to private life in a 
reasonable way.
<P>
	The answer to that question, however, is not to begin paying a 
pension to someone who is only in his or her thirties or forties. 
Such a person will look for employment elsewhere and most 
likely will continue to accumulate retirement savings so that 
ultimately on retirement pension may come from several 
sources.
<P>
	The establishment of a minimum pensionable age for the 
Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act as proposed in 
the bill ensures that the pension plan takes its place as building a 
portion of ultimate retirement income for a person who may 
have several different types of employment during a full career.
<P>
	As I have indicated, I fully support the action proposed in the 
bill with respect to the issue of what is commonly referred to as 
double dipping by former members who are receiving pensions 
and are appointed or become employed in federal jurisdictions.
<P>
	To a great extent the problem has its genesis in the previous 
issue of the age at which pensions have become payable. The 
public is understandably concerned when a 40-year old is 
drawing both a generous pension and a salary from public funds. 
Obviously it would not be fair. Nor would it be in the public 
interest to preclude qualified former members from public 
service at the national level. However it is fair and respects the 
public view to act in the manner proposed in the bill to expect 
the former member to report such income and receive less or no 
pension for the period concerned.
<P>
	The legislation responds to two specific criticisms of our 
pension arrangements. I commend the President of the Treasury 
Board for carrying through on our commitment in this area. I 
draw attention to the fact, however, that the president has gone 
even further and has made a very significant change in the 
formula used to calculate benefits under the plan. The change 
will affect all present and future members of the House by 
reducing the level of pension benefits earned.
<P>
	Until this time members of the House of Commons have 
earned pensions at the rate of 5 per cent of average sessional 
indemnity for each year of pensionable service. For service after 
the bill takes effect the rate will be reduced to 4 per cent of 
average indemnity. This means that members will be earning 20 
per cent less pension in future, which I am sure anyone would 
agree is a very significant reduction in retirement expectation 
for members of Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	For example, based on current indemnity levels, a member 
will be accumulating $640 less pension for each year of service. 
We are told by the President of the Treasury Board that this 
reduction coupled with the introduction of a minimal 
pensionable age will amount to ongoing savings to taxpayers of 
something like 33 per cent of the present cost of the plan. This 
would mean that government contributions to the plan would be 
lower by more than $3 million every year.
<P>
	Undoubtedly some will say this reduction is not enough, that 
the government has not gone far enough, that MPs are not worth 
what they are paid, that pensions are part of the compensation 
and so on, that the plan goes far beyond what is provided 
elsewhere, that the plan is illegal, and that no one else in the 
country would be permitted to have such a plan.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12205"> 12205 </A></B>
<P>
	Clearly the question of how much is enough is one with no 
factual answer. Every Canadian will reach his or her own 
conclusion on whether or not the government has gone far 
enough.
<P>
	A number of points should be considered by the thoughtful 
people of the House before coming to a conclusion. I should like 
to address the much publicized view that the plan is illegal in 
some way. Those who suggest that no other Canadian could have 
such a pension arrangement because of other legislation such as 
the Income Tax Act are either misrepresenting or 
misunderstanding the rules.
<P>
	While the income tax rules for registered pension plans are 
complex, the general concept is simple. The rules put limits on 
the maximum benefits that can be accumulated under a pension 
plan and thus govern the amount of contributions that can be 
made and tax sheltered. The rules do not prevent individuals or 
employers from setting aside other funds to provide additional 
retirement savings. They simply do not provide tax assistance 
for such savings.
<P>
	As well, where employers sponsor such additional 
arrangements and set aside funds to pay for them, I am told that 
special tax rules come into play that considerably increase the 
cost of providing the benefits by applying a refundable tax of 50 
per cent of all revenues to the plan.
<P>
	The Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act was 
amended in 1992 to conform with the rules we expect other 
employers to obey. Part I of the plan provides the benefits that 
are permitted under the tax rules, while part II provides the 
benefits that are offside of the rules. The benefits are provided 
on a funded basis, which means the contributions are made at a 
level that provides for the 50 per cent tax I mentioned.
<P>
	While this is a complicated and technical area, it is important 
to understand the plan provides an arrangement that is not 
denied to any other Canadian by law. The reason it is done this 
way is to ensure we disclose to the public the full cost of 
providing the benefits on the basis available to any other 
employer. That is why the government is paying taxes to itself to 
ensure full disclosure.
<P>
	Having ventured into the arcane and mysterious world of tax 
treatment of pension plans, I will with some trepidation presume 
to place on the record a few thoughts about the financing 
arrangements for MPs pensions.
<P>
	We have heard many allegations about the total amount that 
members will receive in pension benefits over their lifetime. 
Often these comments are accompanied by the suggestion that 
there would be huge but unknown demands placed on future 
taxpayers to cover the cost of pensions. The suggestion is that 
we are hiding from the public the total obligations that are 
coming in the future. This is simply not true. It is not the case.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	The Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act 
imposes the requirement that each year the government 
contributes the amount which together with members' 
contributions will pay the cost of benefits earned by all serving 
members in that year. This means that enough money must be 
put in the pension account and shown as a government 
expenditure to provide for all pensions that will be paid in future 
in respect of members' service in that year.
<P>
	In addition, every three years a report must be tabled in 
Parliament from the government's actuary giving his 
professional advice on whether or not the amounts in the plan 
are adequate to cover all the benefits to become payable under 
the plan. If there are shortages, the government must make 
additional contributions to cover them. This is disclosure.
<P>
	While the funding of pensions is another complex and 
technical area, the point to be understood is that the full cost of 
all benefits, including those which may not be payable for many 
years hence, are recognized and expensed as the liabilities 
accrue. There are no hidden obligations which will only surface 
at some future date.
<P>
	As I have indicated, these pension arrangements are legal. 
The proposal in Bill C-85 will make them significantly less 
generous for the future. I do not suggest this pension plan will be 
typical of the retirement arrangements found on average. It will 
still constitute a very good plan. Undoubtedly, some of the 
public and some members feel we should have gone further than 
a 20 per cent reduction in pension, but the consequences of such 
a step should be examined.
<P>
	Rational people would agree that you get what you pay for. 
They would agree that members of Parliament should be fairly 
compensated for the work done on their behalf. It is unlikely that 
many of us are here for the generosity of the compensation 
package. I hope we are here in the spirit of service to our fellow 
citizens. We are here to do a very important job in the best way 
we can to serve our constituents.
<P>
	The decision to seek public office is seldom an easy one in 
personal terms. It may involve personal sacrifice for each and 
every individual and for those closest to him or her in terms of 
their private time and their privacy. It certainly can involve 
financial sacrifice in terms of interrupting or abandoning a 
career outside government.
<P>
	The question is: What level of compensation do we believe is 
necessary to ensure that qualified individuals continue to offer 
themselves for the service of this great country?
<P>
	The Sobeco study commissioned by the previous government 
and tabled in 1992 certainly indicated that the overall com-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12206"> 12206 </A></B>
<P>
pensation package for members of this honourable House was 
less than that provided to individuals employed in other sectors 
in terms of what the report sees as equivalent responsibilities.
<P>
	The authors of that study, who are professionals in the 
compensation field, did suggest that one element of the package, 
the pension plan, was unduly rich and should be cut back in 
favour of greater direct compensation. We are making a 20 per 
cent cut in that level of pension and instituting a pensionable 
age, a step the report also recommended. We are not increasing 
our pay. In fact, sessional indemnities remain frozen at the 1992 
level and will for two years to come, and maybe more.
<P>
	We have gone a long way in Bill C-85 in responding to the 
public's outcry that we do reform MPs pensions. We have gone 
beyond the promise in the red book that there would be an age 
limit and that we would reduce the input. We have responded to 
the public's interest and to their concerns while maintaining a 
compensation package that will not discourage well-qualified 
candidates from coming forward to serve this great institution.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	We should not be reluctant to say to Canadians that we believe 
what we are doing on their behalf is important enough that it 
warrants a fair compensation package and that we will listen to 
their response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member was trying to tell us how justified members of 
Parliament are in receiving the compensation and how we are 
entitled to receive fair compensation.
<P>
	Nobody denies fair compensation. Nobody denies a bank 
president, a janitor, a farmer, a parliamentarian just 
compensation. What we are talking about here is the pension 
plan that is uneven. It can reward one parliamentarian to a 
tremendous degree and another parliamentarian perhaps to a 
smaller degree and it is called fair compensation.
<P>
	Not only that, the member talked about how members 
contribute and the government as the employer contributes. 
Therefore it is all out in the open as to how much it costs 
Canadian taxpayers for the pension plan.
<P>
	Can the hon. member tell me how much over the last year the 
Government of Canada has contributed to the members of 
Parliament pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that hon. 
members who have come here have not come looking for a 
pension.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Then they should walk away from it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> They have come to serve their country. Let 
me give members a personal note as to why I am here.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Again, to remind 
colleagues that within parliamentary debate there can be a great 
risk if we become too personal in our discussions across the 
floor of the House. Respecting that a question has been asked by 
one member, we now will hopefully hear the reply from the 
member for Cumberland-Colchester.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to remain objective 
when we wonder what motivates others.
<P>
	The pension plan is equitable for all members who are serving 
this honourable House. We have fulfilled a promise according to 
the red book to the public of this country and they are satisfied.
<P>
	The hon. member refers to a bank manager. The bank 
managers I read about in most of the annual reports are earning 
something like $350,000 or $500,000 a year. Hon. members of 
this House earn $64,400 a year. That is the salary of hon. 
members of this House.
<P>
	The pension is equitable for the amount of fairness in the 
system and in equation to our frozen salaries and is meeting the 
needs of the economic recession we are in. We have done the 
reform that badly needed doing. We have responded to 
Canadians and Canadians are satisfied.
<P>
	Any Canadian who elects someone or throws someone out of 
office of this hon. House will not do it on the basis of the pension 
plan.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to ask a question on this 
very issue.
<P>
	I would like to comment first on a figure just given by the hon. 
member. If the bank managers could hear the statistic that was 
quoted, they would be delighted if it were reality. For a bank 
manager to earn $350,000 would be by far the exception rather 
than the rule in this country, certainly the ones I am personally 
aware of. Perhaps this shows a lack of a sense of reality in this 
country.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	Has the member calculated how she herself would benefit 
from this pension plan as compared to other pension plans? I 
wonder if the Liberal members have done that and then 
compared it to what they would have earned in another pension 
plan. I am not familiar with the hon. member's background, but 
what would her pension have been in her previous occupation?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the first part of 
the hon. member's question, from the annual reports of the 
Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia, the salaries of 
the CEOs are quite significant. If the hon. member checks them 
out she will find they are substantial. The average salary for an 
elementary school teacher, as I understand it, is approximately 
$55,000 to $58,000. I do not think it is appropriate to use the 
time of the House to go down the list of salaries.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12207"> 12207 </A></B>
<P>
	In terms of my previous life, my background was in science 
and research and I was a business woman. This is my first 
experience with a pension plan. I have always invested-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> And you cannot wait to get it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> I hope I live long enough to get it, with the 
long days we put in seven days a week. I believe the constituents 
in my riding knew they were getting a hard worker which is why 
they elected me. It was not because of the pension plan. It will be 
in addition to or will supplement investments I have made. I 
remind the House that I still have children in university. Who 
knows what is ahead of any of us down the road?
<P>
	This is an equitable and very fair plan. We have kept the 
promise to the people of Canada that we would reform. We have 
set the age limit which was an important factor in this country. 
We have reduced the luxury of this pension plan in relationship 
to the salary that members of this honourable House are paid and 
the package that is there, those who will attain it.
<P>
	I must remind the member also that more than 50 per cent of 
members who come to this House never receive a pension. That 
is a very important factor to keep in mind.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-85, an act to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act and to provide for the continuation of a certain 
provision, be read the second time and referred to a committee; 
and on the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-85 on the pension 
plan, which has been brought before us. This is the Liberal 
government's attitude toward reform and, according to the last 
speaker, this was equitable.
<P>
	The previous speaker talked about the fact that because our 
salaries are so low we need this exorbitant, gold plated pension 
plan that is an obscenity in the fiscal arrangements of Canada. 
Even though the member was arguing about the fairness of this, 
she admitted that 50 per cent of members do not collect. That 
just totally destroys the argument right there.
<P>
	If we are concerned about inequity in the salaries or 
compensation arrangements, that we are entitled to more, then 
surely we get a larger salary, not a larger pension. The pension is 
not the compensation for the work we do in this House. It is to 
keep us going in the years when we are unable to work because 
we are so old and decrepit. That is the theory of pensions. We 
find that while private and government sectors consider 60 or 65 
to be the normal age before you are too old and decrepit to go to 
work, for parliamentarians it is 55, because we work so hard and 
make such a great sacrifice for our country. If I look around this 
room I do not think I will find one person who was dragged in 
here kicking and screaming in order to make a sacrifice for the 
country. They are here because they have chosen to be here.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Before they came here they knew what the salary 
arrangements were and they knew what the pension plan was. 
That is why they said: ``Now I am here, I want to hang on to what 
I have. We know the Canadian public is mightily upset by what 
we have, therefore we will make a bit of a change and hope the 
masses quiet down so we can ride off into the sunset at age 55 
with an indexed pension plan which will keep us going from the 
day we retire in our anonymity and enjoy the sun in our 
retirement at the expense of other Canadians''.
<P>
	This has been a debate today unfortunately about mistruths, 
half truths, innuendoes, blatant twisting of facts. The previous 
speaker talked about the benefits we pay under Bill C-85 being 
perfectly within the limits of the Income Tax Act. Of course they 
are. The only problem is every other Canadian has to work 30 or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12208"> 12208 </A></B>
<P>
35  years before they accumulate the same benefits we under this 
new bill will acquire in 19 years. Before that we acquired it in 15 
years.
<P>
	The previous speaker also said the contributions we make fall 
within the limits of the Income Tax Act. They do but let us take a 
look at the Income Tax Act. Members of Parliament have two 
pension plans. Let every Canadian know we have two pension 
plans.
<P>
	The first meets the definitions of the Income Tax Act which 
say the maximum benefit we can get is 2 per cent per year. We 
make a contribution to a pension plan that falls within normal, 
allowable limits.
<P>
	Then we make the contribution to the top up, the Retirement 
Compensations Allowances Act. Nobody else can have a top up 
because there is a penalty. An employer who has a pension above 
the bottom one has to pay a 50 per cent tax to the federal 
government. The federal government cannot pay a tax to itself, 
therefore it can have the top up pension plan with absolute and 
total impugnity.
<P>
	That is why we have built the rules and the House has made 
the rules to accommodate members of Parliament who have 
been able to bend them for their own benefit. Nobody else can 
even think about having a pension plan as gold plated as ours, 
even though it may be legal, because there is a 50 per cent tax 
applied.
<P>
	I mentioned we have mistruths, half truths and innuendoes. I 
could use worse words but you may want to intervene, Mr. 
Speaker, so I will leave it at that. I am sure everybody knows.
<P>
	Let me quote a release dated April 20, 1995 from the Treasury 
Board secretariat, quoting the President of the Treasury Board in 
relation to Bill C-85: ``The bill goes even further than the red 
book commitment and will reduce government spending on 
MPs' pensions by 33 per cent''. That amounts to $3.3 million of 
the $10 million the plan currently costs the government.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us take a look at cost. Cost is perhaps the central issue in 
this whole argument. House of Commons estimates, 1995-96, 
table 5, under ``Members of the House of Commons-salaries 
and allowances of officers, members of the House of Commons 
under the Parliament of Canada Act and contributions to 
members of Parliament retiring allowances account and the 
members of Parliament retirement compensation arrangements 
account'' are $56,352,000.
<P>
	I go back to the release from the Treasury Board that this 
amounts to $3.3 million the $10 million the plan currently costs 
the government. There was a little discrepancy there I thought. 
There is $56 million in the estimates and $10 million released by 
the Treasury Board.
<P>
	I checked it out. I went back to the public accounts 1994, table 
7.9: ``Members of Parliament retiring allowances account''. 
Contributions by members are $944,000. Contributions by the 
government are $2 million. The top up is contributions by 
members, $1.5 million; contributions by the government, $10.3 
million.
<P>
	The previous speaker said we contribute and the government 
contributes. If there is a shortfall the government contributes 
more. How much is more? I went to the 1993 public accounts, 
table 7.9: ``1991-92 actuarial liability adjustment'' under the 
members of Parliament retiring allowances account, $158 
million; for one year $158 million extra actuarial liability 
adjustment. In the year 1991-92 that is what the Government of 
Canada paid to top up the unfunded liability of the members of 
Parliament pension plan, right here in the 1993 public accounts.
<P>
	I am quoting from the government document. During that year 
members contributions-this is just the ordinary one, this is not 
the top up-were $945,000. Contributions by the government 
were $2 million. A bit of smoke and mirrors crept in here. After 
we threw in $158 million the fund goes up and to make sure the 
pot is relatively sweet we are paying 10 per cent interest on that. 
The interest the government paid jumped from the previous year 
of $3.4 million up to $20 million of interest the government 
threw in on top of its own contribution. It is still liable if it is 
underfunded to pay the extra.
<P>
	Those are direct quotes from the Public Accounts of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> That is not a direct quote.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> It is a direct quote. One hundred and 
fifty-eight million is what it cost Canadians extra; extra for the 
ordinary pension plan. I have not even talked about the top up 
provision. That is from the Public Accounts of Canada.
<P>
	That is why Canadians are absolutely outraged. We talked 
today about the member for Beaver River who believes she 
walked away from a pension plan in which she would receive 
benefits in the neighbourhood of $1.25 million. I said to her: 
``Does that make you an ex-millionaire or a could have been 
millionaire?'' We talked about that a little bit. We did realize 
that for everybody who opts into this pension plan they are want 
to be millionaires.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	That, at the taxpayer's expense, is totally and absolutely 
unjustifiable. There is that ad on TV: Retire at age 55, freedom 
day on the beach in Bermuda; shorts, the sun is up. He is there 
with his wife. The ad says: ``This could be you, too''. Of course 
it is you over there.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Again I remind the House 
and all participating in this debate that all interventions will be 
made-I will remind you as often as I need to with the greatest 
of patience that I can find-through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize. It was within 
context. I hope you appreciate that.
<P>
	The ad I was talking about says: ``You could be there''. I was 
not referring to you, Mr. Speaker. I was talking to the 
government side.
<P>
	The point I am trying to make is here we have written the 
perfect plan paid for by the taxpayers of Canada, not by one's 
own resources: age 55, on the beach in Bermuda, lapping it up, a 
drink in your hand and everybody else is back home working.
<P>
	That is a crying shame. One of the other things I was thinking 
about was in the New Brunswick <I>Telegraph Journal</I> on May 3. 
There is an article about the indebtedness of Atlantic Canada as 
if Atlantic Canada were a country.
<P>
	It says the indebtedness of Atlantic Canada would be 
somewhere between Uganda and Nigeria, in the most severely 
indebted countries: ``The ratio of net public debt to GDP ranges 
from 121.8 per cent in Newfoundland to 93.1 per cent in New 
Brunswick''. Here we are in Atlantic Canada drowning in debt.
<P>
	The federal government and the provincial governments have 
a responsibility to manage our resources for the benefit of all 
Canadians. Here we are lapping it up for ourselves at the same 
time as we are allowing the country to dig itself into a hole $550 
billion deep with no sign whatsoever that the government can 
even get out of it.
<P>
	It is making the hole even bigger and yet its members continue 
to say: ``It is a sacrifice for us here in the Parliament of Canada. 
We need this gold plated pension plan''. Everybody else has to 
struggle for their jobs, struggle for their paycheques, pay taxes 
through the nose so that we can, with a gold plated, freedom 55 
pension plan, be on the beach in Bermuda courtesy of the 
Canadian taxpayer. I do not think that is good enough.
<P>
	I have an article about Liberal broken promises which says the 
Liberals promised not to increase the tax burden of Canadians. 
That is in the red book. We find in the last budget taxes are going 
up 1.5 cents on a litre of gasoline. Corporate taxes are up. 
Surtaxes are up. Everything is up.
<P>
	The poor taxpayer is finding we are grabbing more and more 
money out of his pocket while he is concerned about his job. He 
is concerned about his mortgage as interest rates go through the 
roof. He is concerned about the education of his kids. He is 
concerned about what his kids will do, whether they will get a 
decent job while we take more and more taxes out of his pocket 
so we can make this great sacrifice and go and sit on the beach in 
Bermuda with freedom 55.
<P>
	The Liberals promised to base federal appointments solely on 
competence rather than patronage. We heard the President of the 
Treasury Board today tell us about how he would put an end to 
double dipping.
<P>
	This bill would stop double dipping because Canadians are 
fed up to the teeth with our gold plated pension plan in one 
pocket and a government salary in another pocket and maybe 
two pension plans after that is all done in another pocket. We can 
get out there and enjoy life after the great sacrifice we make 
while they have to pay after they try to educate their kids and pay 
their mortgage.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	When he defined double dipping he said if you get money out 
of the general revenue fund of the Government of Canada, that is 
double dipping and therefore your pension is going to be 
reduced dollar for dollar.
<P>
	Patronage appointments are things like being appointed to the 
board of Air Canada or to other boards of crown corporations. I 
was reading <I>On the Take</I> about the days when to be appointed to 
the board of Air Canada was a coveted patronage position, 
because, next to the Senate, which had all of the privileges 
granted by this House, the Air Canada board allowed people free 
Air Canada passes wherever Air Canada flew.
<P>
	Appointments have been made by the government to crown 
corporations and not a nickel of the payments made to those 
people come out of the general revenues of the Government of 
Canada. Therefore double dipping will continue under this 
proposed Bill C-85 just as much and just as unjustifiably as it 
was before. And they tell us they have reformed the system. 
Reformed? Not one bit.
<P>
	It goes on and on. They tell Canadians that they are going to 
get this place organized, that they are going to ensure that they 
will make a great sacrifice and that this country will get back on 
some kind of economic sound footing. Unfortunately, the only 
people who will get themselves on a sound footing are the 
people who get themselves elected to this House to make that 
supreme sacrifice of getting the gold plated pension plan so that 
they can get their freedom 55 and sit on the beach in Bermuda 
and enjoy it all while the poor Canadians have to work to pay the 
taxes and the debt and look after the kids.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did want to have an opportunity to ask the hon. 
member a question and perhaps make a comment in advance of 
doing that.
<P>
	He is quite right that MPs do make sacrifices. One of the 
sacrifices I have had to make is to give up one of my favourite 
pastimes of reading fiction. Fortunately, sitting in the House 
today has been some compensation for that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12210"> 12210 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us talk about the figure of $156 million that he bandied 
about. Let us understand what that is. That is an accrual figure. 
For those members who understand a balance sheet, it would be 
like counting depreciation as a cash layout. It is not any such 
thing. It is a liability that would suggest that if every member of 
Parliament lived to their actuarial age and if every member of 
Parliament qualified for a pension, that would be the lifetime 
expense of the pension. First, 50 per cent of MPs never receive 
it, so that figure is nothing but an accrual figure that is used by 
actuaries who are dealing with a pension plan. It is not a true 
government expense.
<P>
	Let us get down to what the true government expense is. Right 
now, under the present regime, it is between $10 million and $11 
million. That will drop by 33 per cent.
<P>
	Let us put into context what this great party across the way is 
battling and why it is so worried about economic concerns. This 
represents six one-thousandths of one per cent of the total 
government expenditure. The party that has come here to control 
expenditures, the party that has come here because Canadians 
have told them that we are spending too much, has all of this 
outrage to deal with six one-thousandths of one per cent of 
government expenditure.
<P>
	Let us put it in a better light. If a member was earning $40,000 
a year and decided they needed to cut back on their expenditures, 
the amount the MP's pension would represent in equivalent 
terms of that $40,000 is $2.40. That is all they would be dealing 
with, and that is all we are dealing with in the cost.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	So I think that when the member describes these expenditures 
he should do it accurately and in the appropriate context.
<P>
	I have one other point. He talks about the fact that double 
dipping is going to continue. I point out there are four members 
of his party who are double dipping using the definition he just 
used. I ask the hon. member: Are those four members going to 
stop their double dipping? Will they stop drawing their pensions 
from the public purse while they sit in this House and draw the 
MP pension? Or are they going to continue with double dipping? 
It will be interesting to hear the answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, you will recall that in my speech 
I did say this was a debate of mistruth, half truths, twisting the 
truth and so on.
<P>
	To answer the member's question, in the Public Accounts of 
Canada, 1991-92, on page 7.9, and in the 1993 public accounts, 
volume one, it does say quite specifically ``an actuarial liability 
adjustment of $158 million'', which he tried to tell us was just 
one of those fictitious accounting entries that mean nothing to 
Canadians. The only point is that the following year this 
fictitious accounting adjustment that means nothing attracted 
about $17 million worth of interest the taxpayer had to dig into 
his pocket to find. In 1991-92 the  interest paid on the retirement 
allowances account was $3.44 million, and that jumped because 
the value of the fund went up because they put in $158 million of 
taxpayers' money. That interest jumped from $3.4 million to 
$20,493,768. That is accurate. I am quoting from the public 
accounts.
<P>
	I am saying this was real money the Canadian taxpayers had to 
come up with. That is the shame of the whole affair. Remember I 
quoted the President of the Treasury Board when he said that this 
new plan would reduce the costs by 33 per cent. That amounts to 
$3.3 million of the $10 million the plan currently costs the 
government.
<P>
	I recall the questioner saying this $158 million was some kind 
of fictitious accounting adjustment to bring things all the way 
through to cover off pensions that would not be paid. This is an 
actuarial liability adjustment. The plan needed that.
<P>
	I never talked about the retirement compensation 
arrangements account, which will likely need a significant 
top-up as well. If the member cares to read the public accounts, 
he can study how his government spends its way through $165 
billion.
<P>
	They talk about balancing the budget, yet spending stays 
constant. They hope to squeeze more taxes out of Canadians in 
order to balance the budget. If they think that is the way to go, let 
them go back and ask their constituents if that is what they want, 
if they want the government as they balance the budget to take 
them by the neck and give them a rattle and a shake until the 
money falls out so that we can pay these pensions and balance 
the budget. I do not think so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I will ask my question again, because there 
were two questions. I got a part answer in one and no answer in 
the other. I will start with the one I did not seem to get an answer 
to.
<P>
	There are four members of your party who are double dipping 
by the definition you used.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would caution members 
to please put all interventions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are four members of the 
third party who, using the definition of the last speaker, would 
be considered to be double dipping using the term the way we 
use it here. I had asked for an explanation as to whether those 
members will stop that practice that he finds so abhorrent. That 
would be the question.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Now the second question. We talked about that famous line, 
and those of you who know how to read a balance sheet know 
that an accrual figure is not a cash expense. I ask the hon. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12211"> 12211 </A></B>
<P>
member to say what is the cash expense to the government for 
the past fiscal year. That is debatable.
<P>
	What I really want though is the answer to that question about 
those four members of the third party who are doing the double 
dipping, as he describes it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is hard to come up with figures 
just on the spur of the moment. When we are trying to find our 
way through $165 billion worth of spending it is difficult 
sometimes to find exactly where the numbers are. On spending 
cash, writing cheques, let me see if I can find it.
<P>
	From the 1993 public accounts we made payments and other 
charges, annual allowances-and this is out of the ordinary 
pension plan-of $9.8 million. Out of the other one we paid out 
$13 million or $14 million. This totals about $23 million, and we 
as members only contributed 10 per cent of that, about $2.3 
million.
<P>
	To answer his other question, their definition of double 
dipping is to be paid out of the general revenues of Canada. As 
far as I am aware, no member of the Reform Party is getting paid 
out of the general revenues of Canada or is enjoying a patronage 
appointment by the federal government. Therefore the 
innuendos he applies to the Reform Party are totally false.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I intend to split my time with the next speaker. I would 
like to indicate that. It is a pleasure to participate in this debate.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House continue to sit beyond the ordinary time of daily adjournment 
for the purpose of considering the second reading stage of Bill C-85, an act to 
amend the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and to provide for 
the continuation of a certain provision.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Will those members who 
object to the motion please rise in their places?
<P>
	Fewer than 15 members having risen, pursuant to Standing 
Order 26 the motion is adopted.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Just to set matters 
straight, having been given an indication previously, before the 
parliamentary secretary moved the motion he gave an indication 
to the Chair and the House that he was splitting his time. I would 
interpret that to mean that the member for Durham will have ten 
minutes for his speech and there will be five minutes for 
questions and comments. Resuming debate, the hon. member for 
Durham.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point order, if extended hours 
have been requested, to what extent will the hours be extended?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> As I understand it, there 
are no limitations under the motion that was moved and agreed 
to.
<P>
	Resuming debate, the hon. member for Durham.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to speak in the debate on Bill C-85. I do not 
think any piece of legislation has enraged people in the country 
more than the concept of MP pensions.
<P>
	I remember back to my days in private professional practice 
when we said we should not drive a car our clients could not 
afford. I think in some ways that is how people regard MP 
pensions.
<P>
	The system being revised here today is possibly better than 
most private pension plans. Possibly one problem we have in the 
whole issue of debate is we have not properly focused on the 
whole concept of remuneration of members of Parliament, and 
MP pensions are one factor.
<P>
	Unfortunately things often get confused in Ottawa when we 
look at various aspects of remuneration, even in the public 
service. The public service has something like 1,400 separate 
agreements that cover remuneration for public employees.
<P>
	The point I am trying to make is when we look at pensions we 
cannot strictly look at the concept of pensions and compare them 
with private industry. We have to look at the whole concept of 
remuneration of members of Parliament.
<P>
	Another aspect is exactly what does the public expect and 
what kind of qualities and qualifications do members of 
Parliament need to come to this place? For most people it is not a 
matter of money. I believe that is true of all my colleagues in the 
House. In my case I really did not even know how much 
members of Parliament got paid until I came here. When the 
first paycheque showed up in my bank account it quickly 
enlightened me to the fact I was being employed for less than 
half of what I made in the private sector.
<P>
	The government commissioned an independent study to 
review the whole matter of MP pensions and also remuneration 
of members of Parliament. The study came back basically 
saying reduce MP pensions to reflect the norms of the private 
sector. At the same time it talked about changing the entire way 
we are remunerated in terms of salary.
<P>
	The reason our salaries are so strange goes back over a long 
period in our history and there are some aspects that have been 
picked up over time that probably belong to the past. I suppose it 
is much like laws on the books in Parliament. We often take a 
great deal of time to update and modernize them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12212"> 12212 </A></B>
<P>
	That is what is happening with this whole issue. The 
government clearly has gone far beyond its commitments. I will 
read from the red book because there seem to be points members 
opposite have missed entirely. It says Parliament will end 
double dipping. That is what this legislation does. It also talks 
about reviewing. I point out and underline it says ``review the 
question of the minimum age at which pensions will begin to be 
paid''. We are doing more than reviewing them. We are 
changing them, moving them to the age of 55.
<P>
	We have actually surpassed the red book commitments 
because we also have talked about the accrual rate at which we 
can receive pensions. Currently the accrual rate is 5 per cent 
which means we get a 75 per cent pension after 15 years of 
service. By reducing from 5 per cent to 4 per cent we have 
increased the number of years we have to be in the plan to get a 
75 per cent pension from 15 to 19.
<P>
	We actually have a reduction in the total remuneration of 
members of Parliament. It is a wage roll back. Not only have our 
salaries been frozen for a number of years but now the 
government, through this initiative, has actually reduced our 
salaries, our remuneration, which includes pensions as a part of 
that.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Clearly this goes way beyond our commitments to the public. 
We have ended double dipping. The first $5,000 of other income 
a former member can have from an appointment or whatever is 
excluded.
<P>
	Any moneys over that, he will have to basically claw back off 
his pension. If somebody were to get a $50,000 appointment and 
were collecting a $12,000 pension, he would not get any pension 
at all.
<P>
	There is a very interesting study by Mr. Jeffery. This is very 
interesting, very allusive for some of the members of the 
Reform Party who are so quick to possibly give up their options 
in this plan.
<P>
	These are members of the former Parliament. I have little 
clips here. It is very allusive as to how members' remuneration 
is affected after their life in Parliament. We all think we will be 
here forever.
<P>
	The reality is, as many of my colleagues have mentioned, less 
than 50 per cent of members will ever collect a pension. Here is a 
quote from a former member: ``My advice to those who are 
neither on leave from a tenured position nor wealthy would be 
not to seek office until sufficient means to live independently 
beyond leaving office''. These are people who have paid the 
price: ``Life after defeat was quite different. I feel that my time 
in politics has drastically curtailed my credibility when seeking 
employment. So much for service to one's country''.
<P>
	Another quotation: ``My experience as a member of 
Parliament was a major hindrance to finding employment''. 
This is from a cabinet minister: ``Cabinet experience was no 
great help, not compared with the loss of income opportunities 
over 17 years''.
<P>
	Another quote: ``My oldest son is about to enter university. I 
had hoped my retirement allowance would be available to fund 
his education if necessary. It has been required to keep up the 
mortgage''.
<P>
	If I had to retire after 22 years in the House on my gold plated 
pension, the euphemism often given by the Reform Party of 
$46,000 without additional income from a job, I would be in 
tough shape.
<P>
	The record is very clear about what we are talking about. 
What we are talking about is the remuneration of people who 
have given up their careers or whatever to come into this great 
House.
<P>
	In some ways I see MP pension as a form of danger pay. These 
are things that do not really make the Toronto <I>Sun</I> or for that 
matter the National Citizens' Coalition.
<P>
	We talked about the fact that less than 50 per cent of members 
collected. Another interesting statistic is that of the ones who do 
collect, the 50 per cent who do collect, less than 30 per cent 
receive pensions in excess of $50,000.
<P>
	Why is that? It is because they are unable to attain the 
six-year vestiture period. My Reform colleagues constantly 
argue why this is not comparative to the private sector. If the 
private sector were involved the vestiture period would be two 
years.
<P>
	I wonder why some of our Reform colleagues are opting out of 
this plan. There is another interesting aspect. Right now MPs are 
required to contribute 11 per cent of their pay into this plan. The 
new plan will be 9 per cent.
<P>
	Could it be that the Reformers are not very good savers? What 
they want to do is spend. In other words, by taking the 9 per cent 
of these pension contributions they will give themselves more 
disposable income. Could it be they are not very good financial 
advisers, not very good at managing their own affairs? They 
want to spend for today rather than save for tomorrow.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the 
issue of MP pensions today. We are debating Bill C-85, which 
should be entitled an act to make minimal changes to the gold 
plated MP pension scheme.
<P>
	I have heard Liberal members speaking about their MP 
pension plan and they do not want to give it up. They sound like 
spoiled children, whining about how difficult life would be if 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12213"> 12213 </A></B>
<P>
they did not have their MP pension plan. I hear the sound of 
violins out of tune on the other side. It is really pitiful that we 
have to listen to this screeching, wailing and complaining. 
Canadians deserve better than  what they are getting from their 
Liberal representatives today.
<P>
	My colleagues and I in the Reform Party are proud that our 
constant pressure on the issue has finally led to some 
government action. It did not want to do anything. 
Unfortunately the government has failed to propose any 
meaningful changes and as a result the bill falls well short of 
what the public expects and what Reformers can accept.
<P>
	What the government fails to understand is that all of us in the 
Chamber work for and are paid by the public. We must ensure 
the compensation package for members of Parliament, 
including the pension portion, is in line with public sector 
standards and what Canadians want to pay us. We must respect 
taxpayer money as if it were our own. I would like to repeat that 
because I do not think the Liberals understand. They do not think 
about the concept that we must respect taxpayer money as if it 
were our own.
<P>
	We would not spend money foolishly. We would not spend it 
so extravagantly, especially if we were running a country $550 
billion in debt. I do not know why the Liberals cannot 
understand taxpayer money is very important. It is precious. 
They worked hard for that money. Why should they see it so 
extravagantly thrown to the wind?
<P>
	I know the Prime Minister and many others on the government 
side have waxed poetic about all the hard work MPs do. It is true 
that the majority of MPs do work very hard. What the 
government forgets is most Canadians across the country work 
very hard also. I do not think any Canadian gets the kind of 
pension plan MPs receive. None of them receives such a lavish, 
extravagant remuneration after their retirement or defeat.
<P>
	Canadians are aware of the long, hard hours members put in 
and I do not think they actually begrudge the salary of a member 
of Parliament. After all, there are many professions in Canada 
where the pay is higher than that of a member of Parliament. 
Senior teachers, for example, can earn in excess of $65,000 in 
some jurisdictions, and sometimes school board officials 
receive upward of $100,000. What angers Canadians are the 
pensions of MPs. There is no private sector precedent for such a 
lucrative plan.
<P>
	It is important to recognize the opinions of Canadians matter 
when it comes to issues of members' pay and pension. The 
government has forgotten that it is the Canadian public that it is 
here to represent. It is the Canadian public that it works for. It is 
the Canadians who pay all the bills. It is a strange arrangement 
where the employees design their own pension plan and brag 
about it even though it outrages Canadians, the people who 
actually pay the bills. The views of the taxpaying public on this 
issue should be heard and respected.
<P>
	The government is only going through the motions of pension 
reform. It reminds me of lip syncing the old country and western 
song, ``If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time''. 
Government members have years and years of a retirement life 
with $30,000, $70,000 a year, totalling in some cases several 
million dollars. Perrin Beatty, recently appointed as the 
president of the CBC, has an MP pension which will total over 
$5 million by the time he reaches 75. The MP pension plan 
attracts selfish opportunists to political life.
<P>
	I heard a member of the NDP saying members have to be paid 
properly if we are to attract good quality representatives to the 
House. I do not believe that. I believe the motives of the 
members of this place must be higher than fixing their sights on 
the remuneration and the pension plan they receive. It is a bit 
revealing when we hear members discuss these issues as to their 
motives for seeking election and why they are here.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-85 is a cynical attempt at a public relations job rather 
than a significant policy change. The Liberals are trying to give 
the appearance that they are taking action on the issue of gold 
plated MPs pensions but in fact are not.
<P>
	The government is making what it sees as the minimum 
necessary changes in its opinion to the pension plan. It is the 
least it could do, and certainly it does the very least.
<P>
	The Liberals have decreased the annual accrual rate of 
benefits from 5 per cent per year to 4 per cent. The provision 
makes a minor change in the rate at which pension benefits 
increase, but it does not change the maximum pension amount 
members can receive. It slightly increases the time it takes to 
reach the maximum. There is no substantive change here. There 
is a slight accounting change that has been dressed up to give the 
public the impression of reform. It is not the real thing.
<P>
	It is a lot like the noise the finance minister made about real 
cuts to overall spending in his budget. Total spending this year 
will be higher than the total spending last year. Despite this fact 
the Liberals have their spin doctors and media people spinning a 
tale of real spending reductions when there has been a spending 
increase. Canadians know who the real reformers are and they 
are not on the government benches. The legislation proves it.
<P>
	I can hear the Minister of Health saying that instead of a very, 
very generous pension plan it is a very generous pension plan.
<P>
	It is difficult to find a positive side. The positive side is by far 
the smaller side on a multi-sided sphere. On the positive side the 
government has established a minimum age for eligibility 
although it is set pretty low. I wonder how many private pension 
plans set a normal retirement at age 55. The normal retirement 
age is 65.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12214"> 12214 </A></B>
<P>
	The old age pension begins to be paid at age 65. If people in 
the private sector take early retirement they receive lower and 
lower benefits for each additional year they draw from the plan. 
This is done with private sector pensions because it is believed 
they should be actuarially sound. This concept seems to be 
foreign to a government that thinks it does not matter if the 
numbers add up at the end of the day, that it is somebody else's 
money and that it will do with it as it pleases.
<P>
	The government does not have the foggiest notion of the 
consequences of lavish spending that has sunk us over $550 
billion in debt. It says that we should look after ourselves. It is 
the selfish baby boomer MPs who say: ``Too bad for the rest of 
you. Good luck to future generations. We don't care if we 
bankrupt you. It is your tough luck''.
<P>
	The 55 years of age provision is better than what we had 
before. If I suddenly won the 649 and became a multimillionaire 
I could walk away from this place, if I were an irresponsible 
person. I assure the House that I am not. Had I won the election 
in 1988 when I first ran I would have been here for six years and 
would have been able to receive the gold plated pension at age 
42. The 55 figure is a little better but certainly not what 
Canadians are asking for.
<P>
	Again the Liberals have done the very least. They have made 
minimal changes. The government does not realize, or perhaps it 
does not care, that if the benefits are too high and retirement age 
is too low it will have to dip into public money to make up the 
difference. The Liberals seem to have trouble differentiating 
between public money and their own. It is no wonder the country 
is in debt up to its eyeballs. Again the government is going with 
the minimum necessary to give the impression of change. It does 
not realize that the public sees through this type of masquerade.
<P>
	The elimination of double dipping that used to occur through 
members taking another federal job or patronage appointment is 
a positive move. I am pleased that in the face of public opinion 
and constant pressure from Reform benches the government is 
beginning to move on the issue.
<P>
	There are many examples of people in patronage appointed 
positions who are collecting the MP pension. I will name a few. 
Ed Broadbent has apparently taken a slight reduction in his 
salary just so he could keep on receiving the MP pension plan. 
He was not going to be reappointed to his position unless he 
knuckled under. He would have gladly taken that pension had his 
term not expired and had he not needed to be reappointed.
<P>
	I mentioned Perrin Beatty a little earlier. We also know that 
Mr. David Berger was named an ambassador. He still gets his 
MP pension. They had to do some wheeling and dealing to make 
it politically acceptable. He had to state that he would take a 
lesser salary than he would normally take to compensate for the 
pension.
<P>
	It points out to the House that there is a chance for behind the 
scenes manoeuvring in the setting of salaries. Certainly it is not 
the type of scenario we want to allow retired members of 
Parliament to find themselves in. They are very vulnerable to 
corruption and wheeling and dealing behind the public's back 
with regard to their salary and total pension benefits.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	In some cases the recipients of a cushy patronage plum will 
announce their new salary is being reduced by the amount of 
their MP pension. How can the taxpaying public know the high 
salary these people are paid would not have been different if the 
appointee did not have a fat pension? The whole system has the 
potential for abuse. It is all smoke and mirrors with the Liberals. 
Why do they not simply get into step with the rest of the country 
and come clean about the details of the appointments and 
positions?
<P>
	The pension scheme remains out of line with what other 
Canadians have available to them. What they would approve for 
us brings up a very important issue, the issue of making the plan 
voluntary or having an opting out or opting in provision.
<P>
	Bill C-85 includes an opting out or opting in provision, 
however we want to look at it, that is designed solely for the 
purpose of trying to get some crass political advantage for the 
government. It does not allow long time members of the House 
the option of completely leaving the plan. Only members 
elected within the last six years prior to the 1993 election have 
the option of refusing to participate in this taxpayer rip-off. 
That includes those elected for the first time in 1993 and in 
1988. My hon. colleague from Beaver River was elected in a 
byelection in 1989. Incredibly the government wants to make it 
mandatory for all future members.
<P>
	If it is good enough for us to have a chance to opt out or opt in 
now, why not for the class of 1997 or whenever the government 
screws up the courage to call an election? Why just the one-time 
opting in or opting out option? What possible reason could the 
government have for denying future members of the House the 
freedom to opt out of this gold plated scheme?
<P>
	The government obviously views membership in the Camber 
as some sort of caste system or inherited aristocracy. MPs are 
not royalty. I am getting worked up. I am very serious about the 
issue. It really bothers me. Members of royalty are specifically 
excluded from becoming members of Parliament despite Liberal 
attempts in this place.
<P>
	Future members of the House should not be forced to inherit a 
royal pension. Why should we in the 35th Parliament have the 
privilege of opting out while it is denied to future members? 
This may be a question of privilege. The government is 
attempting to create a two-tier pension scheme: one for 
members with a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12215"> 12215 </A></B>
<P>
conscience and one for those who want to get as much from the 
trough as they possibly can.
<P>
	I was listening to my colleague from Calgary Centre. He gave 
a very good illustration of the confusion around the pension 
plan. He said that originally we thought we were to have trough 
light and trough regular. Now he has found out there are trough 
regular, trough light and trough stout.
<P>
	The problem with the bill is that some of us want to abstain 
altogether. Future MPs will not be allowed that option and that is 
wrong. The legislation needs to be changed to correct a terrible 
precedent. The government is attempting to create a two-tier 
pension scheme: one for members with a conscience and one for 
those who are out for themselves, those who call themselves 
number one rather than the Canadian taxpayer who is paying the 
bill.
<P>
	There is no reason why all future members should not have the 
choice of opting out of the pension scheme. It is unacceptable 
that future Reform members, and there will be many, will have 
to participate in this outrageous pension plan along with future 
Liberal members, if there are any.
<P>
	If the government arranges it so that no members can opt out, I 
suppose Liberal MPs can continue to show sympathy for 
overburdened taxpayers who complain about MP pensions 
without having to make any sacrifices themselves. The only way 
to solve the problem and clear up the mess is to elect a Reform 
government and create a modest and a respectable pension plan, 
one of which we as MPs can be proud. We would not have to 
hang our heads in shame because we contribute to such a plan 
and, even worse, collect from such an outrageous plan.
<P>
	The Liberals know that the way the current severance package 
works for defeated or retiring members could be affected by 
exercising the opting out provision of the bill. They knew this 
yet made no provision for those effects of the legislation. They 
are trying to place many disincentives for opting out in the way 
of members wishing to do so. It is nothing more than an attempt 
to punish members for doing the responsible thing and opting 
out of a system that is unfair and out of line with the 
expectations of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Canadians are well aware of the ratio of public money to 
members in the contributions to the plan. They know the current 
pension plan would contribute $4.1 of taxpayers money for 
every dollar that members contribute. The minor changes in Bill 
C-85 move this ratio to $3.6 to $1. That is not much 
improvement when the number should be $1 to $1. The design of 
the pension plan is a little less scandalous, a little less immoral, 
if we follow the provisions of Bill C-85.
<P>
	Canadians are not happy that they contribute over three and a 
half times as much as members will to the new scheme. The ratio 
comes nowhere near the approximate $1 to $1 ratio used in the 
majority of private pension plans. Canadians are not happy with 
the souped up benefits for MPs. They want to know what 
justification exists for this imbalance.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> None.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> The member for Beaver River says there are 
none and I totally agree with her. The government cannot answer 
the public because there is no justification for such an inequity.
<P>
	The government should take into account that the days of 
traditional employment when someone worked for the same 
company or even in the same profession for their entire working 
life are over. I have heard the arguments in the House about 
being a successful business person or a school teacher who 
decided to make a sacrifice and run for election, about being 
elected and it ruining careers, about being unable to go back to 
their teaching positions or into business. I understand, but the 
solution is not to create a crazy pension plan like the one the 
Liberals are supporting. The solution is not only to enable MPs 
but all members of society in various professions to move their 
pension from one occupation to the next so that when they reach 
a legitimate retirement age they have an adequate pension in 
place.
<P>
	Let us talk about some common sense solutions to our 
problem. Let us not sit and whine and complain and say that 
because I made a voluntary decision to get into politics 
somehow I need to be coddled, babied and given an ultra lavish 
pension plan.
<P>
	Members of Parliament are good examples of people who 
change their professions. Most members have active careers 
before they are elected to this place and many return to them. 
Many times becoming a member of Parliament gives us an 
advantage when we go back into the workforce. It is not all 
gloom and doom like the Liberals would have us believe.
<P>
	Even some of the awful Conservatives who did all those 
terrible things and got kicked out of this place are gainfully 
employed right now. They are probably making as much or more 
money than they made when they were in the House. It certainly 
is not all gloom and doom.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Perrin Beatty is one of them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> As the member for Beaver River said, 
Perrin Beatty certainly seems to be doing all right for himself as 
are many of his colleagues and many former Liberals. With the 
quality of Reformers I am sure they will do well when they 
decide to leave political life.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12216"> 12216 </A></B>
<P>
	Before the budget when anti-tax rallies were being held 
across the country I had the privilege of attending one in 
Saskatoon. The people in that crowd did not want to see higher 
taxes. They told us in no uncertain terms to tell the government 
not to increase taxes in the budget. It did not listen. It brought in 
higher taxes. The people also said in no uncertain terms that the 
government had no right to increase taxes as long as it had a gold 
plated pension plan.
<P>
	I remember one person who came to the microphone and said: 
``I know MPs work hard but I work just as hard as they do. I 
make $20,000 a year and I do not get any pension. Why should 
they get an immoral pension, one that is so extravagant, just 
because they get to design their own pensions and I do not?''
<P>
	It is unfair. We should not be designing extravagant, lavish 
pension plans for ourselves. We should be considering the 
people in the real work world who work just as hard as we do and 
deserve fair treatment. We should be prepared to give them fair 
treatment.
<P>
	Bill C-85 fails to deliver an effective pension reform in two 
ways. It fails to bring MP pensions in line with the private 
sector. More important, it fails to bring MP pensions in line with 
what Canadians are willing to provide for members of 
Parliament. We cannot lose sight of the fact that we work for the 
Canadian public. If our employers think our pensions are too 
high then they must be reduced. It is the people's opinion that 
counts.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	For these reasons, unless the bill receives some very 
significant amendments along the lines of those my colleague 
from Beaver River mentioned in her speech, I would call on the 
members of the House to join me in defeating Bill C-85. In fact I 
would call on them to support the amendment that my colleague 
put forward.
<P>
	This bill is so flawed it needs to be sent back to committee. 
With your indulgence, I would like to move an amendment to the 
amendment made by the member for Beaver River. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be further amended by adding the words ``and report back to 
the House no later than June 23, 1995''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment to the 
amendment is in order.
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the 
House that the question to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for Kamloops-The

	The House resumed from March 13 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-232, an act to amend the Divorce Act 
(granting of access to, or custody of, a child to a grandparent) be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak on this issue as someone who grew up without knowing 
her grandparents because her grandparents were in another 
country. I have observed, as my brothers and sisters have had 
children, the special relationship that has developed between my 
parents and my nieces.
<P>
	Bill C-232 can be supported in principle for attempting to 
address a very distressing situation. The relationship between 
grandparent and grandchild is something very special. 
Particularly after their parents' divorce a grandparent can be an 
important resource to children, someone who can offer care and 
support and buffer children from the many changes and stresses 
associated with family breakdown.
<P>
	Research confirms the importance of the 
grandparent-grandchild relationship. Arthur Kornhaber, a noted 
child psychiatrist and researcher has conducted three years of 
lengthy, in depth, personal interviews with some 300 children 
and as many grandparents. His conclusion is that: ``The bond 
between grandparents and grandchildren is second in emotional 
power and influence only to the relationship between child and 
parent''. He has stated that a healthy and loving bond between 
grandparents and grandchildren is necessary for the emotional 
health and happiness of all three generations. This bond is a 
natural birthright for children, realized through an emotional 
attachment, a legacy bequeathed by their elders that benefits 
everyone in the family.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	Given this very special and valuable role that grandparents 
play in a child's life, it is very upsetting to hear about cases 
where children are being denied access to their grandparents 
because of some very bitter disputes.
<P>
	It is hoped that the situation is limited to unusual cases where 
the divorce has been especially bitter. However, it occurs 
frequently enough to warrant the formation of support groups. 
Organizations such as the Canadian Grandparents' Rights 
Association and Grandparents Requesting Access and Dignity 
help grandparents cope in these situations and do an admirable 
job.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12217"> 12217 </A></B>
<P>
	The reality is there are cases where grandparents who wish to 
be able to continue to have contact with their grandchildren are 
being denied this contact and are forced to withdraw from their 
grandchildren's lives.
<P>
	It is this situation that Bill C-232 proposes to address by 
identifying changes to the Divorce Act that could promote 
grandparent access. The main focus of Bill C-232 is an 
amendment to subsection 16(3) of the Divorce Act which 
currently states that a person, other than a spouse, may not make 
an application for child custody and access without leave of the 
court.
<P>
	That means that currently the grandparent-grandchild 
relationship is accorded the same value as a child's relationship 
with any other third party. Grandparents must obtain leave of the 
court to make an application for custody or access to the 
grandchild.
<P>
	The bill proposes an amendment that would distinguish the 
grandparent-grandchild relationship as a distinct type of 
relationship. It would give grandparents the same standing as 
parents so they would no longer be required to obtain leave to 
make such an application. Instead, grandparents would have 
independent standing to apply to the court for access or custody 
of their grandchild at the time the grandchild's parents are 
getting a divorce.
<P>
	This is an important change to make to the Divorce Act. It 
would mean that the Divorce Act would formally recognize 
grandparents' legal rights to have access to their grandchildren.
<P>
	Another important implication of the proposed amendment is 
that it would grant grandparents who have strong legitimate 
interests in their grandchildren greater leverage in their 
negotiations with the child's parents. This new legal standing 
would allow a grandparent to challenge a parent who is 
threatening to withhold or deny access without good cause. 
Hopefully the threat of a lawsuit would be enough to motivate 
that parent to resolve the dispute.
<P>
	For these reasons I rise in support of Bill C-232 and suggest 
that we should applaud it for attempting to emphasize the 
beneficial role that grandparents may play with respect to their 
grandchildren. However, I must say that there are some aspects 
of the bill as it currently reads which must be reviewed.
<P>
	First, there is concern that the bill may be over-reaching when 
it places grandparents on the same footing as parents for custody 
when the real problem is access. Consideration should be given 
to treating these two matters differently.
<P>
	In addition to allowing grandparents to apply for custody and 
access as of right, the bill proposes an amendment to section 
16(5) of the Divorce Act to give grandparents the same rights 
that this section currently provides to the parent who is granted 
access, namely the right to make inquiries and to be given 
information as to the health, education and welfare of the child.
<P>
	This proposal is problematic because private and confidential 
information such as this is normally only available to parents. It 
is not clear that there are valid policy reasons to allow 
grandparents with access rights to obtain this information, 
especially since other grandparents, those with grandchildren in 
intact families, may have no such right.
<P>
	It is also important to ask why grandparents need this right. It 
has to be recognized that different grandparents may have 
different motivations and that there is a potential for this 
amendment to promote further intergenerational disharmony if 
grandparents make use of the information they receive to 
challenge the custodial parent's decisions.
<P>
	This part of Bill C-232 should be reviewed carefully by the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, of which I am 
a member. The committee in reviewing the bill should be guided 
by the standard set out in section 16(8) of the Divorce Act which 
provides that in making any custody or access order the court 
should only take into consideration the best interests of the child 
of the marriage.
<P>
	This is the standard that has come to be accepted both in 
Canada and internationally as the appropriate standard to apply 
with respect to matters relating to children. It means that laws 
directly affecting children should focus on the needs and best 
interests of the child rather than on the rights of adults.
<P>
	It is this standard that the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs should utilize in assessing the other proposals of 
Bill C-232, such as the proposal to amend section 16(9) and (10) 
of the Divorce Act to include the word ``grandparent'' in the 
wording of these two provisions.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	It is important that courts, in assessing whether grandparent 
access would be in the child's interest, continue to consider the 
quality of the relationship that has existed in the past between 
grandparent and grandchild, as well as the amount of prior 
contacts. Evidence about the prior relationship between the 
parents and grandparents, especially if it is conflictual, is 
arguably also very important.
<P>
	In reviewing Bill C-232, the committee should also consider 
that while it allows grandparents to apply as of right to the courts 
for access to the grandchild, it does not address the problem 
about the high costs of these legal proceedings, costs which may 
very well be prohibitive to many grandparents and custodial 
parents.
<P>
	There is another important point that must be made. It should 
be recognized that there are limitations to what a court order can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12218"> 12218 </A></B>
<P>
accomplish and what the law can do to enforce it. It would be 
ideal if a court order awarding grandparent access could ensure 
that meaningful access could occur without further problems.
<P>
	Unfortunately this is not the case. The court cannot order 
people to change their attitudes, their feelings or manners of 
relating to one another. If the custodial parent continues to 
oppose access, the reality may very well be that attempts to 
enforce any access order would only lead to more conflict and 
perhaps even more litigation with the child caught in the middle. 
This can be detrimental to the well-being of the child.
<P>
	It may be that there is a need to attempt to address some of the 
underlying fundamental problems surrounding the issue of 
grandparent access. The issue is closely related to other child 
custody and access issues and perhaps should be addressed in a 
more comprehensive way.
<P>
	The committee in reviewing Bill C-232 may want to consider 
whether legislative reform alone can provide a solution to this 
very complex problem. Other non-legislative options that have 
been identified include judicial education, parenting education 
and improved counselling and mediation services. The 
committee may want to explore some of these longer term 
solutions to provide more services and supports to divorcing 
couples and their families, including the grandparents.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in the House today to speak on Bill C-232, an act 
to amend the Divorce Act. The aim of this bill is to relieve 
grandparents of the obligation to obtain special leave from the 
courts to apply for a provisional, permanent or amended court 
order for the custody of the children or access to them.
<P>
	At the moment, the Divorce Act contains no provision for 
grandparents' rights. Grandparents wishing to obtain custody of 
their grandchildren now must first apply to the courts for leave 
to debate the custody of their grandchildren.
<P>
	This bill would entitle grandparents to obtain information on 
the health, education and welfare of the child. It also provides 
that the amendments to the Divorce Act would be subject to 
review by a parliamentary committee four years after their 
coming into force.
<P>
	Bill C-232 would eliminate the need for grandparents to make 
this initial application and would enable them to be a party to the 
dispute.
<P>
	Parents divorce, but children do not. Today's family is 
considerably different from yesterday's. The patriarchal family 
of the past has changed and become mobile and temporary. With 
divorces, common-law unions and other arrangements, the 
family tree has been uprooted.
<P>
	The family of the year 2000 is born of the break-up of 
couples. The reconstituted family is a collection of members 
who are not all biologically related. No model exists for this new 
family. Each member must adjust by finding a way to function 
within the family unit.
<P>
	Studies tend to show that children can benefit from family 
reconstruction, which gives them another chance.
<P>
	The traditional family, when divorce did not take place, hid a 
lot of frustrations behind its air of respectability. However, the 
number of divorces still evokes some bitterness. Solutions have 
to be found for children to overcome their suffering, and 
grandparents have a vital role to play following the breakup of 
the family unit.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	As the official opposition critic for seniors organizations, I 
have a keen interest in this bill, but I feel I must point out some 
of the shortcomings of this attempt to improve the status of 
grandparents.
<P>
	In recent years, grandparents who were denied access to their 
grandchildren often asked the courts to intervene and grant them 
visiting rights.
<P>
	A number of anglophone associations were established, 
including GROWTH-Grandchildren-Grandparents Right of 
Wholesomeness Through Heritage, GRAND-Grandparents 
Requesting Access and Dignity, founded in 1983 in Toronto, and 
the Canadian Grandparents Rights Association in British 
Columbia. In French, GRAND becomes GRANDIR, which 
stands for Grands-parents réclamant accès, nouveau départ 
incitant retrouvailles. These associations are asking for federal 
legislation that would give grandparents easier access to their 
grandchildren.
<P>
	I think I should point out the excellent work being done by the 
organization Grands-parents-tendresse in Saint-Jérôme, in the 
riding of the hon. member for Laurentides, headed by Cécile 
Lampron, whose purpose is to develop intergenerational 
relationships by visiting schools, organizing group excursions 
with the children, helping young mothers after the birth of a 
child or during convalescence, and by offering services to single 
seniors.
<P>
	First of all, this bill is aimed only at the children of couples 
who are either divorced or about to divorce. The federal 
government has jurisdiction over divorce proceedings, but Bill 
C-232 may exceed this authority. Grandparents are not directly 
involved in the marriage, as is the case with parents and the 
children born of the marriage.
<P>
	Parental authority is a provincial matter, under subsection 
92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867. This is clearly an intrusion 
into an area under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Unlike Canadian common law, the access rights of 
grandparents to Quebec children are already provided for 
explicitly in Quebec's civil code. Section 611, passed in  
December 1980, says that the parents cannot, without good 
reason, prevent the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12219"> 12219 </A></B>
<P>
child from having a personal relationship with its grandparents. 
If the parties cannot agree, the terms and conditions of this 
relationship will be determined by the courts.
<P>
	Section 611 of the Civil Code may be invoked at any time 
before or after the divorce of the parents. In addition, this clause 
does nothing to define the notion of grandparents in the Divorce 
Act. We presume that section 579, which states the following, 
takes precedence: ``When adoption is granted, the effects of the 
preceding filiation cease''. The rights of the parents of a father 
or a mother could be revoked at the same time as those of the 
biological parents.
<P>
	In Quebec, section 611 resolves the issue of the grandparents' 
access to grandchildren and they may submit a petition at any 
time. Quebec has resolved this problem, but Canada's other 
provinces have not. Bill C-232 improves the position of 
grandparents and their grandchildren in other provinces, but 
only covers the children of married or divorced parents. As a 
consequence, this bill will change very little about the current 
laws regarding grandchildren in Quebec.
<P>
	Therefore, all common law provinces should pass a law like 
that in effect in Quebec. We believe Quebec's legislation shows 
the way in this area and should be used as a model.
<P>
	This bill has another shortcoming: grandparents' access to 
medical and school records. The Act Respecting Access to 
Documents Held by Public Bodies and the Protection of 
Personal Information is a law of Quebec governing a matter of 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Quebec has legislative power over marriages, property and 
civil rights, marriage contracts, adoption, separation from bed 
and board, custody, etc.
<P>
	Consequently, Bill C-232 increases the overlap in family law.
<P>
	In addition, under subsection 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 
1867, parental authority bestowed on the couple is an 
exclusively provincial jurisdiction. Therefore, the bill also 
infringes on a provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that Bill C-232 tends to protect the rights 
of grandparents in the other provinces of Canada, but 
unfortunately, it has shortcomings and the Bloc Quebecois must 
point out this obvious infringement on a provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Grandparents have an enormous role to play in the lives of 
their grandchildren during the years following a separation. 
They are exceptional compensations for the partial absence of a 
father or a mother. They can bring emotional and other stability 
to a child's life. Grandparents can often detect problems, but 
they cannot take part in discussions, because, often, intruding in 
such a way can only aggravate an already adverse climate.
<P>
	In closing, the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, will 
put aside the few misgivings it has and will support Bill C-232 
which was introduced by my kind colleague for 
Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is in the name of my 
own mother, who was a mother and a grandmother, and in view 
of the progress being made in the changing family unit 
nowadays, that I support the spirit of this motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The family is a changing unit in 1995. Certainly from my own 
perspective, I have to pay a special tribute to my mother who 
prevailed upon me to make sure I got my views on this issue on 
the record. From the perspective of my daughter, my mother has 
been an invaluable role model and a very important anchor in a 
changing world. I understand the difficulty sometimes of 
legislating familial relationships. Obviously the best interest of 
the child has to be the guiding principle in any dispute of a 
familial nature, but the spirit of this legislation is worth 
supporting.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise to speak on Bill C-232, an 
act to amend the Divorce Act, sponsored by my colleague from 
Mission-Coquitlam who is herself a grandparent. I know she 
has put a lot of time and effort into creating and promoting this 
piece of legislation. I must commend her.
<P>
	I would also like to make reference to the gallery and the 
attendance of a number of interested persons in this particular 
legislation. I commend them for their attendance.
<P>
	With reference to the previous speaker's comment on the 
changing world, I sometimes wonder if we are not today playing 
a bit of catch up here. Some of the principles or the things we 
were used to in days gone by just slipped away from us because 
of various other things that were occurring in our world.
<P>
	For example, technological developments such as 
transportation and communication have had a tremendous effect 
on how we live our lives today. We travel farther. The world is 
much smaller. On the other hand, we can communicate much 
quicker with each other. We have E-mail for example. Even in 
my lifetime, and I do not like to think I am that old, I can 
remember the first telephone in our neighbourhood.
<P>
	We look at such an amendment where we are talking about 
general access and we have the technological equipment. The 
resources are there for this kind of thing.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12220"> 12220 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Another thing has snuck up on us from the days when a small 
percentage of people did not have access to grandparents due to 
distance, death or whatever. It now seems to have turned the 
other way. We are suddenly aware that this very important 
aspect of our lives has slipped away from us.
<P>
	One of the other things that contributes to that is the advances 
made in health care, not only from the point of view of our 
attitude toward living a healthier lifestyle but also through 
medical research with which we can prolong our life. 
Consequently, we are living longer. The average person's 
lifespan has gone to 72 years from 25 or 30 years ago when it 
was six months after one retired at 65.
<P>
	Some of the things we have seen come out of what has 
affected our lives are such things as higher divorce rates and 
family break-ups. The average marriage lasts something like 
five years. It might be seven, I am not exactly sure on that 
statistic. A higher divorce rate is a given in today's society. 
Family break-ups are occurring. It is a two working parents 
society as well. The standard of living that could be enjoyed on 
one income in 1960 now requires two.
<P>
	Those kinds of things have had an effect on us. They have 
created situations in today's society. We find ourselves trying to 
come up with some way to get that component back into our life 
of the family, including the grandparents.
<P>
	One of the previous speakers got into a legal concept. What I 
am suggesting here is that we look at the intent of the law more 
so than the letter of the law. There will be time enough for the 
letter of the law when it gets into committee. Then we can get 
our learned people in those areas to address those issues. This 
House has to say what the intent is. The intent is to get a family 
structure or have the grandparents included in the family 
structure.
<P>
	Another thing in our society today versus 20 or 25 years ago is 
the advent of new Canadians who do not necessarily have a 
European background. We hear more and more about the 
extended family. We are trying to put that into some sort of a 
parameter as to what that actually means. We also hear of the 
extended family in our aboriginal groups.
<P>
	It is time that we looked at these new concepts. If there are 
some legal barriers in recognizing these in law, then it is our 
responsibility to see how we can overcome them. The extended 
family could include the grandparents quite nicely. I would 
prefer that.
<P>
	I realize there are very many different ways a divorce 
situation can turn out. On the other hand, if there are children 
involved in a situation who are going to go into the social service 
realm and foster parent situations and there are grandparents 
sitting right there who have to get a court order to apply to get 
into that situation, that just does not make logical sense to me.
<P>
	When we address this point by point, we must look at the 
bottom line and know that the overall objective is what is best 
for that child. On average, we can argue that the family and the 
grandparents in normal situations are what is best for the child. 
There will always be the isolated cases.
<P>
	When we get down to looking at it line by line or looking at 
the letter of the law, that is when we address those issues. What I 
am trying to say now is that there are four amendments here. One 
is asking not to have to go to court to make an application to 
apply for access. That does not mean to say they are going to get 
it, but when they have made the decision to make an application 
they have to trot off to court first.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Another amendment we must address is the right to know. As I 
related earlier, we have all of these wonderful advances such as 
E-mail and television and we can fly on the Concorde to 
goodness knows where and how fast. I certainly think that at 
some point we should be able as the intellectual animal of this 
planet to come into some sort of situation in which we can 
recognize what is best for the child. If there is animosity at the 
time the court is making these kinds of decisions, I still believe 
there are ways in which what is best for the child can be 
addressed and that we can use this technology to that end. A year 
from now the situation might be a little better and people might 
get over their feelings and start thinking more about what is 
actually happening to their loved ones on both ends of the age 
scale.
<P>
	Another thing that comes into this concept is our roots and our 
family tree. If we do not keep in touch with each other that will 
be much more difficult to keep track of. I believe there are a 
number of people who find that important in their lives.
<P>
	With respect to geographic living conditions, I am not too 
familiar with what is happening in divorce rates, but it is my 
understanding that when access is granted to one of the parents 
there are usually restrictions placed upon where these people 
can live. They get a geographic area in which they can live so 
that the other side can have access. I am suggesting that will not 
survive long in our society. At some point that will be addressed, 
and maybe this is a good time to do it. As I have said, 
communication and transportation are not the problems they 
once were. I am much more familiar with the geography of 
British Columbia, and I can remember when it took two and a 
half days to get from Kimberley to Vancouver, which can now be 
done in almost nine hours, or ten hours if you are not speeding. 
Surely to goodness we should be able to look at these kinds of 
things to resolve these barriers.
<P>
	I would like to reinforce that it is a given when we look back at 
situations in our past, when there was the family unit, including 
brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and grandparents, that it was 
always the grandparents in that family unit who were constant. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12221"> 12221 </A></B>
<P>
may have lost touch  with my brother and his wife for a while, 
but I never lost touch with my parents.
<P>
	I encourage this House and all hon. members to unite behind 
this non-partisan issue and support the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise because I also feel very strongly about this bill. I have the 
fortune of having grandparents and I have the fortune of having 
an extended family. Unfortunately, my son never had that 
luxury. My parents and my in-laws are in Italy. I always felt 
guilty, because I know what a comfort grandparents can be, both 
for the family and for the children.
<P>
	When I went to Italy with my son, who was then five, I 
realized how much he and his grandfather were alike and how 
much they missed each other and how much they enjoyed each 
other.
<P>
	I believe that we have to always take into consideration the 
needs the children have. We seem to forget that many times. 
Since we are adults and we are the ones who have to help 
children to get what they need, I think we should definitely 
support this particular piece of legislation and make sure that 
the children are taken care of and that we allow their 
grandparents to take care of them whenever possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is an honour today to speak to this private 
member's bill. My colleague from Mission-Coquitlam I know 
has worked very hard over the last few months travelling across 
the country talking to groups about this legislation. I would like 
to advise the House that the response out there has been 
overwhelming in support.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	There are many voids in the Divorce Act. For example, at the 
present time in a divorce case grandparents do have to seek leave 
of the court to obtain standing to discuss the question of access 
to their grandchildren. This bill will give grandparents an 
automatic right to the standing to participate at court.
<P>
	I am not a grandparent, but I hope to be some day. I think most 
of us want to experience that joy. Sure, it might make us feel a 
little older, but these days what does not make us feel older?
<P>
	As parents and grandparents we want to see that our 
grandchildren have the best quality of life. There is nothing 
wrong with this. But the law can divide, and we need to mitigate 
against that. To me, grandparents have always seemed rather 
stable. Perhaps it stems from the notion that the older you get, 
the wiser you become.
<P>
	I recently read an article in which a federal official was quoted 
as saying: ``In the great majority of cases, it would be in the best 
interests of children to see their grandparents. They can be a real 
stabilizing force''.
<P>
	I understand the Minister of Justice is not quite in support of 
this legislation. Why? Apparently he feels that if Bill C-232 is 
passed the courts would be flooded with  litigation, causing a 
tremendous backlog. I do not think so.
<P>
	I spent enough time working within the British Columbia 
family and divorce courts to know that including grandparents 
in contested divorce cases will only improve matters, not make 
them worse. As the Divorce Act currently states in section 
17(2), ``a person other than a spouse may not make an 
application under paragraph 1(b) without leave of the court''.
<P>
	The minister may say that if we allow grandparents a say at 
the original hearing it will increase litigation. My experience 
says otherwise. Extended families must be encouraged to take 
more responsibility for their own and come to the rescue or 
backstop the social alternatives considered in child custody and 
access disputes.
<P>
	In clause 3(1) it states: ``On the expiration of four years after 
the coming into force of this act, the provisions contained herein 
shall be referred to such committee of the House of Commons or 
of the Senate or of the Houses of Parliament as may be 
designated or established by Parliament for that purpose''.
<P>
	If that measure is adopted, Parliament will conduct a 
comprehensive review of these provisions in four years. The 
Minister of Justice is afraid of guarantees like this. He does not 
put guaranteed reviews into his bills because he is perhaps afraid 
that down the road legislation may be changed because it is 
really flawed. Why does the minister not put such a clause in 
Bill C-68, for instance? Maybe he fears the results.
<P>
	Certainly family law needs fundamental review. I am not 
encouraged that the justice minister will produce any 
substantive changes soon. But this bill is not only about 
grandparents, it is also about grandchildren. It is vitally 
important that we have legal protection for them.
<P>
	We recognize that all grandparents are beneficial for their 
grandchildren. There are times when they should be denied 
direct access or should not be involved, but that should be the 
exception by an order. This is why we have courts and judges. 
They are the decision makers in those contested cases. All 
relevant voices must be heard in difficult cases, and this bill 
facilitates that help. The best interests of the child is still the 
operative principle.
<P>
	All that is being done here is awarding the grandparent the 
right to have a voice. That is essentially all we are asking to have 
changed.
<P>
	This morning I received a copy of the speech the Liberal 
member for South Shore was to give today but could not because 
of previous commitments. The member clearly is in favour of 
this legislation. The member for Nepean is another member who 
I know supports this legislation. Therefore, I would encourage 
members of the Liberal Party to consult with their colleagues on 
this bill and find out what their feelings are.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12222"> 12222 </A></B>
<P>
	Certainly members of the Reform Party are behind this 
legislation. We believe that it is needed as one small step in a 
larger effort to update and simplify family law.
<P>
	Reading some of the comments the member for Nepean has 
made on this bill, I understand that there are some parts she has 
difficulty with, but this is understandable. This is why the House 
of Commons has standing committees: to deal with legislation, 
to bring in the experts and go over it with a fine-tooth comb.
<P>
	I have been a divorce mediator. As an officer of the court in 
the past, I have investigated circumstances and made 
recommendations and written recommendations about child 
custody and access. It is my considered opinion from within the 
system that in general family law is in somewhat of a disarray. 
But clarifying the role for grandparents in hotly contested cases 
is a help, not a hindrance. A strong legal climate as a backdrop 
encourages mediated settlements and alternative solutions.
<P>
	Indeed, the court is a very blunt instrument to settle family 
matters, but clarity and resolve in the law can only help children. 
Sometimes these matters deteriorate into a swirl of struggles 
and manoeuvres and the real needs of children and their wishes 
are forgotten.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	This bill deserves to be sent to the standing committee. It 
would represent a very positive step toward the protection and 
development of the child who is caught up in these unfortunate 
circumstances.
<P>
	Therefore, on behalf of many grandparents rights groups 
across the country, including the British Columbia based 
Canadian Grandparents Rights Association, I want to fully 
endorse this bill and commend it to this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to take a few minutes and say a few words on 
this bill. In particular, I think I would be remiss if I did not take 
the time of the House to remind all of us not only of the good 
work the hon. member proposing the bill has done, but equally 
the work of the hon. member for Nepean.
<P>
	I hope, Mr. Speaker, you will allow me to say this in spite of 
the fact that it is not customary to our rules, but the member for 
Nepean is unable to be here because of illness. Because of that, I 
hope, Mr. Speaker, you will be lenient with the application of 
that rule.
<P>
	The hon. member for Nepean is ill. She had very extensive 
surgery some time back and of course cannot participate in this 
debate today. However, I am sure all members will know of the 
work she has done, as well as the hon. member proposing the bill 
today. If the member for Nepean were here, she would no doubt 
want to be participating in this debate and giving it her full 
support as well.
<P>
	On behalf of the hon. member for Nepean, I thought I would 
take a moment in the House to indicate what I believe to be her 
support and the support of several other hon. members who have 
worked on this initiative as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As we all know, the hon. member for Nepean had tabled a bill 
similar to the one now before the House several years ago during 
the previous Parliament. She put forward an analogous bill 
during this Parliament. Being absent from the House for health 
reasons, she is unable to address this House today. I know that 
the House will vote on this motion in a few minutes.
<P>
	I am unable to vote by proxy on her behalf because that is not 
the practice in this House. However, if such were the case, I am 
sure she would have asked me to vote in favour of this bill. The 
least I can do is to mention all the work she has done on this bill, 
along with the hon. member who proposed the bill today. I also 
wish to commend the hon. member for Nepean for her work on 
this issue, not only in this Parliament but also in the past several 
years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to rise today to make a few comments on Bill C-232 
tabled by our hon. colleague, the hon. member for 
Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
	Since the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
spoke about the health of the hon. member for Nepean, allow me 
to point out that we think about her often, especially when we 
are dealing with issues such as this one which affect the most 
vulnerable in our society.
<P>
	The bill before us today is no magic solution. I believe, 
however, that it is a step in the right direction. Indeed, Quebec, 
which is concerned about its areas of jurisdiction, has always 
looked with a very critical eye at amendments to the Divorce Act 
and to family law, because it knows that we must still live in a 
federal system for a certain time and tries to balance federal and 
provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	Are we dealing with a filiation problem or a divorce problem? 
What is the situation? We could debate this for a long time.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	In any case, we have before us a provision which would allow 
grandparents to avoid the additional step required of any third 
party in divorce proceedings. A neighbour is not treated any 
differently from a child's grandparent in being granted access or 
custody rights in divorce proceedings.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12223"> 12223 </A></B>
<P>
	That obstacle would be eliminated. In the eyes of the law, 
grandparents would, for all practical purposes, be reintegrated 
into the slightly extended family unit. So this provision may be a 
step forward.
<P>
	As I said at the outset, we should not see this amendment to 
the 1985 Divorce Act as a magic solution. A similar provision, 
which covers all children, whether they were born to married 
couples or common law partners, has been in effect in Quebec 
since 1981. Having practised family law since 1981, I can tell 
you that grandparents are not rushing to make applications to the 
courts. Since 1981, few grandparents have applied for access in 
Quebec.
<P>
	Today, grandparents applying to the courts in Quebec do so 
only when the conflict is quite serious. Grandparents, the 
grandfather or grandmother-who should have reached a point 
in their lives when they could start relaxing a little-often must 
go against their wishes and say: ``Well, I must retain the services 
of a lawyer, I am going to take my own son or my own daughter, 
or my son- or daughter-in-law, to court and I am going to take 
this to the limit, with all of the emotions that go with it''. Not 
many grandparents insist on an all-out battle: their lives already 
have been one, they have had their children, raised them and 
worked all of their lives. So, we must not think that this clause 
will be the magic solution.
<P>
	However, the fact that such a disposition is even included in 
the bill could make many divorce lawyers strongly advise their 
clients to do the following: ``Give the grandparents the right to 
visit their grandchildren. Otherwise, they could take you to 
court in the future to fight for it''.
<P>
	This kind of provision could prevent a great number of legal 
disputes and is better than using court cases to settle them.
<P>
	I also think that we could use our vote on a bill like this one to 
send a very clear signal to the courts which must interpret these 
laws, and that is to listen very carefully to the petitions of 
grandparents before declining their requests for the right to pick 
up their grandchildren to take them out from noon to four for a 
pop and a Big Mac and to bring them to a park to play before 
being forced to take them back home. The courts should perhaps 
also give them a little more time together, because it takes time 
to bond. In the era of broken families, we are all aware of how 
difficult it is to rebuild the ties between our children and their 
parents and grandparents.
<P>
	Thus, all of the aspects that have been raised during this 
debate show that we have the opportunity to help remedy a 
rampant and very serious social ill. And, although this bill is not 
perfect, I think it should be passed at second reading and sent for 
consideration to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate. 
Colleagues, the Chair was given an indication previously that if 
an opportunity arose the mover of the motion, the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam, asked that she be able to summarize for 
not more than two minutes, understanding that no one else 
would speak afterward. She would close the debate. Is that 
agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to close the third hour of 
debate on the bill. I want to personally thank all those members 
who took part in the debate.
<P>
	As many members know, this bill has a long history. In the last 
Parliament my good friend from Ottawa West championed the 
cause of grandparents. She presented petitions containing over 
8,000 names requesting that the Divorce Act be amended to give 
grandparents status before the courts in the case of divorce of 
their married children along with status to ensure that the 
presiding judge would take into consideration the rights of 
grandparents to grandchildren.
<P>
	My good friend from Nepean, who could not be with us 
tonight, has worked very hard on this. I have been talking with 
her on many occasions on this bill, which both of us had before 
the House.
<P>
	More important, this bill addresses the cause of many 
grandchildren across the country who seek access to their 
grandparents. I have had the great privilege in the past few 
months to meet and speak to literally hundreds of grandparents 
across the country. They tell me that what they want is the 
opportunity to be heard in the courts.
<P>
	There have been many concerns expressed about the part of 
the bill that gives grandparents the right to make inquiries about 
the child, inquiries the parents may not have the right to make. 
This can be amended in committee.
<P>
	It is my belief that the bill will reduce litigation, not increase 
it. All outstanding issues will be dealt with at the same time 
under the same judge.
<P>
	Again, I would like to thank everyone present. I urge all 
members to vote in favour of sending this bill to committee for 
further study.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 6.20 p.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 93, the time provided for debate has 
expired. Accordingly, the question is as follows. Is it the 
pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-85, an act to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act and to provide for the continuation of a certain 
provision, be read the second time and referred to a committee; 
and of the amendment; and of the amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my delight to rise to speak to Bill C-85. I speak in 
opposition to this bill, an act to amend the Members of 
Parliament Retiring Allowances Act.
<P>
	I found it very interesting today to listen to the debate and to 
some of the rhetoric that has surrounded it. As we address the 
debate from this side of the House, we certainly are representing 
the mood and the voice of Canadians in opposing a pension plan 
which is far above and beyond anything any other Canadian 
outside of this place could enjoy or ever think about.
<P>
	The Reform Party bases its decision on the principles put 
down within the party from its inception. My opposition to this 
bill is based on certain of these principles that the Reform Party 
holds. Let me remind members of two of those.
<P>
	Principle 17 of the party states: ``We believe in public service, 
that governments, civil servants, politicians and political parties 
exist to serve the people and that they should demonstrate this 
service and commitment at all times''.
<P>
	Principle 18 states: ``We believe that public money should be 
regarded by government as `funds held in trust' and that 
government should practise fiscal responsibility to balance 
expenditures and revenues''.
<P>
	Both of these principles deal directly with the issue at hand 
today. It is from these principles that this party, since its 
inception, developed a policy on MP pensions.
<P>
	The Reform Party policy on MP pensions states that it 
opposes the current pension schemes for members of 
Parliament. We would end full indexation of these pensions. We 
would postpone eligibility for benefits until at least age 60 with 
eligibility further postponed by the amount of time in which the 
person has already been paid prior to age 60. We would subject 
the MP pension to a tax back according to a formula identical to 
that of the old age security.
<P>
	Compare our policy with the vague and general policy I have 
heard quoted here today of which the Liberals seem proud which 
is outlined in their red book: ``The pension regime of members 
of Parliament has been the focus of considerable controversy. It 
is now the subject of an independent review which Liberals 
support. We believe that reform is necessary''.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	It is of some small comfort to know the Liberals have finally 
and only seemingly recently realized the MP pension scheme is 
an affront to Canadians. I have heard it and I am sure they have 
heard it. It has taken a while to sink in though. It is also 
interesting to note the Liberal policy uses the word reform. I will 
quote again: ``We believe reform is necessary''.
<P>
	From the vague Liberal policy, which often happens with 
vague policies, Bill C-85 has flowed, a bill that I believe is 
totally unacceptable.
<P>
	I am sure everyone has heard that 52 Reform MPs will be 
opting out. My Reform colleagues have come here from 
ordinary communities, homes with families. We have mortgages 
too. Like our colleagues on the other side, we want security for 
our homes. We want security for our families, for ourselves and 
our loved ones, just like every other Canadian. However, we 
have come to this place to show leadership in difficult times. We 
were sent here to show leadership in difficult times. We as a 
party cannot in good conscience claim to lead by example by 
participating in a plan such as has been shown here.
<P>
	Let me explain a few points on how this diverts directly from 
what ordinary Canadians might experience. First, this bill raises 
the age of eligibility to age 55. It raises it to age 55. But what 
about the age of 55? This is totally unacceptable. Ordinary 
Canadians only receive their full pension benefits, their CPP and 
old age security at age 65. Notice there is a difference of 10 
years. What is 10 years? Ten years is a long time.
<P>
	Why does the government still persist in maintaining this 
discrepancy? Fairness calls for members of Parliament to be 
eligible at the same age as the people they purport to represent. 
After all, the entire concept behind our parliamentary system is 
that all of us in this House represent the common people. That is 
why it is called the House of Commons. Have they forgotten this 
on that side of this House?
<P>
	A second concern is that under Bill C-85 full indexation of 
the MP pension to the level of inflation remains from the date 
that an MP retires. This again is an affront to the average 
Canadian whose pension income is not indexed to inflation. It is 
another example of how privileged members of Parliament have 
been and will continue to be under this government's proposed 
``reform'' of the pension scheme.
<P>
	I also find it interesting that once again this bill shows a 
duplicity in high sounding statistics. We are told benefits will 
now accumulate at a rate that will drop by 1 per cent. An accrual 
rate of 4 per cent instead of 5 per cent is still above the legal 
limit of what any other Canadian enjoys. It has been 
accommodated by book work, or by putting it into two pots or 
whatever. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12225"> 12225 </A></B>
<P>
The fact remains it is something Canadians legally cannot enjoy 
otherwise.
<P>
	At the same time as this goes down by 1 per cent, the amount 
the MPs pay into the plan decreases by 2 per cent. Perhaps I 
could throw in the concept of one for you and two for me and if 
we do it quickly enough maybe no one will notice. It is a sort of 
shell game. It is no wonder the Canadians I hear have given up 
faith in this place. They have a right to be cynical if government 
plays games with the numbers and with the things they 
represent.
<P>
	The government also claims that significant savings will 
result from these measures. It is true that now the taxpayers' 
contribution will be at a ratio of approximately 3.5 to 1 
compared to the members' contribution, down from what we 
considered to be seven to one before. That was obscene.
<P>
	It is also true that most of this change resulted from the 
actuarial realities of a lower rate simply because of the large 
number of new members in this place. That is, this ratio even 
with the old plan would have been approximately four to one had 
no changes at all been made to this pension plan because of the 
difference in the membership in this place.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Therefore little has changed in spite of the government's 
rhetoric and platitudes on this issue. The bill it put forward is 
smoke and mirrors. In fact little has changed in this place in 
spite of the government's rhetoric and platitudes on many 
things.
<P>
	In my riding in the greater Vancouver region there is a 
significant and expanding portion of the population that is 
retired and receiving pension income. How can the government 
and the President of the Treasury Board who proposes this bill 
justify keeping the full indexation of MP pensions that those 
people, those families, those individuals in my area do not 
enjoy? How can the government and the President of the 
Treasury Board justify not making the age of pension eligibility 
consistent with what average Canadians can expect and what 
they experience?
<P>
	This bill represents the gulf between what Canadians expect 
and what the government delivers. Should the rules be different 
for those that lead than for those whom they serve?
<P>
	Our party brought this issue to the fore. As a result the 
government has given the House and the Canadian people a mere 
token. The government has failed once again to bridge that gulf, 
and the gulf between it and the people of Canada remains even 
after the rhetoric of this bill.
<P>
	On page 11 of the red book it states that Canadians have to see 
themselves as belonging to a society of reciprocal obligations in 
which each of us is responsible for the well-being of the other. 
Canadians know this intuitively. That is mighty sounding but I 
would like to take that quote within the context of this MP 
pension plan and compare it to the 45,000 civil servants that now 
are facing being laid off from their place of work.
<P>
	I take that quote within the context, and take the obscene 
pension plan that we still see in place and compare it with 
government cutbacks in the funding of medicare to the 
provinces. I take that quote within the context of the MP pension 
plans and compare it with struggling Canadian families faced 
with outrageous tax burdens, many of whom therefore are not 
even able themselves to put money toward an RRSP at the end of 
the year.
<P>
	Another concern I have with the bill is that it has been 
thoroughly politicized. Initially the President of the Treasury 
Board was to have introduced the bill in February before the 
government tabled its budget. It is now May 4. Four months 
have gone by. What delayed its introduction? The President of 
the Treasury Board had to ensure that all the various interests 
within the cabinet and caucus were represented and that those 
interests were placated.
<P>
	I ask the President of the Treasury Board, whose interests is 
he representing? Is he representing the interests of his cabinet 
and caucus colleagues or is he, as he should, representing the 
interests of the Canadian people who have been loudly 
demanding genuine reform to the MP pension scheme for a long 
time?
<P>
	Politics and rhetoric are an integral part of the government's 
approach. Good schemes and fair proposals have been put 
forward by outside sources and even by some government 
members. These have been rejected and replaced by rhetoric 
which is answered at every turn by comments about pay scales 
and double dipping.
<P>
	When challenged on the continuing arrogance of the new 
pension plan, why does the government insist on talking about 
pay scales? If MPs' salaries are not acceptable, then change 
them. Do not use them as an excuse for the pension plan. Do not 
divert the issue from the scandalous pension scheme that 
continues to exist.
<P>
	What of the issue of double dipping? What is the real issue 
here? Once again the government tries to divert attention in 
other directions. The issue that concerns Canadians is 
patronage. The issue is choosing political friends to fill 
positions, letting them feed from the public trough and the 
attitude of gross arrogance toward the taxpayer in doing so.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	I will only take the time to briefly recall for Canadians some 
of the very recent and ongoing issues that relate to this, like the 
Pearson airport review, the Lobbyists Registration Act, the 
expensive and self-serving byelections made necessary by 
Senate and other appointments, the Power Corporation contro-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12226"> 12226 </A></B>
<P>
versy that exists today and even our elusive and unaccountable 
ethics counsellor. The list goes on and on.
<P>
	The real issue here is special favours, concessions and 
decisions made by the government that fly in the face of the trust 
of Canadians and the trust that they expect in their 
parliamentary system. What do we get in terms of pension 
reform? What is significant in their version of the end of double 
dipping?
<P>
	It only means that the obscene amounts of publicly funded 
pension dollars grow behind the scenes for those lucky 
recipients of government appointments. I would like to say that 
an abuse of the public trust is an abuse no matter which way you 
cut it.
<P>
	With the help of some professionals within the insurance 
industry, actually the Mutual Life branch in Surrey, I have 
received some numbers for normal pension expectations. I 
related it to our longest standing Reform MP, the member for 
Beaver River, who would in the old plan receive $1.8 million in 
pension at age 75.
<P>
	With this bill and the changes that have been introduced, the 
government comes to the Canadian people and boldly says that 
this is a fair plan. The numbers indicate that our qualifying 
member would have received, had she chosen not to opt out, 
mostly at the expense of the Canadian taxpayer, a whopping $1.2 
million still. The pension is reduced from $1.8 to $1.2 million.
<P>
	That member plus the rest of the Reformers have chosen to opt 
out. I would like briefly to put forward the cost she will pay to do 
this very thing.
<P>
	It is of note that Canadians should be aware of that difference. 
They should know what the difference is between what normal 
Canadians might have to do in putting aside their own pension 
and what it is that this place considers fair, equitable and can 
receive without blushing at the fact that they will take this 
without an apology to the Canadian people.
<P>
	It is a statement of the integrity of our member that she is 
prepared to opt out. If that member contributes her portion of the 
pension allotment into her own RRSP plan instead of this gold 
plated pension plan of the government, she would receive a 
pension at age 60. I put it at age 60. It is not like age 55. It is not 
the freedom 55 that is proposed by the government. At age 60, 
like some other Canadians, or perhaps 65, that pension would be 
less than $15,000 a year. Therefore her total payment if taken to 
age 75 would be approximately one-quarter of a million dollars. 
It is something like $228,000.
<P>
	In trying to put aside her own pension scheme, she will come 
out with a one-quarter million dollar payment as opposed to the 
revised government plan which would give her one and a quarter 
million dollars. Making this decision will cost our member 
approximately $1 million. Do members think she is doing that 
easily? Do members think she is doing that on a whim? The very 
fact that we would take this position shows how strongly we 
feel. We in turn mirror how Canadians feel on this issue.
<P>
	Leadership must start in this place or else the future of the 
country is in very great danger. Our party wants a fair plan. Our 
party wants a plan that is comparable to the private sector. Our 
party also wants to provide security for our families and for 
Canadian families. The plan must start here.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	Some of the details of the plan are these. All members who 
have less than six years of experience as of October 25, 1993 
have the right to opt out of the plan. As we have said, it will not 
be and it is not an easy decision for the class of '88 in this place. 
However, on the basis of principle, we challenge the class of '88 
or later members on the Liberal side to do what is right and just 
for the Canadian people. If you go to your constituents and ask 
them, I know the answer-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wish to remind the 
House that all interventions must be made through the Chair and 
not directly across the floor, using the word ``you this'' or ``you 
that'' but having everything through the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, if they go to their constituents they 
will certainly hear what I have heard, that the people of Canada 
are sick to death of the abuse of their tax dollars. They need 
leadership which responds to what they have to go through these 
days.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is not so in St. Thomas.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> I would be very surprised if that is the case.
<P>
	For those who have more than six years of experience, they 
will continue to receive this gold plated pension for that period 
under the old regime. We have members of the front bench and 
the back bench on this side and on the other side who have to be 
accountable to the people they represent.
<P>
	I will conclude with some statements on the challenges that 
we are facing. Canada is facing challenges like never before. 
Those challenges are in the areas of finance, socially and 
internationally. The challenges we have these days are extreme, 
unique and great.
<P>
	This government and this place needs to walk with Canadians 
hand in hand. First it must connect with the reality that 
Canadians face day to day. The gulf between this place and 
Canadian people has widened vastly in the last 20 years.
<P>
	For the government to try to cross that distance with a bridge 
that goes only a fraction of the way is no solution at all. It does 
nothing to reconcile the distance. Actually it puts the 
government at a very great risk. If the bridge between this place 
and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12227"> 12227 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian people is not built in its entirety, the chasm between 
the two will swallow those who simply pretend to cross it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
address the subamendment to Bill C-85 which requests that the 
government report back by June 23 with some improvements to 
the bill.
<P>
	I would like to do two things: cover an area that is in the 
Liberal red book on pensions and talk a little about what is 
happening here tonight.
<P>
	In the red book at page 92, the Liberal government says that 
the pension regime of members of Parliament has been the focus 
of considerable controversy. That is an understatement. It is now 
the subject of an independent review which the Liberals support. 
They believe that reform is necessary. We agree. ``Whatever the 
results of the independent review, a Liberal government will 
reform the pension plan of members of Parliament to end double 
dipping''.
<P>
	This is the issue I want to have clarified. I hope when they 
report back by June 23 it is clarified to the degree that all these 
accusations from across the floor about double dipping and 
which members are double dipping will cease and desist.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	Today the President of the Treasury Board explained what 
double dipping was. He said that MPs, people who have been in 
the House, should not be able to leave this office and receive a 
pension from the federal government if they accept a new full 
time paying job from the federal government. In addition, they 
will review the question of the minimum age at which pensions 
will begin to be paid.
<P>
	The government introduced a minimum age of 55, which 
should be 65. On the issue of double dipping I would like to 
point out members on the other side like to accuse a certain 
member on this side, the member for Lethbridge, of double 
dipping. The member for Lethbridge is elected to this position, 
not appointed to this position, as former MPs are like Joe Clark, 
who was appointed to head up some agency is getting an MP 
pension plus a salary for heading up that agency, a position to 
which he was not elected.
<P>
	There is a big difference. Double dipping means you are 
appointed to an agency or a board and still receive an MP's 
pension. That will cease and desist. I commend the government 
for that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I will applaud once the other side understands what 
double dipping is.
<P>
	The thing I would like to point out is the Reform Party's 
criticism of the MP pension. It is three tier, trough regular for all 
the old MPs, trough light for all the rookies who are too weak 
and lack the fortitude to stand up to the veterans, and the trough 
stout, all the extra perks and privileges this pension provides to 
those cabinet ministers where there is no cap on what they 
contribute on their extra salary.
<P>
	This three tier pension plan is unacceptable to the Canadian 
public we believe simply because it sets a double standard, one 
for politicians, MPs and senators, and one for the private sector. 
The reason it is so high is they say the salary is low. I have heard 
today about the sacrifice of the family, the children and the 
grandchildren and it is something they build toward. I do not 
deny those emotional arguments.
<P>
	On the same emotional basis why not come clean with the 
Canadian public and simply state the compensation package 
should be addressed? We should not have three or four different 
sets of rules. Let us clean it up. Let us pay politicians what we 
believe they are worth or what they deserve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Give us a number.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Twelve thousand dollars a month and then look 
after your own pension plan. This is my point of view.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I am again trying 
to maintain the best parliamentary debate possible. I encourage 
members to address themselves through the chair. In the event 
that we get to question and comments they will have an 
opportunity to debate the last intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate those comments. You 
remind me of my football coach who said that if you have rabbit 
ears you will never be a success in this business. I believe that 
should apply in the House as well.
<P>
	As of today I will no longer have rabbit ears. I will only focus 
my comments to you and through you to the other side and to the 
public.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I cannot pass it up. Maybe 
it is the hour. I know all of us make promises. I know we do our 
best, our darndest, to meet each and every one of those.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Thank you, coach-I mean, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I want to explain to voters what is happening. The Reform 
Party wants a proper pension plan commensurate with the 
private sector, compensation for MPs at a level that the sacrifice 
is compensated for. The salaries are too low. The pensions are 
far too great. We should have a balance between the two. That is 
what we are recommending.
<P>
	We are trying to debate this fully. We want to see full 
disclosure on all the items in this pension plan so the Canadian 
public understands it.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	The government today introduced a motion to extend the 
hours of debate. It wants us to use up all our speakers so it can 
rush this through to committee so the Canadian public does not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12228"> 12228 </A></B>
<P>
get an opportunity to see what is in it, to understand the full 
message about the pension plan.
<P>
	I would not be surprised if in the future as this bill works its 
way through the system, the Liberals use time allocation on this 
bill. I will predict the Liberals will use time allocation on Bill 
C-85, the pension plan bill. That is totally unworthy of 
government members who pride themselves on parliamentary 
reform, integrity and restoring integrity to the government like 
they said they would. It is the lowest of low tricks they can do in 
a democracy when they are too afraid to let debate on a sensitive 
issue take its normal, full and natural course.
<P>
	This is what is happening tonight. We have tried to not lose 
the opportunity to allow our members to speak to this bill, to 
point out why they appreciate the opportunity to opt out, why 
they like the fact they can lead by example and perhaps through 
this mechanism restore some integrity to this whole fiasco of the 
gold plated MP pension plan.
<P>
	We would appreciate if the government would allow proper 
debate to continue. We would appreciate if the government 
would stop playing these games with extended hours and if we 
could go ahead and live our normal day and work it out properly. 
There is a lot of time if it would follow the normal procedure.
<P>
	What is the rush? If you had a good bill, Mr. Speaker, would 
you not be proud to present it before the Canadian public for as 
long and as often as you could, to get the credit for it if you 
could? Would you not do that, Mr. Speaker? Would you not be 
proud and hold your head up high to be able to show the people 
of Canada what a great pension plan you had introduced? I know 
I would.
<P>
	If the Liberals want to rush it through, want to get it through 
committee, do not want to have the proper amount of time on it 
and introduce time allocation, that will be the proof they are 
embarrassed by the little they have done on it. They are 
embarrassed by how weak their legislation is and that they have 
not totally and fully used the benefit of all the arguments of all 
the members of the House.
<P>
	Therefore I will conclude my comments on the 
subamendment to Bill C-85.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, members on this side of the House are very much used 
to working 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., seven days a week if necessary. If 
the member has a problem with working evenings we can 
appreciate that, but that is not the government's way of doing 
things. The way on this side of the House is that we work hard, 
we continue to work hard from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., seven days a 
week on behalf of our constituents.
<P>
	When we are not in the House we are in our offices or in our 
constituencies doing constituency work on behalf of our 
constituents. I challenge the member to indicate what the 
problem is working here this evening for whatever time it takes. 
We are listening to the comments being made from the other side 
of the House, as ridiculous as some may be. We are open to listen 
to them.  We are prepared to work. Are they not prepared to work 
whatever hours it may take? We will be here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will accept that comment as the 
cheap shot that it is. We are not at all afraid to work late hours. 
We have done so often. I will also predict we will be the only 
ones putting up speakers. The Liberals want us to exhaust all of 
our speakers. They will not have any speaker on this. They will 
not have a member rise and speak for 20 minutes on the MP 
pension. They will not have a member rise and speak on the MP 
pension tonight for 10 minutes. They are here to exhaust our 
speakers. They are playing a game.
<P>
	When the member said he works hard for his constituency, 
every member of the House works hard for their constituency 
regardless of their political view point, regardless of where they 
stand on an issue. I do not think they work hard; they work long. 
We put in a lot of hours. The people who do the hard work are 
those who do the research, who dig out the facts, who have to get 
our messages out through communications.
<P>
	We are the spokespersons. We have to put in long hours. The 
cheap shots notwithstanding, the debate on the MP pension plan 
should be focused on how we can make it better. That is what an 
opposition party is here for. We are trying to be constructive. We 
are trying to point out the flaws. We are trying to show where it 
is weak. They do not have to listen if they do not want to. They 
do not have to make any changes if they do not want to. It is 
obvious they do not. However, we are happy to opt out. We are 
proud to opt out because we know it is the right thing. If they do 
not opt out they will get voted out.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member seems to be suggesting that sitting 
late is somehow unfair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Unnecessary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says it is unnecessary. We 
have made very little progress this week on government 
legislation. We expected to get two or three bills done yesterday 
afternoon but we did not get any.
<P>
	Tuesday was an opposition day. On Monday we expected to 
get two bills. We got one motion to a vote which, as I recall, was 
on an amendment. The motion to set up a special joint 
committee to study ethics was opposed particularly by the 
Reform Party. It has been stalled and is not happening now. We 
have a tremendous number of bills to deal with. The government 
is anxious to move on with its legislative agenda.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12229"> 12229 </A></B>
<P>
	Because we have had very good co-operation until the last 
few weeks we did not feel it necessary to sit late very often. Hon. 
members will note we did not. However, now that we have an 
extremely heavy agenda, dozens of bills waiting to be dealt 
with, it seemed only reasonable that we allow members to 
express their views on a bill to which we recognize there is 
significant opposition from Reform Party members who for 
various reasons do not like this bill. Some of us have views on 
what those reasons are but I will not go into that on a comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Why not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I would not want to bore the House or impugn 
motives to members as they have done in respect of some of the 
members on this side of the House in the debate.
<P>
	However, it is fair that we give members every opportunity to 
express their views. One of the things we do not like doing is 
cutting off debate. Often, as the hon. member knows, when we 
have used time allocation in the past we have offered to sit late 
to avoid having to use time allocation so members could get an 
opportunity to express their views. That is exactly what we are 
doing tonight.
<P>
	I want to ensure that all members who want to express their 
opinion on this bill are given a good opportunity to do so. Sitting 
late tonight gives all members that opportunity. They may have 
to leave their office or skip the movie they were going to go to, 
but most of us are here until 11 o'clock at night anyway working, 
so it is no problem and we are happy to stay and listen to hon. 
members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue is not sitting late or working 
late. The issue is giving proper time to a proper audience. 
Debate is progress. Being heard is progress. Passing bills is not 
necessarily progress. All the bills the government has 
introduced do not have all the answers or all the solutions, 
notwithstanding the Liberals may think they do and 
notwithstanding that all the years they were in opposition they 
now feel they have a licence to go ahead with any legislation 
they wish to. Therefore, they really do not like to have input 
from opposition members. That is what democracy is all about.
<P>
	If in this bill we have the opportunity to point out those 
elements we feel will make the bill better, which is by making it 
closer as much as we can to what is available in the private 
sector, in a way we are hurting ourselves because if they did that 
they more than likely will get voted back in at the next election. I 
am sort of in a conflict here. I do not know if I should be giving 
them this advice.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I do so on behalf of Canadians who work hard. 
Politicians are not a better class of people. They are not better 
than the people who voted them in. They are not a cut above the 
rest. Why we have this double standard in so many areas of this 
MP pension plan, why we have double standards in so many 
other areas like the travel allowance for MPs, 37 cents instead of 
31 cents,  which is allowable in the private sector, is what makes 
the public suspect of the motives of politicians.
<P>
	The government was elected on a promise in the red book that 
it would restore integrity to politicians. Instead of doing that, 
they just give lip service and use all the tricks of the standing 
orders at their disposal to push bills through without proper 
debate. They want to do it at times when certain members are not 
here who would like to speak to it.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	All the things they went through when they were in opposition 
they are trying to take advantage of on a Thursday evening when 
those key people who would like to speak to this are not 
available. This is what I do not like. I feel that it is totally 
uncalled for.
<P>
	There were a lot of emotional comments made today, but the 
main issue was missed. That is, the government is not listening 
to the people. It is not listening to the taxpayers, who feel that 
the pension plan is too generous. The taxpayer is not saying that 
the salary is too high. They are not asking us to take a salary cut. 
They are saying make what government and politicians do equal 
to what is in the private sector.
<P>
	Yes, we have an important job now. And yes, the Canadian 
public expects us to lead. But they also expect us to lead by 
example. If there is a double standard and we treat ourselves 
better than the public sector can treat itself, is that setting a good 
example? Is that what government members will be proud of 
when they go back to their constituencies, that they fought for a 
pension plan that is better than those of their constituents? Is 
that what they want to do?
<P>
	I for one do not want do that. That is why I stand before 
government members in debate to point out that our party would 
like to have them listen to what voters are saying. But the 
government is not listening. This is an opportunity. It might be 
the last opportunity if they keep forcing these tricks on the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I enter the debate with some reluctance. However, I 
must say that the whip or the caucus co-ordinator, or whatever it 
is one is supposed to call the person who has that job in the 
Reform Party, has just said I am supposed to call the person the 
hon. member. The hon. member talks about cheap shots after 
standing for 20 minutes in the House calling the government 
everything under the sun and impugning the motives of the 
government.
<P>
	One of the last things the whip of the Reform Party said 
tonight was that the government was using a procedural trick. 
Who introduced today a dilatory motion, the purpose of which is 
to not read the bill?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12230"> 12230 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Yes, the Reform Party, as my hon. colleague 
said.
<P>
	So if moving procedural tricks is the wrong thing to do, I have 
to ask why the whip of the Reform Party made these disparaging 
remarks against the member for Beaver River.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> It is the pot calling the kettle black.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> It is the pot calling the kettle black. That is 
exactly what it is.
<P>
	I think that what has been said here has not been thoroughly 
researched. But we all know, of course, that Reform Party 
research is an oxymoron. One can never be equivalent to the 
other. They are diametrically opposed.
<P>
	We have heard again from the same member that we should be 
leading by example. Now, I ask myself the following question. 
Is this the same political party that is asking us to lead by 
example when the leader of that party had a limousine provided 
to him by the government and he said he did not want the 
limousine, then reconsidered the position? He ordered the 
limousine and had the staff of public works, or whoever does 
these things, wax the car and bring it here. It took a day or two of 
work to get it all prepared. Then he did a giant publicity stunt 
with the car, which had already been sent back. He made a 
presentation of giving the keys back and put a ``for sale'' sign in 
the window of the car. It probably cost thousands of dollars at 
the expense of the government to orchestrate that scene.
<P>
	Now, as if that was not bad enough, someone said that the 
ultimate result was that he got rid of the car. That is what you 
think. No siree, Mr. Speaker. He had a limousine subsidized by 
the taxpayers through the back door of the Reform Party 
provided to him after refusing the first limousine in the publicity 
stunt I have just described.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	Those are the people who talk to us about leading by example 
and governing with integrity. Yes, those are the same people.
<P>
	Let us talk a bit more about governing with integrity. Let us 
talk about what I would qualify as suitable leadership. Yes, the 
leader of the Reform Party decided that he wanted a 15 per cent 
pay cut, but he had his suits bought by the Reform Party in order 
to supplement his income. That is leading by example. Mr. 
Speaker, do your constituents or do my constituents receive 
subsidized suits? Hardly. If they did they would probably be a 
taxable benefit. I wonder if it is a taxable benefit for the member 
of the Reform Party. Perhaps some of our colleagues in the 
House who are accountants can enlighten us on that subject.
<P>
	Let us develop that a bit further. The leader of the Reform 
Party, from what we were told, is also receiving, thanks to the 
taxpayers of Canada, contributions to his RRSP and all sorts of 
other things like that. If that is not  bad enough, some Reform 
Party members said they were taking a 15 per cent pay cut. I 
know their performance has not been all that great, but to say 
that it was only 85 per cent as valuable as everyone else's, not 
even I would go that far. Let us assume that they were worth the 
same amount as other MPs, which I know is a debatable point.
<P>
	We had the following situation. Some of them did this and 
some of them did not. And then the whole thing was reversed 
because, as they said in a press interview, the people were not 
appreciating it sufficiently. They did not change their minds 
because it was wrong or right, but because they did not get the 
right amount of publicity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Is there 
not a House rule that requires speakers to keep to the subject? I 
thought we were debating Bill C-85 and the amendments 
thereto.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia raises an issue that is 
often raised in this House with regard to relevance. Of course in 
a speech of a potential maximum of 20 minutes, sometimes 
members take a little longer than others to get to the actual point 
in debate. But I am sure that the speech of the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, who is an experienced 
parliamentarian, will certainly be relevant to the bill that is 
before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am reminded that we 
are discussing the pay and benefit package of MPs. Of course 
that is what I was addressing in this House. I know that I was 
addressing the pay and benefits of Reform MPs-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. 
The hon. member says that we are discussing pay and benefits. 
There is nothing about pay in the bill. We are discussing 
pensions, period.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not believe that is a 
point of order. We are getting into debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was saying before I was so 
rudely interrupted, we were discussing the benefits of MPs. The 
hon. member invoked the rule of relevance, and perhaps 
discussing what some MPs are worth, particularly the Reform 
kind, is not really a relevant issue. Perhaps there is some merit to 
what the member said. However, let us get back to the central 
issue of the debate. We are discussing how MPs of any political 
party should be paid.
<P>
	The salary I get for being an MP is about the same as that of a 
high school teacher in my constituency. That is fair game. I 
knew the salary before I got into this, and I accept it. I think I 
work somewhat longer hours, but that is okay. That is certainly 
acceptable in my book. I do not ask for anything more. However, 
I do resent those people who come here and say that we are worth 
less, that our salaries are too big and that the benefit package 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12231"> 12231 </A></B>
<P>
offered to members is too high. These people do the same kinds 
of things in terms of getting backdoor salaries.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	I also resent people who pretend that MPs somehow get too 
much in the way of pension when they or their own colleagues 
are getting federal government pensions at the same time as they 
are sitting in the House of-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I want to clarify 
that I had just said in my speech that MPs' salaries were too low, 
not too high.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> This is not a point of 
order. We are engaging in debate. Resuming debate, the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true that that member invoked 
a huge pay increase for MPs, so I am not going to say that he 
asked that the salaries be reduced. But others who spoke not long 
before he took the floor tonight referred to the fact that we were 
overpaid.
<P>
	There are a couple of further points to consider in all of this. 
One, allegations are made about our so-called golden pension 
and so on. I know it is not easy to defend one's salary, one's 
paycheque. It is a lot easier to say no.
<P>
	I remember those days in the Ontario legislature, where I sat 
in a previous incarnation. The odd three or four MPs would vote 
against a pay increase and none of them of course would ever 
refuse to take the increase once it had been given, in spite of 
voting against it. We are seeing the same kind of thing going on 
here.
<P>
	The bill that we have before us is to reduce MPs' pensions. 
Whether or not that is a good idea is a matter that is open for 
debate, but we were elected on a specific program to reduce it. It 
is a commitment we made. What we are delivering on tonight is 
in excess of the commitment we made. We were elected on that. 
Fair game. I could have disagreed or agreed with the individual 
parts of the red book, but I was elected on the red book and I will 
vote for that.
<P>
	At the same time, it does not mean that any of us in this House 
should cater to the likes of David Somerville of the National 
Citizens' Coalition, who raises money by printing in the 
newspaper little pigs saying that little pigs represent MPs and 
that to cut off their salaries would be a good thing and that if 
Canadians want those benefits for MPs cut off all they have to do 
is send their money to David Somerville in a little box, which 
happens to be at the bottom of the same newspaper ad all the 
time.
<P>
	What does he do with that money? I am sure he sticks it in his 
own pocket. Who is he accountable to? He has an outfit called 
the National Citizens' Coalition. It is not national. It is not a 
citizens' coalition. It is nothing of the sort. It is a business. It is 
run by him and for him for his own benefit. He does not disclose 
how many members he has. He never discloses any of the names 
of any members. And he makes no disclosure of the salary he 
gets from generating these contributions from Canadians. That 
is not an honest way of doing business.
<P>
	People know how much I make. People know how much the 
member across the way makes. And he does not pretend, issuing 
a press release, that people should send him money so that he 
can blast David Somerville in Toronto. He would not do that. 
Neither would I. But he gets away with that, and a few of us cater 
to that kind of nonsense. It is not right, and it is about time some 
of us said it.
<P>
	On the issue of the pension itself as it is today, it is going to be 
reduced with this bill. I am 45 years old. I have worked in the 
government all my life. I worked for 14 years as an employee of 
the federal government. Because I had only nine and a half years 
of contributions to the pension plan-in the beginning. I was a 
sessional employee-I had no pension. I had to withdraw my 
contributions. I was given 2 per cent interest on the money I had 
invested there. Are they the kinds of funds I would have had in 
an RRSP? Surely not.
<P>
	Then I served under another golden pension plan as a member 
of the legislature. I served there for nearly four years. Interest 
rates in the 1980s were in the area of 18 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Who got them there?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Again, I caution 
members. I know there are some very strongly held views on 
both sides of the House, but please direct the interventions 
through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> After four years I was given my premiums 
back, no employer share, no transferability, no portability and 4 
per cent interest when the interest rate was 18 per cent. Would 
anyone else invest their contributions that way? I suggest not.
<P>
	I have contributed to the federal MPs pension plan since 1984, 
11 years. The Library of Parliament research office calculated 
the value of the premiums I have paid plus interest, based on the 
regular guaranteed investment certificate rate. I have 
contributed in interest and premiums, $136,988. That is what I 
have paid personally toward the plan, interest and premiums 
included.
<P>
	Some members across the way were asking why all of this was 
not in an employer-employee plan, jointly contributed, a money 
purchase plan of sorts where both sides contribute the same 
amount. If that would have been the case with me I would now 
have $273,976. Just the interest on an amount of that size at 10 
per cent would be $27,000 a year which I could draw right now. 
If I were defeated today as an MP I would get about $30,000 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12232"> 12232 </A></B>
<P>
instead of $27,000. That is the gold plated pension plan those 
people across the way talk about.
<P>
	They talk about these unfunded liabilities. These unfunded 
liabilities are based on assumptions of the nature that the money 
I contributed toward the plan bears no interest. Who has ever 
said that? Nobody. That is why they make these kinds of 
allegations but they need to be substantiated with some facts and 
some truth.
<P>
	Yes, of course, Mr. Speaker, you could probably find 
someone's grandmother here and find an unfunded liability for 
their old age security cheque. If you revealed those numbers, 
someone who is 65 and expected to live until 85, 20 years times 
an OAS cheque, plus the supplement if they so qualify, that 
would make a huge amount too. Are the people across the way 
suggesting we cancel that?
<P>
	If that were the only element of debate it would be awfully 
shallow. It is awfully shallow. I am not ashamed of the 
paycheque I get as an MP. I am not asking for more at all. I think 
I do an honest job of trying to serve the people who sent me here 
many years ago.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I said at the beginning of my remarks that I had 
been a federal civil servant. I know I have said this before but I 
will repeat it now. I started here as a busboy in the parliamentary 
restaurant. The other day I looked at my paycheque when I first 
started. It was $86 for two weeks. That was on October 25, 1966.
<P>
	I work hard for my constituents and I think we should be 
working hard. There is nothing wrong with our doing that. I am 
not complaining about it. I am glad that I work hard. I am glad I 
have the health and so on to do that which is required of me to 
properly serve my constituents. At the same time we should stop 
pretending that MPs are overpaid and underworked, do not do 
anything and so on.
<P>
	If the only thing wrong with that would be that we criticize 
each other, I suppose it would be secondary. However we are 
diminishing the whole institution by keeping this up. Of the G-7 
nations, Canada is either sixth or seventh in terms of the 
compensation it offers to its legislators at the national level. It is 
not the highest. We are not pigs at the trough. What kind of 
nonsense is that?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Garbage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> It is garbage and that is all it is. We are trying to 
do the appropriate job for those who sent us here.
<P>
	I sit with a number of others on the Board of Internal 
Economy. We have made cuts everywhere we could and we are 
continuing to do that. We are going to continue to strive to do a 
good job, one that is economical for those we serve. At the same 
time, I say to members across the way that when they start doing 
things like saying members are worth nothing or very little, they 
do not win.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	Some members across the floor were high ranking people in 
the military. How many people in the military are chauffeured 
around with limousines as part of their jobs? Do they have to 
account for that every day? Do members of the military have to 
put up with this kind of debate about their pensions? No, and I 
am not saying they should.
<P>
	We were told by one member that the normal age of retirement 
and getting a pension is 65. That is what he said to us. We are 
going to be dealing with bills shortly to bring the retirement age 
in the public sector from 55 to as low as 50. So where is the truth 
in what we heard earlier? It is not there.
<P>
	I end on the tone I started on. We made commitments through 
the red book. We are going to deliver to the people of Canada. At 
the same time, it does not mean we are doing a service to 
democracy by doing the damage that some people are trying to 
do.
<P>
	I am now at an age where some of this is starting to make less 
and less difference. I am already here. I have been elected. My 
children are advancing in terms of university and everything 
else. None of this will probably affect me in the future, or if it 
does, very little. People who are 25 or 35 years old and want to 
run in the next election, I do not want for them to be unable to 
run because they cannot afford to, because they cannot afford 
the compensation package and because they cannot afford to 
leave the workplace.
<P>
	As I said, I am already here as are all of us, but we have to 
remember that we are not here permanently. Others will come 
after us. To destroy the institution is serving no one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wanted to follow up on my colleague's remarks and 
comment on the extensive damage this debate is doing.
<P>
	I ran as an MP solely because I wanted to serve my country. 
Many people on the other side of the House, certainly the 
Reform Party, would have us believe they did the same thing and 
I believe them. Bloc members also have run as members of 
Parliament because they have an idealism, they believe in a 
cause. I might not agree with that cause, but they have run for the 
very best of principles.
<P>
	I have received 20 letters on this issue, 20 special letters. 
They are from a school in my riding and the children are only 12 
years old. Those letters condemn me as a member of Parliament 
as a result of this debate. They accuse me of being at the trough. 
They ask: Why am I taking these inflated salaries? Why am I 
cheating the public? Obviously this group of school children 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12233"> 12233 </A></B>
<P>
have a teacher who has the same view as the members of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	What is happening is this debate has destroyed the face of 
those children.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Laugh if you will, members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. As I said earlier, I 
know there are some strongly held views on this debate as is the 
case on every debate, but the interventions must be made 
through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was getting a little heated there 
anyway. I do want to make the point that it is terrible to read 
those letters from those children and to see they have lost faith 
in their members of Parliament, not just me but all members of 
Parliament and the institution. That is the price of attempting a 
political advantage by this debate. That is exactly what it is. The 
members who have initiated this debate should really think 
twice. I agree with my colleague that they are destroying the 
institution and they are destroying the faith of the children in 
this land.
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> In Britain in the 1830s the great reform act was 
passed. I think it was eventually passed in 1832, if my memory 
serves me. The debate lasted a very long time. The reform act 
had two purposes at that time. One was to widen the franchise 
because very few people had the right to vote in the United 
Kingdom, which included Ireland. Some of the people who 
fought the most to ensure both features were included in the 
legislation, widening the franchise and giving salaries to MPs, 
were the people of Ireland.
<P>
	It was their feeling that if a person came from a disadvantaged 
group the chances of their kind being represented in Parliament 
were nil. Daniel O'Connell was elected to the Parliament of the 
United Kingdom. He was known as the liberator. The liberator 
was elected to Parliament but he came from a very wealthy 
family.
<P>
	In spite of the fact that he was elected, I believe, in 1829 it 
took a number of years before others could get elected because 
there were no salaries for MPs. If they were fortunate enough to 
sit on the government side they had the government benefits at 
the time. They had what they called offices; they served in 
various functions. If they did not receive government benefits, 
as the minority Catholic members obviously would not have, 
they received no salary for being an MP. That was seen as being 
the biggest disadvantage for people seeking public office.
<P>
	Widening the franchise enabled everyone to vote and made it 
possible for people to seek public office because they had a 
salary by which to transport themselves to Parliament. Those 
were seen as the two important things. That is the history of that 
Parliament. Our lot is not the same and I will not say it is.
<P>
	I would like to close by saying what I said initially. I was able 
to run for election to be an MP notwithstanding that I started 
from the lowest rung of the ladder. If I had been rich I could have 
run notwithstanding anything else. I was not and I am still not 
rich but I was able to run notwithstanding. I am today a member 
of Parliament in the highest court of the land representing my 
constituents.
<P>
	Because there is a salary and benefits it makes it possible for 
not only wealthy middle aged men to run, but for young people, 
people from disadvantaged groups, and all others to come here. 
Parliament, if it is a democracy, should be a microcosm of those 
we claim to represent. Rich people should have a right to run, 
poor people should have a right to run, men and women, all 
equally. In our efforts to make things better let us ensure we are 
making them better, not worse. That is the point I wish to make.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
<B>(1930 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The question is on the 
amendment to the amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House to 
adopt the amendment to the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> On division.
<P>
	(Amendment to amendment agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate on the 
amendment, as amended, with the hon. member for Kootenay 
East.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting to me as an absolute novice in the House that we are 
at the mercy of people on the other side like the member who just 
spoke. They have parliamentary knowledge having gone to 
England and learned at the feet of the masters how to run 
different affairs within the House of Commons. It is particularly 
disappointing on an issue that is key to my relationship as a 
politician with the people I represent that the government would 
try through procedure to slip it through the House tonight so that 
it could get it under the cover of a committee.
<P>
	The member from Hamilton talked about the fact that young 
people in his constituency have approached him and written him 
letters saying that they have a low regard for politicians. The 
problem is that he does not understand the actions of the 
government today in the House of Commons are a duplication of 
the actions of previous governments of the Liberal stripe and of 
the Conservative stripe, whereby politicians consistently looked 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12234"> 12234 </A></B>
<P>
after themselves to the best of their ability. That is the reflection 
these young people have.
<P>
	We can look at the fancy words in the red book about restoring 
integrity and about building bridges between the people in the 
constituencies and the politicians. However we see in the 
actions tonight, in the total waste of time of this assembly, the 
reality. The reality is that the government will do anything it 
needs to do to slide this kind of process through the House.
<P>
	In looking at the issue it is interesting how we as members of 
Parliament arrived here. Totally contrary to the assertions made 
by the Liberals, the member for Calgary Centre and I as do all of 
us agree that the pay package or the actual salary package is 
deficient against the number of hours being put in and the level 
of responsibility of members of Parliament.
<P>
	What did previous politicians do? They said that it was too 
visible, too transparent, that people would see they were doing 
something to change it around. Therefore they came up with the 
gold plated pension plan. Now we are faced with a situation 
where in taking a look at the pension plan and at the changes 
proposed in the legislation currently before the House we simply 
compound error upon error. We simply continue to generate a 
situation where we have a wall between ourselves and our 
constituents.
<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
	I find it absolutely astounding for the Liberal members to 
assert that somehow it is only in Reform constituencies, that it is 
only our constituents who are concerned about this issue.
<P>
	It makes me think of when we were having a debate about the 
very meagre, weak-kneed measures that were brought forward 
by this government with respect to the Young Offenders Act. We 
were having a debate in this House of Commons, I believe on the 
Thursday immediately prior to the Liberal convention.
<P>
	Reform members of Parliament were being told that 
everything was fine and the only place where there were any 
problems and any desire to make changes to the Young 
Offenders Act was in the Reform constituencies. What an 
amazing thing. There were only 52 constituencies out of 295 that 
had a problem with the Young Offenders Act, or so it was being 
represented by the Liberals.
<P>
	It was particularly fascinating that what ensued out of the 
convention convened by the Liberals on the Friday, Saturday 
and Sunday is that members of their constituency organizations 
told them that Reform was right. They told them that there was a 
problem.
<P>
	Could someone inform me what the annual membership fee is 
to be a Liberal party member? I assume one has to pay or do they 
give them away?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Ten dollars.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Ten dollars. In other words, for people in Canada 
to get a message through to Liberal members of Parliament they 
should line up, pay their $10 and then maybe they will be 
listened to within the confines of one of those meetings. That 
seems to be the only place that this kind of communication is 
actually taking place.
<P>
	I am relating this young offenders story specifically to this 
issue. The situation in this House is that within our party, as 
members of Parliament, we walk around trade fairs and we walk 
up and down the streets in our constituencies and people 
approach us saying that this is the issue. I challenge members 
present to tell me with a straight face that people in their 
constituencies do not see this as a problem. I cannot comprehend 
that this is a problem in only 52 constituencies.
<P>
	One of the problems it has created is when one ends up with 
the travelling information gathering road shows the government 
puts on. I should not say that in such a way because it does sound 
rather denigrating. When the government makes an effort to 
listen to the people it moves a standing committee around 
Canada.
<P>
	As an example, the member for Cape Breton 
Highlands-Canso went around last fall getting input on social 
programs. I wonder if there were any walls between him as the 
chair of that standing committee and the people he was talking 
to about the downgrading that was going to have to happen with 
respect to social programs. According to the figures I have in my 
hand, if he were to resign today he would be eligible for 
$1,495,663. Yet he in that capacity, in spite of being eligible for 
$1,495,663, was telling people: ``I am sorry, we are going to 
have to downgrade the social programs''.
<P>
	There is that kind of wall. I appeal to the best sense, if they 
have best sense, of the people on the other side of the House. I 
ask them to listen to the people if they ever go to trade shows or 
if they ever go walking up and down the streets.
<P>
	If they listened they would hear that the issue is the major 
barrier between all of us as politicians and ordinary Canadian 
citizens. It is simply not right that we should be able to have a 
program three times as generous as can be had in the private 
sector. It is a wall; it is a barrier. I appeal to members opposite to 
take another look, to wipe out the existing legislation and go 
with $1 to $1. Let us get out of the faces of ordinary Canadians 
and break down the wall.
