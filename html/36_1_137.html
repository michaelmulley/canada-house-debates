maximum support possible. 
It is my view, and that of many Canadians, that a guaranteed 
annual salary would be an important tool in the fight against 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the instigation of the Minister of Finance, an ad hoc Liberal 
committee was formed in April to examine possible solutions to 
the problem of unpaid work in the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In point of fact, the Income Tax Act discriminates against 
Canadian parents who choose to care for their own children, 
especially those who have large families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example is the Côté-Germain family of 1016 Quessey Street in 
Val d'Or, Abitibi, whose child tax benefit was cut by a whopping 
$280 a month this year.  Right now there are nine children in 
this family, and in a few months there will be ten. 
The eleven of them are relying on a single gross annual salary 
of $55,000 and, to add insult to injury, are not entitled to a 
GST refund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada's tax legislation does not take size of 
family into account.  We should rethink our approach and draft 
legislation that is fair to Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank Beverley Smith of Calgary, who has worked 
for years with a group of Canadian stakeholders in support of 
salaries for women and men who stay at home to raise their 
children.  For many years now, the people of Abitibi and 
Canadian MPs have known about my efforts to see mothers or 
fathers who stay at home to care for their children paid a 
salary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to the motion which has been presented by the 
hon. member for Abitibi.  For many of the people watching it 
might be wise to read the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
legislate to grant a salary to mothers and fathers who stay at 
home to care for their children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years, in spite of the concerned voices of many 
Canadian families and the intense lobbying work by many in this 
House including even some in the Liberal Party, the government 
has chosen tax funded support of only one approach to child care. 
That one approach is institutional day care, not parental care or 
extended family care, but only formal day care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the current budget I thought the Liberal cabinet and the 
finance minister might finally have heard parents who want the 
discrimination against their options of child care, including 
full time homemaker and parent, to stop. But they went in the 
other direction again.  They increased the child care expense 
deduction for the cost of institutionalized day care by up to 
$2,000 more per child but did absolutely nothing to recognize the 
cost and value of other forms of care parents choose to provide. 
It is interesting that this is what they have done.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have consulted a number of studies that point out how 
important parental care is to the long term emotional stability 
of children.  Even without considering those studies, let us 
consider why the government cannot treat parents' choices 
equally.  If the government will provide up to a $7,000 deduction 
for institutional receipted care expenses, why can parents who 
choose other options not also be considered?  This question has 
been asked again and again by parents and it was asked loudly 
after the current budget ignored them one more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the motion on the floor of the House today which calls 
for parents to be employed by the government, i.e., the 
government would pay them a salary to be parents, is the Liberal 
government's best solution, but surely we can do even better.  I 
appreciate the member's attempt to recognize the value of 
parental care in the motion.  I truly hope it is a real start. 
However, based on the federal government's repeated determination 
to only subsidize day care, and it increased the tax breaks for 
it just eight months ago, there is little real hope that the 
pattern will change with the current government.  Parents will 
continue to be told that through the tax system the only valuable 
child care is non-parental day care.  That is tragic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us assume somebody is listening and perhaps today's debate 
will influence the government to finally consider changes to 
bring in fair family tax reforms.  The Reform Party has long 
called for fair family tax reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us seriously consider the motion.  It calls for the 
government to pay parents.  Does this give parents the freedom to 
choose the child care arrangement that best works for them?  Does 
it allow them to make that choice without discriminating tax 
treatment?  Is it really simple? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had parents ask me these questions.  How would this work? 
If parents work part time and only use day care a little bit and 
care for their children at home the rest of the time, do they get 
a salary for being stay at home parents?  What if a grandparent 
or another member of the extended family looked after the kids 
when the parents were working and occasionally day care was used 
but three days a week mom was home for part of the day, what do 
they get? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some families where parents work alternative shifts. 
One parent is with the children in the day and the other at night 
and maybe there is an hour with a sitter.  Do these parents 
qualify?  They both work but they both stay at home with the 
kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Add to this that life is dynamic.  Situations change because of 
illness, job changes, moves, et cetera.  Child care arrangements 
within families may often change several times in the same year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Picture trying to figure all this out on an already overly 
complex tax form.  Does this not add more stress to the family? 
Maybe there is a better way.  There is and I am going to get to 
that in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me ask are Canadian families not also concerned about 
their country and the overall prudent operation of the 
government?  I think they are.  Why then would they want to pay 
the high taxes that they pay?  I should point out that the 
Liberal government has raised taxes 37 times since coming to 
power.  Why would they want to pay these high taxes and have the 
government flow that money through Revenue Canada and only have 
Revenue Canada give some of it back to the same taxpayer? This is 
expensive bureaucratic manoeuvring. Where is the value added by 
flowing the money through Revenue Canada?  Put a dollar in and 
get 75 cents back out.  The bureaucracy burns up the rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not just leave the dollar with the taxpaying family in the 
first place?  Save us all the money. That family pays less tax 
and has more disposable income now when it is needed.  Other 
taxpayers are saved the expense of collecting dollars from and 
returning dollars to the same people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party, driven by its membership made up of thousands 
of Canadian families, has long called for fair family tax 
treatment when it comes to child care costs.  Instead of just a 
child care expense deduction for day care, Reformers have long 
proposed a child care expense credit that would be available to 
all parents.  This per child credit can be deducted directly from 
the tax the parents are required to pay thereby leaving the money 
and the child care choices with them.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the family has no tax to pay, then the credit would be paid 
to them in the form of a refund.  This way everyone receives 
equal monetary recognition for the costs of child care, 
regardless of the method of child care chosen.  As well, there is 
no added bureaucratic cost flowing through Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, let us examine the concept of paying someone to be a 
parent.  The proposal in this Liberal motion today would give the 
appearance that stay at home parents are employed by the state. 
In effect, parents would be hired using their own money.  This is 
strange.  Down the road would conditions be applied to the 
salary?  Is it conceivable that parents would be required to meet 
some government set of parenting rules or risk loosing the 
salary?  Is that far-fetched?  Perhaps, but why go down that 
road?  History is full of examples of things that people thought 
would never happen, but they did.  Do parents have children so 
they can be employed by the state?  No.  Parents have children to 
build a family and express their love. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is better to recognize that there is a cost and a social 
contribution to raising the next generation of Canadians and all 
parents, regardless of the change in child care options chosen, 
should be given the same degree of tax relief.  There is no 
salary that appropriately addresses the interaction between 
loving parents and their children and it is inappropriate to try 
to set one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, it is good that this motion is a recognition of 
significant tax inequities and tax discrimination against 
homemakers.  Unfortunately, this government, in typical fashion, 
also demonstrates an approach that increases government 
dependency and wasteful spending through an inefficient 
methodology.  Instead, replacing the child care expense deduction 
with a fully refundable child care expense credit is a much 
superior means to addressing the current inequities in the tax 
structure.  It would not be dependent on the method of child care 
chosen and it would reduce both family and government 
administrative overhead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach to a fair family tax system for Canadian families, 
which the Reform Party has long advocated and developed, is 
simple, flexible and efficient.  Most importantly, it is good for 
Canadian families and it is good for the children they care for.

behalf of the people in the riding of 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
legislate to grant a salary to mothers and fathers who stay at 
home to care for their children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first thought is that the member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik has introduced an interesting 
subject for public debate, but that his position is either very 
naïve or out of touch with reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in Canada knows that family policy is a provincial 
responsibility.  It is the responsibility of the Government of 
Quebec.  Furthermore, the proposal by the Liberal member, a 
member of the majority, is totally contrary to the approach his 
government has taken in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that, in 1993, the electoral promises of the 
Liberals included a national child care service.  In short, they 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must try harder—A Liberal government will create up to 
50,000 child care spaces— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still looking for them.  The project was cancelled.  It 
was swept under the carpet.  This is the first contradiction 
with the motion of the member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 
the meantime, the government responsible for family policy set 
up a $5 child care service, which is so popular that they are 
looking all over for money to meet the demand.  People in Quebec 
gave some thought to finding the appropriate solution.  It was 
put into effect and is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example where the federal government and federal MPs 
should limit themselves to proposing interventions in areas of 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may well be a certain amount of visibility involved. 
There may also be a real desire to improve a difficult 
situation, but I cannot say the solution proposed is the right 
one.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During their prebudget consultations throughout Quebec, Bloc 
Quebecois members held information sessions and listened to what 
people had to say. Let me give you an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the case of a young couple who earned $20,000 in a given 
year, or about $10,000 for each person. They have three 
children. At the end of the year, they receive their income tax 
assessments, and are asked to pay $500 and $800 respectively. On 
the same day, they also receive a letter telling them they are 
allowed to invest $10,000 in an RRSP. We are talking about a 
couple with three children and an annual income of $20,000. To 
tell them they owe taxes and then say that they could have 
invested up to $10,000 in an RRSP is adding insult to injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the real tax problems in Canada. They have to do with 
the indexing of tax tables. We must make sure that low income 
people can manage adequately, and not necessarily by having an 
additional salary, as suggested in the member's proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik is contradicting his own 
government. Let us not forget that, over the two mandates of 
this government, transfer payments to the provinces have been 
reduced by $42.2 billion. In order to truly improve the plight 
of our families, would it not be better for the member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik to propose that the money be given back 
to the provinces, now that we will have budget surpluses? Is 
this not a much more pressing need, and would it not be a much 
more realistic solution to the problems being faced? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another contradiction. The Liberal government reduced 
access to employment insurance benefits for women on maternity 
leave by implementing a reform that makes it much more difficult 
to qualify for benefits. On the one hand, they want to pay a 
salary to the spouse who stays at home, while on the other hand 
they make it harder to qualify, so much so that women on 
maternity leave can no longer qualify for employment insurance 
benefits. This is another contradiction that dampens the 
member's good will. I think there are other initiatives he could 
propose that would produce much more positive results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the whole issue of pay equity. There is talk of paying 
a salary to the stay-at-home parent, but the government does not 
even comply with the rulings issued by its own tribunals, which 
provide that there must be equal pay for work of equal value. 
This principle was confirmed by a tribunal, and now the federal 
government is trying to find some way to avoid having to pay the 
amounts involved. 
They refused to settle out of court, a ruling was handed down 
and now they will not abide by it. This is yet another example 
of bad faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the intention behind the motion of the hon. member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik is good, the solutions put forward are 
not first rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois are proposing constructive solutions, 
which I will outline again. First, to use the surpluses to 
restore social transfers to the provinces. If they get their 
share back, the provinces will be able, within their 
jurisdictions, to direct the funding where it is needed and to 
decide where it is best invested; as a result, individual 
citizens will have an adequate income to ensure the economic 
well-being of their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second solution is to negotiate in good faith with the 
Government of Quebec so that its new family policy can be fully 
implemented. We also ask that the federal government withdraw 
its appeal before the federal court on the issue of pay equity 
in the public service and make changes to employment insurance 
to provide greater access to maternity leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of income for stay at home spouses is a complex 
issue that must be examined thoroughly. We must seek the opinion 
of women's groups on this. We must consider solutions people put 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem that needs to be resolved. Traditionally, 
women are the ones who stay at home for thirty years or so. 
By the time they reach retirement age, they may be widowed, 
divorced, separated or what not, and find that they have to fend 
for themselves. But unlike women who have been on the labour 
market, they do not have access to a plan like the Quebec 
pension plan or the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to social protection, we should give serious 
thought to ensuring that women do not find themselves in a 
difficult financial situation at that time in life. But the 
solution is not necessarily to provide a salary to stay at home 
parents. I think this whole issue needs to be revisited.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik has 
proposed a significant motion for ensuring that our families 
have a decent income.  As far as solutions are concerned, he is 
disadvantaged by being a member of a government that has been 
unwilling to find solutions to problems and is now living with 
the results of its inaction, namely increased poverty in Canada. 
The gap between rich and poor is widening.  It is becoming 
increasingly difficult for families to survive as families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no easy solutions to this problem, but there is a need 
for an overall strategy, a collective intervention strategy 
which will make it possible to find a satisfactory solution. 
This is why I wish to see a strategy that respects 
jurisdictions. 
If there is one instance where Quebec can show that it is 
working efficiently within a jurisdiction that belongs to it, it 
is the way it has defended social rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, there is someone in Quebec who wants to 
become premier and who has no concern whatsoever for providing 
people with social protection,  and he has decided that Quebec 
needs to be nothing more than a market-based economy.  It is my 
impression that Mr. Charest will be getting the very clear 
message that the people of Quebec want nothing to do with this 
model.  They have developed another, and are capable of 
continuing to develop it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion by the hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik is a 
good starting point for reflection.  He will need to see that it 
is debated further within his caucus so that we may all work 
together to focus the same amount of energy on overall solutions 
to poverty as there was on overcoming the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More original solutions must be found, and not at the expense of 
the poorest members of society, so that in 10 years from now 
when we are retired, we will be able to say we did our part in 
the battle against poverty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise in the House today to speak to the motion 
that is before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik for bringing forward this motion 
because it provides us with an opportunity to talk about a very 
important issue, that is, the role of caregivers who are 
primarily women in the home in our society.  It is a very 
important issue that I think must be debated in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP believe that it is very important that the role of 
caregivers, primarily women working in the home, is recognized. 
Women working in the home are often portrayed negatively in a 
society that seems to place value only on economic pursuits.  In 
fact, child rearing is the most important task that we face as 
individuals and as a society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that standpoint this motion is grounded on some important 
principles that we should be debating.  One of those principles 
is that our children are our most valuable resource and those who 
care for children on a full time basis must be recognized as 
providing an important service to society.  They are nurturing 
those who will shape the future of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, having said that I must point out that we have some 
concerns about this motion because it is put forward in a very 
simplistic way and does not give any context to the condition 
that we now find ourselves in of growing poverty, growing 
unemployment and fewer and fewer options for caregivers and 
parents who remain in the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, what safeguard is there that the salary that the 
motion refers to will be adequate to ensure that caregivers, who 
are mostly women, will have the options that women have been 
struggling for over the course of the last 100 years?  I think 
the danger here is that the salary the motion refers to will be 
so far below the poverty line that it will serve the opposite 
purpose than that which is intended.  Instead of adding to the 
value of the work that women do in the home, it could actually 
undervalue the important contribution that caregivers make. 
Instead of opening doors for women it could limit the options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to look at other issues of public policy and at how 
we treat caregivers in the home to see how we undervalue that 
work.  This is where the danger lies in the motion.  We only have 
to look at welfare policies.  In most provinces welfare payments 
are way below the poverty line.  Many people who are on welfare 
are women.  They are raising children.  They are struggling to 
pay rent and to meet the daily needs of food.  We only have to 
look at the situation with the EI cutbacks which are forcing more 
and more women into a range of more and more limited options, if 
they can even claim EI.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note from the changes in the regulations that less than 40% 
of workers who pay into UI, many of whom are women, are now no 
longer eligible.  It is forcing those women back into poverty and 
back into a situation where they cannot meet the basic needs of 
raising their families.  Those are the kinds of public policy 
decisions we have had that have really pointed the finger at the 
Liberal government as to what it really thinks about the role of 
women and caregivers at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to look at pay equity and the disastrous course 
this government has embarked on in terms of denying federal 
civil servants what has rightfully been theirs for so many years. 
That struggle has gone on for more than 14 years.  The member 
needs to go back to his own caucus and his own government to 
establish accountability and to point out the contradictions and 
the hypocrisy this government has put to Canadians in terms of 
policies that have actually penalized women and caregivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A program of affordable quality child care would truly provide 
women with meaningful options.  At the same time it would ensure 
all children were given the necessary early education and care 
despite a woman's income.  There is no question that families in 
Canada are under incredible pressure.  Prolonged high 
unemployment, a labour market in which wages are stagnant and 
jobs are hard to come by, and massive cuts to social programs and 
public services have made it more and more difficult for families 
to meet their own needs and the needs of their children. The fact 
is that affordable, accessible, high quality early childhood 
education and child care are critical components of an integrated 
strategy to meet the needs of families.  Unfortunately this 
motion does not address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child care performs many important functions in our society, 
functions that improve the quality of life for children and 
families, both for those who are poor and for those who are not. 
High quality child care and early childhood education ensure 
children are given important foundations necessary for healthy 
growth and development throughout the rest of their lives. Access 
to child care is a key source of equality for women because it 
allows women access to jobs, therefore improving their chances 
for greater economic equality.  As such we should look at child 
care as an anti-poverty measure for Canada's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad reality is the Liberals and the Tories before them have 
not taken this issue seriously.  The Liberals delivered the 
biggest blow to Canadian children by eliminating the Canada 
assistance plan which was the only source of federal funding for 
regulated child care in Canada.  Under the Canada health and 
social transfer there is now no provision for federal-provincial 
sharing of subsidized child care.  Therefore there is no 
incentive for provinces to provide more child care spaces.  By 
eliminating the Canada assistance plan, the Liberals effectively 
cut $350 million from federal spending on child care.  This hurts 
poor women and children the hardest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do care about child care.  A national survey 
commissioned by the child care sector studies steering committee 
and conducted by Environics in May found that 89% of Canadians 
agree that high quality child care is an important factor in 
helping to ensure Canada's future social and economic well-being. 
Eighty-one per cent of those surveyed think the government 
should develop a plan to improve child care, and seventy-eight 
per cent would like to see government spend more money than it 
does now to ensure high quality care exists at fees families can 
afford.  That is a very important matter in terms of 
accessibility. Despite promises to the contrary, this government 
has done nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech of the member's own party, the Liberals had 
the gall to say “one of our objectives as a country should be to 
ensure that all Canadian children have the best possible 
opportunity to develop their full potential”.  The truth is that 
while 1.4 million children participate in some form of paid child 
care, the organizations operate without the support of clear 
public policy and with little or no public funding.  The shocking 
reality is that on average child care workers are paid less than 
zoo keepers.  In 1996 the net average annual income of caregivers 
in regulated family child care was $8,400.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of value the Liberal government has placed on 
caregivers.  I think it raises very serious concerns about where 
this motion is coming from, that it is not connected to the 
reality of what has happened in Canada which has undermined the 
ability of families to provide care at home or to give options to 
women to improve their equality and to ensure there is early 
childhood education for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Liberals abandoned their 1993 election promise to 
create 150,000 new child care spaces.  The 1997 platform does not 
even mention child care, so we have a travesty on our hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we support the idea of remuneration for the important work 
mothers and some fathers do in the home, the real issue and the 
ideal is to have this become one component of a much broader 
comprehensive initiative centred around early childhood care and 
education, the equality of women and ensuring there are real 
options in the home as well as in the workforce to make sure we 
do not see a situation of growing poverty among children and 
families.  It is to make sure we do not see a situation where 
women are denied EI benefits, where women are denied pay equity 
and where women are struggling, living below the poverty line 
caring for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the member to go back to his government and to point out 
the stark realities and the contradictions and the victimization 
that has happened to women and children of this country because 
of policies from the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik has long worked on this.  He 
presented a similar motion in 1993, when he was a member of the 
Progressive Conservative Party.  The only difference is that he 
referred only to women then.  In five years, not only did he 
become a Liberal, but he now includes men too.  I congratulate 
him on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is a good idea, but it should be looked at more 
seriously.  I think that everyone agrees the work done by 
parents who stay at home is important and should be recognized 
in some way or other.  However, a guaranteed hourly salary of 
$5.40 is not very realistic these days. 
The member must realize that his own government will never agree 
to his motion.  But it is nice to dream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member were serious, he would perhaps be looking at more 
realistic solutions.  My colleague from Shefford introduced in 
this House a motion to index the child tax benefit, which was 
agreed to on division.  Perhaps the member should try to 
convince his own government to introduce legislation consistent 
with his motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could perhaps think about investing more money in 
child care or about giving tax credits.  More flexible work 
schedules could be established.  The hon. member could also 
pressure his own caucus to get the government to consider these 
proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of such a project could reach $9 billion.  I do not 
think the government is prepared to spend that kind of money. 
I thank the hon. member for proposing this motion, but, 
unfortunately, I do not think it is very realistic.

am very pleased to speak to this motion today. I extend my 
congratulations to the member for Abitibi for taking the time, 
with all the issues he could have raised in this House, to put 
forward the family and investing in children as the issue he 
wanted to bring before the House and phrase it in a way that did 
not lock people into anything but rather gave us the opportunity 
again to talk about investing in children and the family.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the Government of Canada has taken 
positive steps to invest in our children such as the increases in 
the Canada child tax benefit, cumulatively about $1.7 billion of 
additional investment.  Is it enough?  No, but it is a start and 
we are working in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a debate about child poverty.  This is a debate 
about the principle of how to invest in children so we improve 
the probabilities of better physical, mental and social health 
outcomes of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Fraser Mustard, the founder of the Canadian Institute for 
Advanced Research, came before the Standing Committee on Health, 
of which I was a member, in October 1994.  Dr. Mustard provided 
us with substantive evidence that childhood outcomes were not a 
question of being rich or poor but rather of other factors 
related to the quality of care during the formative years of 
infancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very important point.  Poor people can raise very 
healthy, well adjusted children.  Rich people can have very 
poorly developed children.  It is not simply a matter of rich and 
poor.  Poverty is an exacerbating factor, not a causal factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spent a lot of time on this issue and I want to share 
with the House some new research that has come out this year 
regarding why it is important to have direct parental care.  It 
came out in a report that was completed in April 1998 and 
published in June 1998. It came from Dr. Christopher Ruhm of the 
University of North Carolina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study was of population data from 1969 to 1994, 25 years of 
population data.  It looked at nine European countries, Denmark, 
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway and 
Sweden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study is long but the conclusion is not.  The conclusion is 
very important.  Dr. Ruhm found up to a 29.1% reduction in infant 
mortality where paid maternity leave, direct parental care, was 
given for the first year of a child's life. That first year is 
very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study does elaborate a bit.  When he broke down the 29% of 
the reduction in infant mortality, Dr. Ruhm found more 
specifically that there was a 25% decline in post-neonatal 
deaths.  That means the first year.  Of the 29%, 25%, almost all 
of it, had to do with the first year of life.  Eleven per cent of 
the total was for the period from age one to age five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue of quality of care and it has to do with a lot 
of issues.  One really important issue is breast feeding.  There 
is a lot of research regarding the importance of breast feeding. 
In February of this year the president of the Canadian Paediatric 
Society, on behalf of the society said to Canadians that they 
wholeheartedly support the international guidelines set by the 
World Health Organization and UNICEF that breast feeding should 
be given for one year at least for the optimal health of the 
children during that first year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not an insignificant amount.  They indicated that about 
1.5 million children in the world die each year because they are 
not breast fed.  That is an outstanding statistic that members 
should keep in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question in my mind that it is important that we 
invest in children and it is not just a matter of throwing money 
somewhere and hoping something is going to happen.  The issue is 
trying to improve the quality of care given to children during 
the formative years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Carnegie task force study of 1994 entitled “Starting 
Points” the research observed that good physical and mental 
health, the ability to learn, to cope with stress, to relate well 
with others and to have a positive outlook were all rooted in the 
earliest experiences of life. They concluded that where, how and 
with whom children spend their early years of life are the most 
significant determinants of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider the impact on the brain development of a child 
and the fact that 80% of the lifetime development of a human 
being's brain is complete by age three and that the issue of 
abstract reasoning, problem solving and general logic in a 
child's brain is all wired and established by age one, there is 
no question based on current research that the first year of life 
is where we should be investing in our children.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have also been a number of other studies but I will not go 
into them because members have them on the record. Many 
initiatives have been brought forward in this place.  There have 
been bills, such as Bill C-256 in the last parliament, on income 
splitting between spouses so one could stay at home and care for 
preschool children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was Motion No. M-30 on the caregiver tax credit.  It 
passed in this House in the last parliament.  It proposed a 
caregiver tax credit for those who supplied care in the home to 
preschool children, the chronically ill, the aged and the 
disabled.  It passed 129 to 63 in this House.  I know who the 63 
were and they opposed the motion on a technicality, of not 
supporting anything that involves spending money. The point is 
that when we had the debate in the House, member after member 
stood up during the three hours of debate and supported the issue 
that we have to support caregivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some suggest that maybe this should go through the Income Tax 
Act.  I will give one example of why this should not go through 
the Income Tax Act. It has to do with farm mothers.  Under the 
Income Tax Act a woman working on the family farm is not 
considered to be working.  Therefore she does not qualify for the 
child care expense deduction or any other deduction because she 
has no earned income.  To do it through the Income Tax Act would 
be discriminatory against every farm mother in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also does not address lone parent families. If the lone 
parent cannot work and there is a benefit through the Income Tax 
Act and there is no earned income, there is no way the lone 
parent could benefit from anything through the tax act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best approach is to go back to something we had earlier.  It 
was called the family allowance. The family allowance was an 
allowance for parents because they had children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child care costs exist for no other reason than the fact that 
the child exists.  Parents who provide direct parental care also 
have real costs in raising their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some important points which we should really take into 
consideration when we consider a motion like this one.  This 
issue transcends partisan politics.  Some issues are brought up 
by private members in good faith.  They are not motivated by 
partisan politics, not motivated by trying to rattle somebody's 
cage, but motivated because those members are prepared to stand 
in this House and declare what their interests are and to declare 
to their constituents that they care about family and children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I want to congratulate the member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik.  The member has done this House a 
service by raising again that investing in children and the 
family is the dollar best spent by Canadians.  I know that this 
is an issue which is shared by many people in this House.  I hope 
that as we get more and more opportunities in this place to talk 
about investing in children and not just about child poverty but 
the poverty of physical, mental and social health, we will see 
that directing some sort of a benefit to our children is in fact 
the best thing for our children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in the House today to discuss this very 
important issue. I have to say at the outset that I have some 
serious reservations about the hon. member's motion. I ask the 
question, would it improve the lives of Canadian children more 
than the current initiatives undertaken by the Government of 
Canada and our provincial and territorial partners? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be helpful at this time to consider the initiatives 
presently under way to help give our children every opportunity 
to develop their full potential as Canadian citizens. I am sure 
that is what the hon. member is hoping to adopt if his motion in 
fact were to proceed and go forward.  I commend him for his 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of our hon. colleagues have already outlined the 
effectiveness of the Canada child tax benefit and other measures 
that benefit families with children.  I would like to talk a 
little about the national children's agenda.  I will begin by 
briefly outlining the positive history of the development of this 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1997 at a meeting of the Ministerial Council on 
Social Policy Renewal, federal, provincial and territorial 
government officials agreed to work together to develop a 
national children's agenda. 
This agenda was confirmed as a priority for government in the 
September 1997 Speech from the Throne.  To quote from that speech 
“Federal, provincial and territorial governments will work 
together to develop this broader agenda for children, including 
clear outcome measurements by which to gauge success”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1150
<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further confirmation to the high priority given to the national 
children's agenda was evident in the publication of “Securing 
our Future Together” and again at the December 1997 meeting of 
first ministers.  In fact the development of the national 
children's agenda to date is a superb example of what can be 
accomplished when we work in partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national children's agenda has a broad scope. The government 
and its partners recognize that the full development of our 
children cuts across many sectors:  health, social services, 
justice, and education to name a few.  It involves participation 
at many levels of authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a February 1997 speech to the Ottawa-Carleton Board of Trade, 
the Prime Minister said that the national children's agenda will 
be “an effective, modern, truly national approach to benefits 
and services for children and for families”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the government and its partners are not about 
to reinvent the wheel.  The national children's agenda will build 
upon efforts already under way by federal, provincial and 
territorial governments, community groups, business and voluntary 
sectors, child care professionals and of course families 
themselves who have the greatest responsibility for their 
children's welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major provisions of the national children's agenda is 
that it will act as a springboard for future and further 
initiatives.  It will be a magnet that will draw partners 
together to continually enrich the provisions under that agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people may ask why a national children's agenda is 
necessary.  There is strong evidence including scientific 
research which shows that what happens to children when they are 
very young shapes their health and well-being throughout their 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need the national children's agenda because unfortunately 
some Canadian children are especially vulnerable in today's 
rapidly changing world.  We know that although children in many 
families experience a great deal of love, others experience abuse 
and neglect and suffer from physical and mental health problems. 
We need then to pay particular attention to family difficulties 
to ensure that these disadvantaged children have the chance to 
get a good start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people and levels of government are already involved in 
helping Canada's children grow into healthy and well adjusted 
adults.  There is however widespread recognition that no one 
individual or organization can meet all the child's needs. That 
quite frankly is why we need a national children's agenda.  We 
need a truly comprehensive and complementary approach to ensure 
that there is no wasteful duplication of services and to ensure 
that no child falls between the cracks. That is very important 
for all of us as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the national children's agenda initiatives have already 
been announced, such as the national child benefit. The learning 
readiness indicators are another priority which is being worked 
on.  A lack of readiness to learn can harm a child's chances of 
fulfilling his or her potential.  Data from the national 
longitudinal survey on children and youth indicates that up to 
15% of all Canadian children who begin school may not in fact be 
ready to learn.  Learning readiness indicators also will help us 
to measure the readiness of our children to learn. That will 
enable us to assess just how well we are doing at giving our 
children the very best possible start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the national children's agenda the Government of Canada 
will also expand the aboriginal head start program to cover First 
Nations children living on reserves.  Begun in 1995, aboriginal 
head start already helps First Nations, Metis and Inuit children 
living in urban centres and large northern communities to prepare 
for school. This initiative responds to the report of the Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples which underlined the importance 
of extending corresponding assistance to First Nations children 
living on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national children's agenda will establish centres of 
excellence for children's well-being. This also is important to 
note. The purpose of these centres will be to help us understand 
and respond to the physical and mental health needs of children 
and to understand the critical conditions for healthy 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents an overview of the national children's agenda. 
I would ask the hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik to 
support this agenda and other measures mentioned today and to 
work with the government to implement them before we take on the 
massive legislative changes necessary to adopt his motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we should take one approach and evaluate the results 
before trying another.  I appreciate the intent of the hon. 
member's motion but I am unable to support it at this time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it must be abundantly obvious to everyone sitting in 
this House that we need more time to debate this very important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very thankful that I have the opportunity as someone who 
has helped to develop Reform's family issues policy to be able to 
address this motion for a very brief time this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to immediately let everybody know where I am coming from. 
Caring for our children is the most worthwhile and important 
task anyone in this country can perform. I think we all agree on 
this.  I have been listening to the debate and we may not agree 
on the solution but we do agree that this issue is very important 
and needs to be talked about in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing that I have not heard very much talk about 
and which needs to be discussed.  Whenever we talk about 
developing a program such as this one, we have to first ask what 
the costs will be.  I am talking about money but there are also 
justice, education, health care and social costs such as welfare 
that need to be factored in when we develop a program like this 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have studied this for quite some time.  If, as we have 
advocated many times, we were to run this through the tax system 
and recognize child care in that way for those parents who wish 
to stay at home and take care of their children, the reduced 
justice costs, education costs, health care costs and social 
costs would more than pay for any program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that disturbs me and actually surprises me is 
that members who have been talking about this have not told us 
what the costs would be if we simply paid out a certain sum of 
money for child care to the parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would like to make is incentive.  Every time 
we have a government program there is going to be an incentive of 
some kind or another built in and that needs to be analysed.  If 
we were to simply pay out the money through another large 
government program, what kind of an incentive would that give? 
Would a small percentage of people abuse it and have children 
simply for the sake of having children rather than having them 
because they wish to raise the next generation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the devil is in the details.  What regulations would 
accompany this?  When the state gets involved and interferes in 
family affairs, problems will come down the road.  We will run 
into problems unless parents take care of their children as they 
wish rather than as the state dictates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the highest quality of child care is given by 
parents who care for their children because their motive is love. 
Unless that is happening, we are going to have problems. That is 
why we need to run this through the Income Tax Act, income 
splitting and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the importance of this issue, I would like to ask for 
unanimous consent to make this a votable motion so that we can 
debate the issue further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  At any time members can 
appeal to the House for unanimous consent.  Does the House 
understand the request made by the member? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have permission to put

</I></B></P><P align=left>I said during my speech that we must respect all governments,

ideas expressed by members. We should take the time at some 
point to discuss the motion put forward by the hon. member 
opposite seeking the unanimous consent of the House to continue

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-54, an act to support and promote electronic commerce by 
protecting personal information that is collected, used or 
disclosed in certain circumstances, by providing for the use of 
electronic means to communicate or record information or 
transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the 
Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to address the 
House regarding Bill C-54, the personal information protection 
and electronic documents act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the advent of the new information economy, Canadians are 
finding new ways of connecting to each other, to markets, to 
governments and, indeed, to the world.  All Canadians have a 
stake in the new knowledge based economy which brings with it 
changes that profoundly affect all of our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's success in the 21st century depends increasingly on the 
ability of all Canadians to participate and succeed in the global 
knowledge based economy.  To ensure that participation we must 
move quickly to provide Canadians with the necessary access, 
skills and confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54, the personal information protection and electronic 
documents act, is a significant step toward achieving these 
goals. In very significant and practical ways it will help build 
the confidence of Canadians in a field that will be key to 
Canada's prosperity in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill addresses three issues to help Canadians fully exploit 
the true potential of the Internet as a medium of information and 
commerce.  The proposed legislation would protect the personal 
information of Canadians in their dealings with private sector 
organizations.  It would create an electronic alternative for 
doing business with the federal government.  It would provide a 
legal footing for electronic records and secure electronic 
signatures. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill demonstrates leadership in building the information 
society.  It will make it both easier and more secure for 
citizens to deal with the government electronically, when they 
choose to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already, the federal government has pioneered the use of the 
Internet as a means to improve service to Canadians, increase 
efficiency and lower costs.  Many of the federal government's 
transactions with the public—from filing for patent protection 
to the provision of information on any number of subjects—can 
now take place electronically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much more can be done if we update federal statutes and 
regulations to capture the opportunities presented by the 
Internet. 
Many existing statutes and regulations often specify that 
information must be given “in writting,” or “signed.”  Such 
references can be interpreted as restricting transactions to 
paper only, and as precluding the electronic provision of 
information.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Department of Justice has found that more than 300 
federal statutes contain references that appear to limit 
electronic service delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 allows us to make existing statutes and regulations 
compatible with an electronic environment.  It will enable us to 
provide an electronic alternative to the transmission of 
information on paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the operations of the federal government it 
addresses very real needs in three specific fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 gives federal departments, agencies and boards the 
authority to decide how requirements in existing statutes and 
regulations can be satisfied by electronic means in place of 
paper.  Since the integrity and reliability of electronic 
transmissions must be ensured, provisions to foster the practical 
development and implementation of secure electronic signatures 
are a key component of the bill.  A federal department, agency or 
board must be technologically and operationally ready before it 
offers its services to the public via electronic media.  The time 
required to attain readiness will undoubtedly vary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, each federal body will be given flexibility and 
have the discretion to apply the new law and do business 
electronically when it is fully up to speed and has both the 
technological and operational capabilities necessary to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electronic technology is affecting evidence presented to 
Canadian courts in ever increasing ways.  Bill C-54 will clarify 
how the courts assess electronic documents and recognize 
electronic signatures, give recognition to notices and acts 
published electronically by the Queen's Printer and give official 
status to the electronic version of the consolidated statutes and 
regulations of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to stress that the creation of an electronic 
alternative does not mean the federal government is doing away 
with the more traditional methods that it uses to communicate 
with Canadians.  People will not have to throw out their pens and 
paper and typewriters or be forced to communicate exclusively 
over the Internet.  Rather, we are enabling the federal 
government to accommodate a way to do business that is more and 
more popular with Canadians through electronic means. Canadians 
increasingly have demonstrated that they want to do business 
electronically, not just with their governments but with the 
private sector as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electronic commerce conducted over the Internet is currently 
estimated at about $45 billion Canadian.  However, exponential 
growth is forecast, with e-comm revenues expected to reach $600 
billion Canadian by year 2002.  This is a reflection of the 
skyrocketing growth of the Internet.  The Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business has found that the number of small 
businesses with Internet access doubled in just one year between 
1995 and 1996. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building of an environment where electronic commerce can 
flourish is a key component of the government's commitment to 
ensure that Canadians can take advantage of the opportunities 
offered by today's connected and global economy.  We want to 
establish Canada as the world leader in electronic commerce by the 
year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For electronic commerce to flourish in Canada, the first 
requisite is clear: a predictable and supportive environment 
wherein citizens, businesses and institutions can feel 
comfortable, secure and confident. 
All of us, consumer, business and government alike, need to feel 
confident about how our personal information is gathered, stored 
and used.  The protection of our personal privacy is a basic 
right which Canadians cherish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To safeguard privacy, however, there is a significant challenge 
to be met.  In the electronic age, every time we make a 
transaction we leave a “data trail,” traces that can be 
compiled and assembled to provide a detailed record of our own 
personal histories and preferences.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a risk that these records may be sent across provincial 
and national borders, or sold, reused or integrated with other 
databases without our knowledge or consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider just some of the ways in which Canadians already can 
and do use the Internet.  We already use it to shop and to plan 
vacations from our homes.  We use it to do banking from home.  We 
use it to correspond with family and friends wherever they may be 
in the world.  We use it to read on-line magazines and to 
participate in discussion groups.  All of these uses can 
unavoidably reveal traces of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As consumers and citizens we need to know that we have some 
control over our information and be assured that it enjoys a 
basic level of protection.  Bill C-54 will provide this 
protection.  It addresses the need to safeguard personal data by 
establishing a right to the protection of personal information. 
It sets clear rules for how that information will be collected 
and used and disclosed in the course of commercial activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1998 the departments of industry and justice released 
a public discussion paper entitled “The Protection of Personal 
Information—Building Canada's Information Economy and Society”. 
This paper outlined the various issues which must be addressed in 
the development of legislation to protect personal information 
and it sought input from Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians consistently expressed concerns about their privacy in 
light of the new technologies, particularly with regard to the 
control of personal information.  Canadians have told us that 
they want legislation that is light, flexible and effective and 
that provides meaningful recourse for consumers.  They support 
building on existing instruments, especially the national 
standard for the protection of personal information of the 
Canadian Standards Association, and they told us that they wanted 
independent oversight, someone to investigate complaints and 
ensure compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the development of the legislation before us the CSA standard 
was a particularly relevant avenue to explore. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a set of ten fair information principles.  They address 
the ways in which organizations should collect, use, disclose and 
protect personal information.  They also concern such things as 
accuracy and security safeguards; the need for an individual's 
knowledge and consent regarding information collection; and 
measures to provide organizational accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CSA standard was developed in the early 1990s, through a 
broad consultative process that included representatives from the 
public sector, business, consumer advocacy groups, labour and 
others. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us will require organizations to comply 
with all 10 fair information principles of the CSA standard for 
the protection of personal information.  Furthermore, compliance 
with the legislation will be overseen by the privacy commissioner 
of Canada.  The privacy commissioner's role will include 
receiving and investigating complaints and mediating disputes. 
Unresolved disputes can be taken to the Federal Court of Canada 
for final resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time in Canada the protection of personal 
information in the private sector can, by and large, best be 
described as sporadic and uneven.  Many industries are not 
subject to any rules at all concerning the collection, use and 
disclosure of personal information.  The rest are covered by what 
the privacy commissioner of Canada has called a patchwork of 
laws, regulations and codes.  The result is that protection is 
incomplete and, quite possibly, inconsistent.  This situation is 
no longer acceptable.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our consultations regarding privacy, Canadians told us over 
and over again that they were very concerned about having 
consistent protection across Canada for their personal 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian business raised similar concerns about consistency and 
the need for a single set of rules to ensure a level playing 
field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address these concerns the legislation will apply first to 
the federally regulated private sector.  Three years after coming 
into force it will apply more broadly, covering virtually the 
entire private sector, except where a province or territory has 
passed similar legislation.  Where and whenever organizations are 
subject to such provincial or territorial law they would be 
exempted from the application of the federal law by order of the 
governor in council. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 also has the great advantage that it builds upon the 
existing CSA voluntary measures.  It is designed provide a regime 
that is simple, yet effective, consumer friendly, not overly 
burdensome for industry, especially small and medium sized 
enterprises, cost-efficient and with a minimal administrative 
burden, and, in conformity with Canada's international agreements 
and trade obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs new legislation to protect privacy.  Legislation 
must strike a balance between the right of individuals to have 
some control over their personal information and to have access 
to avenues for effective redress, and the need of industry to 
collect and use personal information as a vital component of 
success in the information economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us strikes that balance.  It addresses 
both the business need to gather, store and use personal 
information and the consumer need to control the collection of 
information, to be informed about how that information will be 
used and to be assured that the information will be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 will help build the consumer trust and market 
certainty needed to ensure that Canada is a world leader in 
electronic commerce and the global information economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information privacy is crucial for a number of reasons.  First 
and most basically, it is related to a series of other rights and 
values, such as liberty, freedom of expression and freedom of 
association.  Without some control over our personal information 
our ability to enjoy these fundamental rights may be hindered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, in the new information economy information is a 
valuable commodity that can bring jobs, prosperity and higher 
levels of customer service.  This reality, along with other key 
factors, is creating mounting pressure to collect and use 
personal information more broadly than ever before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian citizens are right when they ask for adequate privacy 
protection in the new digital economy.  The legislation before us 
will help to provide that protection.  It addresses both present 
and future challenges, and I am confident that it will receive 
justly deserved support from the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to discuss Bill C-54, which I believe goes in the right 
direction.  Some very good points have been made in the bill. 
The minister's statements of a moment ago illustrate the 
significance of electronic commerce in Canada and virtually the 
entire world. We need to recognize and accept that, and I think 
we all do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem I see with this bill has to do with what is really 
being done here.  It is not as if electronic commerce developed 
yesterday.  It has been with us for quite some time.  It has 
existed for at least 13 years in terms of doing business, in 
terms of consumer shopping, and we have had ATMs for a number of 
years.  It is almost as if suddenly something has happened, that 
it is recent and has happened just now, but it has not happened 
just now.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that this is really a catch-up system, and 
for that I want to commend the government.  This bill will make 
it possible to use some of the modern technology, to do some of 
the filing that needs to be done electronically and to get 
information and things of that sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there are some people who wonder:  What is this 
electronic commerce anyway?   What are we really talking about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the business of making transactions via 
telecommunications systems using computer technologies.  It is 
almost as if computer technologies and telecommunications are 
separate.  I do not think one could exist without the other.  The 
telecommunications industry depends upon computers and computers 
depend upon the telecommunications industry.  The two are very 
much involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How big is electronic commerce?  It is big.  The minister just 
indicated to us some of the dimensions of the electronic commerce 
industry and we know they are true.  It looks like there will be 
not only a tenfold increase, but a manifold increase. Nobody 
knows exactly how fast this electronic commerce area is going to 
grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this an issue today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we have many laws in Canada covering paper 
transactions and paper commerce.  Paper transactions are founded 
on the notion and the awareness of boundaries:  provincial, 
federal and international.  Laws and taxes are applied within 
these boundaries and there are agreements as to which law or tax 
has precedence in cross-boundary transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, traditional boundaries do not exist on the Internet. 
Therefore, legal rules and consumer protocols become unclear, 
especially when the consumer is not even aware that they have 
crossed a traditional border in making a transaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which law or tax then applies?  Can the same law be applied to 
the electronic world as is applied to the paper world?  This is a 
fundamental question because it raises the kinds of principles 
which ought to govern legislation with regard to electronic 
commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is not complete and I think the minister would agree 
that it is not complete.  It is be a good beginning, but it is 
only a beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very careful that in this beginning we do not 
chart a course that ends up with errors of some kind.  We have to 
be very careful that we choose the right course at the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We use electronic commerce to transfer funds in banking, to pay 
our bills and to access automatic teller machines.  We use it in 
the operation and in the guidance of trucks, ships, planes; 
vehicles which are in the air, on land and at sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The global positioning system, for example, is strictly an 
electronic mechanism.  Satellites such as RADARSAT make a very 
significant contribution to electronic commerce.  What does it 
do?  It provides information, for example, about what is 
happening to the ice caps.  It also inventories and gives 
information almost immediately about the moisture conditions in 
various parts of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are some of the issues involved?  The minister said that 
one of the big issues is privacy.  Yes, privacy is a major issue, 
but I would like to raise another issue before I speak about 
privacy, and that is the integrity of the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Integrity means that we can have trust and confidence in the 
information that is made available to us by electronic means. For 
example, can we be assured that what we think is happening is 
actually happening?  Is the money being transferred from my bank 
account to somebody else's bank account as it ought to be?  Is my 
account being credited or debited as it ought to be?  Will the 
person receive exactly what it is they thought they were buying 
via the Internet or the telephone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Verifying signatures is a very significant issue as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public information cryptography issue is involved.  The 
business of recognizing the public key infrastructure on 
cryptography is something that this bill wants to control.  We 
need to ask ourselves the question:  To what degree can or ought 
the government be able to control the various encryption methods 
and systems? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year there was a discussion regarding the type of 
policy the government should pursue with regard to encryption. 
There was a lot of resistance to this particular issue.  A policy 
statement was finally drafted.  I believe there are some good 
aspects to this particular policy.  However, I would like to ask 
whether the provisions in the legislation before us are 
consistent with the provisions of the policy on encryption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, one of the elements in this encryption policy 
states that Canadians are free to develop, import and use 
whatever cryptography products they wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will not implement mandatory key recovery 
requirements or licensing regimes.  The government encourages 
industry to establish responsible practices, such as key recovery 
techniques for stored data.  The government will act as a model 
user of cryptography through practices of the Government of 
Canada public key infrastructure program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy indicates that Canada will take into consideration 
the export practices of other countries and the availability of 
comparable products when rendering export permit decisions.  The 
export permit application process will be made more transparent 
and procedures will be streamlined to ensure the least regulatory 
intervention necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the issue is to ensure that the integrity of information from 
one business to another business is indeed safe, secure and 
private, that is one thing.  However, if the issue is government 
intervention and the ability to intervene, to read, to uncover 
and to break through the encryption that is used by businesses to 
do their business, then all privacy will be destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the policy suggests that the government will not do 
that.  However, the issue is that it is not protected in this 
particular legislation.  This legislation does not say that the 
government may not or the government shall not get into the 
encryption systems that various industries may use in doing their 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to deal with encryption a bit further.  Someone may 
ask:  What is encryption?  It is actually a code.  Someone who 
does not know the code cannot uncover the message.  We must 
ensure that a message which is designed to reach a particular 
destination only reaches that destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Internet is accessible by many.  That message, 
once it is put on the Internet, can be retrieved by virtually 
anyone unless it is encrypted.  The person who receives the 
message must either decipher what the encryption is or have the 
key that gets them into the message immediately.  There are many 
people who are pretty sharp at discovering encryption systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to accept that the new laser technology and the 
application of the laser technology is one that we need to look 
at carefully.  There are experts in this field who say that if 
one human being has created a code another human being can 
decrypt that code.  Dr. Paul Corkum of the National Research 
Council makes the statement that unbreakable codes for secure 
information transfer can be based on the basic structure of 
light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we enter the field of laser technology we are dealing with 
a complicated issue.  Nevertheless, Dr. Corkum makes the 
unequivocal statement that unbreakable codes for secure 
information transfer can be based on the basic structure of 
light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere in this legislation is there reference to unbreakable 
codes or the use of encryption codes being limited to business, 
government or anything of the kind.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to have privacy we must be absolutely sure that if 
someone wishes to encrypt a message the message can be encrypted 
to the degree that no one else can understand it except those for 
whom the message was destined in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize not only the need for privacy but another 
area in the legislation which has to do with privacy.  It has 
nothing to do with encryption but it has something to do with the 
provision of privacy of information.  I refer to the beginning of 
the bill.  In division 1, which is headed “Protection of 
personal information”, subclause 5(2) says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word “should” when used in Schedule 1, indicates a 
recommendations and does not impose an obligation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Should” is a guidance and not an obligation. Let us go to 
schedule 1 and have a look at what is there.  In section 4.2.3 it 
states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>identified purposes should be specified at or before the time of 
collection to the individual from whom the personal information 
is collected— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose should be stated.  It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Depending upon the way in which the information is collected, 
this is can be done orally or in writing.  An application form, 
for example, may give notice of the purposes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a possibility.  It should be there, but it is not a 
requirement that it be there. However, the next section, which is 
section 4.2.4, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When personal information that has been collected is to be used 
for a purpose not previously identified, the new purpose shall be 
identified prior to use. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not an interesting contradiction or at least an 
implication of confusion?  In the first instance it is not 
obligatory that the purpose be stated, but if it is stated and it 
is changed then there is a requirement that the individual be 
notified.  If we wanted to protect ourselves and wanted to be 
flexible, we would simply never state the purpose.  Then we could 
do whatever we wanted because section 4.2.4 would not apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some interesting questions about what is being done 
and being proposed in the legislation.  As the committee deals 
with it, I hope it will be in some detail and that some of the 
weaknesses will perhaps be rectified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look as well at the conflict of interest issue.  In 
the bill there is no statement about the use of private 
information in a conflict of interest situation.  I refer 
particularly to the application forms currently in vogue and used 
by certain banking institutions in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until very recently an application form to do business, for 
example with the security branch of a bank, contained the name. 
Underneath there was very tiny print stating: I hereby allow or 
give permission to this bank to use the information given for 
trading securities to be used in other parts of its operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that banks today own trust companies and insurance 
companies.  Some of them are health insurance companies and life 
insurance companies.  They have investment dealers and clearly 
they have the banking institution.  Is it not interesting that a 
bank which collects information to trade securities may use it in 
other parts of its operation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us suppose one has a loan in the particular bank and an 
insurance problem.  Is it not interesting that individuals may 
suffer ill health which as a consequence, at least in the mind of 
the bank, places in jeopardy their ability to repay the loan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information was collected for the purpose of doing trading only 
in a particular bank.  Yet the bank is now able, through its 
insurance branch, to transfer the information.  That insurance 
branch may and will, if it owns an insurance company, have 
transactions with other insurance companies and may trade 
information. 
The potential for a conflict of interest is very real.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that although one has given voluntary 
permission to the bank to use this information and suddenly 
withdraws that permission, the bank reserves the right, in very 
tiny print, to close one's account with 30 days notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very interesting issues.  Compliance is granted 
by giving permission, but it is used in a way that was never 
intended, or the customer never believed it would be used in such 
a way.  The action is unilateral on the part of the financial 
institution to close the account if the individual suddenly 
chooses to withdraw access to the information for a purpose other 
than the one for which it was intended originally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now wish to move to the interdependence between electronic 
commerce and traditional or other commerce.  Electronic commerce 
cannot exist without a traditional infrastructure for moving 
things and people.  For example, a service may be ordered through 
the Internet but the product or service must be delivered.  A 
contract must ultimately be signed and become operational.  Funds 
must actually be moved from one state to the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the ability of being able to do electronic 
commerce.  There is an interdependence between electronic 
commerce and regular or traditional kinds of commerce.  This 
requires an infrastructure that is ready and able to meet the 
requirements, one of which is speed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time delivery is all very well if it is in a beautiful computer 
and it has to be deliver, for example, on September 30 of a 
particular year at one o'clock.  However, if the truck does not 
get there it does not help.  There is no relationship.  If the 
relationship is not there and it is not working, there are 
backlogs and queues and things break down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that there needs to be a back-up for 
intercommunication.  We need to trace the trail.  If something 
goes wrong we need to know where it went wrong, why it went 
wrong, who is responsible and how can it be fixed.  It involves 
all kinds of aspects.  It involves many people and things.  We 
need to know where are the airplanes, the satellites and the 
rockets on land.  Will it be done by foot, by truck, by rail or 
by any other method?  The situation on the sea is similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the business of controlling electronic commerce. 
It is also the matter of developing adequate human resources. The 
number one requirement in the whole business of electronic 
commerce is the ability of personnel.  Ultimately people will 
make the system go.  They need the ability to use electronic 
commerce information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They must know how it works.  They must understand how it works. 
Then they must expect to be able to apply it.  There must also be 
confidence and faith in the integrity of the information. All 
else depends on it.  Because it is so fast and because it allows 
transborder transactions very easily, errors are multiplied and 
magnified if they occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There also must be integration.  We need to recognize the 
interconnection of nations, the interconnection of industries and 
the interconnection of people.  There will be a tremendous 
requirement in the ability of management to integrate what 
appears to be separate and disparate parts into a corresponding 
and working whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really does something to me when I hear our Prime Minister 
answer the question about how far the dollar has to sink before 
we become alarmed.  The minister has often talked about the 
issue.  The Prime Minister, the senior minister in the country, 
is the one who should know.  He is the one who is asked this 
question because it is fundamental to our economy, to electronic 
commerce and to any other commerce.  He answers that the problem 
is market decisions. 
He answers that either it is floating currency or monetary policy 
under Canadian law like in most of the countries managed by the 
Bank of Canada.  According to him it is the way the system 
operates.  It is never the Prime Minister; it is the Governor of 
the Bank of Canada who makes these daily decisions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian economy is functioning very well.  We reduced the 
deficit from $42 billion to a surplus that was billions of 
dollars for the first three months.  In spite of strikes at GM, 
in construction and in the paper industry in Quebec, unemployment 
did not go up.  It remained at 8.4%.  We have around 1% 
inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago there was a report for the first time in a long 
time that activity in Canada had been higher than in the United 
States.  It is a very positive sign.  The monetary policy of the 
Canadian government is made by the governor of the bank under the 
Bank of Canada Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do better.  What can we as parliamentarians learn 
from the complications of electronic commerce and from the need 
to protect the privacy of individuals and to do business 
successfully and well?  We need to learn about a couple of 
issues.  We need to recognize that our ability to do things has 
been magnified manifold.  That means the responsibility of doing 
it right is greater than it has ever been.  We also need to 
recognize that one error can cause many other errors and have a 
far broader impact than was the case before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all we need to recognize the need for integrity and 
leadership in the country.  We need to know more.  The bill is 
not sufficient.  It is a good beginning but is not a leadership 
document.  If anything it is a document that catches up to where 
industry has been for the last 10 years.  We need leadership.  We 
need to understand the significance of what we are doing.  We 
need to be confident.  We need to have an attitude of 
co-operation, humility and self-control. We need to recognize, as 
never before, the absolute necessity and the centrality of 
integrity, truth and honesty in whatever we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not good enough for the Prime Minister to try to explain 
the value of the Canadian dollar and its fluctuations the way he 
does.  It is not good enough for the Minister of Finance to say 
we have a surplus while recognizing full well that the surplus is 
built on sand.  In fact it is not even good sand.  It is shifting 
sand because it is built on the revenues collected for the EI 
program rather than on the management of the finances of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to tell the truth.  The Prime Minister, the Minister of 
Finance and the rest of the ministers need to tell the story the 
way it really is.  If they do not it will not be long, 
particularly with the transfers across borders, with e-commerce 
and any other mechanisms available to us, that the truth will be 
known.  Where is the confidence going to come from when in fact 
we recognize that the Minister of Finance has not told us the 
truth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the confidence when we recognize that we do not have a 
balanced budget, that it is a concoction of numbers which makes 
it look as if it is balanced but is not really balanced? This is 
dangerous.  If there ever was a time for us to learn from a bill, 
it is this one which is at the cutting edge. It does not provide 
leadership but it is at the cutting edge, and for that I commend 
the minister.

ministerial position, the government's position and the position 
of the bureaucrats are identical, and that government can be 
there with integrity so that we can depend on what it tells the 
people and base our future direction on that.  That is what we 
need to learn from legislation like this.

<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, for very 
many years now—as I am going to document—Canada has been waiting 
for legislation on the protection of personal information, 
privacy legislation relating to the private sector.  The bill we 
have before us this morning is titled as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An Act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting 
personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in 
certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic 
means to communicate or record information or transactions and 
by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments 
Act and the Statute Revision Act 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with this bill is that it is not a bill addressing 
the protection of privacy.  My colleague has just referred to 
the need for leadership, and the Minister of Industry has spoken 
of his desire to take a lead role by introducing this bill in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where he was expected to show leadership was not only in 
protecting consumers involved in electronic commerce—and even 
here we need to look at how much protection they have, because 
it is far from sufficient—but also in protecting privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privacy is a fundamental right. In 1983, Canada enacted privacy 
legislation relating to government bodies coming under federal 
jurisdiction.  The Charter contains certain provisions, but the 
minister himself has acknowledged that this protection is 
sporadic and uneven, and no longer acceptable.  This situation 
is no longer acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leadership in privacy protection came from Quebec. Since 
1984 Quebec has had legislation, effective legislation, to 
protect personal information in the private sector.  That 
legislation has proven itself. 
We would have expected to see it used as a model, because it is 
the only legislation based on experience and know-how. It has not 
had the catastrophic results some were predicting in the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now more than ever, when private information can be collected 
and collated without an individual's knowledge, transmitted, 
sold, used for all sorts of reasons, with impunity, or just 
about, except in Quebec, what we would have expected from the 
minister was a bill with some teeth. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1250
<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are going to ask him for.  And we are going to 
take this opportunity not just to talk about the importance of 
the right to privacy, but also to get some information across. 
Because, all too often, members of the public, who are not just 
consumers of commercial services, but people living in the real 
world, faced with a plethora of intermediaries collecting 
potentially erroneous information and selling it or using it for 
their own or other purposes, deserve much more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will tell me that, if Quebec's legislation is so 
effective, it can go on being effective, and Quebeckers should 
decry the fact that Canadians cannot count on a better law.  But 
it is much more complicated than that, because not only does 
this bill fail to provide sufficient protection for the public's 
privacy but, as it now stands, it undermines—yes, undermines—the 
protection Quebeckers enjoy under Quebec's legislation.  And 
that is even more unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give clear and documented examples.  Right now, under 
Quebec's legislation, an Eaton's employee in Montreal has access 
to his personal file held by his employer, even if this personal 
information is kept in Toronto. 
With Bill C-54, this request for access becomes part of a 
interprovincial access request. Thus, since it is not part of a 
commercial transaction, according to the interpretation in the 
bill as it now stands, and given the recourses available, that 
employee will no longer be entitled to access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider another example: at the present time, if a 
person undergoes a medical examination for insurance purposes, 
the results of that medical are recorded by an American 
organization with a branch in Toronto.  At this time, the client 
has the right to access his records.  Since this will no longer 
be part of a commercial transaction, there is a good chance that 
right will not continue.  This is not taking into consideration 
the type of recourse that is in the federal legislation. I will 
come back to this point a little later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have read the minister's press releases which intimated that 
the Quebec legislation would apply in its entirety.  Yet this is 
not at all what we see in the bill, in a number of aspects. 
Clause 27 gives all of the power to the governor in council, or 
to put it more simply, to the government, for deciding whether 
or not a provincial act will apply in whole or in part.  I think 
it is worthwhile reading this clause, although it is couched in 
the curious language used in bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>27(1) The Governor in Council may make regulations— 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) if satisfied that legislation of a province that is 
substantially similar to this Part applies to an organization, a 
class of organizations, an activity or a class of activities, 
exempt the organization, activity of class from the application 
of this Part in respect of the collection, use or disclosure of 
personal information that occurs within that province. 
</UL></UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very well for the law in Quebec to be the law in 
Quebec, the governor in council can decide what part of the law 
applies or does not apply within the province involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision is shocking.  I could say we are used to this, 
but it is more than that.  This is serious.  In the very area 
the minister wants to open up, electronic commerce, there are a 
number of players, including a major one, our neighbour, the 
United States.  We know that, in the United States, and this is 
one of the problems we will talk about, the government wants to 
let business regulate itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the European Union.  Canada wants to establish a 
free trade zone with it.  A meeting to this end is being held 
here right now. 
The European Union has already established guidelines that are 
very much along the same lines as the law in Quebec, in fact so 
much so that it had planned not to authorize any business links 
except with Quebec, because the other provinces and the United 
States could not properly guarantee the protection of the 
personal information of the people of the European Union. This 
issue of effectively and efficiently guaranteeing personal 
information is more than a Quebec-Canada dispute.  It is far more 
than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must underscore, and perhaps members will think excessively 
so, the fact that Quebec was really at the forefront in 
formulating clear, readily implemented and effective 
legislation—unlike the federal one—which meets the criteria of 
the European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the minister wanted to demonstrate the leadership he is 
claiming, he should have adopted these principles, not because 
they are our principles or because Quebec is involved, but 
because this is the sort of protection the people of Quebec and 
of Canada are entitled to expect.  Instead, Quebeckers' rights 
are being infringed.  And Canadians do not have enough 
protection, not in the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of the provisions in this bill fall short, but one 
involves the reduction of Quebec's rights and that is the one 
concerning all the provincial provisions.  Under Quebec law at 
the moment, as I was saying earlier, an individual working in 
Quebec can access his record, wherever it is, or a person having 
a medical examination can see his records, wherever they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on, it will no longer be the case, since all the 
provisions that go beyond provincial jurisdiction will be 
subject to federal legislation. One might wonder whether federal 
legislation will provide the same protection. The answer is no. 
When it comes to information that is not of a commercial nature, 
the act is vague, to say the very least.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The core of Bill C-54 is a standard, a CSA national standard that 
bears a number and that was approved in a totally different 
legislative context by the standards board, in consultation with 
the telemarketing board and another body whose name I forget, as 
well as with consumer representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this self-regulating project is commendable, particularly 
since it originated with the private sector, it is also full of 
conditions. There are a number of very important provisions for 
people on the information needed to create their files, and on 
the use of these files, that are full of conditional “may”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act provides that these conditions may be overlooked. The 
problem is that all this is extremely confusing. 
What can a person do when he or she is refused access to his or 
her file? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the federal act, the person may file a complaint with the 
privacy commissioner, who then conducts an investigation. Fine. 
We hope he will have the proper means to do so. The commissioner 
may attempt to resolve the complaint through mediation. Fine. If 
a solution can be found, great. But what happens if no solution 
is found? This is what people want to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is that the person must go to court. The 
commissioner can take it upon himself to go to court, but this 
is not automatic. The person, even assuming he or she has the 
means to do so, cannot do it. He or she cannot directly take his 
or her complaint to a court at the beginning, because he or she 
must wait for the commissioner's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is question of means involved. There is a delay, 
because the person must wait for the commissioner's report. 
First of all, there is a degree of confusion in the drafting of 
the legislation, a lack of clarity that surprised even the 
experts from what they told me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that, instead of the legislation the minister 
promised, one that would be user friendly—he described it as 
simple yet effective—where users may not always be commercial 
services consumers but are citizens, the legislation before us 
is not simple to use and, on the face of it, certainly not 
effective, except when good will is involved and mediation may 
suffice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree it will work that way some of the time, but legislation 
is required when the government has to say where it stands, on 
whose side it is, the unco-operative business or the citizen; the 
government does not side with citizens unless the commissioner 
himself decides to go to court. 
Do members have any idea what this means? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will disappoint a great many people. I for one might 
say I understand the minister may be feeling stuck between the 
United States on the one side and the European Union on the 
other, but his primary duty as minister is to reassure the 
people of Canada and Quebec that the current level of protection 
will be maintained.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the role of Canada to undermine the protection they 
are currently afforded. It is not to reduce the level of 
protection but to increase it because, as a country, together 
with other countries—and I have never found it so sad that 
Quebec was not one—it could push to have all countries adopt 
compatible rules, to reassure the public. But the public will 
not be fooled and no one will believe that a meaningless piece 
of legislation will provide consumers across Canada and Quebec 
with greater protection against American companies. There is a 
real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An OECD conference was held in Ottawa on the initiative of the 
Minister of Industry, and I congratulate him on this. 
One thing came out very clearly at this conference, however. 
Right now, 80% of e-commerce is U.S based, 80% of it in business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the defence of consumers and the public, 
governments should sit up and take note.  Many have said so.  I 
was pleased to hear that the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business does not want it forgotten that consumers are not just 
individuals, members of the public, but also small and medium 
sized businesses, which do not have the wherewithal of big 
business, and which are also in a David and Goliath situation, 
much worse in fact, as things now stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is extremely disappointing.  It fails to give citizens 
the protection they are looking for. 
The Internet is not just a place were business is transacted, 
and cannot be divorced from civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telemarketing was debated in this House.  We saw that the 
government wanted to clamp down on businesses engaging in 
deceptive telemarketing, by requiring them to state very clearly 
over the telephone who they were and the purpose of their call. 
We wanted to amend this to apply to the Internet as well, and 
now we are looking at a bill on e-commerce.  This provision 
remains completely vague in the bill.  But members of the public 
wishing to use this medium—which is just a medium, and not 
another way of life, as the OECD recognized—will increase their 
use of it only if they are truly protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first step is protection that is not just partial, not just 
aimed at e-commerce, but real protection of privacy.  Then we can 
consider it further, but first there will have to be 
international agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we are waiting for Canada, the country we are depending on, 
to show some leadership, but not without first reassuring the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successive Liberal governments have repeatedly promised real 
legislation, legislation that would protect privacy.  In 1982, 
the then communications minister, Francis Fox, said that the 
next step with respect to privacy legislation would be to extend 
the principles governing the protection of privacy to the 
federally regulated private sector.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1987, the Standing Committee on Justice and the 
Solicitor General endorsed this recommendation in its report 
entitled “Open and Shut: Enhancing the Right to Know and the 
Right to Privacy; a Review of the Access to Information Act and 
the Privacy Act”. Quebec embarked on a similar process which 
resulted in 1994 in the passing of its current legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his 1996-97 annual report, the privacy commissionner saluted 
as a fundamental and highly significant event the undertaking by 
then justice minister Allan Rock to enact before the year 2000 a 
bill protecting privacy in the private sector in a real and 
effective fashion. What happened next? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the industry minister himself promised an umbrella bill 
on the protection of privacy in response to the Information 
Highway Advisory Council's report. I stress that the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques moved a motion 
which was unanimously approved providing that all crown 
corporations be subject to the Privacy Act, but not all of them 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1997, the Standing Committee on Human Rights adopted a 
report entitled “Privacy: Where Do We Draw the Line?” recommending 
that the current act be replaced by one applying only to 
parliament and to all government agencies as well as to private 
sector entities under federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the minister is tabling a bill to promote electronic 
commerce by protecting personal information. I will not read the 
full title again. This is sad and woefully inadequate. This bill 
will not meet the desired goals and will actually weaken the 
current rights of Quebeckers while recognizing the efforts by 
the private industry in its own code, which contains many 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to demand that the federal government give proper 
protection, not one that is so limited, so minimal, and in many 
cases inexistent, because of the nature of the procedure, of the 
conditions and of the confusion and also because of the power of 
the governor in council, who can even change the content of the 
legislation to adjust to the changing standards of private 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot let this bill go unnoticed. We cannot be content with 
saying that we would like to see many more provisions included 
in this bill. This was to be such an important piece of 
legislation, but, should it pass without amendments, it will 
create more problems than it will solve in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois and all governments in Quebec, of whatever 
political stripe, have always very strongly supported the 
principle of respect for privacy and personal information. The 
Parti Quebecois and the Liberal Party did so again, recently, in 
a review of the legislation. 
We are deeply committed to this principle, and that is why we 
cannot agree with this bill to promote electronic commerce, 
because it does not meet its stated goals, and does not protect 
the needs of citizens and consumers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am happy to rise today to join in the 
debate of Bill C-54, the personal information protection and 
electronic documents act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's debate may be the beginning of perhaps one of the most 
important debates in the House for many months as we begin the 
discussion of virtually a new form of commerce, a form that is 
already beginning but a form of commerce with dimensions that are 
somewhat awesome, the whole issue of electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to what could be exploding as a new way of doing 
business.  At the recent OECD conference in Ottawa it was 
suggested that electronic commerce transactions totalled about $4 
billion in 1997.  Within another three years from now that could 
accelerate to nearly $400 billion.  In Canada it could reach as 
high as $13 billion within that short period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a totally new way of doing business, a 
complete transformation of commerce not only within Canada but 
all the other nations with which we do business.  On a business 
level there are tremendous implications and on a personal level 
tremendous implications, and of course that is what the debate is 
all about.  We are going to hear the term e-commerce, electronic 
commerce, a great deal in the next few weeks and months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the House has heard much discussion of the transfer of 
vitally important information.  Rather than discussing the 
dangerous transfer of cabinet secrets in public places such as 
airplanes or gymnasiums, today we are gathered to discuss a 
transfer of a different type of information, the electronic 
variety.  The bill before us aims to support and promote 
electronic commerce by increasing Canadians' confidence in online 
transactions, providing protection for personal information that 
is collected, adjusting the legal framework of the electronic 
environment and providing an alternative means for the federal 
government of providing valuable government services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that Bill C-54 is part of a much larger 
overall strategy to make Canada an international leader in the 
growing realm of electronic commerce.  The debate today is timely 
because if there is one role that Canada can play it is to widen 
the debate on future electronic commerce within our borders and 
beyond.  At this point it would appear that Canada is playing a 
leadership role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about some of the contents of the bill and 
outline some of the reservations my colleagues in the New 
Democratic Party and I have with the bill.  I begin by discussing 
the phenomenon of electronic commerce in the information age.  A 
variety of commentators from all sorts of disciplines have 
commented on the increasingly important role electronic commerce 
is playing in the lives of everyday citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the chairman and CEO of Bell Canada, Mr. Jean Monty, 
told delegates at the Ottawa OECD conference: “What we are 
witnessing today is the birth of a new economy, a new economic 
order that is based on networks and chips”.  This electronic 
transfer of information has changed the way humans interact with 
each other and for this reason it is the subject of great 
importance and we would be wise to consider very carefully any 
decisions we take.  That is why I say the bill is really the 
first piece of direct legislation that says something about this 
whole new issue of electronic commerce.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it may be helpful to discuss the very definition of 
electronic commerce itself.  If we are to adapt a broad 
understanding of the concept of e-commerce we will see that it 
includes two very different types of transactions.  One type, 
which has proven quite successful in this country, involves the 
exchange of information through closed networks.  This would 
include such systems as those used for debit cards and credit 
cards.  As I say, Canada is recognized as a world leader in 
developing the infrastructure for these kinds of closed networks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other types of transfers are those conducted through open 
networks such as the Internet.  This type lags far behind its 
closed network counterpart for numerous reasons which I will 
examine in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it would be useful to outline very briefly what 
e-commerce is and how it works. In the friction free ideal of 
electronic commerce, a typical catalogue order for example would 
happen like this.  A consumer would fill in an order form on a 
computer and file it through the Internet directly to their 
retailer's computer system.  The system would immediately process 
the information to create a shipping weigh bill, a packing list 
and would be electronically charged to one's credit card.  A 
likely low paid warehouse employee might then prepare the 
shipment and deliver it to the loading dock, but other than that 
the human element is removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, a job that perhaps would involve four, five or 
six people would now be handled by a single person and likely one 
who would be relatively low paid, removing any need for data 
processors, bookkeepers, shipping clerks and others.  These types 
of jobs would become automatically redundant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one starts to think about the online world a certain 
minister comes to mind.  Just as the solicitor general has had 
some difficulty lately maintaining the security of his 
department's private information, so does the Internet in 
ensuring the confidentiality of important matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have demonstrated a lack of faith in the minister as a 
result.  This is similar to the reservations Canadians also have 
about entrusting their own personal information in cyberspace. It 
is our job as legislators to address these concerns adequately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet remains mainly an intimidating world for most 
Canadians in which trade relations are purely developed and 
people cannot be certain of the ways in which confidential 
information is being handled.  Business as well as consumers are 
often unsure exactly with whom they are dealing, whether payment 
measures are secure and just what the legal frameworks are for 
these types of transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet for most Canadians remains as a sort of computer 
wild west where law and order at the moment is relatively poorly 
represented and in some cases not represented at all and one 
enters at one's own risk.  Many parents are reluctant to 
establish these Internet accesses because of well founded fears 
that the online environment has become a haven for those who 
traffic in such horrible issues as child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business as well as consumers have been clamouring to build 
confidence in terms of building measures with this electronic 
commerce for some time.  I think it is fair to say that Canadians 
do not want cyberspace to be lawless.  Proof of this can be found 
in the recent controversy surrounding Mr. Zundel's events in 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One part of the bill which attempts to tackle people's 
reservations about trade on the information highway is the 
section on privacy rights.  The bill adopts a set of guidelines 
developed by the Canadian Standards Association for using, 
gathering and disclosing the personal information of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time the federal Privacy Act deals strictly with 
information that is collected by the public service.  Bill C-54 
goes further than this.  After a period of three years the 
guidelines for the handling of personal information will apply to 
all commercial transactions.  For example, the bill would force 
companies to obtain the consent of individual Canadians in order 
to collect personal information.  It would force them to only use 
this information for the purpose for which it was collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill people would be granted access to the information 
held about them and would also have the right to make changes to 
it when there are inaccuracies in the information regarding their 
personal financial holdings and other relevant personal 
information.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 significantly strengthens the office of the privacy 
commissioner and allows Canadians a means of recourse against 
those who abuse confidential personal data.  New Democrats 
support these provisions in principle and feel they are long 
overdue.  With the rapid manner in which information can be 
transferred in today's world it would be reassuring to know that 
individuals do have some control on this information as it 
relates to them personally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order that Canadians can feel confident enough to engage in 
electronic commerce, common guidelines for the handling of 
personal information are totally essential.  They would benefit 
business as well as the piece of mind of the consuming public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other prominent feature of this legislation that attempts to 
remove the fears of Canadians is the discussion of security 
features such as secure electronic signature which would now be 
recognized by law.  More noticeable, however, is the absence of 
any discussion on encryption technology.  I know my hon. friend 
across the way is very interested in encryption technology, as we 
all are, in terms of what we this can do for the whole privacy 
issue.  At first glance this appears to be an adequate solution 
to addressing security concerns.  However, the way the government 
is going about this raises some very serious concerns about our 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cryptography technology allows users to encode information then 
pass it along the Internet; in other words, use various codes to 
codify information being passed along so that others, without 
knowing that code, would have a difficult or impossible time 
deciphering what it is all about.  This can be used to encode all 
sorts of information such as credit card numbers, medical records 
and private correspondence.  In itself it is a good thing. 
Unfortunately this legislation has adopted a completely hands off 
approach in the area licensing encryption software.  This 
government has indicated no concern about licensing this type of 
software.  It has not demanded any sort of access mechanism that 
would allow it to intercept and decode these kinds of messages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fear that the government has forfeited any means whatsoever of 
policing the Internet when it comes to these critical matters. 
For example, the privacy commissioner would have little power to 
actually see whether personal information is being mishandled and 
transferred illegally.  The privacy provisions of the bill seem 
to be weakened by the rather hands off approach to cryptology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, law enforcement agencies might see their ability to thwart 
child pornography traffickers severely curtailed as a result of 
this omission.  Similarly, without any source of access 
mechanism, cryptology technology will possibly play into the 
hands of organized crime and the perpetuators of corporate 
sabotage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that government will allow any type of cryptology 
technology will serve only to increase the security fears of 
Canadians using this system.  The thought that the RCMP and other 
police forces will be basically powerless to investigate Internet 
abuses is obviously something of great concern.  This is really a 
violation of the peace and good government principle on which 
this nation was formed.  It will do little to make Canadians feel 
more secure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the Internet presents a very difficult medium to 
regulate. However, Canadian law enforcement agencies must be 
permitted to fulfill their basic obligations to protect the 
public.  Barbara Roche, Britain's parliamentary undersecretary of 
state for small firms, trade and industry, stated recently that 
governments must not loose sight that electronic commerce is at 
heart a human issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that people risk being hurt if any encryption is 
not regulated.  In this area the government has shirked its 
responsibilities to protect our citizens of all ages by taking 
this hands off approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries have expressed serious opposition to 
unrestricted cryptology, including the United States, France, 
Russia, Australia and New Zealand.  Clearly there exists some 
international consensus as to the dangers of allowing any sort of 
cryptology products to be used.  I wonder why the government has 
chosen to ignore this concern.  An opportunity to co-operate with 
other nations on this security issue seems to have been missed as 
a result of this omission.  I hope the government will see fit 
when this legislation moves through the House to change that and 
enable Canada to join with these other nations to control the 
misuse of cryptology products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 attempts also to establish the federal government as a 
responsible and model user of the Internet as a tool for 
delivering services.  With this in mind, many federal statutes 
have been examined to see whether the references to means of 
collecting information were limited only to paper.  The result 
that nearly half seem to indicate that paper transactions are the 
only legal means of sharing information is worth noting.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 attempts to adjust or apply current laws so that there 
is an electronic alternative for transmitting appropriate 
information. In principle, when asked to only say that this is a 
good proposition, it would offer Canadians access to a new and 
faster means of communicating with their government bodies 
regarding important services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that by acting as a role model it can 
stimulate a substantial increase in the use of technology in all 
realms.  A quick glance at the current electronic commerce 
situation reveals that Canadians are far from embracing the 
Internet.  In many cases this is because they simply cannot 
afford to.  Even if we assume that about 30% of Canadians have 
some sort of access to the Internet, which may be just the fact 
that they have connected computers at their schools, we must 
acknowledge that the other three-quarters of the country are 
presently in the dark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted some statistics the other day, which are not much more 
than serious estimations.  Approximately 13% of Canadians had 
home Internet access in 1997 and I suspect that number probably 
has not changed much.  We are talking about a relatively small 
number of Canadians.   We recognize Canadians are world leaders 
in access to the Internet so we can see this is just the 
beginning for this technology.  This affords Bill C-54 an 
excellent opportunity to do the job correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians in rural areas have begun to voice concerns. They 
foresee exorbitant increases in the cost of local phone services 
in their areas in the near future.  We have all been hearing from 
rural Canadians. With the competition between existing phone 
companies they are concerned with what we have known for many 
years as cross-subsidization. Charges levied on long distance 
charges and related charges provide phone companies the ability 
to keep rates relatively low in rural areas.  That is now coming 
under some question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will people living in rural Canada have reasonable phone rates 
and therefore reasonable access to services such as the Internet? 
How can a farmer in rural Saskatchewan be expected to invest in 
a second line for Internet purposes if these service charges are 
not kept affordable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the government has put the cart before the horse 
on this issue.  In order for electronic commerce to work, New 
Democrats believe all Canadians must be given an opportunity to 
get on board this new technology.  Otherwise we risk creating a 
future society of information haves and information have nots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns that was raised in the commentary at the 
recent OECD conference in Ottawa was the development of a select 
technological elite not only in the world of commerce but in the 
world in general.  There would be people with access to the 
Internet with a sophisticated knowledge of computer use and there 
would be a vast majority of people who would be marginalized and 
would have neither access nor that type of knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small and medium size businesses have complained that the costs 
of participating in electronic commerce are simply prohibitive. 
Ideally, electronic commerce would provide an excellent means for 
small businesses to expand their market reach but unfortunately 
many cannot afford the fees charged by banks for setting up 
secure on-line ordering services.  The costs are keeping 
electronic commerce in the big leagues. Small businesses will be 
put at a competitive disadvantage unless this issue is 
considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada has addressed this issue with the community 
storefront program which helps many small businesses become 
on-line merchants.  However we believe that a significant 
expansion of this program will be absolutely crucial in order to 
ensure the equitable growth of electronic commerce for the big 
players as well as the small players.  The present program is 
good but certainly is not good enough at its present stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another important issue surrounding electronic 
commerce.  Very drastic economic changes will take place should 
this type of on-line trade take off the way governments and others 
predict.  It is impossible to deny that when electronic commerce 
becomes a more popular means of conducting business, thousands of 
Canadians will risk losing their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jeremy Rifkin, the American expert on the future of work, 
concluded in his recent book that adverse effects of electronic 
technology will have major impacts on Canadian society and other 
societies around the world.  There is a danger that electronic 
commerce will eliminate whole types of workers. 
Those at risk are a diverse group, everyone from stockbrokers to 
call centre operators to shipping clerks in warehouses.  A 
society in which there is a large pool of unskilled labourers 
with no work and a small compact group of informational elite is 
not a desirable outcome.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my time is quickly wrapping up.  We have a number of other 
concerns which I do not have the time to elaborate on but my 
other colleagues will.  It is clear at this point that we oppose 
the legislation in its present form as being somewhat short on 
the details required. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a short question to ask the hon. member from the 
NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made a statement that everyone must have access to 
the Internet but the member did not indicate who was going to pay 
for it and how the program was going to be paid for.  We all like 
to have services but we have to come up with a way to pay for 
them and who is going to pay for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to hear that 
my colleague was paying attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly the point I was making. As we develop this 
technology option in terms of electronic commerce, it is 
imperative upon us as legislators that all Canadians have access 
to this crucial service of the future.  At the moment the way the 
legislation is in this bill, this is not taking place. Small 
businesses tell us that they are unable to take full advantage of 
the service because of the cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier we do not have to look far to find out how we 
can go about it.  I refer to the community storefronts program 
which was introduced to assist small businesses in particular but 
also medium size businesses in accessing this type of technology 
for market development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to ensure that this program is expanded in all 
regions of the country.  There was an announcement just the other 
day by Bell Telephone indicating its intention particularly in 
the province of Ontario to provide this type of technology option 
for the small and medium size business sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our job is to ensure that these opportunities, as we move into 
this new form of doing business, are available to all Canadians, 
consumers and businesses alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B> Madam Speaker, I did not receive 
the answers to my questions of who is going to pay for it, how we 
are going to pay for it and how much it is going to cost to make 
Internet available to everyone in Canada.  I ask the member for a 
short answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate my hon. 
friend has asked for a short answer.  There are some things in 
life that simply cannot be answered in a snappy, quick way and 
this is one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend makes an important point.  This is something we cannot 
rush and that is what we are saying.  I think all the speakers I 
have heard so far, including those from the government side, have 
indicated a concern that we take this step by step to ensure it 
is developed properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that some countries are dealing with this in a 
creative way.  For example as of September one country took the 
unprecedented decision to provide every child in the country with 
a laptop computer as part of the infrastructure for their 
education.  It is a relatively small and a relatively wealthy 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that if we are going to address this whole issue of 
including all Canadians in the information culture of the 21st 
century, we have to take some bold steps as a country and as a 
parliament.  We have to acknowledge the fact that there is an 
elite in our country that has access to the Internet and the 
sophisticated computers that are required, but also a vast 
majority currently are not hooked into the Internet and do not 
have computer technology expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a challenge as legislators as we move into the 
e-commerce of the 21st century. All Canadians should have the 
opportunity to participate. In other words there should be equal 
opportunity to participate in e-commerce.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, today we 
begin the process of crafting legislation to catch up with 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada is truly to become a cyberspace world leader and carry 
the title of most connected nation, government must conduct 
itself accordingly. Indeed if a balance is struck between the 
privacy of Internet users and the legitimate marketing efforts of 
Canadian businesses, we could face a situation where Canada is 
the world leader in e-commerce importing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trust is at the very centre of this entire exercise.  Internet 
users need to trust the security safeguards put in place by 
on-line marketers.  Canadian industry needs to trust that 
legislation will permit them to responsibly do business on-line. 
The Canadian taxpayers need to trust that they are getting value 
for their money from their elected officials and that out of 
their work will come a comprehensive state of the art electronic 
commerce policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should come as a surprise to nobody that Canada is poised to 
be one of the world leaders in e-commerce.  Unlike almost every 
other nation in the world, our massive geography has dictated 
that we seek innovative solutions to draw our population closer. 
This should not be lost on my colleagues in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 is the first step in developing an e-commerce 
structure.  In many ways it is the 21st century equivalent of the 
first spike. The Internet continues to grow exponentially with 
implications for every Canadian business, government department 
and indeed every Canadian resident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be a privilege for me to work with my colleagues on the 
industry committee in a diligent and non-partisan effort to 
achieve responsive legislation.  However, this issue goes well 
beyond the boundaries of the industry department.  Just as the 
Y2K bug impacts every facet of government and what we try to 
accomplish in this House, so does the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>E-commerce will have far more implications than just privacy 
issues.  This government needs to come up with a comprehensive 
plan which addresses the issues of uniformity in the digital 
marketplace, on-line eavesdropping by security forces, public 
private on-line relationships, competition, the role of small and 
medium size enterprises, Canadian heritage and culture, and the 
list goes on and on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One Canadian executive made an interesting observation on this 
issue and I think it bears repeating in this House.  He said that 
a fax machine is only valuable when the rest of the world has a 
fax.  Value explodes exponentially with membership. Extending his 
advice to its logical conclusion would see government treat this 
very carefully so as not to allow the fledgling Internet commerce 
industry to falter.  Possibly this is legitimate advice but there 
are other ramifications to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are industries that are immune to Internet competition. 
When a family in Markham decides they want to have a Saturday 
night barbecue, it is unlikely they will turn to the Internet to 
supply their hamburgers.  It is probably reasonable to assume 
that given the choice, most people would rather step into the 
warmth and smell of a bakery to buy their rolls than to order 
on-line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many consumer choices remain which can be reviewed and ordered 
in a visually pleasing format on a computer screen. Perhaps the 
message here is that the butcher and the baker are safe but the 
candlestick maker should beware. There is no doubt that my 
analogy is simplistic but it does lead me to the discussion of 
the pending showdown between downtown and cybertown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incentives are a very intricate balance in the marketplace. Some 
are intrinsic such as the desire to be self-employed. Others can 
be nurtured through regulations such as those that favour the use 
of tax implications. The important issue to note is that there 
are artificial incentives created by legislation. It is almost 
certain that an equal and opposite disincentive is created as 
well.  The job of legislators should be to determine what is a 
disincentive and debate it rationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the federal revenue minister announced that the 
government is not interested in creating new taxes for 
e-commerce. I wish to commend him for that position. Canadians 
have spoken loudly and clearly that they do not have the stomach 
for any new taxes. 
Instead we should be looking for ways to cut taxes.  The question 
we must ask ourselves is how we apply existing tax legislation in 
a fair, predictable, revenue neutral fashion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time a situation exists whereby online retailers, 
set up in Prince Edward Island as an example, ship to other 
provinces like Ontario.  They are not required to collect sales 
taxes. Instead consumers are responsible to remit their own sales 
taxes to the provinces in which they reside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may come as a shock to the revenue minister so I ask him to 
brace himself, but by and large these taxes are not being 
remitted.  It is not an insurmountable problem.  Time and time 
again Canadian industry has shown its willingness to comply with 
the necessary regulations which allow government to collect the 
revenue needed to provide the services Canadians demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At issue is the interim situation.  There appears to exist a 
marketplace where those who open storefronts, employ sales clerks 
and pay commercial property tax will also have to endure a 
competitive disadvantage.  They are required to collect sales 
taxes that their online competitors need not collect.  I suggest 
that this situation be addressed sooner rather than later.  There 
should not exist a timetable for when tax regulations will be 
fair.  Fairness must remain an inherent fundamental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have dealt with a purely domestic Internet tax issue, so now I 
turn my attention to taxation and the international marketplace. 
At the recent OECD e-commerce ministerial conference held in 
Ottawa much of the focus was on the principles of e-commerce 
taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was fundamental agreement in five areas.  They included 
the following.  The first was neutrality.  This would see that 
taxation would seek to be equitable and fair as it pertained to 
both e-commerce and traditional forms of commerce.  The next was 
efficiency.  This would target compliance to ensure that it would 
meet the dual objectives of limiting costs in administration. 
Next came certainty and simplicity.  This would ensure that 
taxation levels and collection procedures were transparent and 
predictable.  Then came effectiveness and fairness.  This would 
limit the potential avoidance and evasion and guarantee that the 
right amounts of tax were collected at the right time.  Finally 
there was flexibility.  This provision was included to assist 
legislators in the attempt to keep pace with emerging technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fair minded, far reaching in their scope, even highbrow, all 
these terms could be used to describe these principles.  The 
dilemma is that taken together the principles seek to equalize a 
world of incongruent tax regimes.  Perhaps they could be 
implemented in a single nation state or even negotiated for a 
long term phase-in within the realm of a free trade agreement. 
However this is not the world we live in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly there is no international formula for taxation 
that could possibly balance the playing field.  If we were trying 
to negotiate such a treaty we would be beginning a long arduous 
process which would entail all the same pitfalls as currently are 
being encountered with the MAI.  How do we respond to this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House is charged with the duty of protecting and fostering 
Canadian interests.  As far as I can see we have to choose to be 
a player in a liberalized trading world or we can follow the path 
of protectionist policies, a trail that most assuredly leads to a 
dead end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party, as the author of the 
greatest, most successful free trade agreement in the nation's 
history, is not about to turn its back on free trade.  However we 
must be realistic about the competition that exists out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cold reality is that Internet commerce cannot help but be 
brutally efficient.  Price comparisons will be performed in a 
matter of seconds, eliminating what used to be an entire Saturday 
of window shopping.  Price as a determinate will become the 
overriding decision maker on the Internet.  When we understand 
this and couple it with our knowledge of our completely 
uncompetitive situation, when we compare our tax system to our 
neighbour's to the south, the situation is a serious one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the success story of the Ontario provincial government has 
not provided the Minister of Finance with enough evidence that 
tax cuts create growth, perhaps the uneven environment may spur 
him on. 
By and large regulation of the Internet has been a failure in 
every jurisdiction that has tried to overstep the boundaries of 
common sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 23, the CRTC will begin hearings into what kinds of 
regulations, if any, are needed for new media and the Internet. 
The commission has been vilified for this and has been accused of 
empire building.  The Progressive Conservative Party believes 
that this is exactly the kind of exercise we must engage in. 
Certainly that is not to say we will support any move to censor 
the Internet.  In fact quite the opposite is the case.  The 
private sector must determine what the future holds for the 
Internet.  However the public sector has a role to play in 
facilitating the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the realities we must accept is that the Internet is 
expanding at a rate which far exceeds our ability to respond with 
legislation.  The biggest impediment to any regulation is the 
fact that rules can only be imposed through national laws.  Yet 
the medium itself is global in scope.  Therefore government will 
have to rely on the private sector to produce new technology 
which individuals can use to access or eliminate specific 
Internet content as they see fit.  Government's role will be 
greatly curtailed in the exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expansion of this technology that was originally devised as 
a research tool for academics has surpassed all of us.  Recently 
an IBM executive referred to the phenomenon as a digital 
revolution and labelled its impact as being no lesser in scope 
than that of the industrial revolution.  Like the industrial 
revolution the Internet and e-commerce have the ability to change 
the way business is done, the way governments are organized, and 
the way economies are structured.  The major difference though is 
that this revolution is happening 10 times faster than the 
industrial revolution.  Beyond that the Internet is doubling in 
size at a rate measured in months rather than in years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that the CRTC will generate many worthy submissions 
and be provided with volumes of advice.  However it seems clear 
that any attempts to control levels of Canadian content on the 
net would result in abject failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead it is time for government and the Canadian industry to 
work together in this pioneering venture.  As model users of how 
the Internet can be adapted to the needs of Canadians we will 
have the greatest impact.  Uniformity of policy from nation to 
nation will become a much touted idea.  By responding early we 
have the greatest opportunity to leave a lasting Canadian imprint 
on this emerging technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge before us is no less than monumental.  Perhaps the 
most daunting realization we have to come to as legislators is 
the elimination of our influence.  Instead of imposing our will 
we will have to become more proactive in our spheres of 
influence.  The days of paying lip service to providing 
incentives must come to an end.  There is no way to legislate 
others to invest in Canada.  Thus we must back up our knowledge 
based economy with incentives and access to capital, something 
which the industry minister failed to do when he recently tabled 
the revamped Small Business Loans Act in the form of Bill C-53. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Liberal newsletter, otherwise known as the 
<I>Toronto Star</I>, offered up some free advice on how these 
incentives might be implemented.  The suggestion was that the 
Income Tax Act be amended to provide incentives for Canadian 
businesses to advertise on Canadian Internet services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether this suggestion has merit or not is a point for debate. 
However the overriding principle that we need to grasp and 
incorporate is the need to pursue e-commerce legislation with an 
eye to the carrot and not the stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OECD estimates that by the year 2003 e-commerce transactions 
will reach $1 trillion, a number so large in scope it represents 
54% of the U.S. direct marketing sales industry.  Governments and 
business need to develop solutions which will make this bulging 
phenomenon available to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Computer costs have come down dramatically in recent years. 
However personal computers are still out of the reach of many 
households.  If this gap is not addressed now, it will only 
result in a larger chasm in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest reasons for the rapid growth of the Internet 
is its ability to allow expression which goes right to the heart 
of what it is to be alive, to be human.  Knowing this we cannot 
accept that some might be disenfranchised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a subject which should fill us with fear. 
Predictably many in the union movement have reverted to their 
Luddite ways and decried the potential loss of jobs.  There is no 
basis for such fears. Instead the reality is that many new high 
salary positions have been created and in fact remain unfilled as 
demand continues to outstrip supply.  These same positions are 
ones which traditionally have not leant themselves to trade union 
affiliation.  Perhaps those in the labour movement who engage in 
such fearmongering should examine their own motivations.  It 
seems that job losses are not their greatest worry but instead it 
is their own influence which worries them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other issues that need to be addressed include law enforcement 
for serious egregious offences which are committed over the 
Internet.  Bill C-54 begins to deal with this issue in its 
amendments to the Canadian Evidence Act.  The proposed amendments 
would create an admissible provision which defines electronic 
signatures.  This will make it difficult for online fraudsters to 
lurk behind some perceived anonymity.  It is also my hope that 
this provision will assist in the identification of hate 
promoters that will continue to permeate the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue will continue to be revisited as long as this virus 
continues to exist in Canada.  Whether it is on line or otherwise 
it strikes me as ironic that tools such as the Internet, which 
has so much power to unite the planet, continues to provide a 
haven for blatant distorters of truth. I call on all my 
colleagues in the House to work together so we can begin the 
process of eliminating this plague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Copyright infringements are a serious concern which cannot be 
successfully addressed by one nation.  Canada needs to show the 
same leadership on this issue as we have exhibited in the past 
when it comes to protecting creative capital.  A point that we 
all need to be reminded of, plain and simple, is that copyright 
violations are theft and there is a victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head of the digital crime unit, the Federation Against 
Software Theft, FAST, recently confirmed that Internet crime is 
growing.  The Internet is a primary tool used for software theft. 
It is also used increasingly for the distribution of counterfeit 
software and other intellectual properties such as music.  It is 
imperative that we give law enforcement officials all the tools 
they need in this battle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to some very large picture issues regarding 
e-commerce.  Now I would like to turn my attention to the 
specific provisions of Bill C-54.

supports actions by the federal government designed to help ease

Canada study grants, tax free RRSP withdrawals, RESPs, tax relief

the federal government is helping to bridge the gap to a good

next four years in three networks of centres of excellence, the 
Canadian Arthritis Network, the Geomatics for Informed Decisions 
Network and the Mathematics of Information Technology and 
Complex Systems Network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an investment will be of particular benefit to Laval 
University, which houses a sizeable number of researchers in 
these fields, but it will also have a significant impact on 
Canada as a whole, through the presence of our top researchers 
and their partners in the universities, government and the 
private sectors 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget that Laval and the Quebec City area have 
played a role of excellence in geomatics for 10 years, and 
provide support to the network through research infrastructure 
and a pool of top-notch human resources.

Defence.

cannot afford this type of wasteful management.  Yet the Prime

there that this type of wasteful management will not happen 
again?  To answer these questions to Canadians' satisfaction, I 
have written to the auditor general to request an internal audit 
of the Department of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return the wasted money to the minister this afternoon

</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government has at least six high priced lawyers 
defending it at the APEC inquiry, but the students who were 
pepper sprayed currently have none.  According to the solicitor 
general this is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister's idea of fair play giving one side of the 
APEC inquiry a team of high priced lawyers and the other side 
simply a blast of pepper spray? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is a commission that has been established under 
the law of this parliament.  It is a commission that looks into 
the interests of those who have a complaint.  It has been done 
many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lawyer working for the commission who is helping the 
witnesses and the complainants air their complaints.  The police 
and the government being challenged have a lawyer to defend them. 
But there is no complaint against the students.  They are the 
ones complaining and they can make their case.  If they have 
problems as witnesses, the lawyer in charge— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The Leader of the Opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every crook in this country can usually count on getting 
legal aid from this government.  Even murderers and rapists like 
Clifford Olson and Paul Bernardo received legal aid.  There is no 
law and there is no convention that stops the government from 
giving help to the students at the APEC inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that criminals can get legal aid from this government 
but legal protesters cannot? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are not accusing the students of anything.  It is the 
students who are complaining about the work of the police.  That 
is what is happening.  We are not, as the Leader of the 
Opposition is, comparing the students with criminals.  They are 
not criminals.  They are making complaints against the police. 
The commission is willing to help them if they have problems with 
their testimony before the commission. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is wandering around in circles. 
Surely it is self-evident that it is not fair play when we have 
an inquiry and one side has at least six high priced lawyers and 
all of the resources of the Government of Canada behind it and 
the other side has nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister stand up in this House and say that he 
thinks that is a fair deal? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, again I want to repeat that there is no complaint 
against the students.  They are not accused of anything.  They 
are the ones complaining against the activities of the police and 
against the activities of the government.  The students have made 
their complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a law of parliament that was passed to permit every 
complainant to be heard, but complainants in front of any corps 
of police in Canada do not ask for lawyers.  Complaints are made 
and the commission looks into the validity of the complaints on 
behalf of the people of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
spent the last two weeks at the APEC hearing in Vancouver and I 
can tell the Prime Minister that there is absolutely no sense of 
balance.  I saw the first student have his testimony completely 
twisted and warped by a process that only a veteran crown 
prosecutor can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How in the world can the Prime Minister say it is fair that he 
is siccing high priced lawyers on these students? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, commission counsel said “The commission can and will 
take extra measures to ensure that the protesters who cannot 
afford lawyers are dealt with fairly.  We are there to make sure 
they are treated fairly and that is what we will do”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no complaint against the students.  They are the ones 
complaining against the police.  Of course the police want to 
defend themselves because they are the ones being accused.  No 
one is accusing the students of anything. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister should spend one day at the inquiry to 
discover exactly how unbalanced this process is.  The difficulty 
is not only will the students not get a fair hearing, but the 
RCMP themselves will be seen as taking part in a tainted and 
slanted process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask again:  Will the Prime Minister fund the students as they 
should be funded?  Would he appear at the inquiry without proper 
legal counsel himself?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I just explained the process.  There is a law of 
parliament that was created to help any citizen in Canada who has 
a complaint against the police to complain without having to hire 
a lawyer.  That is why we established that commission.  When 
somebody complains about the activities of the police, it is 
normal for the police being accused to defend themselves, but 
there is absolutely no accusation against any student.

politically speaking, the Solicitor General is being kept on 
life support by the Prime Minister.  Unfortunately, that still 
does not prevent him from making bad decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Solicitor General not refusing to pay the legal fees of 
the students who filed a complaint in the “Peppergate” affair 
because he is afraid of losing control over the investigation

<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

capacity to do justice, to be fair to complainants and so on. 
That is exactly what it is doing in this case.

with a dozen lawyers paid for by the taxpayer.  On the other 
side, there are the students, who filed the complaint, who were 
roughed up, arrested and deprived of their rights and who cannot 
afford a single lawyer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

also, and this is serious, to control and manipulate its 
coverage by the media. That is why a complaint was filed with 
the ombudsman at the CBC and the journalist relocated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister realize that, by engaging in behaviour 
that is totally unacceptable from a government, he is bringing 
discredit upon all political institutions?

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“I am not troubled by this because the ombudsman is independent 
and will try to determine the facts.  This complaint procedure is 
far better than trying an end run to put pressure on a

the government has a $14 million shortfall in the RCMP budget, 
$8.5 million of which is in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP has been told to stop using its boats and planes.  It 
has been told to ban overtime and to cancel all training, among 
other things.  The results have been disastrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals squander hundreds of millions of dollars weekly 
that could have easily funded this, so it is a political decision 
and not a financial one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that Royal Canadian Mounted Police operations are 
considered a royal pain in the butt to the Liberal government?

of restraint.  How it exercises restraint is an operational

same reasons as were used by the Bloc Quebecois during the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade,

happy the Bloc Quebecois shares in that—that the ultimate end 
game of putting in place rules for investment in the way we have 
rules for trade is that they need to take place at the World 
Trade Organization.  We said very clearly to the OECD that this 
was just the beginning of the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should attempt to go as far as we possibly can and then we

is where the rules of trade are and that is where the family of

government's position.

criticizing the employment insurance reform to wait for the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, the minister can no longer hide behind the report because 
58% of unemployed Canadians are not eligible for benefits. 
Entire families are suffering today because of the Liberals'

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

contrary, we want to make the job market more accessible to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the study that was made public this morning showed very

to the labour force and who have not left their jobs without 
just cause are covered by the employment insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for those who are not covered, it is because they have not 
worked long enough, or maybe because they have never worked and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, payroll 
taxes are a barrier to jobs.  They raise the cost of labour and 
create a disincentive for firms to create jobs.  These are the 
past words of the finance minister who knew that due to the law 
of supply and demand high payroll taxes killed jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this the minister is now prepared to change the EI law 
to maintain artificially high payroll taxes.  Will the minister 
also be repealing the law of supply and demand or will the 
Canadian jobless have to wait?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I said that increasing payroll taxes would cost jobs. 
That is exactly what the previous Conservative government did, 
which is why when we took office instead of allowing them to go 
to $3.30 as the Conservatives wanted we froze them.  Then every 
year after we took office we brought those premiums down.

In October 1997 the Prime Minister expressed an interest in

is true that after the Prime Minister announced it last year 
Canada began official negotiations with the European Free Trade 
Association last Wednesday.  This is a group of four European 
countries that has two-way trade of almost $6 billion with 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After obtaining the thumbs up from consultations over the summer

Despite assurances from their superiors to the contrary, these

been advised by the commissioner of the RCMP that there is no 
risk to public safety.  We are talking about a period of 
restraint as many departments are going through.  I have every 
confidence in the RCMP's capacity to give Canada the same police 
protection they have for 125 years.

<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today on a question of privilege in regard to an issue 
which I thought was before you in a previous question of 
privilege raised by the member for Calgary—Nose Hill on February 
26, 1998. I contributed to that question of privilege and I have 
been awaiting a response.  I have been informed that you will not 
rule because the issue of the question of privilege of February 
26, 1998 was about the appointment of Mr. Landry to the Canadian 
Millennium Scholarship Foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the member for Calgary—Nose Hill did bring up the matter 
of the appointment of Mr. Landry, her second point during her 
presentation was, and I quote from <I>Hansard</I> of February 26, 
1998 “There is no legislation before the House setting up this 
foundation.  Nor has the budget announcement allocating $2.5 
billion in revenue to the foundation been allocated”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I was hoping that this second point would be enough 
for you to rule on, even though the first point was no longer an 
issue. 
However it appears that I need to bring up the second issue as a 
separate point which I am doing today.  I would also like to 
address new evidence regarding this issue, which I will be 
putting on record and which will be tabled today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the recent auditor general's report to parliament, he 
confirmed that the government accounted for the $2.5 billion 
Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation in the 1997-98 year even 
though there was no legislation establishing that scholarship nor 
any recipients of funds. Doug Fisher's article in the Ottawa 
<I>Sun</I> of October 18 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AG noted how the government, in defiance of normal accounting 
practices, charged the costs for harmonizing the GST and PST in 
the maritimes ($961 million), for the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation ($800 million), and for the Millennium Scholarship 
Foundation ($2.5 billion), to current years, when the actual 
spending would not take place until later.  (In doing so, the 
government showed contempt for parliament, which had not yet 
voted for all the initiatives for which moneys were being set 
aside.) 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general, the media and the public are all engaged in 
a discussion of this issue and are judging it as contempt.  I am 
getting a little more than frustrated as this discussion 
continues without this House resolving the question of contempt. 
We cannot make a further mockery of this place by having this 
debated and judged by the public and the media as contempt.  The 
place for that debate is in this House and nowhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the member for Calgary—Nose Hill recounted all the 
sins of the government in her presentation on February 26, 1998 
which I will only touch on very briefly here this afternoon 
because you have those facts before you. They are important 
because they establish a dangerous pattern that must be addressed 
by this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member argued that the government and its departments are 
making a habit of mocking the parliamentary system.  She pointed 
to a recent incident raised by the member for Prince 
George—Peace River regarding the Canadian Wheat Board.  That 
member pointed out that the Speaker was asked to rule on a 
similar complaint on March 9, 1990 regarding a pamphlet put out 
by the government concerning the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again on March 25, 1991 another complaint was launched on a 
similar issue.  The member for Fraser Valley made a progressively 
stronger case on October 28, 1997.  This led to the Speaker's 
ruling which contained a strong statement and a very strong 
warning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker of this House, you Mr. Speaker, said on November 6, 
1997 “the Chair acknowledges that this is a matter of potential 
importance since it touches the role of members as legislators, a 
role which should not be trivialized.  It is from this 
perspective that”—and it continues—“this dismissive view of 
the legislative process, repeated often enough, makes a mockery 
of our parliamentary conventions and practices”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also pointed out that an earlier warning of the 
Speaker had been ignored since the ruling of November 6, 1997 
additionally stated “I trust that today's decision at this early 
stage of the 36th parliament will not be forgotten by the 
minister and his officials and that the department and agencies 
will be guided by it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 26, 1998 the member for Calgary—Nose Hill asked you 
“How many times must we put up with this sort of mockery of our 
parliamentary system and disrespect for the Speaker before we 
take action?” Mr. Speaker, I am asking you again, how many times 
must we put up with this sort of mockery of our parliamentary 
system and disrespect for the Speaker before we take action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you said on November 6, the dismissive view of the 
legislative process repeated often enough makes a mockery of our 
parliamentary conventions and practices.  The government by its 
actions has demonstrated its contempt for parliament.  The 
auditor general has acknowledged these actions and the media has 
passed judgment on these actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time this House decided on the issue or it will arise time 
and time again I am sure.  Mr. Speaker if you rule this to be a 
prima facie question of privilege, I am prepared to move the 
appropriate motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, without speaking on this too 
long, the Chair will recognize what was said some months ago on 
this very issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT50"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT50"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1510

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be remembered that at the time the government had made 
an announcement in the media to obtain input and participation 
from Canadians in what was hoped to be then at the legislative 
level, the millennium scholarship fund as an organization. Of 
course, no one was asked to actually function until the 
legislation was put in place and therefore no infringement 
occurred.  I remember that the hon. member raised a similar 
question in regard to the Canada pension plan fund in that the 
government had prepared in advance for a structure to be created, 
which is only normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is the whole question being asked by the hon. 
member about whether or not it is appropriate for the government 
to set aside funds for future expenditures.  In business that 
principle is called encumbrance of funds.  In other words there 
must be an assurance that an expenditure is not undertaken until 
it is ascertained that it can actually be funded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the disbursements pursuant to that fund have not been 
made yet.  We have not arrived at the millennium scholarship fund 
period, but we have of course earmarked the funds to ensure that 
the moneys are available so that funding is not spent without our 
having the money.  It is a prudent way to manage. We have a 
history of prudent management in this government.  We have a 
history of doing things in the way that does not strangle the 
taxpayers or increase the burden upon the taxpayers.  We are 
prudent managers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought the hon. member should at least point out that the 
government is attempting to be wise in its handling of taxpayers' 
money and not to spend money it does not have. Were we to do the 
opposite, the member and others would be the first to remind us 
that we did not have money set aside for a planned future 
expenditure.  Of course, we are planning and putting moneys 
aside.  We are not spending first and then worrying later about 
how we will pay for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  First, let me set the stage.  There was a 
point brought up by the hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill in 
February.  A specific date was mentioned. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took the two points as being part of one.  That particular 
point, because of obvious reasons, because Mr. Landry has passed 
away, I consider to be a moot point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the hon. member brings forth what I will consider to be a 
separate question of privilege that he wants me to look at.  I have 
had advice from at least one member.  Perhaps there are 
others who will want to give me advice on this specific question of 
privilege.  I would be willing to entertain them for a little 
while.  After that I will make a decision as to how I am going to 
handle it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill on the specific question of 
privilege brought up by the House leader of the opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK156"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it was my intention and understanding that I raised that 
point as the most important element of the question of privilege 
I raised; that is, this government is moving ahead on the 
expectation that the House will make certain decisions which have 
in fact yet to be placed before the House.  The point I was 
making is that that is a violation of the rights and privileges 
of members of the House and also, and perhaps even more 
importantly, a violation of the democratic process which we are 
all here to uphold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard nothing in response to the issue I raised, which I 
have just laid out, which the opposition House leader has just 
laid out and which you have identified as well.  I think as 
Speaker you have let the House know how seriously you take this 
situation that government must not disrespect the process of this 
House and the democratic process in the way it operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, we look to you to make a ruling and to help 
government keep its decision making and its announcements in 
proper order in light of the process and the role of this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to add two points to the points 
made by the House leader for the official opposition.  First, it 
is important that we always maintain the supremacy of parliament 
in terms of initiatives taken by the government.  We have seen in 
the past when government enthusiasm has surpassed the 
parliamentary process from time to time and I think we have to 
acknowledge that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is to differentiate between the budget process 
and the points raised by my hon. friend, the House leader for the 
official opposition.  Often when budget initiatives are presented 
legislation and policy are announced, effective at that 
particular point, knowing full well that the appropriate 
legislation and bills will follow.  This is not a similar 
situation and I think we have to distinguish between these two 
types of announcements. 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank you for your advice. 
As I put it in place in the first section, that was a moot 
point.  I consider this to be a different point that the hon. 
House leader for the opposition has brought forth.  I take the 
information and I take the advice in the spirit in which it was 
given to help me to make a decision which is good for the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to take this under advisement.  I want to refresh my 
memory about everything that was said in this particular case and 
then I want to revisit this particular question of privilege and 
come back to the House.

<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Question No. 118 will be answered today. 
.[Text] 
<Question No. 118—<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to pressure-treated lumber: (<I>a</I>) what chemicals 
are approved for use in treating pressured lumber/wood; (<I>b</I>) 
what are the accepted levels for each of these chemicals used to 
treat this lumber; (<I>c</I>) what testing procedures has the federal 
government established to ensure companies use satisfactory 
levels; and (<I>d</I>) what has the government done to ensure there 
are ample health safeguards from these materials both before and 
after installation? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Chemicals 
considered to be pesticides are used in the pressure treatment of 
wood products, such as telephone poles, railway ties and consumer 
lumber products.  Scientific information is reviewed to determine 
whether risks for a wood treatment chemical are acceptable or 
unacceptable.  If risks are acceptable, the wood treatment 
product is registered, with an approved label, under the Pest 
Control Products Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Health Canada also has the authority to undertake 
the periodic reassessment of all registered products and to 
conduct an up to date safety assessment.  The result of this 
assessment is to decide if continued use is acceptable.  Wood 
treatment products used for pressure treatment are presently 
undergoing such a safety reassessment in a joint project with the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  This reassessment is 
targeted for completion in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) At present, there is a variety of chemicals used for wood 
preservatives or treatments which are registered and, therefore, 
approved for pressure treating lumber.  They include 
pentachlorophenol, creosote, copper chromated arsenicals, borax 
based products, and products based on the common household 
disinfectant active ingredients called quaternary ammoniums with 
copper.  These chemicals vary in how effective they are in 
protecting wood and are selected for use according to the 
intended use of the wood product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b)  Acceptable levels of use are determined as part of the 
assessment of risk and performance conducted by the Pest 
Management Regulatory Agency in Health Canada before a product is 
approved for use.  As part of the performance assessment process, 
Health Canada determines the lowest amount of chemical that can 
be used to effectively protect the wood.  The selection and 
verification  of the lowest needed amount helps to ensure that 
risk of exposure is, in turn, the lowest possible.  In 
considering the appropriate level of use, Health Canada also 
relies, in part, on Canadian Standard Association standard 080, 
which outlines the amount of chemicals used in order to maintain 
the structural integrity of certain wood products, for example, 
telephone poles.  The Pest Management Review Agency reviews 
product performance data against this standard  as part of the 
assessment process.  Specific values for use are contained on the 
product label and in the Canadian Standard Association standard 
080. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) 1. Provincial regulatory programs have the authority and 
regular opportunity to monitor activities related to wood 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. Environment Canada and Health Canada have worked 
co-operatively in the development of technical recommendation 
documetns, TRDs, that would foster a best practice approach to 
the use of wood treatment chemicals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>3.  Federal regulatory activities are largely based on 
complaints and incidents requiring investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d)  Before a wood treatment chemical can be used in Canada it 
must be registered, or approved for use, under the Pest Control 
Products Act.  In order for it to be registered, the chemicals 
undergoes a safety assessment that includes considerations of 
possible effects and exposure to the chemical.  These effects are 
considered for those involved in the treatment process as well as 
those using the treated wood.  Furthermore, health risks are 
considered for all new products as well as those that are 
currently being reassessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labels on registered products include information regarding 
personal protection, to be observed in the handling of treated 
wood at the time of treatment as well as the time of post 
treatment.  Additional labelling information includes 
prohibitions specific to the handling, use and disposal of 
treated wood.  For example, it is not permitted to burn treated 
wood due to the possibility of releases of toxic materials during 
burning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada is responsible for protecting the health of 
Canadians who use wood treatment chemicals and the resulting 
treated wood.  These chemicals undergo an extensive safety 
assessment process prior to being made available to the wood 
treatment industry.  As part of the safety assessment process, 
the safety of those involved in the treatment industry, as well 
as users, both industrial and consumer of treated wood products 
is considered.  Health Canada is currently engaged in a 
reassessment of these products with its U.S. colleagues which 
will address health safety considerations associated with these 
products.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS 
ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK202">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-54, an 
act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting 
personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in 
certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic 
means to communicate of record information or transactions and by 
amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act 
and the Statute Revision Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have spoken 
to some very key issues regarding e-commerce.  Now I turn my 
attention to the specific provisions of Bill C-54. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many ways this bill is a starting point.  As such we have 
only chance to get it right the first time.  Many of the bill's 
components as they deal with the compilation, storage and release 
of personal information are merely an attempt to give legislative 
teeth to what was previously a voluntary code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privacy is a sacred trust that we often take for granted in this 
country.  That is a good thing.  The seamless implementation of 
privacy regulations should really come about unnoticed by 
Canadians.  If this is the case then the confidence which exists 
before the legislation comes into effect has been preserved for 
the future.  I do not want to be misunderstood.  It is not my 
desire to hide any portion of the legislative process.  However, 
I am sure I echo the sentiments of many when I suggest that none 
of us wants a repeat of the negative option billing fiasco we 
witnessed in the cable industry not that long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representation has been made to many of us from stakeholders in 
this process.  As I said, we need to ensure that a balance is 
struck between the legitimate marketing efforts of business and 
the right of privacy that we all enjoy.  If there is an error to 
be made one way or another let it be resolved that we err on the 
side of personal privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other components of Bill C-54 are general housekeeping 
sections that will move us along the road to becoming a model 
user of the Internet as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to working with the other members of the industry 
committee as we begin reviewing this important first step in 
e-commerce. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Markham 
for his words on this bill.  I know that in his previous life he 
was very much involved in computers and in the computer industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move forward on this bill some people have said that it is 
not enough.  Some people have said it should do more as far as 
making rules and restrictions. Caution also has to come forward 
on Internet, rules and privacy. We do not want to stop innovation 
but we want to move in a certain direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned there will be a lot of debate in the 
industry committee and by all colleagues in this House to make 
sure the bill has a balanced program and moves forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appreciate if the member for Markham could say a few 
words on moving forward and looking at future innovation. This is 
a global and we have to proceed with caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an area that is changing rapidly because of advancements 
in technology. Technology almost on a monthly basis is becoming 
more powerful. It is also becoming a lot more functional in 
capabilities.  At the same time there is a tremendous reduction 
in costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I hear from the industry is that we have to 
watch that this is not just another tax grab as we move forward 
in regulating the Internet e-commerce area.  What the industry 
wants to see is business taxes as usual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we as a country think we are an island we are wrong.  We are 
going to see that this is probably one of the biggest paradigm 
shifts in this century.  If Canada does the right things and 
truly can be one of the leading countries on Internet, we are 
going to position ourselves well for the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to mention that I started to work in this

consultant for many years in Quebec, in Canada and 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, before being elected to this place, I was 
working on an MBA with a major in information technology.  I was 
also the president of the Association de sécurité informatique

Accordingly, I am very familiar with security of information 
issues and I am especially interested in a bill like the one we 
are now debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am especially interested in this debate since I had the 
privilege, in 1992, to present a brief, on behalf of the 
Association de sécurité en informatique du Québec, to the 
National Assembly, which was examining a bill to protect 
personal information in the private sector.  That bill has now 
been enacted. It was passed four years ago, but it goes much 
further than what the government is now proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government has only gone halfway and 
protected only in part personal information held by the private 
sector, i.e. information that is given in a commercial context. 
This is not the only type of information transmitted by 
computer. Thanks to the Internet, it is now much easier to 
provide information to recipients scattered around the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague from Markham to tell us whether he 
believes that this bill should be much broader in scope, that it 
should in fact go as far as what has been done in Quebec instead 
of stopping halfway, because it has to be closely scrutinized. 
What does my colleague from Markham think about the fact that, 
if Bill C-54 is adopted without amendment, Quebeckers will lose 
rights that they have gained through the legislative process 
over the last four years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be very difficult for Quebeckers to go back to the way 
things were four years ago before the Quebec government passed 
legislation in the leading-edge area of electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague from Markam agree to see to it that the 
industry committee amends the bill so it goes as far as the 
four-year-old Quebec legislation? I await his answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
from the Bloc for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He raises some good points but the bill specifically addresses 
e-commerce and how it relates to e-commerce.  Also, from an 
e-commerce and Internet standpoint it relates to the 
jurisdictions of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know the Quebec privacy bill put forward but I would 
hope that over time this legislation on privacy and the 
regulation of the Internet, et cetera, will be a seamless 
integration between the federal government and the provinces. 
That is what will make the Internet and e-commerce grow.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to take the floor to 
expand on the question asked by the member for Portneuf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, for four years now, Quebec has had specific legislation on 
the whole question of protecting personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I would like to ask to the member is about 
electronic commerce and protecting personal information. We 
think that this bill does not strike the necessary balance 
between these two topics. We are evolving in a new area of law, 
a new field that is expanding very fast. We must ensure that we 
develop good practices that will guarantee adequate protection 
of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister himself, in a press release, pointed out that there 
was such a law in Quebec and that there could be delegation. 
Unfortunately, there is no such guarantee in the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not think that it is important to have this 
spelled out clearly, for Quebec or any other province wishing to 
enact an appropriate law, especially when that legislation is 
similar to the one in Quebec? Also, does he not agree that it is 
necessary to have a way to amend the law—that without this 
amendment, among other things, this bill is not good enough to 
pass as it now stands? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member of 
the Bloc Party for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, I am not familiar with the privacy bill in 
the province of Quebec.  For electronic commerce to grow, for the 
Internet to grow and for people to have confidence in doing 
business on the Internet since all transactions will be seamless, 
over the long haul we have to make sure there is a seamless 
integration of laws in this area in both the federal jurisdiction 
and the provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps Bloc members would give me a copy of the Quebec privacy 
act.  I would like to take a look at it.  When we going through 
committee stage I am quite sure we will be open minded in this 
area. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to share my time with the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington.  I am pleased to debate Bill C-54, the 
personal information protection and electronic documents act. 
That is quite a mouthful for those of us in the House and for 
those listening today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paper transactions are time consuming, and in business and 
commerce time is money.  This also applies to individuals.  As 
people are able to use the Internet facilities more quickly, it 
will allow them more time to conduct other affairs in their 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is in the unique position of being at the forefront of 
the evolution of e-commerce.  It is much like the invention of 
the assembly line.  It is a new process with which we can compete 
and win because of our history in embracing communications 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that Canada is a vast country, the second 
largest country in the world.  We are also the ones who fostered 
and promoted the invention of the telephone.  Canada has the 
highest standing in post-secondary education enrolment in the 
world.  We are ranked number one in knowledge workers by <I>World 
Economic Forum</I>.  No longer is geographic size a liability. 
Indeed from B.C. to Newfoundland we are but microseconds away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the advantage of e-commerce?  What are we talking about? 
How does it relate to people in their communities today?  Here 
are some very interesting statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent OECD report noted that airline tickets had a cost of 
$12 when processed by conventional means via a travel agent. Over 
the Internet this cost is reduced to $1.50, which is an 87% 
savings.  Electronic banking reduces those costs by 89%.  Simply 
paying bills over the Internet reduces the cost by 70%.  Some may 
wonder why our banking fees are not even lower than they are 
today because of the significant savings the banking industry has 
been able to glean.  It might also tell us something about its 
profitability over the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This rapid change is not without its liabilities.  Travel agents 
will obviously have to adapt to this new economy.  Maybe even the 
banks.  Many people have suggested that some of the people 
providing bank services in the future may not be banks today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amazon.com is the third largest book retailer in the United 
States with sales of $5.5 billion.  It conducts business over the 
Internet where there is no waiting in line, no time consuming 
wait for that elusive book. 
This will have a tremendous impact on book retailers.  I noted in 
today's papers that Chapters, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> and others 
plan to do the same.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has currently a 5% share of transactions over the 
Internet.  When we say 5% it does not sound like very much, but 
we have to realize that in the context of our per capita 
population it is the second largest per capita concentration in 
the world, second only to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been quick to embrace the Internet.  As many 
members have also mentioned, we are not just talking about 
Internet.  We are also talking about intranets within corporate 
enterprises and other forms of electronic commerce such as bank 
cards.  However I am talking almost exclusively of the evolution 
on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a liability to using the Internet.  In a recent Nielsen 
survey of CommerceNet it would appear that 16% of those who use 
the Internet today are willing to use it for commercial 
transactions.  In other words, there is a large group of people 
using the Internet for their own personal benefit or to find out 
corporate information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed our government is big on promoting the Strategis site 
which helps small and medium size businesses make contacts with 
each other and find out about government services.  Less than 16% 
of these people will actually use the Internet to conduct 
commerce.  There is a general fear concerning privacy issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many of us have been asked for our Visa card number over the 
Internet and how many of us have refused?  There is a problem. 
People ask what will happen to their number when it us injected 
into the electronic system.  Who is taking it?  Who is using it? 
What other uses can they make of it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can all think of abuses.  Many people worry about their own 
privacy and information.  If Canadian businesses and consumers 
can take the lead in this area, it will clearly give our business 
community a competitive advantage in the world.  Let us think of 
what a great advantage it would be to our business community if 
people throughout the world could say they can trust Canadian 
businesses because they have a system of rules and rules 
enforcement that respect Internet transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people have stated that governments should keep their hands 
off the Internet.  There is a great feeling among Internet users 
that it should be a laissez-faire sort of evolution.  It is very 
much akin to at least the stories, if not the reality, of the 
opening up of the west.  We opened up the west before we actually 
brought in law and order.  Of course it was a rough and tumble 
place.  I believe that is exactly where the Internet is today. It 
is a rough and tumble place without enforceable laws. It is 
necessary to have a framework to which we can all relate and 
appreciate to utilize the vast power of the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one issue which goes outside the e-commerce point for a 
minute.  I know some other members have interjected their 
concerns about other forms of privacy over the Internet.  There 
is a major concern, more so in the United States than in Canada, 
about medical records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a form of Alzheimer's that can be predicted at a very 
early stage.  In other words at a very early stage it can be 
predicted that a person will actually get that type of 
Alzheimer's later in life.  There is a major concern that if 
insurance providers and employers could get access to that kind 
of information they may well make decisions based on it. 
Something as absurd as 18 year olds applying for a job and being 
predicted as getting a form of Alzheimer's when 70 years of age 
may result in them not being employed or not being insurable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must couple that with the fact that the province of British 
Columbia has computerized all the medical records.  Suddenly we 
start to see where the problems of using information technology 
can lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the bill does not specifically address that issue, but it 
does enforce and balkanize the use of the privacy commissioner to 
ensure, at least as it relates to e-commerce, that there is 
protection for the common consumer.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue requires a significant amount of leadership. 
Part of the bill ensures that the procurement mechanism of the 
federal government will be open to e-commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be addressing a business group in my riding tomorrow 
morning.  They have already asked me some questions but I am sure 
they will ask how small and medium size businesses can get in on 
the procurement mechanisms of government.  This is the very 
fundamental way they can do it.  They do not have to be big to 
get access to the procurement mechanisms of government.  Indeed 
most of the legislation deals with interprovincial trade. 
Hopefully the provinces and the territorial governments will all 
work together to ensure that this can be advanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We mentioned very quickly the encryption technology.  This is a 
very big concern for a lot of people in Canada.  There is an 
agreement to which Canada has been a signatory called the 
Wassenaar agreement.  Part of the process of the agreement was in 
recognition that encryption could also work the other way around. 
Some members have talked about the fact that we can use 
encryption technology to conduct criminal activity.  It was this 
agreement that put restrictions on the actual sale, export and 
purchasing of encryption technology.  It is clear that we will 
have to modify our orientation to that agreement if we are to 
flourish in using encryption for the positive side of that 
equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I was very proud to take part in the OECD meeting 
on e-commerce which took place a couple of weeks ago in Ottawa. 
It is amazing that all the members I talked to, whether they were 
from Norway, Sweden or Japan, had the same problems.  That is why 
we have an inside track at the starting gate.  I think Bill C-54 
will very much keep us ahead of the pack. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-54 
obviously deals with electronic commerce. Its primary purpose is 
not the protection of privacy, but electronic commerce and in 
that context, the bill supports electronic commerce while 
protecting privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said a few minutes ago during the speech of one of my 
colleagues, this bill is incomplete and this fact was stressed 
by the government member a few moments ago. He mentioned, for 
instance, medical information, to which I would add legal as 
well as tax information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet involves much more than the communication of mere 
business information. 
It contains information of all kinds which can and do indeed 
travel 24 hours a day and concern individual citizens of Canada 
and Quebec. This information which is not of a commercial nature 
is not covered by this bill, and there is the rub. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government member not recognize that the bill is 
incomplete and what changes does he suggest so that it provides 
the same protection Quebeckers already enjoy? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to respond 
to the question, but I do not know if the comment about the bill 
being incomplete is appropriate.  I think there are places for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, which is a lengthy one, addresses many areas of 
evidential law and affects a number of basically commercial 
trading arrangements within Canada.  Whether we want to bootleg 
that kind of issue on top of this one is a question of whether it 
is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to members of the Bloc talk back and forth about 
their concerns of how this will apply.  As I understand the bill 
it does not apply to Quebec because Quebec has an existing 
privacy law which is exempted from the bill in the first place. 
Therefore, I do not really understand why there is such a big 
concern.  Earlier I heard one member say that they were going to 
give up four years of jurisprudence and privacy when in fact, the 
way the bill is drafted it allows for the province of Quebec to 
be exempted because it has similar legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-54, which we are debating this afternoon, and which the hon. 
member for Durham has so eloquently praised, still raises some 
doubts. The title, which is very long, reads in part: An Act to 
support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal 
information that is collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how the Liberal member will position himself since, in 
the early 70s, the Trudeau government, of which the present 
Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister were members, directly 
ordered the RCMP to steal the voters' lists of a well-known 
political party. 
Does he think that the government of the day respected the 
integrity, the spirit and the letter of collective personal 
information? Even worse, instead of being fired, the RCMP 
officers who were found guilty of breaking and entering were 
promoted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member reconcile those actions with his party's 
stated intentions in introducing this bill? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all what we are 
trying to do here is to create a framework of rules and 
regulations that people will understand and appreciate. It is 
very important.  Canada is becoming a smaller and smaller 
country.  A banking employee told me the other day that we are 
only 30 million people but the fact is that we are right around 
the corner from each other.  That includes the province of 
Quebec. The province of Quebec is not a separate entity, but is 
very much part of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>E-commerce is the very thing in that there are no borders within 
Canada within that legal framework. We are going to continue to 
build strong ties between all the people of Canada to make this a 
better country, to make it competitive.  All the people of Canada 
will be able to compete successfully in that marketplace. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in the House today to debate this very 
important issue.  I do so on behalf of the residents of 
Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to underestimate the growing importance of the 
global communications network to economic activity.  To a very 
large degree Canada's success in the 21st century will depend on 
the ability of Canadians to participate and succeed in the global 
knowledge based economy.  Clearly this is the way of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A knowledge based economy is driving global growth. This trend 
can only intensify.  Canada's future prosperity will reflect our 
success in this economy. The Government of Canada has been 
extremely active in helping Canadians gain access to the 
opportunities of the global information culture. We have made 
Canada's participation in the knowledge based economy a top 
priority and rightfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have set the goal of making Canada the most connected nation 
in the world by the year 2000. This is truly a visionary move and 
one which will pay huge dividends in the future. Initiatives like 
the community access program and SchoolNet are ensuring that all 
Canadians no matter where they live have access to the electronic 
highway and the information economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the community access program alone by the year 2000-01 
we will have connected every rural Canadian community with a 
population of more than 400 people, as many as 5,000 communities. 
SchoolNet is a broad based private and public sector partnership 
working to ensure that all of Canada's 20,000 public schools and 
libraries are connected to the Internet by the end of this year. 
As a former teacher and as chairman of the Waterloo regional 
library I know firsthand about the importance of SchoolNet and 
what it represents for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is committed to helping Canadians access the 
information and knowledge that will enable them, their 
communities, their businesses and institutions find new 
opportunities for learning, interacting, transacting business and 
developing their economic and social potential.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electronic commerce is at the heart of the new information 
economy.  Building an environment where electronic commerce can 
flourish is a key part of our commitment. By the year 2000 we 
want Canada's legal, commercial and technological environment for 
electronic commerce to rank among the world's best.  We want 
Canadian industry to be a leader in the development and use of 
electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electronic commerce will benefit consumers and businesses alike 
first, by lowering transaction and distribution costs; second, by 
increasing market access and consumer choice; third, by improving 
product support and information; and finally, by generating new 
products, services and business opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day $1 trillion U.S. in currency and a quarter of a 
trillion U.S. dollars in securities are traded electronically 
around the world, yet only a small portion of these transactions 
are done over the Internet. But this will change and soon. 
Electronic commerce conducted over the Internet is currently 
estimated at about $45 billion Canadian. However, exponential 
growth is forecast with e-com revenues expected to reach $600 
billion by the year 2002. The potential impact of e-com is 
enormous.  Any nation which desires its citizens to prosper must 
move forward to capture these opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the world economy is soon to rely on e-com, we must first 
build trust in it.  We have to assure privacy, and that is 
absolutely important. The rules for the digital marketplace must 
be set both domestically and among global trading partners.  A 
large part of creating this trust and confidence has to do with 
assuring privacy and protecting personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If electronic commerce, e-com, is to flourish in Canada, a 
clear, predictable and secure environment is an absolute 
requisite.  Consumers, business and government, all of us need to 
feel confident about how our personal information is gathered, 
stored and used.  We need to have control over our personal 
information and feel assured that it will be protected whether we 
use the Internet to shop or bank, plan a vacation, seek out 
medical information, browse on the web, use a debit card to make 
a purchase, or correspond with family and friends via e-mail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's privacy commissioner has described our present privacy 
protection as a patchwork of laws, regulations and codes. His 
colleagues in the provinces agree.  They have been calling for 
privacy safeguards that would protect consumers from coast to 
coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government and most provinces have laws governing 
the public sector's collection, use and disclosure of personal 
information.  The federal Privacy Act applies to all federal 
government departments, most federal agencies and some federal 
crown corporations.  The Privacy Commissioner of Canada oversees 
this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protection in the private sector is sporadic and uneven.  Only 
Quebec's law respecting the protection of personal information in 
the private sector provides a detailed framework for the 
collection, use and disclosure of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the present situation with regard to the protection of 
personal information in cyberspace is unacceptable.  To build 
trust in the digital environment and put Canada at the forefront 
of electronic commerce, the government has tabled legislation to 
protect personal information in the private sector and to improve 
the way it conducts its own business via electronic media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the purpose of Bill C-54, the personal information 
protection and electronic documents act.  It makes the 
legislative adjustments that are necessary if electronic commerce 
is to flourish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1998 the government released a public discussion 
paper entitled “The Protection of Personal Information: Building 
Canada's Information Economy and Society”.  This paper outlined 
the various issues which must be addressed in developing 
legislation and sought input from all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have told us that they want legislation that is light, 
flexible and effective and that provides meaningful recourse for 
consumers.  They support building on an existing instrument, such 
as the model code for the protection of personal information of 
the Canadian Standards Association.  They want oversight to 
ensure compliance and investigate complaints.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 provides all of these things.  It establishes a right 
to the protection of personal information and clear rules for how 
the information shall be collected, used and disclosed in the 
course of commercial activities interprovincially or 
internationally, or indeed in connection with the operation of a 
federal work, undertaking or business.  The Privacy Commissioner 
of Canada will oversee compliance and investigate complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will provide other benefits as well.  It will 
enable the federal government to be a leader in the use of 
electronic media as it conducts its business with Canadian 
citizens.  It will do this by updating and adjusting our laws so 
that electronic communications and electronic service delivery 
can be practical and secure options for doing business with 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect of the bill in particular has significant 
implications for e-com.  Provisions in the new legislation 
introduce the concept of secure electronic signatures for use in 
electronic transmissions.  Such signatures would be unique, would 
identify and be under the sole control of their users, and would 
be securely linked to the documents used in a given transaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 will help pave the way for the federal government's 
use of electronic technology as it delivers its programs and 
services in a timely, cost effective and secure manner.  It will 
help ensure continuing federal leadership as the Canadian economy 
increasingly adopts e-com as the normal way of doing business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I want to note that by passing Bill C-54, the 
House of Commons will place Canada at the very forefront of that 
electronic commerce.  It will help ensure that Canadians will be 
able to take advantage of the opportunities offered to them by 
the new information economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also added and I quote “This bill will put Canada at 
the forefront”. Right? Wrong. Quebec is at the forefront. This 
bill will not put Canada at the forefront; it will bring up the 
rear, behind countries which already have more effective 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to wonder why the minister did not go to Quebec to study 
the legislation that has already in force there for four years. 
It is working well and could no doubt be improved. This would 
have been an excellent opportunity to improve on it. But no. 
They ignored it and brought forward a second class bill. That is 
what we have before us, a second class bill, which aims to 
promote electronic commerce, not to protect personal 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, by protecting personal information in general, we would 
not only be promoting electronic commerce, we would also be 
making full use of the tools that the information highway puts 
at our disposal. I have a question for the member opposite. 
Earlier, he said that the federal legislation would not apply to 
Quebec because Quebec already has its own legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 27 provides that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>27. (1) The Governor in Council may make regulations— 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>d</I>) if satisfied that legislation of a province that is 
substantially similar to this Part applies to an organization, a 
class of organizations, an activity or a class of activities, 
exempt the organization, activity or class from the application 
of this Part in respect of the collection, use or disclosure of 
personal information—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member opposite think that a political decision instead 
of a legal decision can be enough to exempt Quebec from the 
application of this legislation? As for me, it does not make any 
sense. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question.  However, he fails to recognize the importance of the 
legislation in Bill C-54 that will put us in the forefront in 
terms of what we are doing as a government for the protection of 
all Canadians. The bill will provide the kind of trust, 
confidence and reliability that Canadians not only deserve but 
need in this new age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with some interest to the member opposite talk about 
Quebec and what has happened in terms of its privacy laws.  I 
point out to him that we as a government have taken a look at the 
kinds of things Quebec has in place.  We have used to the 
required and necessary extent the kinds of processes in place in 
that great province.  I point out for all Canadians that he is in 
error in his premise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line for us as a government is that in terms of our 
moving into the 21st century, we are doing it with the kind of 
confidence and vision required and which all Canadians want.  We 
will do so in keeping with the values and the institutions that 
define us as a nation.

<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to repeat the title of the bill 
under consideration: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting 
personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in 
certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic 
means to communicate or record information or transactions and 
by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments 
Act and the Statute Revision Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the purpose of the bill is to regulate a new sector 
of activity called electronic commerce.  What is electronic 
commerce? 
Broadly speaking, this covers all the transactions one can do 
using electronic means.  Most of us are familiar with ATMs, and 
use them on a regular basis.  But there are also transactions 
between businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put this bill into perspective, let us say that we are 
roughly in the same situation we would be in if we did not have 
a supply network and we were deciding to pass consumer 
protection legislation.  We would try to make sure that the 
consumer is adequately protected and that the information 
gathered is secure.  We have to make sure that we strike a good 
balance between trade, freedom of trade, ease of trade, and 
providing adequate information protection for the people using 
these tools.  This is the challenge facing the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the information package we received from the government on 
this subject, there is an acknowledgement. 
Legislation has been in place for four years already; it was not 
passed by the Parti Quebecois, but by the Quebec Liberal Party. 
It was introduced by a federalist minister, and its 
constitutionality was never challenged.  It has been in place 
for four years and even the Minister of Industry in his press 
release acknowledged that it is an interesting measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main point of this legislation is the protection of personal 
information held by the private sector, which is really at the 
forefront of what should be done.  This is what is expected of 
the federal government.  Let us review how this bill came about. 
In 1982—a long time ago—Francis Fox, then Minister of 
Communications, said that the next step in privacy legislation 
was to extend the principles governing protection of personal 
information to the private sector under federal jurisdiction. 
That was in 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very significantly, in 1996-97, the Minister of Justice said that 
before year 2000, there would be an enforceable act giving real 
protection to privacy in the private sector; the minister added 
that this would be a major development.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that between the opinion of the Minister of 
Justice— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like the hon. members 
opposite to take the time to listen to our arguments on this 
bill and stop behaving like clowns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the Minister of Justice at the time said that 
legislation was needed to protect personal information. Two 
years later the Minister of Industry introduces a bill. The 
pendulum has swung the other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice said that legislation was needed to 
protect personal information. Today, we are debating a bill that 
is aimed more at facilitating electronic commerce than 
protecting privacy. 
Nobody denies the fact that electronic commerce will grow in 
value and importance in the future. Last week, we read in <I>Le 
Devoir</I> that the OECD, which is a major international 
organization, sees a bright future for electronic commerce. It 
is clear that there must be a major growth in that sector. It is 
obvious that we must adopt legislation concerning electronic 
commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is less obvious, however, is the process followed by the 
federal government. We are debating a bill which, in the final 
analysis, will not meet the personal information protection 
requirements that we could expect. I will give the House an 
example. 
Giving information in the course of electronic commerce is not 
like giving personal information over the phone to someone who 
can then either keep it or spread it around; the information is 
registered in computer systems, and that has significant 
multiplying effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to break new legal ground, to draft legislation that 
will provide a framework for years to come. We do not need 
legislation that will work only tomorrow morning, but 
legislation that will define how protection of information and 
electronic commerce will work in Canada for several years to 
come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not seem to offer adequate balance between the 
requirements of quality electronic commerce and the protection 
of personal information. This bill is not carefully crafted. 
It is not clear or accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the minister's press release states that good legislation 
already exists in Quebec and that the government will let it be 
enforced, instead of the federal legislation, if it works well. 
Except this is not spelled out clearly in the bill. It will 
depend on the goodwill of the governments in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how successive federal governments have tended to work; 
as with all governments, they go with the trends. From time to 
time, the government tends to support the market, but we should 
not sacrifice on that altar what is important in the protection 
of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not spell this out clearly. 
This is a very important first amendment that should be made to 
the bill, so that the Bloc Quebecois can consider it an 
acceptable bill. The bill should clearly state that if a 
province has equivalent legislation, that legislation will 
apply. In this way, Quebec will be able to maintain the lead it 
took four years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, on this planet, if we look at all the countries that have 
good legislation, I believe Quebec's legislation could used as 
an model and be studied by different countries to see how it 
works. It is based on the principle that the protection of 
personal information is fundamental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not something that happened by chance. It happened because 
of all the work we have accomplished as years went by with, for 
example, the Office de protection du consommateur, and on the 
issue of the right to information in the public sector. 
We have a pretty good history in this matter. We took the lead 
in the protection of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we have nothing against the rest of Canada passing its 
own legislation—I believe that it should do so—but we want to 
ensure that the legislation now in force in Quebec can apply, 
and that this will not cause further complications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can 
pass judgment on how the Canadian federation has worked in the 
past. One can condemn duplication. On can say that things should 
have been done differently. One can suggest ways to do things 
differently from the way they were done in the past. But, one 
thing is clear, we do not have the right to pass legislation 
that leads to more duplication.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a sector where the industry does not want dual 
legislation and does not want to be embroiled in constitutional 
problems and problems with interpreting the law, it is surely 
electronic commerce, which will in any case be considerably 
affected by the need of international agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to see how information will be protected in 
North America. If information is transmitted from someone in 
Canada to someone else in the United States, how is it protected 
if other companies in Canada want it? Many things need to be 
spelled out and the bill is vague on this. 
Some finishing work has not been done. The bill should be sent 
back to the drawing table to ensure it is properly amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill opens the door to several interpretations and gives 
discretionary power to the governor in council. The governor in 
council is the cabinet. It is the government that, through 
clause 27(<I>d</I>), may decide to change the application of this bill 
without having to reintroduce it before Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a principle that we do not often find in legislation and 
that we try to avoid as much as possible in our legislation and 
in the British tradition, to ensure there is no usurping of 
authority, especially in very contentious areas, such as 
personal information protection, where the government itself 
could be involved and would at the same time have the 
flexibility to change the legislation if it were not to its 
advantage to enforce the legislation as passed by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this point, there is work to be done. The bill, as it stands, 
needs more work and needs to be made clearer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also ask whether the bill responds to the expectations of 
consumers and of Quebec and Canada privacy commissioners. The 
respective titles of the two bills, that is the Quebec 
legislation and the Canadian legislation, are very explicit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's act is entitled an Act respecting the protection of 
personal information in the private sector whereas the federal 
act is entitled an Act to support and promote electronic 
commerce by protecting personal information that is collected, 
used or disclosed in certain circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Quebec legislation is aimed at protecting privacy 
and applies to every organization, the federal legislation only 
applies to transactions with a commercial purpose. The 
difference in ideology is obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the federal level, electronic commerce is the main object of 
the bill. Personal information also means businesses' trade 
information. The federal act should not hamper the very same 
trade activities it seeks to promote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can reasonably state that the Quebec bill is stricter and 
more encompassing both in its form—it truly is a bill—and its 
definitions, its clear wording and the power to issue orders it 
gives the commissioner, something that is lacking in the federal 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has many other flaws. The framework of the bill is its 
schedule. This is rather odd. It is as if they were trying to 
hoodwink us. And that is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The schedule is a model code for the protection of personal 
information developed by the private sector and consumers as a 
framework for the protection of personal information in the 
private sector on a voluntary basis, I repeat, on a voluntary 
basis. This is noteworthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means is that the minister chose to stick to this code 
because he had the support of the private sector and was eager 
to develop e-commerce in Canada. In other words, they did not 
delve into this issue to see if the protection of personal 
information was adequate, real and complete. They said “This is 
the consensus the industry has agreed to. We will include it in 
the legislation as is”. But is it enough? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister did not follow through on the recommendations made 
by consumers and the privacy commissioners, who stated that the 
code provides a good basis, but needs to be reviewed and amended 
if it is to be included in the legislation. They are very clear 
on that issue. So, during consideration of this bill, we would 
need to review the code. 
As long as it remains unchanged, we have yet another reason to 
believe that this is an incomplete piece of legislation that 
needs some major amendments.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the bill is rather unclear. The roles are not clearly 
defined and there is still a lot of work to be done in this 
area. The bill is open to various interpretations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, it stipulates that organizations shall make a 
reasonable effort to ensure that the individual is advised of 
the purposes for which the information will be used. What is 
meant by “a reasonable effort”? 
Will there be all kinds of legal challenges because a company 
has disclosed credit card information or any other type of 
information, claiming that it had mentioned the information 
could be used for all kinds of other purposes and that, by 
giving authorization, the person who provided the information 
had also authorized all possible uses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person who provides information because he or she wants to 
acquire a product may not have understood this clearly, and 
there is a list of possible uses, but those uses are not 
mentioned in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get back to one important element. I am sure the 
minister responsible for regional development in Quebec is well 
aware that a law has been in place in that province for four 
years. Since it was adopted by the Liberal government at that 
time, nobody can say that it has a separatist or sovereignist 
bias. 
It is a law that Quebeckers put in place because they thought it 
was relevant and because we were slightly ahead in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must change the bill so it is very clear 
that Quebec, or any other province that adopts similar 
legislation, can enforce its own legislation rather than the 
provisions contained in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other aspects of this bill that I would like to draw 
to the attention of the House. What about the exchange of 
information outside commercial activities, for example, between 
non profit organizations? The status of this type of exchange is 
not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know a lot of non profit organizations, such as foundations 
and all volunteer organizations, that must exchange information. 
Information is collected on volunteers. 
There is nothing in the bill with regard to this type of 
exchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal institutions are subject to much more restrictive 
legislation than the private sector will be with Bill C-54. There 
is a double standard. The federal government is asked to be 
efficient in its operations, but the requirements will not be 
the same for the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences of these various aspects makes members of the 
Bloc Quebecois wonder. 
If, with a privacy law in the public sector, the privacy 
commissioner is obliged to take Human Resources Canada and 
Canada Customs to court under section 8 of the charter of rights 
and freedoms for contravening the Privacy Act, how can the 
government expect private enterprise to go one better with a law 
that is less restrictive and more open to interpretation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just gone through this with employment insurance.  The 
Government of Canada decided to relate information provided to 
Canada Customs by out of country travellers and by people 
receiving employment insurance.  The privacy commissioner had to 
go to court to get Human Resources Canada to comply with the 
law, and we are still awaiting the decision on this. 
The government is proceeding against itself, when the 
requirements are indicated in the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we ask businesses to behave any better when the law 
contains no specific provision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the issues are fairly clear.  The Minister of Industry 
has to make sure that Canada is an active participant in the 
world economy, more specifically, in the upcoming explosion of 
electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think this will become very important.  I think it will be 
vital to do so.  In terms of traditional imports, Quebec is 
currently experiencing a pretty fantastic boom.  The same is 
true in the case of electronic commerce.  We are ready to get on 
the bandwagon and grab our share of the market. 
I think it is in the interest of everyone globally for this to 
happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a balance must be struck between the rights of 
consumers, the citizens' right to privacy and the right to 
trade. It is therefore very important that the federal 
government go back to the drawing board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, it seems to us, in the Bloc Quebecois, that this is 
a jumbled bill, full of ifs and whens, whose central feature is 
a schedule that can be changed by the governor in council 
without debate. All of this is unacceptable to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will make federal-provincial linkage extremely 
complex and will result in further interference. It emphasises 
electronic commerce at the expense of the fundamental concept of 
privacy. 
This bill, as it stands, does not give commissioners any real 
power, making the legislation meaningless, and it does not draw 
upon Quebec's unique experience with protecting personal 
information, or privacy, in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, unless amended, this bill should be defeated 
in Parliament or sent back to the drawing board so that the 
final product can measure up to the expectations of the people 
in Quebec and Canada with respect to both electronic commerce 
and privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Order, please. It is my 
duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that 
the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is 
as follows: the hon. member for Frontenac—Mégantic, Asbestos. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I greatly 
enjoyed the speech given by my colleague and friend, the member 
for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques.  He is 
perfectly right; the bill before us is not just about e-mail and 
the associated personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give an example so that all those in the House 
and listeners at home will understand what we are really talking 
about.  You go into a department store.  We have all been in 
these stores which, in addition to selling things, offer credit 
cards, which record our name, address, telephone number and 
postal code when we buy something there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The store collects all this information and then, with the help 
of its computer, is able to produce a list of people who bought 
a sports item, for example, and then turn this list over to the 
publisher of a sports magazine, say.  These lists command quite 
a price, apparently going for a dollar and up per name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how it is that members of the public receive junk mail. 
For anyone wondering where on earth they got our address, and 
how they knew we were interested in whatever it was, if in fact 
we even were, because sometimes we were just buying a present 
for somebody else, this is how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned department stores; I could mention many other 
organizations, not always commercial, and various associations. 
In Quebec, such a practice is not allowed. It is an indictable 
offence. But in the rest of Canada, it is allowed and 
legal—unless a business follows its own code of ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us would not necessarily make this practice 
illegal, and this is the purpose of my question to the hon. 
member. Clause 4.3.7 of the schedule deals with the consent 
principle and provides the following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) a checkoff box may be used to allow individuals to request 
that their names and addresses not be given to other 
organizations. Individuals who do not check the box are assumed 
to consent to the transfer of this information to third parties; 
</UL></UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT68"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT68"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we go to a store, buy something and get a receipt. The clerk 
says “Look at the receipt. There is a small box”. We think 
“fine”, but the act has just been circumvented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what will happen with this bill, which provides just the 
opposite of what we have in Quebec, where a person must check 
off the box to allow the transfer of information to third 
parties. Here, it is exactly the opposite. In Quebec, there is 
no consent unless otherwise specified, whereas in the 
legislation before us, consent is implicit, unless otherwise 
stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques could comment on 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Portneuf for 
the example he gave at the end of his speech, which so clearly 
explains the whole situation.  Quebec has a law which operates 
on the principle that privacy should have priority.  The federal 
government has taken the opposite approach and given priority to 
business.  The Liberal government will make it the exception 
rather than the rule that people can block the release of 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to right this state of affairs, which we find 
unacceptable because Quebec is already much further ahead in 
this regard.  I have an even greater reason to be concerned 
because, in this very House in April 1997, I proposed a motion, 
which was unanimously passed, requiring the Privacy Act to apply 
to all crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion received unanimous approval in the House of Commons 
one and a half years ago and the government has done nothing. 
Right now, there are still many crown corporations not subject 
to the Privacy Act, even though the motion received unanimous 
approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand that things take time.  What I am getting at is 
that, if the bill is not right from the start, we will find 
ourselves in a similar situation, where a motion passed 
unanimously by the House of Commons is not acted on by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a new area of law.  We are in a new sector, where 
those who are better informed will be better protected.  Poverty 
and the ability to use the tools available will still determine 
the outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us level the playing field.  Let us give everyone a fair 
chance with E-mail and see that their rights are protected, 
rather than the opposite.  We have an opportunity to make these 
amendments, and the government took the time to table the bill. 
The Minister of Industry won out over those members of this 
government who wanted a bill that protected personal 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still time for the government to right the balance and, 
among other things, make it possible for the Privacy Act to be 
the legislation that really applies in Quebec and to confirm 
this in the legislation, not just in the minister's press 
releases.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
the context of questions and comments on Bill C-54, I found my

Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques' reference to the 
Henry VIII clause particularly relevant.  I prefer the Louis XIV 
clause.  When we were in high school, Louis XIV said, in the 
books of course, “L'État c'est moi”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 27(<I>d</I>) provides that the governor in council may amend the 
law without parliamentary debate or democratic consultation.  A 
bit like this afternoon, when the Solicitor General, in response 
to a Reform Party colleague, said “I personally decided to not 
pay lawyers to defend the students”.  That came from private 
interests. 
Pepper was thrown in the noses and eyes of 19- and 20-year-old 
students for no reason other than to please a foreign dictator, 
a bit like what is happening with the Chilean dictator, where 
years later wrongs are being recognized and he is being arrested 
abroad. 
In order to accommodate a foreign dictator, our Prime Minister 
infringed the rights of these students and has used his position 
to decide not to pay.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleague from 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques whether, with 
clause 27(<I>b</I>), there is not a risk of the same sort of personal 
danger we have just mentioned.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, the 
member is not on topic.  I think the Chair should pull him to 
order.  We are not dealing with that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We thank the hon. 
member for drawing the House's attention to the topic at hand. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the member opposite would 
like to participate in the debate, he is welcome.  If he would 
not, perhaps he would allow those who want to to do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That was not a point 
of order either. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the question from 
my colleague from Frontenac—Mégantic, I do indeed think his 
words were very aptly chosen. This Henry VIII-style clause more 
or less says “We are going to give the government the 
opportunity to amend the legislation without having to go back to 
the House”. This could have a significant economic impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already seen battles between the Minister of Heritage 
and the Minister of Industry on matters impacting on the 
cultural future of Quebec and Canada and we have seen that, with 
this federal government, culture was not always the aspect that 
won out and also, particularly, that the negotiations were 
always held in secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause could easily put us back into the same situation in 
future: international agreements could be changed and bring 
about changes in Canadian legislation without necessarily having 
been re-approved by Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The less this happens the better. 
The government over there, which is already bureaucracy-driven, 
has already given us plenty of proof that it would give itself 
additional powers over the heads of the elected representatives. 
This, I believe, would be extremely harmful to democracy in 
Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can see that 
few members are interested in addressing this issue, and I can 
understand that, since this is a rather complex issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with electronic commerce, with EDP, with modern 
technology, and we tend to be in awe of this wonderful 
technology which, presumably, will solve all our problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we know full well that such is not the case. This technology 
is only one of many tools that can help us achieve the best, and 
also the worst. I realize that Bill C-54 before us seeks to 
ensure that, in the area of electronic commerce, we will achieve 
the best, and not the worst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the title of Bill C-54, An Act to support 
and promote electronic commerce. The purpose of this legislation 
is to support and promote electronic commerce. 
How will this bill support and promote electronic commerce? It 
is stated right after, again in the title: by protecting 
personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in 
certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic 
means to communicate or record information or transactions and 
by amending certain acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 seeks to promote electronic commerce, while protecting 
personal information, so that consumers can engage in electronic 
commerce with confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of this House and of those who are watching us 
on television, let me first explain in general, easy to 
understand terms what this legislation is all about. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT70"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT70"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650
<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about electronic commerce, what exactly are we 
talking about? We are talking about making purchases or 
transactions—bank transactions, transactions with suppliers, 
with manufacturers, with clients—electronically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These types of transactions have been in existence for quite 
some time. Telecommunications have been with us for thirty years 
or so. They have been relatively well structured in terms of 
standards for 25 years. As for electronic data interchange, it 
has been governed by international standards for more than 10 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, electronic data interchange, or EDI, is used 
relatively often by many businesses. For the past ten years or 
so, large businesses have been using it in their dealings with 
suppliers. That means that a supplier does not send a written 
bill to his client, but rather an electronic bill that is 
received on the client's computer, who will then authorize 
payment after verifying that the goods or services have actually 
been delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening today is an acceleration—and I was going to 
say a democratization—of this process. Electronic data 
interchange is not longer restricted to large corporations and 
government. It is now accessible to the average person through, 
among other means, the Internet. 
One just has to sit in front of a computer screen to have access 
to a supplier of goods or services. Then it is as easy as 
filling out a form shown on the screen, pressing a key or 
clicking on a button, and the information is sent, through the 
telephone line or the coaxial cable, to the supplier, who then 
fills the order and, of course, bills the client. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far so good. However, if I give my credit card number when I 
make such a transaction, I want to be sure that this number will 
not be used for other purposes than those for which I wrote it 
on the electronic form. I want to be sure that somebody will not 
use my credit card number to travel around the world. Of course, 
I would only find out about it when receiving my statement at 
the end of the month. It would be terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True, particularly well equipped hackers might be able to get at 
that information. But we have the tools to make it very 
difficult for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One should not generalize and panic. We have to recognize that 
in everyday life, you and I and a lot of other people are using 
their credit cards in a lot of establishments, restaurants, 
clothing stores, to subscribe to a magazine and God knows what 
else. Our credit card number is handled by strangers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go to a restaurant and give my card to the waiter or 
waitress, who takes an imprint of it or puts it through the 
magnetic tape reader to forward my bill to my credit card 
supplier, for a moment that person has my credit card number at 
hand and could very easily take it down and misuse it later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However 99.99% of people are honest and such misdeeds simply do 
not occur. Credit card frauds do happen though, and it is wise 
to always check one's statement to make sure that it does not 
contain transactions which are not ours. It is a bit the same 
on-line. In the vast majority of cases, there is no risk. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if a hacker wanted to get at some credit card numbers, it is 
not unlikely he would succeed, unless safeguards are put in 
place. This is when the notion of facilitating electronic 
commerce comes into play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I feel that my purchasing something on the Internet might 
reveal things I do not want to be known, such as what I am 
buying, how much I paid for it, what my credit card number is or 
other confidential information I might give, if I am not 
convinced it will all remain confidential and will be used for 
the intended purpose only, I will be very reluctant to engage in 
any electronic transaction. 
I would not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, if the legislation were to require businesses to take 
the appropriate steps to ensure that all electronic transactions 
are secure, confidential and protected, then the average citizen 
would feel much more at ease and e-commerce would blossom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the two problems that can arise in terms of protection 
of personal information? First, there is the illegal access to 
the information by someone who is not entitled to see the data. 
Of course, none of us would like information about us to fall 
into the hands of people who should not have access to it. That 
is the first problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, there is also the misuse or illegal use of the 
information. Someone who should not even have had access to your 
information is using it to harm you or for some other illegal 
purposes. 
So, it is important to ensure that the information can only be 
accessed by the people who are entitled to see it, by the final 
recipient, and used for the purposes for which the information 
was made available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this area, Quebec has been fully protected for four years now 
through its Act respecting the protection of personal information 
in the private sector. The bill before us today, Bill C-54, only 
deals with businesses. It does not extend to any other activity 
and has some serious deficiencies. I have already mentioned one, 
the fact that if an individual does not clearly prohibit it, then 
the information can be used for other purposes than the ones 
stated originally. Silence gives consent. We make a stupid and 
foolish decision, because we are not aware of the consequences, 
and everything is done behind our backs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is extremely important because, whether we like it or not, 
electronic commerce is bound to expand. It is here to stay. I am 
somewhat surprised and disappointed that such a crucial issue 
for a nation like Canada is not receiving all the attention it 
should, and indeed did in Quebec—mind you the Liberals were in 
power in Quebec at the time, with Minister Lawrence Cannon 
sponsoring the legislation; so this is not peculiar to the 
sovereignists, just a good habit Quebeckers have of looking 
after matters that concern them and doing it well. This issue 
was widely debated in Quebec. I know, I was there. 
I was one of the players, as a computer specialist by 
profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Sounds like the hon. member opposite would 
like to speak, Mr. Speaker. 
I hope you will take note of his wish and give him the floor 
next. In the meantime, I would appreciate it if he could be 
quiet and give me chance to carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate held in Quebec was a thorough, major, serious debate. 
It was a societal debate that resulted in one of the best pieces 
of legislation in the world. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed that my colleagues from the other parties, from the 
rest of Canada, do not seem a bit concerned. They bow down in 
front of the computer god. They say “If it is electronic, it 
must be good and if commercial data must be protected, we will 
do that, no problem. Are there other things that need 
protection?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commercial data are only the tip of the iceberg. There are also 
medical, legal or judiciary, tax, school, family data, plus many 
other types of information. In fact, all the information that an 
individual sends directly on the Internet to an organization or 
an other individual should be confidential. 
But Bill C-54 is completely silent on all the other types of 
personal data when, in Quebec, they are already covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said a minute ago when I read the long title of the bill we 
are debating today, one must understand that it does not aim at 
the protection of personal data but rather at the promotion and 
facilitation of electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where the problem lies. In Quebec, the legislation on 
privacy protection in the private sector does not specify if the 
information is to be processed electronically, manually, 
verbally or otherwise. The information is protected, no matter 
what vehicle is used to transmit it. Since electronic commerce 
and all the rest are included, that legislation is a very 
powerful tool in Quebec, while Ottawa is making very timid 
efforts by talking only about electronic commerce. The federal 
government is kow-towing in front of electronic commerce. 
It says “Commerce is important. If it is electronic, it must be 
even more important and we will ensure that personal information 
is protected if the person demands so”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what it says. If the person does not check off the 
box—and I read it earlier, it is written explicitly in the 
bill—the legislation does not operate. The legislation lets 
companies and organizations, those that have their commercial 
information in hand, do whatever they please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation such as this does not deserve to be passed. 
Legislation such as this, in order to be passed, should have all 
the necessary working parts, and be complete. It should be as 
good as the one that Quebec has had for four years. It should 
build on it. It should also build on improvements that could be 
made to it. No. We are presented with legislation that is, for 
all intents and purposes, only half-baked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be very important for this House to ensure the real 
debate takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left and will there be 
other speakers after me? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member has four 
minutes left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Will there be other people speaking after 
me? I feel like continuing. If there are no other speakers, I 
feel like asking the unanimous consent of the House to continue. 
Anyway, we have until 6.30 p.m. You will understand that my 
throat will be tired well before that, but I feel like 
continuing the analysis of this bill in more detail, if the 
House gives its unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> There are four other 
members who would like to take part in this debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House may give unanimous consent for the hon. member for 
Portneuf to speak indefinitely or put a time limit on it. 
However there are four minutes left in this session.  Is the hon. 
member for Portneuf requesting an extension of time in debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am asking for 
unanimous consent for an extension of time in debate to no longer 
than 6.30 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The House has heard 
the request of the member for Portneuf.  Is there unanimous 
consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There is no 
unanimous consent.  The hon. member for Portneuf has four minutes 
remaining.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue here is whether 
this bill meets the needs of Canadians and Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say, on behalf of Canadians, that this legislation is 
certainly better than nothing at all. However, the bill is far 
from what, in my opinion, Canadians deserve. They deserve 
something at least as good as what Quebeckers have. Canadians 
are not well served by this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse still, because of this bill Quebeckers could lose since 
the federal cabinet could make the political decision to allow 
Quebec to implement its own legislation instead of the bill that 
is before us and that is inferior to the Quebec act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, should the federal cabinet feel that the Quebec 
legislation is not adequate, it could—without leaving any 
recourse to the province, since this is a political and not a 
judicial process—make Quebeckers lose important rights 
regarding the protection of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can reasonably assume that some businesses regulated by a 
federal charter might be tempted to avoid—for very questionable 
reasons—being subjected to the Quebec legislation and prefer to 
be governed by the more lenient federal act that is being 
proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> Toothless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Indeed, toothless. I see that the Liberal 
member knows exactly what I mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, the Bloc Quebecois can absolutely not support this 
bill, because it does not deserve to go any further. In fact, 
the government should go back to the drawing board, review its 
objectives, which should be to allow or ensure the protection of 
personal information so as to promote, among other things, 
electronic commerce, instead of promoting electronic commerce 
by, among other measures, protecting personal information more 
or less adequately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc's position is clear: take the bill back to the drawing 
board, let the minister do his homework and then come up with a 
bill that will meet the expectations of Canadians and that will 
serve them as well as Quebeckers have been served for the past 
four years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a few comments to make.  I presume that after the 
member opposite took considerable time that the Bloc Quebecois 
and the member opposite will perhaps enjoy my comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support Bill C-54 in principle.  It should go to committee for 
further study and hopefully we will get good legislation in the 
end, although I send up a flag indicating I have found some 
problems with the bill in my initial examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first problems was a translation problem and the 
definition for work being done by federal agencies.  In the 
French version we see the word radiodiffusion which was 
translated into English as radio broadcasting.  This is one of 
the areas of federal influence that the bill is to apply to 
initially.  I believe the intention is for the CBC to come under 
the act, but because of a misunderstanding of the French word 
radiodiffusion which in the Larousse translates only as radio 
broadcasting—and I understand that in Quebec it means 
broadcasting in general—it would appear that the English side of 
the equation is in error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event the bill is easily understood as comprising a front 
section that deals in general with how the law will apply.  The 
key in looking at the legislation is schedule 1 in the back of 
the bill.  It pertains to the principles set out in the national 
standard of Canada entitled the “Model Code for the Protection 
of Personal Information”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT74"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT74"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a code of conduct in the handling of personal 
information that was obtained by elaborate consensus.  All kinds 
of stakeholders contributed to it.  The government was very 
proactive in seeking this input.  It became a general code of 
standards for protecting personal information and it is the 
corner piece of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately when legislation is created by consensus there 
sometimes are difficulties.  My concern about the legislation is 
that I do not feel, much as I support it in principle, that it 
adequately addresses the problem of charity lists or special 
lists that are comprised from the consumer, put in databanks and 
held by either private for profit corporations or by non-profit 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standard in schedule I waffles on the issue elaborately.  In 
the first place it says the organizations that have these lists 
may indeed have reasons not to ask for the consent of individuals 
whose names are appearing on the lists.  These could be lists of 
charities or donations.  They could be lists of such things as 
buying a computer at Radio Shack.  They could be any kind of list 
like that.  If an organization possesses these lists, the 
proposed legislation indicates that it does not have to be 
responsible for the personal information contained in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on in schedule I to observes that while consent is 
required, the whole principle of being able to get consent— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  My friends on the opposite side should 
be enjoying this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B>  We are, we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  I knew you would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another section it says that organizations are obligated to 
get consent for personal information if it is deemed to be 
sensitive.  Then the code sets out to try to explore what 
sensitive means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do know that sensitive presumably means the religion one 
happens to have or medical records or financial information.  It 
leaves it to the organization to decide what is to be considered 
sensitive.  It makes an example.  It says, for example, that if a 
subscription to a magazine is taken out and one's name goes on a 
list elsewhere it would not necessarily be considered sensitive 
information.  However the legislation says that the names and 
addresses of subscribers to some special interest magazines might 
be considered sensitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case I would suspect that they are thinking about 
prurient magazines, sex magazines.  They are willing to protect 
sex magazines but they are not willing to protect subscribers to 
<I>Scientific American</I>, <I>Homemakers Magazine</I> or religious 
magazines.  That makes us wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the opposition will ask me a really interesting question I 
will continue with my comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of 
my Liberal colleague very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is right. The problem with this bill is Schedule 1, which 
says certain things but does not say others. This schedule is 
based on the so-called CSA code, which is ultimately set up by 
private business and based on goodwill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other terms, we are put in the awkward position of having a 
group of businesses deciding what is good or bad for consumers. 
We are putting the cart before the horse. It is a bit like 
having the fox in charge of the chicken coop. Chickens do not 
get a whole lot of protection that way. 
But consumers should not be compared to chickens. Consumers have 
rights, they are human beings and citizens, and they deserve a 
better approach than the one in Schedule 1.

1, indicates a recommendation and does not impose an obligation. 
That word is all over the place in schedule 1.

chicken coop, the fox does not even have to abide by the 
building code. It could do it, but only if it feels like it.

much latitude for interpretation.  Were I to have had the 
opportunity to elaborate on the comments that I began, I would 
demonstrate to the member opposite that the amount of latitude 
leads us into the situation where we have to wonder whether the 
bill, as currently written, is going to have the effect that we 
desire.  I have a suspicion that it will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this bill is something that has to go before the 
committee to be studied in great depth. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I both agree and disagree 
with my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I agree with his comments.  He is right.  This bill is so 
badly put together that the only winners will be lawyers.  The 
losers will be the consumers.  Businesses will be faced with 
legal bills because they will have to defend themselves against 
the lawsuits of disgruntled consumers who, having read the 
legislation, will assume that they have rights to assert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill being what it is, imprecise and badly put together, the 
courts will have to arbitrate conflicts between consumers and 
businesses.  Lawyers are going to make money to a degree you 
won't believe with legislation such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I disagree with my colleague is when he says that the bill 
should go back to the drawing board if you will, that it should 
be fixed up in committee.  In my opinion it is beyond fixing. 
It has to go back to the drawing board, yes, but we have to 
start “from scratch”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to base the legislation on the Quebec example, we have 
to use the Quebec experience, to give Canadians the legislation 
they deserve, a legislation on par with the one Quebeckers 
already enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There might be more questions, maybe from my colleague again, 
therefore, I am asking for unanimous consent to carry on with 
the questions and comments period for a short while. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Portneuf has requested that the time for questions and comments 
be extended.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to follow my colleague's speech, although 
I hope to be a bit more brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with some of the comments made by members opposite which 
find fault with schedule I of this bill.  So much of the bill 
depends on this schedule which is, in essence, a code of conduct 
that has been established not just by industry, but by general 
a consensus of the various stakeholders, including non-profit 
organizations, which is an area of specialty for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in the questions and comments it was observed that there 
were shortcomings in the bill insofar as it relies heavily on the 
interpretation of what is sensitive information and what needs to 
be protected.  If it is sensitive, then the organization 
collecting the information is required to do certain things with 
it, including protecting and handling it in a responsible 
fashion.  The difficulty is that unless you define what sensitive 
is in legislation there are going to be problems and I believe 
that situation exists with this legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is another aspect that I would like to draw 
attention to which is again in schedule I.  It raises the issue 
of lists.  When we buy or donate to a charity or anything like 
that we go on a list.  Sometimes these lists are held within 
Canada and sometimes they are held outside Canada.  At any rate, 
there is a great industry in collecting, selling or renting these 
lists to various organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the schedule's standard, the observation is made 
that an organization may not always be able to seek consent from 
individuals and sometimes individuals are unable to request 
information from an organization concerning themselves, but a 
charity or a direct marketing firm that wishes to acquire a 
mailing list from another organization can keep that information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my mind there is a bit of a hole there.  I would like to know 
that any organization that is using my name is responsible for 
that personal information.  However, it would appear that 
schedule I allows direct marketing firms to not be held 
responsible in the trading and marketing of these lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we know that our name is on a list and we want to get that 
information from a charity or a for profit fundraiser that has 
our name on a list, what the schedule states is that certain 
information cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial 
proprietary reasons, or that information cannot be disclosed 
which is subject to solicitor-client privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What schedule I states is that if there is a commercial 
proprietary reason for which an organization does not want to 
divulge our personal information to us, it does not have to do 
so. That creates an enormous problem.  What if I want to know how 
my name is being used by one of these fundraisers?  Is it being 
distributed, for example, to other organizations that do not have 
my interests at heart?  Is it being distributed to organizations 
that will take advantage of the knowledge that I give to one 
organization, one charity or another? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to schedule I, as it now exists, if I donate $10 to a 
charity and another person donates $100 to a charity, that is not 
considered sensitive information, or it could be considered 
proprietary information that I cannot get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to have something for the House to contemplate. This is 
a list of all the non-profit organizations that have placed their 
donor lists with a U.S. direct marketing agency. According to the 
schedule as it now exists, that agency can deny me the 
information as to who has access to my name on that list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, if I had contributed, for example, $1,000 to the 
lifetime members of a TV ministry, another organization can get 
that information and find out that I actually donated to an 
evangelical TV ministry.  Talk about religion being sensitive. By 
merely paying money, this organization can supply me with a list 
of all the people who contributed to B'nai Brith.  It is the 
total list of all Canadian Jewish donors.  Anyone who wants to 
know who is Jewish can simply find out by contacting this direct 
marketing firm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members where the protection is of my private information 
concerning my religion if organizations, even in the United 
States, can get that information and distribute it as widely as 
they like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even worse than that.  We would agree that those in 
Canadian society who are particularly wealthy or affluent would 
probably like to keep that information secret. 
If they make generous donations to a charity, they will turn up 
on this list as “Hotline Canada wealthy donors, 502,000 names”. 
Those are 502,000 names that anyone can access.  If that is not 
personal information, I do not know what personal information is. 
If that is not information that can be used unwisely and 
improperly, I do not know what such information is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fear that the schedule as presently drafted does not provide 
adequate protection for the distribution of donor lists or 
commercial lists of any kind.  We are now in an age when we can 
go into Radio Shack, buy a speaker or a piece of electronic 
equipment and that firm will record our name and address in a 
data bank.  We are in an age when because of these lists and the 
electronic control of these lists we can build up a complete data 
profile of any individual in Canadian or American society.  I 
would submit that is very dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I support this legislation in principle, I hope that when 
it goes to committee we look very carefully at it because I do 
not think it addresses the problem of the selling and buying of 
information on donor lists or commercial lists, and that is 
something the legislation has to address.

<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the member 
for Wentworth—Burlington is not making this up.  What he told us 
really goes on.  It actually does happen.  I would like to point 
out to the House, however, that when a member of the public 
provides personal information in Quebec, even to a charitable 
organization, that organization is not permitted by law to pass 
it on or use it for other purposes.  Quebeckers are well 
protected in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member for Wentworth—Burlington told us about is not 
going on in Quebec.  The legislation is four years old. 
Quebeckers are well protected.  But it can happen in Canada. 
Bill C-54 now before us will not prevent what the member opposite 
just described from happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I mentioned earlier that the bill has a serious 
shortcoming.  It is not worthy of Canadians, who deserve the 
same protection as Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's legislation goes much further.  In Quebec, a business 
that has information and must deal with a business in another 
country, not just in Canada or in the United States, and must, 
in the course of the transaction, provide personal information 
it obtained in Quebec, must have signed an agreement with the 
individual outside the country to whom the information is being 
transmitted that that information will continue to be protected 
to the same extent that it was in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not extraordinary? Is it not extraordinary that the 
people of Quebec have this type of protection of their personal 
information?  Why is the House letting a bill like this one 
remain so incomplete as to not deal with the real risks faced by 
Canadians and as described by the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sending the bill to committee for re-examination will not change 
it.  I would like to explain to my colleague that it cannot 
change the nature of the legislation before the House.  The 
point raised by my colleague is in fact intended to change the 
nature of the bill to make it more encompassing.  The bill, 
obviously, is intended to facilitate and promote electronic 
commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What my colleague has referred to aims at protecting personal 
information in electronic commerce or elsewhere.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, even in committee, this bill cannot be amended as 
substantially as necessary, as my colleague mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, my question is: does he not agree that this bill should be 
returned to the drawing board and that a real bill should be 
returned to the House to address the serious concerns he raised 
and I share? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is why we have 
standing committees, to handle difficult problems with 
legislation.  I would expect that the competency of the industry 
committee looking at this will show and we will get good 
legislation in the end. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, as I said earlier, in 
Quebec, information is protected beyond Quebec's borders by 
requiring those contracted to gather it to provide this 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address another aspect of international trade 
and share my concerns with the member for Wentworth—Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I engage in a transaction on the Internet, I do not always 
know where my query will take me. Will it be somewhere in the 
United States, Asia, Africa or Australia? I cannot really tell. 
It does not matter anyway. When a query is made it travels 
through phone lines and satellites to a place that may be 
totally different from the one indicated on the screen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What recourse do I have if I am not satisfied with the 
transaction I just completed? In Quebec, we have the Consumer 
Protection Act. 
In Canada, representations can be made before a civil court in 
one province or another. In the United States, remedies can 
probably be sought through some bilateral agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the countries with which we have not signed agreements in 
this area outnumber those with which we have. The net result is 
that any real development in electronic commerce can only take 
place if there are multilateral agreements between participating 
countries—and we hope there will be a great many—ensuring a 
degree of consumer protection similar to the one enjoyed here, 
at home, regarding the quality of the service or product and the 
protection of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I conduct a transaction, and my name, address, 
telephone number, credit card number, social insurance number 
and heaven only knows what else ends up in Timbuktu.  From there 
it goes to Ankara, and Ankara sends it on to Moscow.  In the 
twinkling of an eye, there is information on me all over the 
world, which does nothing to make my eyes twinkle, because from 
then on anyone in the world can use my name and other 
information in ways I would not necessarily want them to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, Bill C-54 does not provide Canadians with 
sufficient protection as far as international commerce and 
exchanges with other countries are concerned.  There ought to be 
some guidelines for Canadian businesses on how to proceed in 
order to ensure service quality and protect information while 
doing business electronically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is extremely narrow, in fact.  It should be far 
broader, if there is any real desire to promote electronic 
commerce as it deserves, while providing consumers with proper 
protection of their rights as consumers and as citizens entitled 
to privacy.  What are the thoughts of my colleague from 
Wentworth—Burlington on this?

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not doubt that the 
first obligation to the protection of information is at home.  I 
cited a list of an American direct marketer deliberately to 
illustrate to the House the dimensions of the problem. It is not 
just a domestic problem.  It is not confined to Quebec.  It is 
not confined to Alberta or to Canada.  It is a worldwide problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at a particular disadvantage because we sit next to one 
of the most aggressive countries in the world in terms of trying 
to gather information for commercial uses.  We do not have to go 
anywhere but to the United States to discover people who know 
very well the value of personal information and who will 
willingly use it to make dollars for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a very strong piece of legislation at home that puts the 
obligation on the people who are collecting information in this 
country to be answerable for how that information is eventually 
used.  But also we have to be cognizant that we can only do so 
much. We do live in an information age and we cannot expect to 
create miracles. Information is everywhere available and it is 
very difficult to control it in an absolute fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that concerns me in this debate is that we 
have probably lost sight to a certain degree on just what is the 
kind of information we need to protect.  Is it really a matter of 
having to protect what religion we are or is it, as I said in my 
earlier remarks, a matter of protecting information that relates 
to our financial ability?  That is the information that I think 
can be used very dangerously.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is with great interest that I speak this afternoon on Bill C-54. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will allow me a few seconds to read into the record the 
title of this bill. I do want to read it because it is a rather 
long title of about ten lines. The titles reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An Act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting 
personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in 
certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic 
means to communicate or record information or transactions and 
by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments 
Act and the Statute Revision Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a rather complex bill. A few moments ago, my colleague 
from Champlain asked what was the most important thing in Bill 
C-54. 
Is it promoting the sale of electronic material like computers 
or the protection of personal information? The hon. member for 
Champlain told me—and I fully agree with him on this—that he 
could hardly trust a government led by the present Prime 
Minister, who purports to respect personal information but does 
not even respect human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Champlain reminded me of the time when the Prime 
Minister, wearing his big sunglasses, grabbed an activist by the 
throat, threw him to the ground and then let his bodyguards 
break a few of his teeth. If my son did such a thing, he would 
be charged in court for assault and would surely be found 
guilty. In the case of the Prime Minister, however, the matter 
was settled by shelling out $700 or $800 to pay the dental bills 
of Bill Clennett. 
I am sure you remember this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Champlain has doubts, which I believe are 
justified, about the good faith of the government and of the 
head of that government, the Prime Minister and member for 
Shawinigan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He gave us more evidence of this when he welcomed Indonesian 
dictator Suharto. He forced RCMP officers to clean up the place 
by 4 p.m.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The place had to be cleared so that Mr. Suharto could leave with 
a good impression of his visit to Vancouver. The RCMP officers 
listened and came not with a small pepper shaker so he could 
sprinkle some pepper over his food, as the Prime Minister said 
so well, but with big gas cylinders that can reach much further. 
Excessive force was used against students who had the legitimate 
right to demonstrate in Canada against Mr. Suharto's lack of 
respect for civil rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister did not even respect these students that are 
our future leaders. 
This afternoon, during Oral Question Period, in response to a 
question from a Reform member, the Solicitor General said that 
he had personally decided against paying the students' legal 
fees so that they could be properly represented before the 
commission investigating the conduct of the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Henry VIII clause, which I call the Louis XIV 
clause, is all about: L'état, c'est moi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Drummond said the same thing a little while ago. 
The bill contains a Henry VIII clause, which essentially 
provides that the governor in council can change the law without 
parliamentary debate or democratic consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember what happened in Quebec in the early 70s in response 
to the FLQ's activities. The RCMP—and the Prime Minister was 
then a member of the Trudeau cabinet—was ordered to set fire to 
barns, to steal dynamite and to blame the FLQ for all this. They 
even broke into the offices of the Parti Quebecois, a democratic 
political party. 
RCMP officers were asked to break and enter some places. There 
were leaks inside the RCMP. There was the Keable Commission. 
RCMP officers were prosecuted. The same government did not fire 
the RCMP officers. Instead, they were promoted with a pay 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can see how important this Henry VIII clause is. We 
cannot give so much power to people who sometimes lose control 
and act irresponsibly. We saw what happened when Trudeau threw 
500 people in jail, including the late Pauline Julien. Nowadays, 
everybody is sorry about it, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They lost their head. There were a dozen of FLQ members and they 
threw 500 people in jail. The War Measures Act abolished freedom 
in Quebec. The way several Quebeckers were treated is awful, 
they were treated the same way and sometimes worse than the 
students. 
A student said that he had to spend 12 hours in jail without any 
charges being laid and that a RCMP officer had him sign a 
promise not to protest during the APEC summit. That is how 
dangerous the Henry VIII clause is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec passed two bills for the public 
corporations, the government, and the private corporations, and 
that legislation is similar but more complete. That was not done 
by the Parti Quebecois. It was done during the last months of 
the Robert Bourassa government and under the following 
government led by Daniel Johnson Jr., that passed a much more 
complete piece of legislation than Bill C-54 before us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 is full of assumptions, of words like maybe, we shall 
see, it could be. Let us take, for example, section 11(2): “If 
the Commissioner is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds 
to investigate a matter under this Part, the Commissioner may 
initiate a complaint—”. Consequently it is always subjective. The 
Commissioner is given a power that he does not have as well as 
leeway that he should not have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is full of holes. It undermines Quebec's legislation. 
This bill will fail miserably, both in the spirit and the letter 
of its application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to remind the House that the Bloc 
Quebecois will vote against this bill, of course, and that it 
regrets many things. For instance, we believe that the right to 
privacy, which is recognized explicitly in the 1983 personal 
information charter and should be applied to all public and 
private organisations, could be ignored by this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank you for your attention, and if there are any 
questions and comments, I will try to respond to them, of course. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague 
from Frontenac—Mégantic spoke eloquently of the flaws we see in 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We mentioned on several occasions that Quebec has its own act, 
which works well, it is efficient and truly protects consumers. 
For the benefit of the House and in keeping with my colleague's 
comments, I would like to read a few sections from the current 
Quebec act. This might inspire the House to make the necessary 
improvements to Bill C-54. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is part IV, section 27 of the Quebec Act respecting the 
protection of personal information in the private sector. 
Section 27 states: “Any business manager who has a file on 
someone must, when requested by the person concerned, confirm 
its existence and release to said individual any personal 
information it contains”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You and I, every member of the House and the public at large 
know that we have a file in many organizations. 
It may happen that the information on file is wrong, which might 
have an impact on our capacity to enjoy life; for instance a 
credit file might contain errors which might result in a person 
being denied or looked at in a funny way when applying for a 
credit card or a loan, without having a clue as to why or how to 
rectify the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This cannot happen in Quebec. In Quebec an individual can ask 
for confirmation of the file and ask the bank manager: “Where 
did you get the information that my credit is bad?” “I got it in 
such or such a place”, he will answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote section 28: “Besides the rights provided for in 
paragraph 40(1)of the Quebec Civil Code, the individual 
concerned may have any personal information concerning him or 
her erased if its gathering was not authorized by law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I go where the records are kept and realize some data have 
been included without my knowledge. I never authorized any 
company or body to disclose such data to the agency and I can 
ask that it be withdrawn without prejudice to other legal action 
that I might take to ensure that those who broke the law are 
adequately punished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 29, anyone who operates a business and keeps 
personal records on other individuals must take proper measures 
to ensure that they can exercise their rights under Quebec's 
Civil Code as well as under this act. Moreover, the person must 
inform the public where it may consult these records and how to 
do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague, the member for Frontenac—Mégantic, to 
tell me what he thinks about the wide discrepancy between the 
meagre protection proposed for Canadians and the concrete, solid 
and honest protection provided for Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that Bill 
C-54 is a timid bill. This is a very lukewarm bill that, I 
believe, only deals with the promotion and commerce of 
electronic products, and not with the privacy protection of our 
fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Portneuf has been interested in electronics for 
several years, since it was somewhat his previous profession in 
the private sector. We fully realize that this could hit us in 
the face. The government is stretching the elastic. It is 
already quite tight and could snap at any time and hit us in the 
face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House that in London, capital city of 
Great Britain, it was said the each citizen is filmed 51 times a 
week on average. With the technical means that we have today, 
this may be very useful. 
We can find robbers, prisoners on the lam, but just imagine 
being spied on as you go about your business 51 times a day, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in the House of Commons, we see cameras installed almost 
everywhere on the roofs of buildings. I think they are useful 
against terrorist acts. Our Prime Minister must be protected. 
Heaven forbid Canadian citizens should treat him the same way he 
treats his own people or individuals like Bill Clennett. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine how these laws are misused. With the Henry VIII clause 
that was described earlier as extremely negative, the minister 
responsible is given increased powers, terrible powers, a bit 
like the solicitor general who was telling us again, during oral 
question period: “I have decided—”. Who does he think he is? 
This afternoon, around 2.30 p.m., I heard him say that he 
decided that the students' fees for legal counsel would not be 
paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Henry VIII clause grants similar powers to a minister and if 
he loses his mind, he can have searches carried out, or things 
covered up. I remind the House that when the federal police, the 
RCMP, torches barns, steals dynamite, blows up trucks and steals 
member lists of a political party that is democratically 
recognised in this country, it means we have sunk very low. This 
reminds us of the way things worked under Hitler. This reminds 
us of the way things worked under the Communists when the motto 
was “All for one and one for all”. There was no respect for the 
individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a real threat to us all and I can assure the House that 
the Bloc Quebecois members will always rise in this House to 
condemn this. With the means available to us, and if the 
government is really determined to have Bill C-54 passed, we will 
try to propose the amendments required so that it is more like 
Quebec's legislation, which is much more comprehensive and 
complete and which primarily respects the individual.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question that my 
distinguished colleague from the government party is asking 
reflects exactly what my hon. friend and colleague from Portneuf 
was pointing out to me earlier this afternoon when he asked 
whether Bill C-54 was aimed more at promoting modern high 
technology to advance sales of electronic goods or at protecting 
personal information about every citizen of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that question is asked to me, I realize that, for the 
government party, the protection of personal information is not 
a priority in Bill C-54, and that, on a scale of ten, this 
concern would rate at one whereas the promotion and development 
of high technology would rate at nine. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to rise today to join the debate on Bill 
C-54.  The bill before us aims to support and promote electronic 
commerce by increasing Canadian confidence in online 
transactions, providing protection for personal information that 
is collected, adjusting the legal framework of the electronic 
environment, and providing an alternative means for the federal 
government to provide services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 is part of a larger overall strategy to make Canada an 
international leader in the growing realm of electronic commerce. 
I will talk about some of the contents of the bill and outline 
the reservations New Democrats have with Bill C-54. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will discuss the phenomenon of electronic commerce in the 
information age.  A variety of commentators from all sorts of 
disciplines have commented upon the increasingly important role 
that electronic commerce is playing in the lives of everyday 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chairman and CEO of Bell Canada, Mr. Jean Monty, told 
delegates at the Ottawa OECD conference last week that we are 
witnessing the birth of a new economy, a new economic order based 
on networks and chips.  The electronic transfer of information 
has changed the very way in which humans interact with each 
other.  For this reason it is a subject of great importance and 
we would be wise to consider carefully any decision we take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First it may be helpful to discuss the definition of electronic 
commerce.  If we are to adopt a broad understanding of the 
concept of electronic commerce, we will see that it includes two 
very different types of transactions.  One type which has proven 
quite successful involves the exchange of information through 
closed networks.  This would include systems such as those used 
by debit cards and credit cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other types of transfers are those conducted through open 
networks such as the Internet. 
This type lags far behind its closed network counterpart for 
numerous reasons which I will now examine.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one thinks about the on-line world, a certain minister 
comes to mind.  Just as the solicitor general has had some 
difficulty lately maintaining the security of his department's 
private information, so too does the Internet in ensuring the 
confidentiality of important matters. Canadians have demonstrated 
a lack of faith in the minister. This is similar to the 
reservations they have about entrusting their own personal 
information in cyberspace.  It is our job to address these 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet remains for many an intimidating world in which 
trade relationships are poorly developed and people cannot be 
certain of the ways in which confidential information is being 
handled. Businesses as well as consumers are often unsure as to 
exactly whom they are dealing with, whether payment measures are 
secure and what the legal frameworks for such transactions are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet for most Canadians remains a sort of wild west 
where law and order is poorly represented and people enter at 
their own risk.  Many parents are reluctant to establish Internet 
access because of well-founded fears that the on-line environment 
has become a haven for those who traffic in child pornography. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At home, we used to be connected up with the Internet, but I 
gave it up one day because I found some pictures on the screen, 
and I was very happy that my 10-year old son had not seen them. 
If my mother had seen them, I would have had trouble talking to 
her about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that pornography on the Internet is a serious 
problem. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses as well as consumers have been clamouring for 
confidence building measures on electronic commerce for quite 
some time.  Canadians do not want cyberspace to be lawless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One part of the bill which attempts to tackle people's 
reservations about trade on the information highway is the 
section on privacy rights.  The bill adopts a set of guidelines 
developed by the Canadian Standards Association for gathering, 
using and disclosing the personal information of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, the federal Privacy Act deals strictly with 
information that is collected by the public service.  Bill C-54 
goes farther than this.  After a period of three years the 
guidelines for the handling of personal information will apply to 
all commercial transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the bill would force companies to obtain the 
consent of Canadians in order to collect personal information. 
It would force them to only use the information for the purpose 
for which it is collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, people would be granted access to the 
information held about them and they would also have the right to 
make changes to it when there are inaccuracies. Bill C-54 
strengthens significantly the office of the privacy commissioner 
and allows Canadians a means of recourse against those who abuse 
confidential personal data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats support these provisions in principle and feel 
that they are long overdue.  With the rapid manner in which 
information can be transferred in today's world it would be 
reassuring to know that individuals do have some control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order that Canadians can feel confident enough to engage in 
electronic commerce, common guidelines for the handling of 
personal information are essential.  They would benefit business 
as well as give peace of mind to consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other prominent section of the bill that attempts to assuage 
the fears of Canadians is the discussion of security features 
such as secure electronic signatures which would be recognized by 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More noticeable however is the absence of any discussion of 
encryption technology.  At first glance this appears to be an 
adequate solution for addressing security concerns.  However, the 
way in which the government is going about this raises some 
serious concerns for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cryptography technology allows users to encode information and 
then pass it along the Internet. This can be used to encode all 
sorts of information such as credit card numbers, medical records 
and private correspondence. In itself this is very good thing.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government has adopted a completely hands off 
approach in the area of licensing encryption software.  The 
government has not demanded any sort of access mechanism that 
would allow it to intercept and decode such messages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fear that the government has forfeited any means whatsoever of 
policing the Internet.  For example, the privacy commissioner 
would have little power to actually see whether or not personal 
information is being mishandled and transferred illegally.  The 
privacy provisions in the bill seem then to be weakened by a 
hands off approach to cryptology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, law enforcement agencies might see their ability to thwart 
child pornography traffickers severely curtailed.  Similarly, 
without any sort of access mechanism, cryptology technology will 
possibly play into the hands of organized crime and perpetrators 
of corporate sabotage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that government will allow virtually any type of 
cryptology technology will serve only to increase the security 
fears of Canadians.  The thought that the RCMP and other police 
forces will be basically powerless to investigate Internet abuses 
is of great concern.  This is a violation of the peace and good 
government principle upon which this nation was formed.  It will 
do little to make Canadians feel secure. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must add that we are nevertheless in a country where people 
often find it difficult to feel secure.  We saw what happened in 
recent weeks, not only in Vancouver with the students who were 
attacked, probably under orders from the Prime Minister, but 
also the events in New Brunswick.  We saw what happened to the 
parents and the young students of the Saint-Sauveur school when 
they tried to keep their school open. Premier Frank McKenna had 
decided he was going to close schools. 
They sent in the RCMP.  They sent in the pepper spray.  They 
attacked not only the adults, but small children, students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also the events in Kent County in the past two weeks, 
where a man named Jackie Vautour went fishing for a pail of 
clams, although fishing season is closed.  He ended up with 
broken bones.  I do not understand how that can happen to 
someone just for going for a pail of clams.  This is a 65 year 
old man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He and his wife had been in court before for fishing 
clams in a national park out of season.  The charges were thrown 
out because, as you may or may not know, it is not clear whether 
Kouchibouguac national park is really a national park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time Mr. Vautour is caught the government drops the 
charges.  That is what they did the first time Mr. Vautour was 
caught fishing for a little pail of clams. 
They began proceedings, took him to court and were obliged to 
drop the charges, because they could not prove where the park 
boundaries lay. The gentleman went for another pail of clams. 
This time he had his shoulder and his arm broken.  In this case 
too, a complaint must be lodged with the RCMP commission so the 
matter will be investigated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These sorts of things are always the responsibility of someone 
higher up.  When the Saint-Sauveur families were attacked, it was 
clear who had set the gang on the students.  I have no doubt the 
same thing happened when Jackie Vautour was attacked by the 
RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is outrageous to think that they are capable of breaking limbs. 
Mr. Vautour did not have a gun or a knife, but he ended up with 
broken limbs. He and his wife, aged 65 and 64 respectively, 
ended up in jail because they took a bucket of clams, after park 
employees had told them they could continue to catch shells. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing happened to a man in 1969 because he did not want 
to leave his house when Kouchibouguac national park was 
established. They bulldozed his house. That is what they did to 
him. He stayed in the park. Had it not been for him, we would 
have ended up with nothing. In 1971, we left the park with 
$6,600. This was the money we had to move, to settle elsewhere. 
People in Kouchibouguac park did not get rich.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Vautour was smart. He said “I am not leaving. They put us in 
boats back in 1755, but I am not going in boats again”. This is 
what happened to Mr. Vautour. My father was told the same thing: 
“If you do not move, we will be close to your house and you will 
not get anything”. This is what they did, and Jackie had a large 
family. He stayed anyway and he kept fighting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that what he did was always right, but I do know 
that this is how the hate started. It started the day they hired 
someone with a bulldozer to destroy his house. We were not 
pagans in Kouchibouguac park. We were poor people living in the 
middle of nowhere, but we were not people who did not know what 
they were doing. We were not trash. 
There was no crime in Clairefontaine, Fontaine, Cap-Saint-Louis 
and the Kelly region. We were not bad people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those days, the current Prime Minister was the minister 
responsible for expropriation. It is funny how the people who 
were expropriated from the park re-elected him and made him the 
Prime Minister of the country. It is incredible how forgiving we 
Acadians can be. But he better not try his luck again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was 11 when we moved away. In our region, people did not have 
much formal education. But my father had work year round. We had 
a television and a telephone as well as an Eaton's catalogue we 
would order from once in a while. We were good folks and still 
are. The story does not end here. Mr. Vautour went to court to 
know why his shoulder and arm were busted and why he was thrown 
in jail. 
The judge did not even want to let him out for three months 
pending trial. Mr. Vautour was 65 and his wife, 64. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there any justice, any democracy in this country? The APEC 
Summit does not have the monopoly on lack of justice. It is the 
same all over the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic for me to have become a member of Parliament. I am 
sure there are ministers across the way wondering if I will ever 
stop pressing the Kouchibouguac national park issue. The fact is 
that we will keep asking questions and raising the matter until 
our questions on what happened have been answered. In 1969, 239 
families were treated unfairly and no commission of inquiry was 
established. The government does not want to look into what went 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as the issue remains unsettled, families will continue 
to live under extreme conditions within the Kouchibouguac park 
boundaries. We will carry on and we will not let them down. 
Coming back to Bill C-54. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 attempts also to establish the federal government as a 
responsible and model user of the Internet as a tool for 
delivering services.  With this in mind, many federal statutes 
were examined to see whether or not their references to means of 
collecting information were limited to paper.  The result was 
that nearly half seemed to indicate paper transactions as the 
only legal means of sharing information. Bill C-54 attempts to 
adjust or apply current laws so that there is an electronic 
alternative for transmitting information. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be interesting if Jackie Vautour could put the history 
of Kouchibouguac park on the Internet. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle this is a good proposition.  It would offer 
Canadians access to a new and faster means of communicating with 
government bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that by acting as a role model, it can 
stimulate a substantial increase in the use of this technology in 
all realms.  A quick glance at the current electronic commerce 
situation though reveals that Canadians are far from embracing 
the Internet. In many cases this is because they simply cannot 
afford to. Even if we assumed that about 30% of Canadians have 
some sort of access to the Internet, and this may just be because 
they have a connected computer at their school, we must 
acknowledge that the other three-quarters of the country are in 
the dark.

schools. My son is in grade 7 and I am sure he does not have 
access to the program. A lot of young people and families today 
may not be extremely poor, but they certainly cannot afford to 
have a computer at home. We must be careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few moments ago, a government member seemed proud to say that 
he could change plane tickets and that it would cost only a few 
dollars. But how many jobs will be lost? Is anybody trying to 
maintain some kind of balance in all that? It is all well to say 
that we are going to save money. 
Hurrah! the Internet is here and we will save money, but what is 
the real cost in terms of lost jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I will say that not everybody is connected and we 
have to recognize that as a fact. It is a problem for those 
people, and it is not just a matter of not having a computer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome this opportunity after the member's remarks to 
pose a question to her.  It arises out of my earlier remarks in 
which I observed that the bill is deficient insofar as it does 
not clearly and explicitly explain what the parameters are in 
sensitive personal information when it comes to fundraising for 
donor lists for non-profit organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, in another aspect it also is very deficient in that if 
a person knows that their name is held as a result of donating to 
some charity or another and they go to that direct marketing firm 
that has their name on that list and ask that direct marketing 
firm how many other lists their name has been distributed to, how 
many organizations it is out to, according to the legislation as 
I see it, because of commercial proprietary reasons that direct 
marketing firm can withhold that personal information about how a 
person's name is being used and who it has been given to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a list from an organization in the United States that has 
this kind of information.  It gets the names of these individuals 
because these individual organizations approach the organization 
to do direct mail fundraising in Canada for them.  It has the 
list and once it has done direct mail fundraising for a 
particular organization, it offers that list of names to other 
organizations for hire or for rent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Canadian Abortion Rights League is a group of 
7,500 women. We can get their names, as well as the International 
Planned Parenthood Federation. So someone who is perhaps very 
virulently anti-abortion can get the information of all those 
individuals who directly support abortion with their money.  I 
submit that is a very dangerous thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned also that this list contains 73,000 Canadian Jewish 
donors.  I submit to the member that this is a highly dangerous 
thing because organizations that may be engaged in anti-Semitic 
activities can therefore access this information one way or 
another, yet the legislation does not prevent this information 
from being given out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I as an MP have tried in the past to get information from 
my own government about the funding of women's programs or 
anti-poverty programs, the names of the individuals involved have 
often been withheld in this information.  I have not even been 
able to get them under access to information on the grounds that 
those who seek government grants, either poverty groups, women's 
groups or other minority groups, need the protection of the 
government that has their personal information sought as grants. 
It is very hard to get this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet on this list to this direct marketer in the United States, 
this for profit fundraiser, we find the National Action Committee 
on the Status of Women. There are 5,000 names there.  Immediately 
underneath it is the National Anti-Poverty Organization.  There 
are 17,000 names there.  The National Association of Women and 
the Law, 1,300 names.  Under that we have the National Gay and 
Lesbian Rights Supporters.  These are all actually in 
alphabetical order.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to the member opposite that there is something 
dreadfully wrong when an MP cannot get the basic information of 
who these people are who support these organizations.  I am not 
saying that we should but we as MPs cannot get that information 
from the government even though the government is funding these 
organizations.  Yet for mere money we can go to the United States 
and get the names of every one of these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this something that is acceptable to the hon. member?  Does 
she not think that these organizations should not be giving their 
donor name lists to an American organization and should we 
strengthen Bill C-54 in such a way as to make this type of thing 
not occur? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to agree with my 
Liberal colleague for once.  It does not often happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has mentioned incidents that are very alarming and 
not only in those cases, but there is so much information on the 
Internet.  It is pretty well out of control and nobody has really 
admitted it.   We cannot turn on the Internet without seeing 
three or four people in positions that I still cannot figure out 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a computer.  We have children.  It is supposed to be 
friendly to everybody.  I have my limits on friendliness.  It 
goes on and on.  There is a need to get control of what is 
happening on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we do not want to censor everything where we are all 
boxed in and we do not know what is happening on the outside. 
That is not what I am talking about.  Most of us in this country 
have common sense.  Sometimes it is unfortunate that common sense 
does not always win.  There are so many other factors that common 
sense is put off.  We say this is what we have to do although we 
know it is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to agree with my colleague.  There is a need to 
strengthen it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had a speech 
prepared for today on Bill C-43, but strong defender of the right 
to privacy that I am, I could not help but dive into this 
debate, particularly since there are only a few minutes left and 
I would not have had the time to finish my speech on Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to what all my colleagues have said.  It is true 
that I am a defender of the right to privacy.  It is not an easy 
job.  In my union days, I have seen police officers entering 
union premises.  It is a bit like having someone break into your 
home.  For me, the right to privacy is absolutely essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also looked at the difference between the provincial and 
the federal legislation.  I will read the title of the two acts, 
because this strikes me as important in this debate.  What does 
the provincial legislation say?  Its title is an Act respecting 
the protection of personal information in the private sector, 
whereas the title of the federal legislation is an Act to 
support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal 
information that is collected, used or disclosed in certain 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The emphasis of the federal bill can be seen.  The economy comes 
first, before the protection of privacy, rather than the 
opposite as in Quebec.  This is the main reason I believe the 
federal bill we have before us at this time needs to take its 
inspiration from the provincial legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing how the Liberal Party operates, what is more important: 
protecting privacy or protecting the economy, protecting human 
rights or protecting the economy? 
So far, I find the Liberal newsletter is very weak on the 
protecting of protecting human rights before the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a bill like the one we have here, why would the federal 
government now be protecting privacy rights over economic 
rights?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has some serious weaknesses, in my opinion.  Some of 
them have been pointed out.  There is the whole issue of the 
schedule.  The schedule contains most of the substance.  It 
strikes me as odd that it is necessary to refer to the schedule 
rather than the bill proper for questions of interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lawyers will have a field day with it, and not just because of 
this business of the schedule.  The bill itself is full of 
conditions.  Imagine someone who wants to defend his right to 
privacy as opposed to an economic right, and who tells the court 
that he thinks his privacy has been violated. 
Everything is in the conditional, leaving the citizen no choice 
but to hire a lawyer, while we know what the federal government 
will do if it wants to defend its legislation.  It has the best 
lawyers.  It has a justice department chock full of lawyers, and 
never-ending coffers to dip into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a lot of questions are now being asked about the 
need to drag these issues through the courts, and this is yet 
another example.  The public is being told that all it has to 
do, if it does not agree with the interpretation of the 
legislation, is take the government to court.  This is typical 
of this government.   I think that the average citizen is at a 
disadvantage, because he faces economic limitations that the 
government does not have to think about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to mention the famous Henry VIII clause.  We 
know that Henry VIII proceeded by decree when calling for the 
death of his opponents. 
It was as simple as that. Fortunately, the Henry VIII clause no 
longer exists and the Prime Minister cannot avail himself of it. 
Otherwise, there might be 45 victims on this side of the House. 
I have a feeling that we would be hit with a royal order in no 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill gives the governor in council full discretion to amend 
the regulations. But who can amend regulations? On whose 
recommendation, under whose pressure will the governor in 
council amend a bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dealing with this bill, we have to consider the big lobbying 
firms. Who can afford to hire big lobbying firms today besides 
major Canadian corporations, big banks? They have a lot of 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will outweigh everything else when the time comes to decide 
whether regulations should be amended for the governor in 
council, in other words cabinet? What will prevail? 
Will it be the opinion of consumers?  Will it be the opinion of 
the organizations that defend the right to privacy, or rather 
will it be those with economic clout?  Which is the biggest 
backer of political parties? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no problems with this. Our funding comes from the grass 
roots.  But who funds the Liberal government?  The major 
corporations: Bombardier, Bell Canada, the Royal and 
Toronto-Dominion banks, and the like.  Those are the ones with 
the big money.  They are the ones backing the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Pierre Corbeil knows who it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> The hon. member for Frontenac—Mégantic says 
that Pierre Corbeil knows who is behind the Liberal Party 
funding.  It is not citizens' organizations, and not the 
consumer protection organizations, for they have no money. 
Their strength lies in collective effort and consolidation 
against a government which accepts financing from all these big 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To whom do you think the governor in council will listen?  Who 
do you think the cabinet will listen to?  Not the organizations. 
Not the defenders of the right to privacy.  The Governor in 
Council will listen to those who are behind the funding.  They 
will say to each other: “We will change the regulations because 
the people funding us don't like the way things are at present, 
either the little details or the major points.  So we will 
change all that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this bill is not right, and I join with my 
colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois in saying that I will be 
pleased to vote against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member for 
Saint-Jean will have 13 minutes the next time we debate this 
bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
too long now, the Minister for International Trade has been 
pathetically slow to defend asbestos internationally.  He seems 
to have nodded off completely on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof is that his government waited 30 months before finally 
deciding to turn to the WTO to challenge France's unjustified 
ban on asbestos. 
The minister clearly has a double standard when it comes to 
defending Canadian companies on the world market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can he explain the speed with which he rushed to the defence 
of the Toronto-based Sherritt company, when the United States 
passed the Helms-Burton legislation?  Why, at the same time, was 
he so timid and slow in defending the interests of asbestos 
workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hold the Minister for International Trade, the Prime Minister 
and Canada's ambassador to France, Jacques Roy, responsible for 
the negative impact of France's ban on chrysotile asbestos and 
the resultant domino effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Asbestos sales have been dropping for several months, leading to 
the closing of the BC mine and increasingly frequent sporadic 
closings in two other mines, Lac d'Amiante and Bell, in Thetford 
Mines.  In the meantime, the minister just throws up his hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this government not taking the necessary action to 
promote chrysotile asbestos, a product unique in the world, 
effectively?  Why is it not ordering an exhaustive study of the 
environmental risks of the products replacing asbestos?  Why is 
it not also ordering a study of the poor performance of these 
replacement products? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the minister took vigorous and speedy action in the 
Sherritt case, in the case of durum and in the case of Pacific 
salmon, but when it comes to asbestos, the response has been 
limited to telephone conferences organized by Ambassador Roy or 
small evening receptions where a personal friend of Canada's 
Prime Minister has presented his French counterpart with a piece 
of asbestos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the asbestos region needs is a government that defends its 
interests actively on the international scene.  This government 
does not even come close. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask the member opposite 
to be a little more cautious when making allegations which may 
seem good to get media coverage, but which are not based on 
reality and concrete facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, in co-operation with the Quebec 
government, the industry, unions and local communities is 
striving to maintain access to foreign markets for chrysotile 
products. While some may claim nothing has been done, we should 
take a look at the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1997, the Government of Canada organized, in 
co-operation with the Quebec government, an international 
conference on the safe and responsible use of chrysotile fibers. 
Some 300 delegates from 45 countries attended the event. 
In March, April and May 1998, the Government of Canada organized 
visits for Belgian, British and Moroccan journalists, who toured 
Canada's asbestos industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have never missed an opportunity to make representations at 
the highest levels, whether in the United Kingdom, France, the 
European Union, or elsewhere in the world. The Government of 
Canada has always indicated that it was fully prepared to take 
the issue to the WTO, at the appropriate time. We would have 
preferred to settle this dispute on a bilateral basis. 
Since this was not possible, we took the next step, which is to 
ask for the setting up of a WTO panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you can see, Mr. Speaker, and as my colleague can also see, 
this is simply a matter of good faith. The Government of Canada 
and its partners are working together in a co-ordinated fashion 
on all fronts, and they intend to continue to do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
