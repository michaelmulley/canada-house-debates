	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in the House today to pay tribute to my constituent 
John Pahapill. Mr. Pahapill recently returned from a mission 
overseas with the Canadian executives service organization.Mr. Pahapill was in Estonia advising the government's ministry of 
justice on developing an efficient work program to rehabilitate 
prisoners.
<P>
	CESO volunteers are professional men and women, usually 
retired, who share their wealth of knowledge and experience to aid 
businesses and organizations in developing countries, emerging 
market economies and Canadian aboriginal communities.
<P>
	CESO is supported by CIDA, the Department of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development and hundreds of Canadian corporations 
and individuals.
<P>
	We applaud the volunteer work that Mr. Pahapill and the CESO 
organization are doing in eastern Europe to help those economies 
make the transition from the old Soviet state run system to a freer 
market system. Bravo, John.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 1997 
marks the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine in Ireland. 
Thousands of Irish men and women fled their country only to be 
decimated by cholera and typhus  epidemics at the Grosse-Île 
quarantine station, which is located in the riding of 
Bellechasse-Etchemins-Montmagny-L'Islet.
<P>
	Grosse-Île will be the site of a number of major events this year 
to commemorate the sad fate of those men and women. The 
Corporation de la Grosse-Île, inspired by its chairman, Dr. 
Jean-Marie Dionne, has been working for more than 15 years to 
remind the general public that the people of the South Shore 
responded with hospitality, and a spirit of brotherhood, to the 
struggling new arrivals who had fled the famine in their homeland.
<P>
	I invite the people of Canada, and elsewhere, to put Grosse-Île at 
the top of their list of places to visit during 1997, and in the years to 
come.
<P>
	This summer, special commemorations will also be held in the 
city of Montmagny, and the parishes of Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, 
L'Islet, Berthier-sur-Mer and Saint-Édouard-de-Frampton.
<P>
	Come one, come all, the welcome mat is out for you.

	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of Mary Mercier and 16,000 other Canadians, I 
am protesting the use of the FAMEX survey by Statistics Canada. 
The intrusive content and threatening manner of the survey is 
objectionable to Canadians and violates our fundamental sense of 
fairness of what governments should do.
<P>
	This survey certainly is unaccountable bureaucracy gone wrong. 
Such detailed information about one's personal income tax form, 
how much they spend on toilet paper in a whole year or how much 
interest they accumulate on their credit cards per year is of no 
business to a government collector.
<P>
	Governments should not be threatening people with legal 
penalties for non co-operation to fill out a three hour long survey 
when the private sector can collect for itself what it needs from 
volunteers and then pay them for it.
<P>
	Criminal legal sanctions of government should not be used to 
enable private market economy work.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister of immigration recently announced changes to Canada's 
immigration policies, but unfortunately the Liberals have left 
untouched those policies most in need of change.
<P>
	They have left a head tax on immigrants in place, a regressive 
tax that penalizes immigrants with no regard to their financial 
resources, inflicting needless hardship on new Canadians and their 
families.
<P>
	The Liberals have also left in place refugee policies that require 
some legitimate refugees to return to countries from which they are 
fleeing in order to obtain documents. These policies have 
threatened the lives of refugees from such countries as Iran, which 
has an atrocious record on human rights.
<P>

policies of this Liberal government.

	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the issue of section 745, the faint hope clause, should be 
dealt with without trying to capitalize politically on the misfortune 
of the families of victims. Section 745 needs constructive 
discussion.
<P>
	In my opinion section 745 should be eliminated and discretion 
returned to the sentencing judges. This would eliminate injustices 
and would allow judges leeway in sentencing. A judge could rule 
that an Olson or a Bernardo would never be paroled and they would 
never darken the door of the parole board, not even after 25 years. 
Someone who has committed murder under extenuating 
circumstances could be ordered eligible for parole in a much 
shorter time.
<P>
	Let us eliminate section 745, return discretion to our judges and 
return to making good laws, rather than politically capitalizing on 
the misfortunes of victims' families.

recipients of the Prime Minister's award for teaching excellence in 
science, technology and mathematics.
<P>
	Emanuel Sylvester, a teacher at Jameswood school, is dedicated 
to preparing his students for the future. He provides extra help for 
his students through a homework club and is constantly looking for 
new techniques for teaching science.
<P>
	Judith Lawrence teaches math at Phoenix school in Headingly, 
Manitoba. She took on the challenge of not only introducing the 
province's new math curriculum but conducted special math nights 
for family members.
<P>
	A lack of basic literacy and numeracy is a problem which holds 
back thousands and thousands of Canadians. Our colleague, 
Senator Joyce Fairbairn, Minister with special responsibility for 
Literacy, is working closely with provincial, corporate and

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, in response to pressure from Quebec's Minister 
of Public Security, Quebec City area mayors, police forces and 
official opposition members, the Minister of Justice finally 
realized that urgent action was required with respect to the biker 
war. The minister agreed to meet with stakeholders from the 
Quebec City area who are grappling with the war between the Rock 
Machine and the Hell's Angels.
<P>
	In his meeting in Quebec City tomorrow with area mayors and 
the provincial Minister of Public Security, what concrete proposals 
does the minister intend to put forward?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this is not the first time the 
Government of Canada has expressed its views and shown an 
interest in this situation.
<P>
	We have already met with police forces from Montreal and 
elsewhere to discuss possible amendments to the Criminal Code in 
order to resolve this matter.
<P>
	But, as I said yesterday, I intend to meet with Mr. Perreault and 
others tomorrow to discuss all the possibilities and strategies open 
to the Government of Canada in order to work with the 
Government of Quebec, with municipal governments and with 
police forces in order to deal with this difficult situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course there is interest, I would hope so, but interest is 
not enough. I do not imagine the minister is going to Quebec City 
to put on a show for the media. He is going there to intervene, at 
least I would hope so.
<P>
	I ask him if, when he is in Quebec City tomorrow, he intends to 
propose exceptional measures to resolve this exceptional situation, 
as area mayors and the Quebec Minister of Public Security are 
requesting him to do.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, because of the wording of the hon. 
member's question, I must repeat that we have already taken action 
as a government and passed concrete and effective measures to 
improve the Criminal Code as it relates to organized crime. For 
example, in Bill C-17 we proposed and are now adopting valid 
measures in this regard.
<P>
	Once again, as I said, at the meeting we will be holding withMr. Perreault in Quebec City tomorrow morning I intend to discuss 
and examine with him and other individuals involved all the 
approaches open.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the means decided on to date, the amendments made so 
far, are not enough. The police do not have all the tools they need to 
go after biker gangs.
<P>
	Quebec City area mayors and the Quebec Minister of Public 
Security have certainly pointed out to him that more substantial 
amendments to the Criminal Code are required. What does the 
Minister of Justice intend to reply to Mr. Perreault, who is calling 
for urgent amendments to the Criminal Code to deal with the Hell's 
Angels and the Rock Machine?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Mr. Perreault also said there was 
no magic or simple solution, such as an anti-gang law.
<P>
	We must work together, in good faith, setting aside partisan 
politics. We must work together constructively in the search for 
solutions. Of course, police forces want tools to help them in their 
work.
<P>
	But as I said, we have already taken action, and if it is possible to 
identify other approaches, I am prepared to take action again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think the minister understands the reality and the 
great urgency involved, and particularly the fact that there are 
major faults in his system.
<P>
	Need we remind the minister that we again had proof of this 
yesterday, when a certain Daniel Nault, a Hell's Angels 
sympathizer, was acquitted, thanks to the Criminal Code the 
minister refuses to amend, although he had been arrested with a 
working bomb in the trunk of his car.
<P>
	I am asking the Minister of Justice whether he does not 
acknowledge that this is striking proof that the Criminal Code as it 
stands is not strong enough to stop the motorcycle gang wars?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I express my disappointment 
at the tone and the approach taken by the Bloc Quebecois in 
relation to a matter which should engage our serious and 
non-partisan attention.
<P>
	There are people in communities in Quebec, in Ontario and 
across the country who are worried about their personal safety by 
reason of organized crime, motorcycle gangs and bombs exploding 
in the streets. In that atmosphere the answer is not to exchange 
partisan barbs in some political exchange. Rather the approach  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9214"> 9214 </A></B>
<P>
should be to work constructively to see what can be done to 
improve the situation, and that is what I intend to do tomorrow 
morning in Quebec City.
<P>
	The fact that these crimes are being committed may have 
something to do with the need for improvements in the criminal 
law. It also has something to do with the ability of the police to 
work in a co-ordinated fashion with the municipal and provincial 
governments, using powers within their jurisdictions, with the 
allocations of resources by municipal and provincial governments.
<P>
	The member should not pretend that this difficult situation will 
be resolved simply by changing words in the federal statute.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder what tone I am supposed to take in addressing 
this House. Since yesterday, because no action was taken, there 
have been two more deaths in a bomb explosion in Quebec. I think 
the minister needs to wake up and smell the coffee, and do 
something as soon as possible.
<P>
	He also needs to keep in mind that there are at least 15 biker 
clubhouses in Quebec, 15 fortresses, and the gangs continue to 
wreak havoc.
<P>
	The Minister is going to Quebec City, and not to see the sights. 
The mayors are waiting for an answer to their questions. In order to 
settle the problem of these fortified biker clubhouses once and for 
all, and to do away with all the nasty business they are involved in, 
is the minister prepared-and this is a serious matter-to announce 
tomorrow to Minister Perreault and all the mayors who are waiting 
for some action, that, as soon as possible, he will propose to the 
Canadian Parliament legislation that will ban motorcycle gangs 
once and for all?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

on concern. The members on this side of the House, the members 
of the government caucus, are just as concerned about the safety of 
communities in the country as are the hon. member and his 
colleagues.
<P>
	If the hon. member thinks that the bombings taking place are 
going to be stopped because we change words in the Criminal Code 
of Canada, he is sadly deluded. What will make the difference is 
good, solid, co-ordinated police work with sufficient resources and 
municipal, provincial and federal governments working together 
constructively to do the job.
<P>
	That is not achieved with narrow partisan political speeches. 
That is not achieved by pointing fingers and becoming flushed. 
That is achieved with good, solid, hard work, and that is exactly 
what the government is going to do.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the last two federal elections the leader of the federal 
party that ended up forming the government campaigned on the 
promise of jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	When Mr. Mulroney left office, the total number of unemployed 
was 1.5 million and the four years this government has been in 
office there are still 1.5 million unemployed.
<P>
	My question for the Prime Minister is this. Why is his 
government's job creation record no better than Brian Mulroney's? 
Why has the Prime Minister, like Mulroney, failed to deliver on 
jobs, jobs, jobs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the last four years of the Mulroney administration about 
150,000 new jobs were created. In less than four years 725,000 new 
jobs have been created in the economy. That is because we have 
managed the situation.
<P>
	I know that the member is a former voter for Mulroney before he 
had the Reform Party obviously, unless he voted Liberal. That 
would be a big surprise but I am waiting for that judgment.
<P>
	We have restored the finances of the nation. The low interest 
rates of today are the best in 35 years. People are using them 
because the housing market is increasing very quickly. People are 
buying cars and so on. However, we had to cure the mess that had 
been created by the Conservatives in the previous nine years first. 
Now the country is in much better shape and more than 725,000 
jobs have been created.
<P>
	As everybody knows, we will continue working because we are 
always preoccupied that whenever somebody wants to work we 
want to make sure that they can find a job. It is not easy but our 
record is much better than that of the Conservative Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> The bottom 
line is, Mr. Speaker, 1.5 million unemployed when Mulroney left 
office, 1.5 million unemployed today.
<P>
	The Prime Minister just does not get it. Taxes, taxes, taxes are 
what are killing jobs, jobs, jobs. Seventy-one tax increases by the 
federal Tories, 37 tax increases by this government. The 
government now collects more taxes than any other government in 
Canadian history, including wartime. And there is a connection 
between those high levels of taxation and the record of 
unemployment, the worst record of unemployment since the 
depression.
<P>
	Instead of trying to justify high unemployment, exactly like 
Brian Mulroney used to stand in this House and do, why does the

<B><A NAME="9215"> 9215 </A></B>
<P>
Prime Minister not actually do something  for the 1.5 million 
unemployed and start by lowering taxes?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have done a lot to create jobs. Look at the record, 
725,000 jobs have been created.
<P>
	More than that, 825,000 jobs have been created but both the 
federal and the provincial public sectors had to reduce the number 
of jobs by 100,000 to put the finances of the federal government 
and the provinces in good order.
<P>
	We are doing better than any other nation of the G-7 at this 
moment. We have created more jobs than Germany, France, Italy 
and Great Britain together. However, it is not enough. We will be 
working on that.
<P>
	I do not think the recipe proposed by the Reform Party is being 
taken very seriously because we have to finish the job of reducing 
the deficit and not try to buy votes with tax cuts for the rich like the 
Conservative Party and the Reform Party want to do.

Speaker, Brian Mulroney always had an explanation for his dismal 
job record. Our interest rate was lower than Liechtenstein's, our 
growth rate is better than Antarctica, we have a better job record 
than somebody in the G-7.
<P>
	What do we hear from this Prime Minister? Exactly the same 
thing. Our job record is better than somebody in the G-7. But there 
are still 1.5 million unemployed, two or three million under 
employed and one out of four workers afraid of losing their jobs.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	Instead of trying to justify high unemployment records exactly 
like Mulroney, why will the Prime Minister not do something 
different and start by addressing the high tax levels in the country?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> We have had growth and 
therefore we have more revenue. He does not know the difference 
between the level of taxation and the level of revenue. We have not 
increased taxes at all. Oh yes, I am sorry, we have taxed the banks 
by $200 million more.
<P>
	We have plugged loopholes for some people who were not 
paying their fair share in the insurance business because they were 
abusing the system. But we have not increased taxes. We have a 
good, solid administration. Revenues have increased substantially. 
Because we had good growth and low inflation, 725,000 new 
taxpayers are now working who were not working when we formed 
the government.

<P>
	Since the government came to office personal income taxes have 
gone up 15 per cent relative to the size of the economy. That 
contradicts what the Prime Minister just  said. That means more

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the government took office, revenues as a percentage of the 
economy were substantially higher than they are now. The 
conclusion of that is very clear, our take as a percentage of the 
economy has come down.
<P>
	There are areas where we have absolutely changed the tax act. 
Tariffs are down substantially. Close to $600 million is being put 
back into the hands of Canadians. On the other hand, and again if I 
could quote the Prime Minister: ``Yes, there are areas where we 
have increased taxes,'' areas where the hon. member has objected 
to increasing taxes.

as a percentage of the economy by 15 per cent.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance deny that the government has 
raised personal income taxes so they have gone up 15 per cent 
relative to the size of the economy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it

quite possible that more people are paying taxes.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for several months now, the Minister of Finance has 
stubbornly refused to compensate Quebec for harmonizing the 
GST, although according to the calculations done by Quebec's 
Minister of Finance Quebec is entitled to $2 billion in 
compensation for having harmonized its sales tax. This estimate, it 
goes without saying, is very different from the one arrived at by the 
Minister of Finance, and that is why it is becoming increasingly 
clear that the solution to this problem will be political rather than 
bureaucratic in nature.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance realize that his compensation 
formula, the McKenna formula, that compensates a province if, 
and only if, it is losing more than 5 per cent of its revenues, is an 
arbitrary formula and that Quebec is actually entitled to demand 
compensation similar to that received by the three maritime 
provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the member must know that the formula by which only those 
provinces having lost more than 5 per cent of their revenues are 
compensated is perfectly normal. Five per cent includes normal 
fluctuations in a province's revenue from a tax source, in this case 
the sales tax.
<P>
	The reality is that Quebec has not lost more than 5 per cent. 
Furthermore, if we look at the figures for the years since 1990, 
Quebec has made money by harmonizing and there is no 
compensation for a province that has not lost money. Nor is there 
any compensation for Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since the minister wants to talk about reality, here it is: 
there was a 20 per cent drop in QST revenues following 
harmonization in Quebec. Because of harmonization, we have had 
to compensate by hiking the income tax rate of SMBs by 66 per 
cent and payroll taxes by 23 per cent. That is reality.
<P>
	It is so real that the premiers of British Columbia, Alberta and 
Ontario are demanding that the federal government give in to 
Quebec's arguments and pay $2 billion in compensation for the 
Government of Quebec's losses. If that is not a consensus, we 
would like to know what the Minister of Finance is waiting for. 
These three provinces represent 85 per cent of the population.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	I put my question to him. What is he waiting for to give Quebec 
what it is owed in all fairness for harmonizing the GST, because 
equity and only equity is what this is all about?

<HR>
<B><A NAME="9217"> 9217 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, it is very clear that Quebec is not entitled to 
compensation because Quebec has not lost any money.
<P>
	I must point out that Quebec's former Minister of Finance 
himself, Mr. Bourbeau, indicated very clearly that Quebec did not 
deserve to be paid in this case because it had not lost any money.
<P>
	That having been said, Mr. Bourbeau also pointed out that in 
other areas, such as technology and partnership for example, 
Quebec has received more than 60 to 70 per cent of all money, that 
Quebec, with 25 per cent of the population, receives 31 per cent of 
transfer payments, and more than 45 per cent of equalization 
payments.
<P>

to the provinces, Quebec is receiving its fair share.

the government's role in manipulating nicotine levels in cigarettes 
is plain. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada funds the scientists and 
the tobacco companies tell them what to do.
<P>
	Did the health minister know this was going on and why did he 
not stop it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the premise the 
hon. member has brought forward is totally false.
<P>
	Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is in harmony with Health 
Canada in our reduction of nicotine in tobacco products. There is 
no question we have funded a tremendous amount of money to help 
farmers leave the industry. The majority of our spending goes to 
give farmers an exit from the tobacco industry.
<P>
	When we look at it, we have done what we can to make sure the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, they are treating 
the industry reasonably well, indeed. On March 13, 1996 the chair

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Lines crossed with U.S. and Canadian varieties will continue with emphasis on

	Did the health minister know this was going on and why did he 
not stop it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe it is 
very important to realize that nicotine quantities in tobacco 
products are controlled  internationally and that the industry itself 
has standards. The standard for nicotine in a tobacco plant is 2.5 
per cent to 3 per cent. All products sold commercially in this 
country have to abide by between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent.
<P>

plants to make certain that the industry standard is maintained and

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In Quebec, to defray the cost of harmonizing the QST, as my 
colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot pointed out, the tax rate 
on the profits of small and medium size businesses increased by66 per cent, and the contribution to the health services funds and 
the capital tax have both increased by 23 per cent. In the maritimes, 
however, there is no need for an increase, because of the $1 billion 
that Ottawa paid out. Quebec therefore is being deprived unfairly 
of its sole tax advantage compared with these three provinces and 
is being penalized for its earlier tax choices, which are not those of 
the maritimes.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance put a stop to the unfair competition 
from maritime businesses by giving Quebec the $2 billion that 
would have cost a maritime-style harmonization?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the members of the Bloc can keep asking the same question; the 
answer will not change. I have heard all I can stand.
<P>
	Quebec has lost no money. It has lost no more than the five per 
cent. With the other programs, the transfers of technology and 
partnerships, the equalization payments, the transfers to help the 
aeronautical and pharmaceutical industries in Montreal, Quebec 
has received a lot from the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	If Quebec deserved money for harmonizing the GST, it would 
have been given some. Unfortunately, for Quebec, it did not lose 
any money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the premiers of the three maritime provinces are 
advertising in <I>Les Affaires</I> and the <I>Globe and Mail</I> the advantages 
of harmonizing the GST, which are greater for these provinces than 
for Quebec, simply because they have not had to pay the costs of 
harmonization. No wonder.

Mr. Speaker, I speak now as a Quebecer. I think it is very dangerous

regions help each other and that the federal government is always

<P>
	On this the 10th anniversary of the release of the Deschenes 
commission report on war criminals in Canada, will the minister 
inform the House about the status of his department's efforts to 
bring to justice suspected Nazi war criminals who have sought to 
avoid persecution for their acts and who obviously believe that 
Canada is a safe haven?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am among those who believe that 
after the second world war too many governments did too little for 
too long to deal with the presence of alleged war criminals in 
Canada. What I can do today is provide an accounting of the efforts 
made by the government since it took office in late 1993.
<P>
	Immediately after taking office we intensified efforts to prepare 
for prosecution those cases we felt were appropriate for criminal 
proceedings. In 1994 a Supreme Court of Canada judgment in the 
case of Finta made criminal prosecution a very remote prospect and 
very difficult practically.
<P>
	As a result, in January 1995 the then Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and I announced that we would commence 12 cases 
within the following three years, civil proceedings asking the court 
to denaturalize and deport those against whom we would allege that 
there was a lack of candour when they applied for entry  into this 
country and those against whom we would allege there was 
evidence of complicity in war crimes during the second world war.
<P>
	We will do better than the 12 over three years. By the end of this 
month we will have commenced all 12 of those cases. That is not to 
say we have done enough because we have not. We will continue to 
work on other cases where there is evidence to justify proceedings.
<P>
	The government will continue to work because there is no statute 
of limitations on the moral imperative to act where there is 
evidence that there are such people among us.
<P>
	One last thing, if I may, there are those in this country with 
information to assist us. I urge them to go to the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police and provide that evidence so we can act on it.

	Over the past 50 years successive Liberal and Tory governments

Why?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

question other than the RCMP. I can answer for the Department of 
Justice.
<P>
	In the period since we took office the Department of Justice has 
proceeded with cases where there is evidence to justify initiating 
proceedings. As I have just told the hon. member for Scarborough, 
we will continue in those efforts. The government believes as a 
matter of moral imperative that we must act where there is 
evidence to justify it.
<P>
	As I also said very hurriedly a few moments ago, if there are 
those, whomever they may be, who have evidence that is relevant 
to this matter I urge them to turn that evidence over to the RCMP so 
that it can be evaluated and acted upon.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand there are over 1,000 names of 
suspected Nazi war criminals living in Canada. I also understand 
that the Canadian Jewish Congress has provided over 220 names to 
the RCMP and it has not responded. The department of 
immigration also has a list of over 200 suspected modern day war 
criminals.
<P>
	What action will the government take beyond the 12 it is taking 
through civil proceedings to ensure that more war criminals are 
deported? One Nazi war criminal in the past 50 years has been

is evidence to justify action.
<P>
	Before the hon. member becomes misled by claims of thousands 
of cases where action should be taken, I want her to bear in mind 
that the Deschenes commission, the 10th anniversary of which we 
are marking today as the member for Ontario said, identified far 
fewer cases. It identified about 29 or 30 priority cases where there 
was urgent evidence that action should be taken immediately.
<P>
	It is from that list of cases that we have taken the ones on which 
we have acted immediately. We are not stopping at 12. There is no 
magic in that number. We will continue to prepare and proceed in 
cases where we believe there is evidence to justify it.
<P>
	We do not have all the evidence from those who claim to have it 
in hand. I urge anybody who has evidence to give it to the RCMP so 
it can be evaluated and where appropriate acted upon.

virtually accomplished nothing that reflects the wishes of 
Canadians, like lowering the age or publishing names.

pleasant meeting I had with the hon. member and his colleague. I 
have a vivid recollection of the force with which he expressed his 
position.
<P>
	Among other things he urged the government to change the 
Young Offenders Act to deal more effectively with violent 
criminals, particularly those aged 16 and 17. He urged the 
government to introduce stronger penalties for the most serious 
crimes of violence. He urged us to do something about safety in 
schools.
<P>
	In June 1994, following my meeting with the hon. member, I 
introduced Bill C-37 which was subsequently adopted and 
proclaimed in force. Among other things that legislation doubled 
the maximum for first degree murder in youth court; provided for 
the transfer of 16 and 17 year olds charged with the most serious 
crimes of violence, except where they could satisfy the onus; and 
provided for the free sharing of information between police and 
school officials for safety's sake.

<P>

more in the nature of architecture, building a better Young

	The HIV trials network is an important and innovative part of the 
federal government's national AIDS strategy and keeps Canadian 
scientists and doctors at the forefront of research and treatment. Yet 
we hear concerns about the funding of this vital program extending 
beyond 1998.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	Will the minister assure the House that the funding of this 
important trials network will continue beyond March 1998?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has worked tirelessly with me with regard to the 
clinical trials network which is based in St. Paul's Hospital in 
Vancouver but again is well grounded in every region of the 
country.
<P>
	Very recently the clinical trial network here in Canada has 
formulated a partnership with the U.S. AIDS clinical  trial group 
which will enable 500 Canadians living with HIV-AIDS to 
participate in this trial on protease inhibitors.
<P>
	My government is able to provide additional funding for the 
years 1998-99 of $2.5 million and in 1999-2000 an additional$2.5 million.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	Canadians are speaking out across the country against attempts 
by the health protection branch to limit their access to safe natural 
health products, including Chinese herbs, and to charge exorbitant 
new fees which might drive them out of business and to restrict 
access internationally through the Codex forum.
<P>
	Will the minister agree to impose a moratorium on these 
activities, these high fees and these attempts to attack the natural 
health products, which are driven by pressure from multinational 
pharmaceutical companies, until there has been a full public review 
by the Standing Committee on Health?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member can jump to various conclusions but the role we 
play as the regulator in terms of Health Canada is to ensure that any 
products that come on to the market, in particular those which are 
to provide a remedy for a health matter, are safe and that all the 
appropriate tests have been done to ensure that the efficacy of the 
product will be realized.
<P>
	If the hon. member has particular products in mind, I would of 
course raise this with the appropriate officials. I do not think it 
would be appropriate for the Minister of Health to give a carte 
blanche directive to the department when its very reason for 
existence is to make sure that the product is safe and efficacious.

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to table today the report on 
international business development. The document, entitled 
``Achievements of the International Business Development 
Program'', responds to recommendations put forward in the 
November 1996 auditor general's report on Canada's export 
promotion activities.
<P>
	The auditor general recommended that the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade  and Industry Canada 
establish 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9222"> 9222 </A></B>
<P>
mechanisms to measure the effectiveness of our international 
business development activities.
<P>
	As recommended, we are establishing a performance 
measurement framework to determine the effectiveness of existing 
government programs and services and to help plan for the future.
<P>
	The international business development report I am tabling 
today will serve as an annual report card updating parliamentarians 
on the results of our international business development activities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must ensure that the services we provide achieve their 
intended objectives at the least possible cost.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	Next year's report will have much more detail than this initial 
endeavour and will discuss the preliminary results of our 
performance measurement system, including feedback from clients 
on our trade commissioner service, a review of the impact of the 
department's exports, investment and technology development 
activities. It will have baseline indicators that have been 
established to measure Canada's year over year success in terms of 
international markets and our promotion in those markets.
<P>
	The government's international business development activities 
work hand in hand with a rigorous bilateral and multilateral trade 
policy agenda and clearly establish market access priorities to 
ensure that Canadian businesses have competitive access to world 
markets.
<P>
	We are improving the delivery of services because international 
trade is an important part of the government's job strategy. The 
more companies we introduce to trade, the more jobs are created in 
Canada. To that end we have set a tangible goal of doubling the 
number of active exporters by the year 2000.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With exports accounting for nearly 40 per cent of our gross 
domestic product, international trade has become the engine that 
drives the Canadian economy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For ever $1 billion in increased trade, we create or sustain 11,000 
jobs in Canada, jobs for every community in the country. 
Promoting Canada's products and services is, however, only one 
part of the job.
<P>
	We also must sell Canada as an outstanding place to invest. 
Foreign direct investment in Canada has a dramatic impact on job 
creation. Today three Canadian jobs out of ten, both direct and 
indirect, more than 50 per cent of our total exports, and 75 per cent 
of our manufacturing exports are directly attributable to foreign 
direct investment in Canada.
<P>
	Studies suggest that attracting a billion dollars of foreign direct 
investment into Canada results in up to 45,000 jobs over a five year 
period. That is why we have developed a specific agency, a specific 
program, to help bring in more of those investment dollars.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	I cannot talk about international business development without 
referring to the success of the Team Canada trade missions led by 
the Prime Minister, together with the premiers, which have helped 
the private sector to bring home more than 550 business deals with 
more than $22.1 billion for Canadian companies and resulting in 
Canadian jobs.
<P>
	Canada is meeting the challenge of globalization and members 
have only to look at our track record.
<P>
	The 1996 trade statistics are proof that Canada is succeeding 
internationally. Canada's trade surplus reached a record level of 
$34 billion. That was $6 billion more than in 1995. That is success.
<P>
	This success has been built on the strength of the Team Canada 
partnerships. We have forged solid alliances with our provincial, 
municipal and private sector colleagues. By working together in 
Team Canada, we have been able to deliver the programs and 
services that Canadian companies need to compete internationally.
<P>
	Finally, it is a pleasure for me to announce today that the 
1997-98 Canada's international business strategy is now available 
to the Canadian business community. International business 
development programs and initiatives help Canadian businesses 
become export ready by providing access to key financial services, 
market information in export programs.
<P>
	The federal government and its Team Canada partners continue 
to forge ahead in their international business development 
endeavours. Working together we are confident that Canada will 
continue to prosper as we expand and diversify our markets abroad 
and as we attract foreign investment and technology flows into 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
I could thank the minister on tabling this report, but that will 
unfortunately be impossible for a number of reasons.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise in this House today to speak on the report on 
international business development entitled ``Achievements, 
International Business Development Programs'' tabled today.
<P>
	But before I do, I would like, if I may, to tell the Minister of 
International Trade, through you, how the unacceptable attitude of 
his government and his department has saddened and annoyed me. 
Once again, this government and the minister's department have  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9223"> 9223 </A></B>
<P>
shown disrespect for the opposition by waiting until the very last 
minute to tell us about the tabling of the report on international 
business development. This hardly gives us enough time to become 
properly acquainted with such an important report and to fully 
absorb all of its contents.
<P>
	We know that documents could have been made available to us 
by the minister's office yesterday, and we would have known not to 
release this information, because we thought there was honest and 
sincere co-operation. We hope there will be honest and sincere 
co-operation in the future. This is not the first time that I have to 
raise this point publicly in the House. We do hope this issue will be 
addressed.
<P>
	I will not go on about this, except to say that the government was 
unable or unwilling to take the necessary steps to ensure that we 
could carry out our duties properly; otherwise, we would have been 
afforded the opportunity to read and prepare comments on the 
report on international business development before it was tabled. 
After all, is that not what we are supposed to be doing here today?
<P>
	According to the minister, his report responds to the 
recommendations made in the November 1996 auditor general 
report. The report includes the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-in spite of the some $375 million spent by the federal government every year to 
promote trade, the data on the results of this activity is not gathered systematically 
and is not sufficiently objective. Moreover, a systematic and more objective 
feedback on the results would allow the government to be better informed about the 
eventual benefits of its action, and to better understand what adjudication process is 
required when co-ordinating and distributing its resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Finally, the auditor general pointed out ``that the government 
must inform Parliament more systematically about the activities 
and achievements made under the international trade development 
program''.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	In short, the auditor general is saying that the government 
invests $375 million per year in a program, without checking to see 
where that money goes. This is what the auditor general is saying.
<P>
	Moreover, the auditor adds: ``I noticed the same thing 10 years 
ago, and no change has been made since''. So, $375 million are 
invested to help small and medium size businesses, to help 
businesses export their products. Does the program work? Maybe, 
but we do not know, because the government does not conduct any 
audit regarding a meagre $375 million invested hapharzardly.
<P>
	In light of all this, you can imagine my surprise when I noticed at 
the last minute that the report tabled today by the Minister for 
International Trade does not in any way address the Auditor 
General's recommendations, any more than it addresses the report 
of the committee on  assistance to small export businesses. Because 
the minister was not called to order on one occasion, he has now 
been called to order twice: once by the Auditor General and once 
by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
<P>
	We would have expected the Liberal government to explain in 
this report how it was going to come up with systematic and more 
objective feedback on the results obtained in international trade 
that would allow it to be better informed about the eventual 
benefits of its action, and to better understand what adjudication 
process is required when co-ordinating and distributing its 
resources.
<P>
	Instead, the report tabled today looks more like a pre-election 
score sheet of the Liberal government's accomplishments with 
respect to international trade. The report, the minister's speech, far 
from making specific recommendations, only goes over the 
mechanisms already in place within this program, as well as the 
general directions taken by the government.
<P>
	The minister should have done his homework. He wrote the 
chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade asking for an examination of existing mechanisms. We did as 
he requested and, what is more, concluded our study and tabled our 
report. And they replied to it. They are telling us they will reply at 
some point. I am telling him he has already done so.
<P>
	Moreover, the Minister for International Trade's letter of 
presentation with this report clearly stipulates that the mechanism 
for measuring the performance of resources allocated to the 
international business development program is not yet in place, and 
that further details will be forthcoming.
<P>
	The auditor general has said: ``We have been waiting ten years 
for it'', and now the minister tells us that he is well aware of the 
fact that he needs to put feedback mechanisms in place, and that he 
will do so in future.
<P>
	I would like to point out that we can easily be a bit sceptical 
about this. The government also wrote in its red book that two 
groups were going to be set up to examine trade disputes and 
anti-dumping problems. Both were to report to Parliament by 
December 1995. They are saying: ``Trust us. We will make the 
reports by these two groups available during the next election 
campaign''.
<P>
	Asking the Canadian public, and particularly the official 
opposition, to trust the government is perhaps asking rather a lot of 
them. One might have expected that the government and the 
Minister for International Trade would have taken concrete steps to 
respond to the auditor general's concrete recommendations. It was 
not the nasty separatists, nor the Reform Party, but the auditor 
general who asked the Minister for International Trade to take 
concrete steps to correct the situation. The minister tells us: ``Trust 
me, and you will see that, in future, we are going to coeect this 
situation''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9224"> 9224 </A></B>
<P>
	In closing, I remind him that former Prime Minister Kim 
Campbell also said ``Trust me'' during an election campaign. So 
now there are only two of them left.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to 
respond on behalf of the Reform Party to the tabling by the 
Minister for International Trade of the document entitled 
``Achievement of the International Business Development 
Program''.
<P>
	Although we have not yet had a chance to see the document, this 
is democracy at its finest. We are told that it responds to 
recommendations put forward in the November 1996 auditor 
general's report on Canada's export promotion activities.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	Let us examine some of what the auditor general actually had to 
say about Canada's export promotion activities. His comments are 
somewhat less than flattering. ``We concluded that Parliament 
needs to be better informed about the expenditures, outputs, 
revenues and cost sharing of Canada's export promotion efforts. 
This would help ensure that there is no undesirable overlap, that the 
distribution of expenditures reflects the government's priorities 
and that Parliament is kept informed about the progress being made 
toward the government's objectives''.
<P>
	I have to agree with the auditor general that there is a pressing 
need for the public to know how its hard earned tax dollars are 
being spent. For example, how much do all of our globe trotting 
Team Canada missions cost? We are always told that business 
people pay their own way, so ``don't worry, be happy, it is not 
costing us anything''.
<P>
	I would remind the House that it is the taxpayer who picks up 
much of the tab for plane fares, hotels and food for all the 
government officials who lay the groundwork for these missions 
and for the PM's tag-along entourage. That is not paid for by the 
business community.
<P>
	I have a sneaking suspicion that some programs for export 
market development money gets sprinkled around, as well as quite 
a bit from the Export Development Corporation. I would really like 
to know how much, to whom and did we get our money's worth. I 
challenge anyone to get that kind of information out of EDC. All 
you will get is a thousand and one reasons why such information is 
confidential, sensitive or none of our business.
<P>
	I look forward with some eagerness to seeing what the minister 
proposes be done to keep Parliament better informed about 
expenditures on all aspects of trade promotion.
<P>
	Directly related to cost is cost effectiveness. Here is what the 
good AG had to say on that score: ``While we  were unable to find 
conclusive evidence about the direct effects of trade promotion, it 
is possible to measure the cost effectiveness of specific activities. 
To do this requires information on costs and systematic objective 
measures of the usefulness of specific activities to business or 
measures of their impact. However, both the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade and the Department of 
Industry need better cost information. They need to obtain 
systematic and objective feedback to determine the value and 
utility of more of their key activities''.
<P>
	I know, and the auditor general knows, that the exact impact of 
government programs might be hard to measure. Did a foreign sale 
happen because of a government initiative or did it happen because 
a Canadian company had a superior widget and a lot of sales moxie 
and initiative? All that the auditor general is asking is for objective 
feedback about the key activities. He thinks that it can be done. I 
think it needs to be done and done often.
<P>
	I would like to comment briefly on the puffery surrounding 
Team Canada's alleged success in snagging those ephemeral deals. 
The government needs to ask itself: What other factors play a role 
in determining our exporters' success? Really, if Team Canada's 
initiatives are all it takes to be successful abroad, then why would 
we not see our exports to China, Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, Chile, 
Argentina and Uruguay rising instead of falling after our big ticket 
missions there?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> They are rising.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> The hon. minister says they are not falling. He 
should check the government's statistics which are a matter of 
public record. India, I recall, had a drop of 16 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	There must be some other ingredients required in the foreign 
sales mix. A healthy economy is one. Strong companies and 
confident consumers who are not burdened with an unbearable tax 
load is another one. How about the ability to build some muscle 
through domestic trade by allowing companies to freely trade with 
neighbouring provinces?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to tell the hon. member that he 
has the same amount of time as the minister, and that time has 
unfortunately expired.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to the 
concurrence in the third report of this standing This was with 
regard to the family trusts that the Minister of Finance referred to 
earlier today in question period when he talked about how he had 
closed all tax loopholes and accused the other parties of not 
supporting tax cuts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9226"> 9226 </A></B>
<P>
	When we look at the record of this government as it relates to 
issues such as family trusts, we find that the record is less than 
commendable.
<P>
	Last May, I believe, the auditor general tabled his report 
regarding the family trust issue. He was very concerned about the 
situation where about $2 billion had been transferred out of this 
country on a tax free basis.
<P>
	The transaction happened in 1991 but the present government 
obviously concurred with the decision of the previous government 
because it did everything it could in its power to ensure that the 
decision of the previous government was retained and enforced and 
it stood by it.
<P>
	After some months, after it became public, the Minister of 
Finance stood up in the House with a ways and means motion and 
closed the loophole but did not close it retroactively. What that 
meant was the issue of $2 billion moving out of this country tax 
free by people of very substantial means. It is only people of very 
substantial means who can have $2 billion to move anywhere, 
albeit out of the country on a tax free basis.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	After the people involved and others who had the same 
opportunities available to them were able to take advantage of this 
loophole that had occurred in the law, the Minister of Finance stood 
in the House and closed the loophole. I find that abominable for the 
individual small taxpayer of this country.
<P>
	As the House knows, the Reform Party in its fresh start 
introduced proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act and 
proposed that the basic exemption be increased from its current 
amount of around $5,800 to $7,900. That gives every Canadian in 
this country, rich or poor, working or otherwise, a tax break. 
However, it does not focus the tax break on the super rich. It 
focuses it on the working Canadians who carry this country on their 
backs.
<P>
	We found that the Minister of Finance, by his actions and by his 
collusion with the decisions of the previous government, aided and 
abetted a situation where hundreds of millions of dollars of taxes 
went uncollected. On that basis, I find it rather appalling that the 
Minister of Finance would stand in the House, as the protector of 
the poor, and accuse the other parties of being otherwise when in 
fact it was his government that had it in its power to ensure that the 
rich and super rich pay their share and he did not do so.
<P>
	These are the types of things that are abhorrent in this country. 
When we look to our parliamentarians for leadership, we find they 
make the rules according to those who have access, and for the 
small individual Canadian who just pays a bit of tax there is no 
opportunity for him to avoid or in any way escape the long arm of 
the tax collector. Yet others we find have had opportunities to walk 
away with what appears to be  several hundred million dollars of 
tax through a small loophole.
<P>
	I was involved in the debates at the time through the public 
accounts committee. I was appalled by the way the deputy minister 
of finance and others in his department tried to justify this 
situation. It dealt with an issue called taxable Canadian property. 
Every tax practitioner I am aware of is fully aware that taxable 
Canadian property has always been referred to in the context of 
international transactions. No one but no one could find any 
reference in the Income Tax Act, the income tax publications, the 
income tax rules, the income tax books published by the CCH or 
anyone else for that matter that made any reference to Canadian 
taxable property as being part of the domestic tax scene. Yet we had 
the deputy minister of finance come before the committee and say 
``this was such a simple thing, it has been the rule since 1971, and it 
is so obvious that we did not even have to document it in this 
particular case''.
<P>
	The point is if it had been such a simple and obvious thing, if 
Canadian taxable property applied to domestic transactions, such 
as real estate transactions-I remember one official from the 
Department of Finance saying that every time a Canadian acquires 
an asset he is acquiring Canadian taxable property and that is the 
way it has been since 1971-not one publication, not one reference 
in the Income Tax Act and not one reference by tax practitioners 
would suggest this.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	Members know of the ongoing dialogue between the accounting 
profession and the Department of National Revenue regarding the 
way the Income Tax Act is applied to profits. Over a period of 25 
years not one reference was ever made to the fact that Canadian 
taxable property was part of a domestic transaction. Yet the 
government says it is so simple and it has always been that way.
<P>
	How on earth could the practitioners deem that this particular 
transaction was an allowable one? We have had the senior officials 
in committee and the Minister of Finance in the House stand up and 
say absolutely that this is an obvious situation. That is what turns 
the small taxpayer against government and politicians.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance stood today and made specific 
reference to this trust and the fact that he had closed the loophole I 
took exception to his statement. I wondered what he was doing. 
Today he is trying to be the defender of the small taxpayer. He 
made reference to the fact that he had closed this massive loophole, 
yet everyone knows that he left it open a mile wide. Anybody who 
has the expertise, the desire and the motive can take advantage of 
it. People can even get what is called an advanced tax write-off to 
lock it in. After all that, we find out that the small taxpayer cannot 
do it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9227"> 9227 </A></B>
<P>
	The member for Medicine Hat told us that personal income tax 
as a percentage of GDP has gone up 15 per cent. The Minister 
of Finance told us that he had not raised income taxes. The small 
taxpayer is carrying the country on its back, the wealthy have the 
opportunity to take advantage of the loopholes and the government 
allows them to go through before it closes the door.
<P>
	I am going to close now because I am splitting my time 
according to the Standing Orders.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member who has just spoken and so eloquently at that. I am very 
pleased at the interest the Reform Party is suddenly taking in this 
committee's report.
<P>
	However, I learned that the question of family trusts was not 
allowed to go to the public accounts committee. I would like the 
member to shed some light on these famous family trusts criticized 
by the Auditor General that should normally have been studied by 
the public accounts committee but were not.
<P>
	I would like an explanation, and I would also like to hear a bit 
about this family trust scandal that, as my hon. colleague was 
saying, apparently left the small taxpayer stuck once again with the 
bill for this monumental blunder by the federal government. So I 
would ask my colleague to tell us a little more about that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to enlighten him on the 
problem. I am sure the Minister of Finance was well aware of the 
issue a long time before it became public through the publication of 
the auditor general's report last May.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	When it became public, the Minister of Finance immediately 
referred it to the Standing Committee on Finance for study. It was 
studied for many months while the law remained in place with this 
great big, wide loophole that a truck could drive through. I am sure 
many people did drive a truck full of money across the border tax 
free because that is what happened when it went to the finance 
committee. The committee sat on it for months.
<P>
	After the finance committee reported back to the House in 
September, three months after the general public became aware of 
it and this House became aware of it, the Minister of Finance 
introduced a ways and means motion. He could have stopped it the 
very day the auditor general made his report public and he did not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to comment on the remarks of the hon. member for St. Albert.
<P>
	My colleague mentioned very clearly his concern about who 
pays taxes. He talked about the long arm of the tax  collector. He 
also talked about the questions and answers of the Minister of 
Finance today in the House. The minister tried to make the case 
that the Liberal government was taxing banks and a variety of other 
rich people in Canada more now than before.
<P>
	The story is unclear. During this term of the 35th Parliament we 
witnessed and know it happened, the Liberal government-the 
Minister of Finance was involved and a representative from the 
Montreal area-gave Bombardier $100 million practically interest 
free.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It was $87 million.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> It was $87 million. Well, $87 
million and $100 million is not very far apart. By the time it gets an 
interest free loan it is soon going to be $100 million. This is a 
company that made $400 million in profits in the last year and 
could have financed $87 million very easily.
<P>
	This goes on and on. The Liberals try to claim they are defenders 
of the poor but at the same time they shovel the money out to the 
rich. The poor people are being held by the long arm of the tax 
collector. The tax collector grabs 40 per cent of the wages of young 
people so they cannot get ahead. I would appreciate a comment 
from my hon. colleague on that matter first.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. colleague as 30 seconds to 
reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have said it once and my hon. 
colleague has said it again. We can repeat it many times and we 
will be repeating it many times on the election campaign.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is 12 seconds left. Is the hon. 
member splitting his time? I have three members standing. Which 
member is speaking next?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the member for Calgary Centre be now heard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you will find that the member 
for St. Albert, who originally had the floor, had indicated to the 
Chair and to the House that he was splitting his time. Perhaps you 
would go back to that order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The difficulty the Chair has is that in fact 
I do not recall hearing the hon. member for St. Albert when he 
began his intervention say that he was splitting his time. I heard an 
hon. member say he did not hear him either. Can we have a small 
moment of reflection?
<P>
	It has been pointed out that the hon. member for St. Albert 
indicated at the end of his remarks that he was splitting his time 
with the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands. Under those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9228"> 9228 </A></B>
<P>
circumstances I hope colleagues will agree that the hon. member 
for  Saanich-Gulf Islands can now speak. The hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands can now speak.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I 
would like to move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the member for Calgary Centre be now heard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is one of those afternoons. Members on 
all sides of the House will appreciate that the peculiar requirements 
for making a motion on a point of order, as the Chair sees it, were 
met. The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands had not said a 
word of his speech.
<P>
	Accordingly, the Chair has no choice, as I see it, but to accept 
that the hon. member for Lethbridge has moved that the hon. 
member for Calgary Centre be now heard. Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt this motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the yeas have it, barely. On 
the basis that the yeas have it, I would declare that the motion is 
carried.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think you will 
find, on my point of order, that we had more than five members 
rising. We want a standing vote.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Wonderful Wednesdays. The member for 
Calgary Centre was recognized on debate. The hon. member for 
Calgary Centre has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Perhaps 
the Chair can give us some clarification. There were two members 
standing. The member for Lethbridge stood up and asked on a point 
of order for the House to recognize a certain member.
<P>
	The Chair realized that it had no choice but to seek the opinion of 
the House, which you did. When the yeas and nays were called, I 
believe more than five members stood up seeking a vote. Perhaps 
you can enlighten us why the bells have not been rung, and why the 
member which the member for Lethbridge wanted to hear has not 
been heard.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I basically agree with the way the 
member has stated it, except that when the vote was called for the 
yeas won it. Therefore, in my view, the motion had passed and 
accordingly the House is acceding  to the motion which is to give 
the hon. member for Calgary Centre the floor on debate.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Centre has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> We need a ruling.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has made his point. I 
obviously have not answered it to his satisfaction.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Centre has the floor on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
concurrence motion on the third report of the public accounts 
committee deals with a very important issue. The issue is the fact 
that tax havens are a big concern to the government. I got that 
straight from the mouth of the Minister of National Revenue. I 
know she is concerned about this, as we should all be. It is a very 
important issue.
<P>
	Apparently the government feels that it has closed this loophole, 
that the matter has been handled very fairly, and that in no way, 
shape or form will rich people be able to transfer assets within 
trusts, or assets outside trusts, outside the country without paying a 
fair percentage of taxes that one would consider to be right and fair.
<P>
	My big concern is with the way the matter was handled. Right 
from the start the government was upset with the auditor general, 
our watchdog on government. Lord knows we need a watchdog on 
government. When we have cabinet ministers loose with a bunch of 
money, billions of dollars without having someone audit them, we 
can imagine what they could potentially do with it.
<P>
	It should be the same as what we do with private citizens and 
corporations. We audit large corporations and small corporations. 
We audit individual taxpayers to ensure, as the Minister of Natural 
Resources likes to say, that we have integrity in our tax system and 
the volunteer system continues forward.
<P>
	I do not think the government was very smart in attacking the 
auditor general. After all, there was confusion with respect to this 
family trust. It was a very wealthy trust. If the government is 
worried that they have done something wrong then it should have 
complained. If it was not worried it should not have complained. It 
looked bad for the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of privilege. I would 
like a recorded vote on the motion put to the House by the member 
for St. Alberta. The House does not know who said yea or nay. It is 
my right to be able to ask for a recorded vote.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair has already ruled on that 
matter. It may have been an erroneous ruling but the Chair has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9229"> 9229 </A></B>
<P>
ruled on it and we have moved on to the matter of the hon. 
member's intervention which he is in the process of making.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if you would be so kind as to 
let me know when I have one minute left in my speech. With all 
these interruptions I am losing track of the points I want to make, 
and I want to make sure I finish with a bang.
<P>
	I am concerned about this third report. After the government 
finally accepted the auditor general's criticism, looked into the 
matter and had the Standing Committee on Finance and the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts review it, it became clear 
that something had to be done and the government acted.
<P>
	Personally I feel the government has gone too far. It put in some 
strict rules that ultimately led to something everyone will see on 
their income tax form this year. They will see a foreign asset 
declaration section. Never in the history of the country has an 
income tax form been used to find out where everybody's assets are 
offshore. Because of this overreaction the government has put it in 
the income tax forms. It was done prematurely, with arrogance and 
with anticipation that the bill would pass and it has not passed. It is 
not even law.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Now we have confusion across this land. This will simply ensure 
the Canadian taxpayer will become more frustrated and angrier 
than ever with our taxation policies. Instead of simplifying our tax 
policies the government continues to complicate them in such a 
way that I think more money will go into the underground economy 
and more money will go offshore because of high levels of 
taxation.
<P>
	More people will start investing in tax free jurisdictions through 
tax exempt companies. They will put their after tax dollars into 
those tax exempt companies. There are people from tax haven 
countries who tour across the country and advise people on how to 
do it. It is legal. Because of our high levels of taxation that is what 
will happen.
<P>
	They set up a lot of people, a lot of Canadian companies. Large 
corporations have set up their head offices offshore so they will not 
have to report their income to the Canadian government. If 
Canadians are able to make investments in tax exempt companies 
legally with after tax dollars as the money grows and accumulates 
in whatever it has been invested in offshore; if they do not take a 
dividend; and if they do not take a salary, they can still live in 
Canada and enjoy our wonderful health care and education 
systems, which are shrinking thanks to the Liberal government.
<P>
	Then what happens? The offshore money grows tax free. They 
can reinvest the offshore money tax free. Does that not sound like a 
good idea? More Canadians will look at that. They will find that it 
appeals to them, that they like it, that they enjoy it. They will do it. 
That is where they will invest their money. That is what will 
happen.
<P>
	Fewer and fewer Canadians every day have disposable income, 
including the Liberal Party whip who I know has some problems 
meeting his financial obligations in his household these days 
because he is taking home today much less money. I am making the 
same salary except for the whip money. He is taking home $3,000 
less today than he was four years ago thanks to his own 
government. I hope he finds he can make ends meet with $3,000 
less. In his tax bracket that is what the government and the finance 
minister have cost him.
<P>
	Why are Canadians investing offshore? I made a list of why I 
think more people will invest less in companies in Canada and will 
go elsewhere because of the growing global economy. Here is what 
most Canadians feel about our country's taxation system. The 
current system is not fair. People perceive it to favour the rich and 
politicians at the expense of hard working taxpayers.
<P>
	People question the value for money they are getting from 
politicians who do not know how to invest their money and do not 
have the business acumen to invest in businesses. Why are 
government officials investing in businesses and competing with 
the private sector? We could look at the bungling of the Pearson 
airport and the huge grant to Bombardier of over $1 billion over the 
years. This past year the company made a $400 million profit.
<P>
	The Saskatchewan Conservative Party is being raked over the 
coals and being sent to jail for misuse of funds and raising money 
the wrong way. These are the things that scare people.
<P>
	Let us look at the changes to the RRSPs for retired people. Now 
they have changed it from 69 to 71. Reducing taxes is difficult. 
Because of our confusing, complicated and convoluted Income Tax 
Act there is a fine line between tax avoidance which is legal, taking 
advantage of the loopholes, the exemptions and everything that is 
there, versus tax evasion. I have no respect for those who are guilty 
of tax evasion. Our bureaucracy in Revenue Canada is huge and 
costs a lot of money.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Yesterday in the public accounts committee we were reviewing 
the issue of large corporations. Of the large corporations there are 
6,000 plus 200 super huge conglomerates that they audit 100 per 
cent every year. I asked whether any of them ever got through 
without having to be reassessed. The answer was not one.
<P>
	That does not mean these people are trying to evade taxes. It 
means they are trying to avoid taxes wherever they can legally but 
there is always a difference of opinion. Five or six people disagree.
<P>
	There is a reluctance to address debt. I could go on and on, but 
before my time is up and since I am having a hard time getting 
everyone's attention I move:

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, members of the official 
opposition would like to vote on the motion.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They had their chance.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No, no.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I called on three separate occasions during the 
taking of the vote for all those who were in favour of the motion to 
rise. Not seeing anyone, I called-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I called for all those who were in favour of the 
motion on three occasions. Not seeing anyone, I called for all those 
who were opposed to the motion and we voted on that.
<P>
	If there are other members who are opposed to the motion, they 
can vote now, but the voting for those who are in favour has passed.
<P>
	I declare the motion carried.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Transport and the 
Minister of the Environment entered the House after the whips had 
walked up the floor and they voted on the motion just taken. 
Therefore, I think that their votes were out of order.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9232"> 9232 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. members who were mentioned are here 
in the House now. Did they enter after the vote was called?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would happily take my name off 
the list of those who voted if it offends the hon. member. I do not 
wish to hold the House up any longer on this point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to follow the 
leadership of my friend from British Columbia.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Are there other points of order?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, just to clarify things, I did rise. 
When I looked, people at the end had not risen. It seemed they were 
not going to rise. The Prime Minister said-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> I have a point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is it the same point of order?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Our rights have been trampled.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I put the question and, for some reason, members 
did not want to vote. They will not vote this time around. Is there 
another point of order?
<P>
	The hon. member for Richelieu.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services also came in late for the vote.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, if it can put an end to this silly 
game, I will follow in my colleagues' footsteps.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I believe we are ready to proceed.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANVOLUNTEERSERVICEMEDALFORUNITEDNATIONSPEACEKEEPINGACT">CANADIAN VOLUNTEER SERVICE MEDAL FOR 
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING ACT</A></H3>
	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-300, an act 
respecting the establishment and award of a Canadian 
peacekeeping service medal for Canadians who have served with 
an international peacekeeping mission as reported (with 
amendment) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-300 provides for a Canadian peacekeeping service medal to 
be awarded to Canadians who have participated in peacekeeping, 
peacemaking, peace enforcement or humanitarian assistance 
missions which have been sanctioned by the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	In my opinion these would be accurately described under the 
umbrella term international stabilization missions. They do not 
always have identified direct connection or impact on Canada but 
Canadians, as compassionate citizens of the world and as 
international traders, recognize the need and propriety of the 
involvement of Canadians in these places to better the lot or 
improve the situation for the people who find themselves in these 
trouble spots.
<P>
	The Canadians who respond to these calls willingly forego the 
comfort of home, the companionship of family and the opportunity 
to train and better their qualifications, to often place themselves in 
uncomfortable, dangerous situations.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	In so doing they have brought great honour and pride to Canada, 
including the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to those who served 
the UN prior to September 1988. Some 150 of them have paid the 
supreme sacrifice and many more carry the wounds and disabilities 
that resulted from their participation in these activities.
<P>
	In the past their contributions have sometimes been recognized 
by the United Nations and other organizations, but until now there 
has been no way for Canada to provide individual recognition of 
the honour and pride they have brought to Canada. Today true 
Canadian recognition for their individual service in the cause of 
international stabilization, past, present and future, is one step 
closer to becoming a reality.
<P>
	Bill C-300 has undergone a metamorphosis, emerging at today's 
pivotal point after having benefited from incorporating enlightened 
and thoughtful input from hon. members of the House, from 
interested Canadians across the country, and from the Canadian 
Armed Forces. As a result I believe, with the exception of 
specifically recognizing those who won the Nobel Peace Prize, it 
now gives Canada the ability to acknowledge those military, 
constabulary, medical or other Canadians who have given of 
themselves to help others.
<P>
	This will only happen if Parliament gives its approval, both this 
House and the other place, prior to the dissolution of Parliament. If 
not, all these efforts will have been in vain.
<P>
	For Bill C-300 to have reached report stage and third reading 
today is an exemplary display of what can be achieved when 
members of all parties see the worth of a measure and set out to see 
it proclaimed into law. I am truly honoured that members of the 
House have given  their consent by special order to move Bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9234"> 9234 </A></B>
<P>
C-300 quickly up the order of precedence to be debated at report 
stage and third reading today.
<P>
	I much appreciate and wish to thank the chief government whip 
for his support and introduction of the motion making this debate 
possible. I extend my sincere gratitude to all members of the House 
for their tremendous support and constructive input both on an 
individual basis and through debate. Many of the recommendations 
which they offered have indeed strengthened and enhanced Bill 
C-300 as they were adopted in committee on March 12 and are now 
reflected in the bill reported to Parliament yesterday.
<P>
	The co-operation afforded by members of the House of 
Commons Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans 
Affairs and the ensuing discussions on various aspects of the bill 
have been most helpful and are gratefully appreciated.
<P>
	The committee chair, the member for Halifax, and all members 
are to be commended for their co-operation in moving my bill 
quickly through committee. I should additionally thank the former 
committee chairman, the member for Hillsborough, for his 
contribution and support.
<P>
	The expert testimony, advice and recommendations received in 
committee from Major General Dallaire, the chief of staff for the 
assistant deputy minister of personnel; Major Bev Brown of the 
directorate of history and heritage, medals and honours; and Major 
Gallagher, special assistant to the judge advocate general called on 
as witnesses proved to be invaluable.
<P>
	The defence department witnesses were able to give us the 
guidance necessary to ensure that Canadian recognition for 
peacekeeping service would be appropriately directed. I am most 
appreciative of their support.
<P>
	It was at second reading on February 3, 1997 that the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs advised the House that the government would not 
oppose the bill. Thus I would be remiss if I failed to acknowledge 
and thank the Minister of National Defence and Veterans Affairs 
for the courtesy extended to me and the tremendous assistance 
provided by the minister and his staff, in particular Margaret 
Penniston.
<P>
	There is every indication that it will be the will of the House to 
pass Bill C-300 this evening. The only remaining obstacle will then 
be approval in the other place. From communications I have had 
with some members of the other place it would appear there is a 
good chance that it will pass quickly and thus be in a position to be 
proclaimed into law before the 35th Parliament is dissolved for an 
election.
<P>
	With that I will conclude, leaving the fate of Bill C-300 in the 
hands of hon. members of the House.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with 
very great pleasure that I stand to speak in support of Bill C-300. I 
return the favour and thank the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands for his kind words to members of the standing committee, 
to members of the minister's staff and to others who assisted with 
the bill. It is my great pleasure to pay tribute to the member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Too frequently in the House we are accused, and sometimes 
rightfully, of partisan behaviour. In this case the member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands brought the bill forward and worked 
diligently and with great perseverance with all our colleagues in the 
House. There was also assistance from hon. members of the official 
opposition.
<P>
	I for one am pleased to have been involved in a small way in the 
hard work put forward by the member for Saanich-Gulf Islands. 
The only thing I would add is a reference to one of the high points 
of this exemplary piece of legislation. It can be given to persons not 
just in the Canadian forces but those involved in activities in the 
peacekeeping area such as policing, local administration, the 
delivery of aid, medical assistance or election assistance.
<P>
	I conclude by thanking and congratulating the hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands. I am very pleased to have had a very small 
part to play in the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first I 
want to congratulate the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands 
for his great tenacity and for his sense of duty.
<P>
	As we all know, the hon. member had a long and distinguished 
military career. He has made a major contribution to the defence 
committee, because of his expertise and also because he is a true 
gentleman. Indeed, the hon. member has provided a lot of input in 
the work of the defence committee.
<P>
	Today, the Bloc Quebecois, on whose behalf I am speaking, is 
pleased to support this bill, which will allow peacekeepers 
throughout the world to promote democracy and to preserve 
freedom, so that the world can become a better place. As I said, we 
are pleased to support this bill.
<P>
	Ever since the UN was founded, Canada has been taking part in 
peacekeeping missions all over the world. However, there is 
currently no medal awarded to the military, civilians or policemen 
who serve with a peacekeeping mission. Under this bill, we would 
now be able to award such a medal.
<P>
	Canada is aware of the many limitations of peacekeeping 
operations. Canada, which is an average size country, must 
continue to take part in these missions  but, as we have always 
pointed out, it must do so according to its means. I think that, as a 
career military person himself, the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands understood that we can acknowledge such contributions, 
but do it our own way. We need not compare ourselves to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9235"> 9235 </A></B>
<P>
greatest and wealthiest of this world, but only to ourselves and see 
what we can offer.
<P>
	Since Lester Pearson, Canada has deployed forces wherever they 
were required to uphold principles. I think that, through this bill, 
through the hon. member's tenacity and, of course, through the 
government's support for this bill-everyone agrees on this-we 
now have a bill providing that all these men and women who 
participated in peacekeeping missions can be honoured. We cannot 
put a price on that, I feel. It is not the metal that counts, but the 
symbol.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	I find it interesting that, under this bill, the medal can be 
awarded posthumously. There are people who sacrificed their lives 
and their family will receive this honour on their behalf.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the Bloc Quebecois members are very happy to 
support this bill. I think it promotes democracy and at least those 
people who participated in peacekeeping missions will have a 
tangible reminder of their deed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Pursuant to 
order made on Tuesday, March 18, 1997, all questions necessary to 
dispose of Bill C-300 at report and third reading stages are deemed 
to have been proposed, put and carried.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Accordingly the bill is concurred in at report stage, read the third 
time and passed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the third time and passed.)

	The House resumed from February 6 consideration of the motion 
and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise to speak on Motion 
No. 277 of the hon. member for Beaver River. It is a topic which is 
very dear to my heart.
<P>
	I raised this issue on September 29, 1995 in question period and 
again on October 2, 1995 in question period because it was brought 
to my attention that the option of claiming to be a Canadian would 
not be on the new census.
<P>
	Having been one of the Canadians who had a long census form to 
fill out, I found it very interesting, particularly Question No. 19 and 
its confused language,  nationality, geographic origin and colour. 
Trying to answer Question No. 19 became extremely difficult.
<P>
	One of the options under Question No. 19 was other. Because 
Canadian was not listed anywhere in that question, I had the 
uncomfortable situation of having to place Canadian under other. I 
refused to identify myself as a colour, as belonging to some 
geographic region or as someone who speaks a certain language. 
For a government not to allow Canadians to identify themselves as 
being Canadian is not progressive.
<P>
	I am faced daily with people who are assumed to be immigrants 
and newcomers to Canada. Some of these immigrants have lived in 
Canada for 20 or 30 years. Because we as a government insist on 
breaking people down based on the origins of the family trees of 
individuals who are Canadians in all sense of the word-they pay 
taxes, use and pay for the facilities, the hospitals and the schools, 
have citizenship and vote in elections-they are not able to call 
themselves Canadians on our census form.
<P>
	I do not want to leave the impression that I do not believe it is 
important to accumulate statistics. It is very important. It is 
acceptable for persons to be asked in a straightforward manner 
their racial background and left to determine what they want to put 
down, whether it is Irish, Scottish, Jamaican, Korean or whatever. 
They should not be asked if they are white or black, from the 
Philippines or from the Punjab. That is the wrong way to ask for a 
person's racial background or nationality. It is for statistical 
reasons only.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Canadians must be allowed to proudly claim that they are 
Canadian. I do not care whether a person is a brand new Canadian 
who got his or her citizenship the day before the census form 
arrived, or are Canadian born, or are a Canadian who has been here 
for 30 or 40 years. People who have come to this country or who 
were born here and are proud of being Canadian should be 
encouraged to state that on a census form.
<P>
	It was with trepidation that I filled Canadian under other. It is a 
disgrace to have to put Canadian under the category of other. I also 
took the opportunity to fill in my lineage which was quite an 
interesting experience since I am a typical Canadian. My parentage 
is Scottish, Irish, Pennsylvania Dutch, German, Swedish and a few 
other other things to boot. That is what being a Canadian is all 
about. I felt I was not able, through the census form, to indicate 
honestly what I felt: I am proud to be Canadian. I am proud to be a 
third or fourth generation Canadian. I was saddened that my 
children could not put down that they are Canadians.
<P>
	My hon. colleague's motion asks to return to the use of the word 
Canadian in questions like question No. 19. I do not buy the 
answers I received to my questions in question period. I quote the 
Minister of Industry: ``On  the issue of race, in the past people have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9236"> 9236 </A></B>
<P>
made calculations based on language rather than a specific question 
on racial origin. This time we think the provision of fuller 
information will give us a much better understanding of the 
make-up of Canadian society that should be beneficial for a wide 
range of purposes''.
<P>
	I would like to know what is the ``range of purposes''. I would 
like to know what the government is planning. It feels it has to 
segregate little communities. Depending on how it feels it must 
segregate them from each other. I really think this is a very divisive 
way of dealing with new Canadians.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Beaver River is looking to the unity of 
the country when she suggests that the federal government should 
be concerned about those things that bring Canadians together, 
about recognizing Canadianism. The identification of being 
Canadian is one of those things that will unify the country rather 
than divide it.
<P>
	Any government program that is designed to give special 
consideration to any individual over another is wrong, particularly 
if it is based on gender, race, religion, geography or colour. Any 
government legislation that does not treat all Canadians equally is 
wrong. I fully support my colleague from Beaver River. I 
appreciate her efforts in trying to return some pride in being 
Canadian and in trying to return the ability to exercise the right to 
put Canadian down not as other, not as an afterthought, but very 
proudly to claim oneself to be a Canadian. I look forward to the 
next census I have to fill in where I can mark Canadian rather than 
other.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
too would like to commend the member for Beaver River for 
bringing this motion forward. In particular, I would like to thank 
that member for allowing me the opportunity to speak to the 
motion.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	We are in an age where government seems to be intruding into so 
many areas of our lives. I can name a number of bills recently 
introduced in the House that do exactly that. One has to ask the 
question why. For example, think about the Canadian Wheat Board 
and its impact on many farmers in the country, especially western 
farmers, in how they sell their product. Some desire to sell their 
own grain but cannot do so because of the restrictions placed on 
them by the government.
<P>
	I look at the gun control bill and see again a very intrusive 
feature. Some sections in the gun control legislation impact 
directly on law-abiding people. I do not think that is acceptable to 
the majority of people in the country.
<P>
	Some of the more recent broadcasting legislation impinges on 
those who have businesses in that area. We see control on what can 
be broadcast, what can be sent out over the airwaves and what 
cannot. That is not to say  that there should not be some legislation 
or restriction, but here we have restrictions that are going much 
deeper than what should be.
<P>
	Coming up to the census, Statistics Canada, under the 
Department of Industry, claimed that the purpose of the question, 
in particular question No. 19 on the long form, was to organize 
population by selected ethnic origins. Those are the reasons it gave 
for collecting this data. This, irrespective of the politically correct 
spin bureaucrats and social engineers attempt to put on it, is 
nothing more than the labelling of people on the basis of race. Most 
people just want to be called Canadians.
<P>
	I look at my own riding. I live in a very multicultural riding. I 
have neighbours who are from India, Jamaica and the Middle East. 
For the most part, they would like to be considered as Canadians. 
They came to Canada just for that reason. They do not come here to 
be hyphenated Canadians, which is what is the official 
multicultural policy of this Liberal government, which 
unfortunately was introduced some time back into the House and 
imposed on the people.
<P>
	I refer to a statement made by Bruce Petrie, the StatsCan official 
overseeing the census. He said that question 19 was changed on the 
1996 census from other past censuses ``because too many 
minorities born in Canada were listing themselves as Canadian''. 
This upset Mr. Petrie. One would have to ask: Why would this 
upset Mr. Petrie? I might point out that this quote came from the 
Fredericton <I>Daily Gleaner</I> newspaper of May 13.
<P>
	Mr. Petrie goes on to say: ``So someone who is black and speaks 
English and was born in Canada puts Canadian- That gives us no 
information to estimate the number of black visible minority 
people. We are not trying to measure race per se. We are purely and 
simply trying to enumerate visible minorities under existing 
federal legislation''.
<P>
	Again one would have to ask why. Why would the government 
want to enumerate visible minorities under the existing legislation? 
There is no question that it is a divisive form of regulation.
<P>
	Let us go a little bit deeper. I have had the opportunity to speak 
to RCMP officials. In fact in the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Legal Affairs this point was brought up. They want to have a 
quota system on the different visible minority groups in the 
country. The only way they can do that is to determine the number 
or percentages of those different visible minorities through the 
census.
<P>
	The whole point is being missed if we engineer, for instance, a 
police force, selecting those according to their race as opposed to 
choosing the best there is regardless of race.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9237"> 9237 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians know and feel that this is a form of social 
engineering, and they do not care to hear that kind of spin. Mr. 
Petrie would certainly fall into that category because it is people 
such as himself who really drive this kind of a policy, with the 
blessings of the government, in particular the Liberal government.
<P>
	Putting a hyphen before Canadian, so people become 
French-Canadian, Turkish-Canadian, Greek-Canadian, 
Somali-Canadian, Israeli-Canadian, Hungarian-Canadian or 
whatever, has to be the most divisive aspect of Canadian society. It 
puts us all into little boxes and categories. I suggest this 
undoubtedly is the purpose of the census information. It is going to 
be used for that very reason.
<P>
	I am going to speak again of my own riding, a very multicultural 
riding. I see evidence there of this form of blocking of the 
community by race or background. That does not enhance unity, 
nor does it benefit those who come here from different ethnic 
backgrounds or countries.
<P>
	Canadians are painfully aware that Liberal politicians use the 
information gathered from question No. 19 on the Canadian census 
to appease minority groups to attract votes, so it has another 
purpose. Vote buying.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Ludicrous.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> The member across the way said it is ludicrous to 
say that, but that is exactly what is happening. The Liberal Party 
has been a master at such manipulation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> You should be embarrassed at what you are saying.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> No, I am not embarrassed by what I am saying. I 
think that it is important that Canadians hear it.
<P>
	These same politicians also create quota systems for public 
service jobs. It is a quota system that only impacts in areas where 
the ruling party of the day allows it to take place. It is a form of 
reverse discrimination. It is contrary to the equality of all citizens. 
It sullies our reputation as a country which selects people for jobs 
on the principle of merit rather than socially engineered notions of 
race and entitlement.
<P>
	Let us look further into this point of the census. The state is 
demanding answers that are none of its business. The census also 
asks Canadians to divulge other information: the marital status and 
sex of room mates and/or inhabitants of their home; how much 
money they make; how many books they have read in the past six 
months; how often they take a vacation without the children; how 
many windows they have which face north. That sounds like a real 
valuable piece of information.
<P>
	The government assures respondents that the information 
collected from the census is confidential. I have been in the House 
for about three and a half years. I  realize that the information 
gathered in many of the departments within the government is not 
confidential. It is like a sieve and it leaks out all over.
<P>
	The notion that the records will be kept confidential in my 
opinion is absurd. I believe that a lot of Canadians have the fear 
that it is not as safe as what the government would lead people to 
believe.
<P>
	For the reasons that I have outlined I have to urge that all 
members of the House carefully examine Motion No. 277 and 
support it in a vote.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
too am pleased to be able to have the opportunity to speak to the 
motion of my colleague from Beaver River. I am especially 
thankful for this opportunity, having become a Canadian by choice.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	When I received the census form this year I was one of the 
individuals who received the long one. I cannot say exactly what 
people feel like coming to a country and choosing it to be their 
land. My wife and I came here in 1968 and fell in love with the 
country and wanted to call it home. We chose to be Canadian.
<P>
	Then along came this long census form. We saw choices of what 
to mark but could not mark Canadian because it was not on the 
form. I must admit the hairs on the back of my neck, because that is 
the only place I have any, started to rise. I was getting angry.
<P>
	I thought for a minute I should send a message by putting in 
cocker spaniel. However cocker spaniel did not fit the way I felt at 
the time and I thought pit bull would be better. I wanted to put in 
something to drive home the point that I would like very much as a 
person who has chosen Canada to be my home to write Canadian 
and be proud to do so.
<P>
	I wrote in the word Canadian. I was not going to sit back and say 
it was crazy. I just cannot say how pleased I was to hear from the 
social engineers on that side of the room. That is all this is, social 
engineering. I probably would be one of those who would get in 
trouble for not obeying the rule. We are required to obey rules.
<P>
	However this leads to things that really bothered me. After we 
arrived here we had one child born in Canada. He by birth is a 
Canadian and very proud of it. As a Canadian he took advantage of 
some of the opportunities available to him. He joined the air cadets 
as a young man and spent five to six years in them. He was very 
pleased with that program and I was pleased he did well. After 
graduating from high school it was his desire to become a soldier. 
He wanted to be a little better trained so he decided to go to 
university to take some computer courses, which was a wise thing 
to do, and to join the militia in Red Deer, Alberta.
<P>
	He got acquainted with a group of people and spent two to three 
years in the militia, along with getting some  computer training at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9238"> 9238 </A></B>
<P>
university. When he turned 22 he decided it was time to fulfil his 
life dream to become a soldier in the Canadian army.
<P>
	That is when everything fell apart. At the recruitment office in 
Calgary he was told that because of his physical make-up there 
would be no need for him to apply as a soldier in the Canadian 
army for at least six years. It was necessary to fill the positions 
available with other types of individuals.
<P>
	That is totally shameful. That is exactly what happened. I hope 
the member from Saskatchewan will not bother me with heckling, 
nonsense and hogwash about quotas. I now have a son whose life 
dream is being fulfilled. He got to be a soldier. It is only because of 
where we came from that he was able to go south of the border. 
Within three days the United States army took him because of his 
qualifications. He has now been serving for over a year. He has 
received a promotion and is doing very well. They were quite 
intrigued with his qualifications and took him.
<P>
	In the Canadian army he was told: ``Maybe in six years, but we 
must fill these positions with other types of people''. I thought 
Canadians should be able to fill those positions, particularly 
Canadians who believe in the sovereignty of the land and are 
willing to defend that sovereignty. Then along comes this form 
which does not include the word Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	A lot of things make me very proud to be Canadian. We flew the 
flag shortly after we came here as immigrants, before we qualified 
to become citizens. We were proud to be in Canada so we flew the 
flag. We could not be called Canadian at that time because we had 
not had the opportunity to become one. We went to citizenship 
court five years later when we qualified and walked away very 
pleased to say we were Canadian.
<P>
	Ministers and social engineers on that side of the House figure 
that if they give out 20 million flags and get people to fly them 
everywhere it will be a good sign of their love and pride for the 
country. They have it all wrong.
<P>
	As a result of this census and their so-called magnificent 
employment equity bill, somewhere down the road through all this 
social engineering and finagling even the people in private industry 
will be forced in some way or another to make sure jobs are filled 
with a certain quota. It is there already in a lot of places and it will 
be worse.
<P>
	At least on the census form we could have the word Canadian. I 
really do not think it is a whole lot to ask for. I live in Canada. I 
love the country. I am a member of Parliament. I would have liked 
to be able to freely circle the word Canadian on that long form, and 
it was not even there. That is why I felt like putting pit bull on the 
form.
<P>
	The social engineering that goes on in the House when it comes 
to this kind of stuff makes me feel like a pit bull more days than I 
would like to.
<P>
	I have a son serving with the United States army in Georgia. He 
does not like it down there. He would like to be in the north. He 
would like to be in Canada. People who sit here and heckle, like the 
member from Saskatchewan who heckled my friend from Calgary 
Northeast when he was making his points, make life very difficult 
for those who truly want to be a Canadian and to serve their country 
in the best way they possibly can. They ought to be ashamed of 
themselves for making it virtually impossible for a number of 
Canadians to be able to do that.
<P>
	Flying the flag is not the only thing. There are many other things 
we can do and they do not see it. They are too busy social 
engineering and doing the best they can for themselves.
<P>
	Let us include the word Canadian in these census forms and be 
proud we put it there. It will give people an opportunity to say they 
are Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a delight 
to stand in the House today to lend my support to the motion 
proposed by the member for Beaver River.
<P>
	Sometimes I am asked what it means to be a Canadian. I have a 
number of different pictures in my mind of what it means to be a 
Canadian that are very strong, very emphatic.
<P>
	I am privileged by the fact that my grandparents were literally 
chased out of their home country in 1923. They suffered great 
persecution there. A number of my relatives were unjustly 
murdered. My grandparents knew it was not a safe place for our 
family and wondered where to go. Through various circumstances 
which I do not have time to relate tonight they were able to find 
their way to this wonderful country, Canada.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	I have recollections as a child growing up in a little farmhouse in 
Saskatchewan where I was born and raised. I remember 
overhearing my parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts and some of 
their friends talking about the life they had experienced in what 
they called the old country.
<P>
	They talked about some of the hardships and difficulties they had 
gone through and some of the ways in which their freedoms had 
been totally taken away: their freedom to make a living the way 
they wanted to make a living and their freedom to worship the way 
they wanted to worship. Those freedoms were wrenched away from 
them and they came to this country. I remember them talking about 
how grateful and how blessed we were as a family because we 
could be Canadian.
<P>
	I remember being at the home of my grandparents many times. 
Whether it was to celebrate a birthday,  Easter or Christmas we 
would get together as a family and my grandparents would lead us 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9239"> 9239 </A></B>
<P>
in family prayers. My grandmother was more expressive than my 
grandfather. In her prayers she would say over and over: ``Thank 
you for the privilege of living in this wonderful free country''. 
They came here with 10 children. As an aside, until last year all of 
them were still living. The youngest was 75. I come from hardy 
stock. We live long.
<P>
	My grandparents, my uncles and aunts on both sides of my 
family came to this country as immigrants, worked hard and helped 
to open up the west. They helped to till the land to produce food to 
feed themselves and others. They were as proud as we are to be part 
of this country. My parents were 12 years old when they came to 
Canada so I am a first generation Canadian. I was actually born in 
Saskatchewan. I called that home until I married and moved to 
Alberta. I have very strong attachments.
<P>
	There is especial attachment to the country when one grows up 
in a farm family and tills the soil. There is an attachment to the land 
when one actually works the soil and grows food for sustenance, 
because we all know that without food we would not survive.
<P>
	I have other recollections about being in this country. One of the 
most valuable ones was that of my son who has served in different 
places in the world where people were experiencing the same kinds 
of hardships my grandparents experienced. Because of our family 
heritage, partially at least, he felt it was a useful to spend part of his 
life helping others who were in difficult circumstances. He worked 
with various relief agencies around the world, carrying and wearing 
a Canadian flag. He went there not only in the name of the 
organization he was with but also in the name of our country.
<P>
	A most recent recollection I had of the value of being a Canadian 
was a very moving experience for me. I participated for the first 
time ever in the ceremony of welcoming new Canadians at a 
citizenship court. It happened last year on July 1. We were in the 
historic court house in Fort Saskatchewan. As I recall the court 
house was built before Saskatchewan became a province and joined 
Confederation. It was an historical court house. There we were up 
on the second floor with a number of different people who were 
making Canada their home.
<P>
	One lady in particular struck me. As she reached out to take from 
the presiding judge her citizenship papers there were tears literally 
streaming down her cheeks. It touched me because I had the 
recollection of my grandmother who had that same emotional 
reaction, that tie, that love of this country.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	When I talked to her afterwards she said essentially the same 
thing that my grandmother had said: ``I came from a country of 
great strife and I am so proud, so happy and so blessed to be a 
Canadian''.
<P>
	I do not believe that I can express more strongly or with more 
emotion my support for the bill before the House today. It is a bill 
which says let us call ourselves Canadians. This is the most valued
<P>
part of planet Earth. It is the most enviable place to live. There are 
people around the world who would literally give anything they 
have to live here, but for some reason we are hesitant to say that we 
are Canadians.
<P>
	I thank the House for the opportunity to speak to this motion. I 
urge all members on all sides of the House to support the motion 
not because of any partisan consideration but simply because it is 
the right thing to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very glad to rise to speak to the motion which was introduced by 
the hon. member for Beaver River.
<P>
	I guess you might call me a new Canadian, having been born in 
Scotland. I came here when I was 23 years of age. Unfortunately 
that is quite some number of years ago. I cannot do anything about 
that. Nonetheless, I am a new Canadian.
<P>
	When I go back to Scotland to visit the many relatives and 
friends I still have over there, after a few short weeks I want to 
come back to Canada. This is my home.
<P>
	I have family here. I have a wife and two fine young boys. My 
wife was also born in Scotland. My boys were born here and they 
are Canadian. They think of themselves as being Canadian. They 
have lived in this country or all their lives, apart from a few weeks 
when they visited Europe. What are they forced to put down on the 
census form? Certainly not Canadian.
<P>
	The Prime Minister stands in the House and tells us about how 
this is the greatest country in the world. I endorse that statement. I 
think this is the greatest country in the world and millions of people 
would agree with me. However, let us remember that these people 
built the greatest country in the world. It does not matter if they are 
of Scottish origin, like I and my family, or of the different origins 
which we have heard about in other speeches. They all came here 
with a dream, with a hope, with an aspiration for a new beginning, 
wanting to be Canadian.
<P>
	I came here thinking that I wanted to be Canadian. For over 20 
years I have held a Canadian passport. I am proud of that, yet there 
is nothing I can put down on the census form which salutes and 
recognizes that fact.
<P>
	We have heard other speakers tell about the tragedies of where 
their families came from. One of the great heritages of Canada is 
that while, for example, Scotland has a great history of emigration, 
Canada has a great history of immigration. That is what has made 
this country strong.
<P>
	My Scottish history tells me that a couple of hundred years ago 
the Highlands clearances occurred and Scottish  people's houses 
were burned down and the kids were left to starve in the snow. 
Some of them were able to make their way across the great Atlantic 
Ocean to Canada. While they may have a strong emotional
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9240"> 9240 </A></B>
<P>
attachment to Scotland and call themselves Canadians with 
Scottish roots, many of them have never left this country, and yet 
they cannot call themselves Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	I think back to the last war when Canadians liberated Holland. 
The people of Holland are proud of it and grateful. As we know, 
every year there are hundreds of thousands of bulbs sent over here 
from Holland because the Canadians liberated their land. They 
were not hyphenated Canadians, coloured Canadians, white 
Canadians or other kinds of Canadians. All they know is Canadians 
liberated their land.
<P>
	Even when I was a little fellow back in Scotland they talked 
about how the Canadians had worked around where I grew up and 
the sawmills they built and the work they had done for the war 
effort. They talked about Canadians. When I go over to Scotland on 
a holiday, again these people see us as Canadians and are proud and 
envious of what we have. Yet here in Canada we do not even want 
to recognize who we are with our history of immigration.
<P>
	While people have come from all around the world and from 
desperate situations, each and every one of them has found 
freedom. However, now we find that our freedoms are being 
eroded. They are being pigeon holed, classified and counted 
according to groups so that this government can come out with a 
little subsidy program to say ``we are going to give some money to 
you and to you'' because we are all categorized into different 
groups. There are some of Scottish heritage, some of other 
heritage, some who are black, some who are white, some who are 
crippled, some who are handicapped and so on. The government is 
going to count them all up so that it can see what the differences 
are. That is divisive.
<P>
	When the pioneers came to settle the prairies, I do not think they 
cared two hoots about where a person came from. It was can he 
work and can he put his shoulder to the wheel and does he believe 
in building this wonderful land that we have. That was all that 
mattered.
<P>
	Now, in this great social engineering world that we are in, we 
have to get everybody categorized and pigeon holed so that we can 
design a program to fit them and have them developed down one 
certain road. We are going to help other people develop in a 
different way and somebody else go off in a different way so that 
we can keep ourselves apart. How are we ever going to build this 
national unity, national concept that we are Canadians from coast 
to coast, each and every one of us?
<P>
	It can be done and it will be done eventually in spite of this 
government and in spite of government programs given enough 
time. However, it will take a very long time  if we continue on with 
these divisive types of attitudes, categories, pigeon holes and labels 
and count them all one to ten. Do we deny some people access to a 
career even though they may qualify in merit but they happen to 
come out of the wrong pigeon hole?
<P>
	I have had this happen in my own riding. I have had people in my 
office who had wanted to be members of the RCMP so bad that 
they could taste it. I can think of one fine young gentleman with a 
college degree who spent six hundred hours a year volunteering for 
the RCMP. His older brother is a member of the force. He would 
dearly love to be a member of the force. Wrong pigeon hole. He 
cannot join. He has every qualification in the book that is required 
and then some; yet wrong pigeon hole and he does not qualify.
<P>
	This is the same as the member for Wild Rose. His son, wrong 
pigeon hole and cannot qualify.
<P>
	I dearly love, as a new Canadian, speaking in this House. Think 
what that means when I travel back to Scotland and people say 
``you are a member of Parliament in Canada'' and I say yes. They 
say ``that is fabulous, how you have prospered over there''. I have 
prospered. This country has been very good to me. Why, oh why do 
we deny ourselves the right to call ourselves Canadian? Do we 
deny the concept that we are Canadian, which could build unity and 
harmony within the country, rather than the divisiveness that the 
government wants to devise another program to solve. It is easy, 
Madam Speaker. Listen to the people. Do not listen to the 
government.
<P>
