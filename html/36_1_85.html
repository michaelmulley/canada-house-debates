</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Tillsonburg's Glendale Collegiate was recently profiled in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Glendale, under the leadership of Principal Martin Wylie, is 
pursuing educational opportunities with local businesses.  Using 
funding from the federal and provincial governments and corporate 
donors, Glendale has invested $200,000 in a makeover of its 
machine shop.  This makeover allows high school and college 
students, as well as workers from corporate sponsors to retrain 
and to learn on state of the art computer assisted design 
machines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Glendale has also used HRDC funding to set up a computer 
facility in the guidance department which provides high speed 
access to the Internet, not only for Glendale students but also 
for all of Tillsonburg's elementary school students through 
wireless links.  Additional funding from private sources has been 
the result of a partnership between the school, the community and 
local businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate all those in Tillsonburg, both at Glendale and in 
the community.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>TAX FREEDOM DAY 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, each 
year Canadians across the country celebrate tax freedom day.  This 
is the day when an average wage earner has earned enough to pay 
taxes for the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year tax freedom day will occur in July and later than 
ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contrast, as a result of the efforts of Canadian farmers we 
have a much more encouraging date to celebrate:  food checkout 
day.  This is the day when the average wage earner has earned 
enough to pay for food for the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike tax freedom day which occurs in July, Canadians can 
celebrate food checkout day in February.  It takes less and less 
of our income to pay for our food each and every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the government learned a thing or two from farmers. 
If farmers mismanaged food production the way the government 
mismanages taxes, Canadians would all be starving.

riding, Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, and the riding of Simcoe North 
will host an Industry Canada information fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an excellent opportunity for Industry Canada to showcase 
its impressive array of products and services.  Even more 
important, the fair offers one-stop shopping for small and medium 
size businesses to meet with the consultants and experts from 
Industry Canada.  It is a good opportunity for them to check out 
the programs in one of the many booths at the fair, pick up 
program material and indeed discuss the issues with the Minister 
of Industry himself who will be honoured to be in our riding this 
weekend.

prosperity and social well-being of the community as a whole.

today marks the first day in the final leg of our long journey

<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberal government needs to be condemned for its relentless 
attack on the cornerstone of our society, Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our current tax system discriminates against families who choose 
to have one parent stay at home.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A one income family earning $60,000 pays $7,000 more in taxes 
each year than a family with the same total income but both 
parents in the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that the majority of parents prefer family care 
to day care, one parent cannot stay at home because of the huge 
tax hit they face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My private member's motion, M-369, addresses this very issue and 
calls for taxation fairness for families.  Clearly, Liberals do 
not understand taxation fairness.  They have raised taxes 37 
times and hiked payroll taxes, all contributing to a $3,000 
annual pay cut for the average family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contrast, Reform policies are family friendly.  Our priority 
is the well-being of families, not larger tax grabs.

<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, an important 
decision has been made by the Canadian government on the issue 
of the shipyard in Lévis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dry docks in Lauzon are being sold to Davie Industries Inc. 
as part of the government's strategy to transfer assets to the 
private sector, which is in a better position to manage such 
facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, the facilities include the land, two dry docks and 
all the systems required to operate them. 
The Canadian government will pay $20 million to cover the costs 
of urgent repairs and the forecast net operating cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should note also that the repairs will have a direct 
impact on job creation in this community. Payments for the dry 
dock repairs will be made according to the terms and conditions 
negotiated with Davie Industries, and the company is required to 
operate the facilities for the next ten years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a step in the right direction to boost the economy in 
the city of Lévis and the Chaudière-Appalaches region.

millennium scholarships, the health system, transfer payments

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, 
Quebec finance minister Bernard Landry tabled an excellent 
budget.  With the little leeway available to him, he has shown 
the transparency and ingenuousness his federal counterpart has 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only fly in the ointment is that the President of Treasury 
Board's testy reaction to it was to call Bernard Landry petty 
and ungrateful.  What next!

has to make cuts, those of us in Ottawa will be able to 
demonstrate that we have the means to preserve the future of 
social programs.”  Then, a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister was 
boasting that the federal government would be assuming 90% of 
the costs of the ice storm, when in fact it will barely pay 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a glowing example of the federal government's 
cynicism, pettiness and ingratitude.  The President of Treasury 
Board had nothing to say about the Bernard Landry budget, and 
preferred a personal attack over congratulations for his 
excellent work under the circumstances.  Now, that is pettiness—

support for early retirement and licence buy-out programs, 
self-employment assistance for younger fisher people, community 
economic development assistance and an extension of TAGS until at

<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, tens of thousands of innocent Canadians contracted 
hepatitis C when they received transfusions from the government's 
blood system.  Many are slowly dying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has authorized the health minister to 
compensate some of these victims but he has told the health 
minister to abandon the rest.  He has created a two tier system 
for dealing with victims of government negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the Prime Minister not do the right thing and 
compensate all victims of poisoned blood? 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as we said in the House, there was a period where the 
responsibilities of the government were well established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been dealing with the provincial governments.  The 
provincial governments of all political stripes and the federal 
minister of health have agreed to a scheme to compensate the 
victims of that period, as it is our obligation to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision represents $800 million from the federal government 
and $300 million from the provincial governments.  I think it is 
a very generous program. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is not an administrative issue.  This is a moral 
issue.  It is morally wrong for the government to abandon these 
victims of its own negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is concerned about his place in history.  He 
wants the millennium fund to be a monument to himself and to his 
administration, but if he allows this decision to stand he will 
have his monuments all right, 40,000 of them in the graveyards of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask him again.  Will the Prime Minister do the right thing and 
compensate all the victims of poisoned blood? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this terribly difficult decision was made by 13 governments in 
the country.  All the provincial governments joined with the 
federal government in coming to the conclusion that for the 
period 1986 to 1990, when something could and should have been 
done, government should accept responsibility to compensate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, as the Prime Minister has said $1.1 billion is 
being offered as assistance to the victims who were infected 
during that period, as well as those who were infected by those 
people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have heard this cold-hearted rationalization before. 
It does not address the moral issue that is involved here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no excuse for doing the wrong thing.  There is no legal 
excuse.  There is no administrative excuse.  There is no 
accounting excuse.  There is no political excuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Prime Minister again why he will not do the right 
thing and compensate all the victims of this tragedy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Leader of the Opposition uses high sounding phrases but he 
does not come to grips with the dilemma facing governments in 
this situation, a very difficult dilemma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with a medical and health system in which there 
are sometimes risks.  Before 1986 the risk of infections through 
the blood system was well known.  After 1986 it was known and 
there was something that could have been done about it.  That is 
the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do governments compensate?  Do they compensate women who 
have high risk deliveries and babies delivered with brain damage? 
Do they compensate the people who have anesthetics and suffer 
adverse reactions?  Mr. Speaker, this is—

<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the government used to use a high sounding phrase, that is it 
talked about universality.  The Prime Minister used to say that 
he did not think it was right to have a two tier system in the 
country, but it has all changed now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has told the health minister that there is just not enough 
room in the lifeboats for everybody with hepatitis C.  Only some 
of those who were infected will get any sort of compensation. The 
rest of them will suffer with nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister think there should be a two tier 
system in this instance? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what all the governments of Canada have done, all governments of 
all political affiliation, is apply a single principle.  That 
single principle is that public intervention to offer assistance 
is appropriate when it can be identified that at a point during 
the chronology something could have been done by those 
responsible to change the outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should think through the implications for the 
publicly funded health care system if we are to adopt the 
principle that everyone who is harmed, regardless of any 
circumstance, will be compensated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think it might be wise for the health minister to think through 
the implications for the victims who are suffering today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who were infected it does not matter whether they were 
infected in 1985 or 1986.  All they know is that they have the 
disease and that they are suffering.  What difference does that 
make?  It is still wrong.  These people are still suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is morally responsible because it was a 
government regulated blood system that wrongfully infected all 
these people, regardless of when it happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Prime Minister allowing his health minister to have a 
two tier system set up for this problem?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member ignores distinctions that do not suit her 
purpose.  She is slipping away from the difficult dilemma in 
confronting the difficult principle that has to be brought to 
bear in cases like this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those before 1986 thank God we have a health system in the 
country that will care for them and a standard of excellence to 
look after them in their illness.  Thank God they will be 
treated.  Thank God they will be the beneficiaries of excellent 
research in the country.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET OF QUEBEC FINANCE MINISTER 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, Bernard Landry tabled his budget, a budget that came 
very close to being balanced but that was very tight, a budget 
that had no real room to manoeuvre because of the huge cuts 
imposed by Ottawa on the provinces in the areas of health, 
welfare and post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister not embarrassed that the federal 
government is literally swimming in money, when the provincial 
governments are too strapped to ensure adequate delivery of the 
front-line services for which they are responsible? 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are several provincial governments in Canada.  The great 
majority of them are able to balance their books.  They were 
treated exactly the same as Quebec, but if Quebec had started a 
little earlier, it would have made it on time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> The Prime 
Minister is perfectly right.  If the Liberals had not left a 
deficit of $6 billion and had started to work on it earlier, we 
would now have a budget surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Prime Minister should remember that all the provinces 
feel the way Quebec does about transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister not find it abhorrent that the federal 
government overestimated its deficit by $17 billion, and that it 
is still going ahead and cutting billions from provincial 
budgets, all the while creating new programs in jurisdictions 
where it has no business, just for the visibility? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member should perhaps ask the PQ government whether it 
created a Quebec blood agency just for the visibility, thus 
creating duplication in an area affecting the health of 
Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that we have done our job well here in Ottawa.  We have 
balanced our books.  If Quebec has taken a few years longer to 
do so, it is because Mr. Parizeau wanted to spend the money 
before the 1995 referendum. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if there is a 
financial problem in Quebec, it is because Minister Bourbeau, a 
former Liberal finance minister, left the largest deficit in the 
history of our province. This is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can make all sorts of excuses, but one fact 
remains: the federal government is literally rolling in dough, 
while provincial governments, including those that have balanced 
their budgets, have difficulties making ends meet.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Saturday issue of <I>La Presse</I>, the Minister of Industry was 
quoted as saying “If the year 2000 problem is not sorted out in

is Business Development Bank of Canada loans.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only have we suggested loans, but the Business Development

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

argue on the basis of a moral responsibility that the government 
must have toward its citizens”.

problem.  We have had discussions with the provincial authorities 
who have responsibility in this matter.  After studying the 
problem we came to the conclusion that the period for which

</I></B></P><P align=left>What knowledge did the Minister of National Defence have of 
Serco's multimillion dollar contract winning bid?  Why did the

know that the Government of Canada has made no decision yet with 
regard to the federal contribution toward the games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, if 100% of the amount sought was to be given, it 
would still be a tiny fraction of what is contributed now toward 
the Olympic games, the Commonwealth games or even the Pan

what it would be if that amount was given.

the chief of the Tsuu T'ina reserve is allowed to conduct his own

gloss over the problems as well.  They will not answer the real 
questions, like why Connie and her family lived in shantytown 
conditions on one of Canada's richest reserves. The only way we 
will ever know is for an independent inquiry to look into the 
root causes of the tragedy.

was judged that it was best to build a new station at a point 
south of Lévis. When I discussed this with the hon. member, and I

decision.  He was glad that other alternatives imposed by VIA in 
terms of reversing trains would not go into effect. I am rather 
surprised that six weeks after we announced the decision, he has 
come forward with this question.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To demonstrate the full extent of the apprehension expressed by 
the experts I would like to read directly from a letter addressed 
to the Minister of Justice dated March 30, 1998, signed by Mr. 
Scott Newark, executive director of the Canadian Police 
Association regarding “accuracy of departmental information 
concerning firearms related offences”.  The letter reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Minister: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently our office was supplied with a copy of correspondence 
dated July 21, 1997 between Acting Commissioner Beaulac of the 
RCMP and your deputy, Mr. Thompson, in relation to the above 
noted subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I am sure you can appreciate, the contents of the letter are 
deeply disturbing to those persons or organizations involved in 
the C-68 debate and far more importantly to all of us that 
interact or work with the department of justice on an ongoing 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear that the most senior management of Canada's 
national police force has found it necessary to urge correction 
of grossly flawed and misleading firearms data prepared by the 
justice department in relation to RCMP reported statistics 
concerning firearms used in the commission of crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is worse, as the RCMP letter points out, when the error 
became known to the RCMP following a request for an affidavit in 
relation to the material in the C-68 reference before the Alberta 
Court of Appeal and an attempt to meet with the Canadian firearms 
centre of the department was suggested, the RCMP were rebuffed in 
their efforts to correct the public record which they knew to be 
false.  So serious is their concern that the RCMP appears to have 
taken the view that no such further data can be produced for use 
by the justice department's firearms centre until such time as 
this basic question of system integrity is resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assistant Commissioner Beaulac is also entirely correct to note 
that the situation is severely aggravated by the fact that both 
the previous minister and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of 
Police relied on and made public use of this false data during 
the C-68 debate and subsequent discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must confess to wondering whether the Alberta Court of Appeal 
was notified of the fact that it had inaccurate information 
before it once that fact became known, which according to the 
letter took place in February 1997.  Failure to have done so 
would of course be deeply problematic, especially for the 
department of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our organization, as you know, is asked on a frequent basis to 
comment on the Criminal Code and Firearms Act provisions 
pertaining to the overall regulation of firearms in Canada. We 
view it as nothing short of imperative that there be a source of 
accurate, reliable information available to Canadians on crimes 
involving firearms and that the two leading public institutions 
in this area be in a position to guarantee that this is so. 
Failure to meet these most basic requirements will result in a 
justifiable lack of confidence among Canadians that our 
government knows what it is doing when it purports to regulate 
firearms in the fashion chosen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and in our view equally seriously, an explanation from 
departmental officials as to how this massive discrepancy 
occurred is needed.  Public policymakers have no choice at 
present but to rely on representations made to them by your 
departmental officials as accurate.  In just the recent past our 
organization has felt compelled to seek independent legal 
opinions which were contrary to that put forward by the 
department.  In addition, our warnings concerning the inevitable 
result of C-41's conditional sentencing provision and the victims 
evidence at 745 hearings and C-45 were ignored, only to be proven 
subsequently to be entirely accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both areas, as you recall, needed to be dealt with by amendments 
to “correct” what had been identified as unintended defects in 
the legislative intent of Parliament.  This phenomena of 
unreliability, while annoying for us, is, of course, especially 
serious for the Minister(s) of the Crown who are called on for 
leadership in matters of criminal justice reform and who depend 
on the quality of information and advice given them by their 
officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, in light of the refusal of your officials to provide the 
legal basis for their position respecting the timing of taking of 
DNA samples in C-3, (despite independent legal opinion that they 
are wrong) and your apparent refusal to submit the question to 
the Supreme Court of Canada for constitutional reference, 
confidence in your department to properly design and administer a 
firearms registration system may be called into question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of all of the above, we would seriously appreciate 
knowing what resolution, if any, has been reached concerning the 
matters raised in the acting commissioner's letter.  We ask this 
as, like you, we are committed to ensuring that all of our 
decisions are based on accurate information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sincerely yours,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as my hon. colleague, the member for Crowfoot, has 
pointed out, the premise on which these regulations are based is 
false.  They are before this House on false pretences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only recently we find out that the members of this House were 
presented with false and misleading firearms statistics during 
the debate of Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, by the Minister of 
Justice and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the Reformers or the gun lobby saying this.  It is the 
commissioner of the RCMP saying this in a letter he wrote to the 
Department of Justice on July 21, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So Members of Parliament know exactly what the facts are and so 
there is no confusion from this day forward about firearms and 
violent crime, I want to read the entire text of RCMP 
Commissioner Murray's letter to the deputy minister of justice, 
Mr. George Thomson: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Mr. Thomson: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing to request that the Department of Justice correct 
its representation of the 1993 Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
(RCMP) statistics on firearms involved in crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Around June 1994, the Firearms Control Task Group requested 
information on all files investigated by the RCMP during 1993 
where there was a firearm associated with it.  Since the RCMP 
does not collect statistics on firearms in this format, a special 
software application was written to extract the data for the 
Department of Justice.  The data was provided in electronic 
format with the coding information necessary to interpret the 
date.  The Firearms Control Task Group tabulated the data and 
produced reports without consulting the RCMP staff on the 
accuracy of their interpretation of our data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP became aware that there was a problem with the 
representation of the 1993 RCMP statistics on firearms involved 
in crimes in February 1997, as a result of the correspondence 
from Ms. Wendy Cukier of the Coalition for Gun Control, in which 
she requested an affidavit as to the accuracy of the data in 
Appendix “A”, titled “RCMP (PIRS) Table 2.  Firearms Involved 
In Crime: Type of Firearm Recovered According to Offence”. Ms. 
Cukier required the affidavit for use in the province of 
Alberta's constitutional challenge respecting the Firearms Act. 
The Firearms Control Task Group created Appendix “A” from the 
statistics obtained from the RCMP in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the RCMP had not created Appendix “A”, we extracted the 
1993 data again and tabulated the number of firearms involved in 
a crime under the category of violent offences.  We believe that 
most people would interpret the Appendix “A” caption: 
“Firearms involved in Crime: Type of Firearm Recovered According 
to Offence” to mean a firearm used in the commission of an 
offence. In some cases, without completing a more detailed review 
of the file, it was impossible to make a definite determination; 
therefore, we resolved some of the questionable decisions in 
favour of the Department of Justice findings.  We determined that 
our statistics showed that there were 73 firearms involved in a 
violent crime compared to the Department of Justice findings of 
623 firearms involved in a violent crime.  A further analysis of 
the Department of Justice statistics had not been done due to the 
volume of work involved.  However, a cursory review of the 
remaining 909 cases revealed that only a very small percentage of 
these would meet the definition of a firearm involved in a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to mitigate damages, the Firearms Research Unit, the 
Department of Justice, and Ms. Cukier were notified that the RCMP 
could not provide a affidavit on the accuracy of the 1993 
firearms statistics presented by the Department of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a subsequent meeting with the Firearms Research Unit staff to 
discuss the release of similar 1995 RCMP statistics, they 
presented a report entitled, “The Illegal Movement of Firearms 
in Canada”.  This report contains the same statistics as those 
in Appendix “A”, however, the RCMP statistics are combined with 
those of other major Canadian police forces. The Firearms 
Research Unit representatives believed that the firearms 
identified in Appendix “A” had actually been used in committing 
a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is of particular concern that the Minister of Justice and the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police relied on these 
statistics while Bill C-68 was being processed in Parliament as 
evidenced by statements in the report “Illegal Firearm Use in 
Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A quotation from page 2 of the report states that: “It can also 
been seen that rifles and shotguns were involved in 51% of 
violent firearm crimes, airguns were involved in 19%, and 
handguns were involved in 17% of violent crimes.  The Firearms 
Smuggling Working Group was concerned with a significant number 
of long guns involved in crime.” This statement is not 
significant when we consider that in 1993, the RCMP investigated 
333 actual homicide offences, including attempts, but only 6 of 
these offences involved the use of firearms according to the 
statistics provided to the Firearms Control Task Group. 
Furthermore, the RCMP investigated 88,162 actual violent crimes 
during 1993, where only 73 of these offences, or 0.08%, involved 
the use of firearms. If we display the RCMP 73 offences in the 
same manner as the Firearms Control Task Group, we would say that 
rifles and shotguns were involved in 79.5% of violent firearm 
crimes investigated by the RCMP.  This is not surprising when we 
recognize that rifles and shotguns represent 84.4% of all 
firearms in Canada.  The difference between 623 violent firearm 
crimes credited to the RCMP, compared to the actual number of 73 
is significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Firearms Centre (CFC) staff were unwilling to meet 
to confirm where the problem occurred with the interpretation of 
the 1993 RCMP data. Their efforts were focused on producing a 
report on the 1995 firearms data. The CFC offered to make 
comparisons between the results of their current research project 
and other similar research conducted in the past.  This proposal 
was not acceptable since there was no means to validate the 1993 
data, only a possibility of some comments on differences between 
the findings of the two years. This would leave the 1993 data in 
circulation. The incorrect reporting of the RCMP statistics could 
cause the wrong public policy or laws to be developed and cause 
researchers to draw erroneous conclusions. Considering that the 
data is clearly marked as belonging to the RCMP, we must accept 
ownership and responsibility for the harm the data may cause. For 
these reasons, something must be done to correct the data or 
remove it from circulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the data in our Police Information Retrieval System (PIRS) 
and Operational Statistics Reporting (OSR) special reports is 
open to interpretation, it was necessary to suspend further 
release of similar firearms data pending an agreement on 
regulating this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am, therefore, requesting your assistance to resolve this 
issue. In addition, you may wish to inform the Minister of 
Justice about this issue to ensure that she does not refer to the 
RCMP statistics quoted in the Department of Justice report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sincerely, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>J.P.R. Murray.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the standing committee on justice should have 
the opportunity to reconsider the regulations in light of this 
new evidence and in the light of a letter written by a senior 
research officer from the Canadian Firearms Centre.  It is in the 
Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> today.  In this article he says the RCMP is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to move the following motion and the hon. member from 
Cypress Hills—Grasslands will be seconding this motion. The 
motion reads: 
<A NAME="LINK150">&nbsp;</A>

</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following therefor: the fourth

that they amend the same so as to recommend the deletion of the

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair will consider the admissibility 
of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it gives me real pleasure to speak on this matter. 
The motion put forward by the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville 
is a very important one and one that should cause a great deal of 
concern on all sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there is a great deal of information that has come to 
light in recent days, the correspondence that has been read into 
the record, the references to the fact that the RCMP commissioner 
and members of the RCMP are questioning the validity and the 
accuracy of the statistics, the very statistics used for the 
justification of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was contentious without any of this new information 
that has suddenly come to light. Equally troubling is that 
representations were made by the Department of Justice to the 
Alberta Court of Appeal.  Four provinces and two territories are 
currently debating the constitutionality of Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the hon. member's reference to the six times these 
statistics were referred to in the pleadings at the Alberta Court 
of Appeal.  The mere thought that members of the justice 
department may have knowingly made reference to these statistics 
alone is cause for us to slow down and take a second look before 
this proceeds any further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an incredible revelation to think that this could have 
knowingly occurred.  If the RCMP made reference back in July to 
the department, the commissioner took the time and effort to 
write to the minister or the deputy minister bringing this to 
their attention, telling them that he in fact did not in essence 
want the RCMP's name associated with these statistics.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let's face it, the RCMP's name being associated with these 
statistics and the weight that was placed on that by the 
Department of Justice in justifying its position on Bill C-68 
could be one of the biggest lies ever perpetrated on the Canadian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious allegation and we cannot go any further 
until we get to the bottom of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has suggested that there is a 
methodological approach that would explain this difference and 
how these statistics were spun by the department and that this 
would somehow counteract the RCMP's contention that there is a 
real discrepancy here.  It does not take a great deal of in-depth 
knowledge of criminal law to see that the discrepancy here cannot 
be accounted for by a minor methodological approach in the 
explanation of the use of long guns in violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics are available.  The RCMP is questioning these 
statistics.  It is now saying that it accepts the process that 
may have taken place, but the process is yet unknown.  We have 
not heard from the Department of Justice on what has transpired 
specifically between the RCMP and its department to explain the 
difference in the figures.  I believe this is where we have to go 
next before we proceed any further with this very contentious 
piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there was not a 
question there, but I have to make another comment in regard to 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Crowfoot has read a letter from Mr. Scott 
Newark, the executive officer of the Canadian Police Association, 
who has grave concerns in regard to this.  We have the 
commissioner of the RCMP who has stated in his letter that 
incorrect reporting of the RCMP statistics could cause the wrong 
public policy or laws to be developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, what else do we need?  That should be enough to 
cause unanimous consent in this House at this time to not concur 
with the regulations that have been tabled in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very serious matter.  I think every member sitting here 
realizes that we have put into place some regulations that we 
should not have done on the basis of incorrect information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair is of the view that the 
amendment proposed by the hon. member is in fact in order. 
Accordingly, I will put the motion to the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the

once again very disappointed that the opposition party

<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to stand before the House and speak to Bill C-37 
which is known as the Judges Act.  Among other things this bill 
increases the number of appeal court judges from 10 to 13.  It 
increases the number of unified family court judges from 12 to 
36.  It also increases judges' salaries retroactively from April 
1, 1997 to March 31, 1998 by 4.1% and by an additional 4.1% the 
following year.  That makes it 8.2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to take a different approach in speaking to this bill 
today.  I want to talk about some of the judges in our country 
who are basically making really stupid decisions.  This motivates 
me to say that anybody in this day and age who is picking up 8.1% 
should really be doing a good job at all times and should be 
deserved of an 8.1% raise.  I do not think anyone in private 
industry is getting that, so there must be something 
extraordinary about the judges in our land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about some of these stupid decisions.  As well, I 
want to talk about the Canadian judicial council which makes 
recommendations about judges and things that should happen in 
judge land.  Quite frankly, Bill C-37 does not address any of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed that the government tabled Bill C-37 and 
did not address some of the things that some judicial councils 
were asking for.  It is typical of our country.  We give a raise 
but we do not ask whether it is deserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about three issues in my riding. I could name 
more from some of these witty judges.  I first want to talk about 
Judge Harry Boyle.  I have taken Harry Boyle's name and I have 
plastered it across the country because Judge Harry Boyle has 
made a dreadful mistake in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young lady by the name of Diane was violently raped by a 
fellow by the name of Darren Ursel in my riding.  As Darren Ursel 
went through the court system he went before Harry Boyle. He said 
“Judge, I am sorry for what I have done.  I have been tender at 
times.  Gee whiz, you know it is only the first time I have got 
caught”. Judge Harry Boyle said “Son, that sounds like a pretty 
good reason to me”.  He gave Darren Ursel a conditional 
sentence, not one scrapping day in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the other side might say “Here comes that Reformer. 
He picked an isolated case in trying to justify his position and 
that is a terrible thing”.  I am going to go through a number of 
cases in my riding alone.  I could talk here all day about 
hundreds of judicial decisions all across this land that are not 
only irresponsible but are absolutely preposterous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know Diane quite well.  We fought together to try to get 
appeals.  We tried to coerce the legal industry into 
acknowledging that this was such a terrible mistake.  We profiled 
the issue.  We profiled and profiled it again until we did get an 
appeal.  The appeal worked.  Under pressure this creep got two 
years in jail, minus I believe the time that he was running 
around in our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we say about Judge Harry Boyle?  Judge Harry Boyle, do 
not come to me and ask for an 8.2% increase.  I would have you 
off the bench, quite frankly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about Judge T. D. Devitt in Abbotsford, my hometown. 
There is a fellow by the name of William Gibson Brown who did a 
lot of time for violently raping a woman. 
He did about seven years out of the eleven he was supposed to 
serve. In this day and age I suppose that is a lot of time. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He got out into my community and was charged for molesting five 
young people. The lawyers got together and tried to do a little 
plea bargaining.  They got it down to molesting a couple of 
children. The lawyers went before Judge T. D. Devitt and Judge 
Devitt said “It does not sound like you are all that bad.  I am 
going to give you a conditional sentence”, and so he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The man got no time in jail. The man walked away from molesting 
children in my community after he violently raped a woman.  The 
judge said that he must be an okay guy, so he got no time in 
jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very shortly after he walked out of the courtroom on his 
conditional sentence, he molested a five year old in my 
community. I talked to the mother.  She does not believe in the 
justice system.  She does not believe in judges.  Quite frankly, 
I believe in her judgment that she should not believe in judges. 
It is hard to understand a judge's decision on something like 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read some statements about William Gibson Brown.  This 
comes from the parole board. Although Brown presented a 
willingness to take counselling, prior parole board records show 
that Brown “appears totally normal, he remains a very cynical, 
angry man. He cannot or will not accept that he needs help.  He 
would not guarantee that he would not offend again.  Clearly the 
man is deteriorating and is more dangerous now than when I saw 
him two years ago”. That is a man who got a conditional sentence 
from a judge and has now molested another child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1994 National Parole Board report said that the risk to 
reoffend was very high and release would only put a community at 
risk.  The board member was of the view that detention until 
warrant expiry was confirmed.  And a five year old boy and a 
mother are wondering what the heck is wrong with this justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Judge Devitt in my riding who might some day come to me and 
ask for an 8.4% raise, I would say absolutely not.  He does not 
even deserve to be on the bench.  That is what I would say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at Howie Slaunwhite.  I talked to Howie the other 
day.  Most of us in this country would say that if some criminal 
were to walk through our doors and molest our children or our 
wives, we would beat them or take a gun to them.  Today, most of 
us say that we would protect our own land, our own families, our 
own rights and our own turf.  That is what we would say.  That is 
what Howie said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened is that the perpetrator in Port Alberni molested 
Howie's 15-year old daughter.  Howie took a bat to him and I am 
glad he did because the justice system does not work well. So 
Howie is guilty of assault.  Bad guy, Howie.  That is not right. 
I would admit that.  So the man would go before a judge and in my 
mind the judge would say “That is wrong, we will give you a 
suspended sentence, perhaps”. What actually happened was that 
the molester, Stephen Mack, was convicted and jailed for 10 
months.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While in prison this molestor took out a civil case and went to 
another judge, Judge Lathleen Downes.  Judge Downes awarded the 
perpetrator, while in prison, $42,000 out of Howie's pocket. 
Howie had to get a lawyer who of course whips out his own wallet 
and says it will cost him $15,000.  Now Howie is up to close to 
$60,000 which he cannot afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to wonder in this land what is wrong with this system 
when the father of a molested child is treated worse than the 
criminal.  Today he will very likely not spend 10 months, like 
the perpetrator, but 10 years trying to pay the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone asks me whether I would give Judge Kathleen Downes an 
8.4% increase I would say absolutely not.  I would debench her. 
That is what I would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a couple of other minor issues to what these 
Liberals have often said to me in this House, like Judge Peter 
Vanderhoof, while he described a three year old girl after 
sentencing her attacker to 18 months probation for sexual 
interference.  Judge Vanderhoof called this three year old girl 
sexually aggressive in his defence of the criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these people on the other side, if Judge Vanderhoof asked 
for an 8.4% increase, the answer in Bill C-37 should be 
absolutely not.  He should be debenched for such stupidity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have so many issues I do not know where to start.  Here is a 
fellow who likes to tape me on the radio so that someday he might 
like to sue me.  I welcome him because not being a lawyer I would 
love to defend my own case against this fellow.  Would he ever 
have the spotlight on him.  Port Hardy, B.C. provincial court 
Judge Brian Sanderson gave 57 year old Vernon Logan “an absolute 
discharge” even though Logan pleaded guilty to possessing child 
pornography.  The judge said: “The law banning child pornography 
violates the charter of rights because it is an infringement of 
one's freedom of thought, belief or opinion, as unfettered access 
to reading material is necessary to exercise those freedoms”. 
This is a judge who makes a decision that child pornography is 
okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope you are watching, Brian, because he listens to me enough. 
If Brian Sanderson comes to me and asks for an 8.4% increase I 
would say absolutely not.  You, sir, are a disgrace and should be 
debenched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Snow was charged in Vancouver with kidnapping two women 
and trying to strangle a third.  “I cannot conclude”, says the 
judge, “that the placing of the wire around the neck of the 
victim and the placing of the plastic over her head are 
sufficient to establish intent to kill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government has any idea of what a bill about judges 
should be all about, it only has to listen to this kind of 
stupidity.  To insult the rest of us in Canada with an 8.4% raise 
for this fellow, the answer should be absolutely not.  He should 
not be sitting on the bench. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are disgraceful and I have piles of them mounting every 
day.  It is sick.  We cannot forget Howard Wetson, the judge in 
Manitoba.  He is a federal court judge.  A year ago he decided in 
another ridiculous ruling that federal prisoners have the right 
to vote under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
Prisoners having the right to vote is absurd.  If Howard Wetson 
would like a raise please, Howard, apply to me for your 8.4%.  I 
would say, sir, you do not deserve a raise and you should not be 
sitting on the bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what the judges of Canadian judicial 
organizations say.  What should happen to the judicial system? 
They made a recommendation for open disciplinary hearings against 
judges to the public.  Is that in Bill C-37?  Absolutely not. 
Another recommendation is to limit the terms of chief justices in 
most courts to seven years.  That came from the justice system 
itself. Is that in Bill C-37?  Absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong with the mentality of this House today. 
There is a head in the sand approach.  We want to disregard the 
obvious that the once proud justice system of Canada has 
deteriorated into a legal industry.  Many judges are put in their 
position because it is who they know and who they work for.  It 
is not necessarily for their relevance, decision making or their 
knowledge of the law.  It is not about their integrity.  It is 
all about this system of patronage which has become a national 
disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government really wants to do something useful why not 
take Bill C-37 and stick it on the desk of a bunch of lawyers and 
keep it there.  Take it to the people and ask them what is wrong 
with the Canadian judicial system today. Ask them if they like 
the decisions of Howard Wetson.  Ask them if they like Harry 
Boyle's decision and ask them what they would like to do with 
judges and how to react to a system that no longer works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why we do not examine lawyers before appointment to the bench, 
why we do not disclose their qualifications, skills and abilities 
to the public before they are appointed I do not know.  I do not 
understand why we do not end political appointments.  I do not 
know why we do not have more predictability in sentencing. Why we 
do not continuously test and time limited appointments I do not 
know.  Why we do not have a national code of conduct for conflict 
of interest rules for judges as the Canadian Judicial Council 
recommended I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-37 is all about more bureaucracy and money in the pockets 
of judges.  I would not give one scrapping cent to the judicial 
system until I was satisfied if worked properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Psychotic killer Michael Kueger was awarded $2,250 for being 
inconvenienced during a labour dispute at Oakridge prison.  He 
killed someone in 1991.  The judge said: “He was inconvenienced 
for denial of showers, therapy and swimming pool”.  That is 
after he gave a class action suit award of $45,000 to 11 
prisoners.  Just ask me if that judge would get one red cent out 
of my pocket.  I would have him debenched like the others I spoke 
about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is a long held 
tradition, cited many times in Beauchesne's and other references, 
that when we as members of Parliament speak of others in high 
office, particularly when they are not in a position to defend 
themselves, we exercise extreme caution in doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a ruling I am making. This is a longstanding 
tradition in our Parliament that we be cautious when we attack 
individuals or groups, particularly in the judiciary, and those 
who are unable to come in here and have the same right of free 
expression as we enjoy with impunity here. I make that as a point 
of interest to all hon. members. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order. I do not want to get into a row with 
the Chair but the fact of the matter is Bill C-37 is about 
judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I come to the House of Commons with my colleagues to talk 
about issues that are relevant to a bill called the Judges Act, 
by the way, then we should have every right to stand in this 
House and talk about the real problems and not about the 
irrelevance put in the nature of that bill by the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is precisely 
the reason the member was not interrupted in debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
a little puzzled. There was no point of order raised. There was 
no one questioning the speech of the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford.  There was no interruption. There was no 
point of privilege, order or anything else.  I do not understand 
why Mr. Speaker chose to read to us from Beauchesne's when no one 
has protested or found anything wrong with the speech just made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is a good precedent for the Chair to be 
instructing members when no one in this place has found anything 
wrong with the speech was just made.  I urge the Speaker to 
remember that he can rule on points of order.  He can interpret 
precedents for us.  But to try to instruct members of the House 
and members of the opposition on what kind of speeches to make or 
when to make them, I think Mr. Speaker should be very careful 
about setting that kind of precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I take the hon. 
member's point under advisement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened attentively to the intervention from the official 
opposition and the House leader.  I know from time to time 
Speakers have traditionally advised the House wisely in such 
matters and I certainly do not concur or agree for one moment 
with my respected colleague opposite, the whip of the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> You were not even in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  The member is correct in reminding the 
House that I was here.  I was sensitive to the approach taken in 
the speech by his hon. colleague who I know has very strong views 
and feelings on this issue.  His commitment to judicial issues 
and his passion to the topic is well documented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the strong feelings any of us might have on an 
issue such as this, when we are dealing with other people of 
integrity and people in offices such as the judiciary, I believe 
we are well to be reminded by the Chair to respect the traditions 
of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I did not rise during his speech in the same fashion as 
the Chair chose to act, I was certainly as sensitive to the 
issue.  I am pleased that the Chair did raise this to remind us. 
We should keep this in mind when dealing with an issue such as 
this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if you could perhaps provide a little further 
advice because I am slated on the Speaker's list to speak next to 
this bill and I am fairly concerned. 
Obviously I do not want to run afoul of your ruling, Mr. Speaker. 
I want to be very cautious in my approach.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Let us just take it 
from here then.  It is understood that because of the nature of 
the debate and the topic that is being debated, in general terms, 
it is fair ball.  If members refer to a specific individual who 
does not have the same privilege to defend himself or herself 
with the same impunity in the Chamber, that is where we get into 
the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general terms it is quite appropriate because what we are 
talking about is the remuneration of the judiciary.  What we are 
not talking about is the individual conduct of a particular 
member of the bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to make two quick 
points on this.  One is that Reformers were sent here to try to 
set some traditions of their own.  How are traditions set? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, when we came here we could not even refer to the other 
place.  There have been a lot of issues raised about a certain 
senator, Mr. Andrew Thompson, who has been mentioned by name 
here.  I do not recall the Speaker shutting down the official 
opposition when we were questioning— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I can speak to the point of order or I can go on to 
questions and comments, whatever you choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Questions and 
comments, the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest and then we 
will go to the hon. member for Charleswood—Assiniboine. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, just for the benefit of Canadians who might be watching, 
in terms of my comments and my question to the hon. member, he 
mentioned at the tail end of his last remarks what in fact we are 
debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not debating a revamping of the Judges Act.  We are 
debating amendments to the Judges Act.  The summary of those 
amendments is as follows:  to provide changes to salaries and in 
respect of eligibility for an annuity; to make additional changes 
to the judicial annuity scheme; to establish a Judicial Benefits 
and Compensation Commission; and to provide authority to pay 
additional appeal court and unified family court judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about compensation for judges.  In this bill we 
are not talking about the removal of judges.  We are not talking 
about conditional sentencing under the Criminal Code.  That has 
nothing to do with Bill C-37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a couple of comments to the hon. member and then 
ask him a couple of specific questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I want to say that, as usual, his speeches are 
entertaining and easy to listen to.  He makes good points.  He is 
also perhaps a little bit loose with the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned a number of judges.  I was wondering how many of 
those judges are provincial court judges, appointed by various 
provincial governments across the country.  The reason I am 
wondering this is because after each of the horror stories that 
the hon. member mentioned he blamed the people on this side of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He answered his own question when he referred to Brian 
Sanderson.  He indeed is a provincial court judge.  That has 
nothing to do with the federal government.  It has nothing to do 
with Bill C-37.  It has absolutely nothing to do with an 8.5% pay 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are all of the judges that were mentioned by the hon. member 
federal appointments?  If they are— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry, we have 
to keep going.  The member for Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can read a list of 
hundreds of decisions like this from federal court judges.  There 
is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I tried to express to the member and to all of those 
listening is that the issue of judges and their decisions is 
important in our society today.  I am really not interested in 
which court they are.  Some of them are federal, yes.  They may 
even be supreme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the real issue.  I think the member missed the whole 
point.  There were numerous recommendations made by the Canadian 
Judicial Council to change the system that has gone astray.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those recommendations were made after numerous studies and yet 
this government tables a bill called Bill C-37, the Judges Act, 
which will give judges an 8%-plus increase.  My message, 
therefore, is if we cannot get the judicial system corrected, why 
on earth would this government bring in a raise for judges? There 
is something wrong with the mentality of this thought. This is 
not brain surgery, it is reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started my debate off by expressing some serious concerns 
about judicial decisions in my riding.  These decisions, whether 
they are provincial, municipal, supreme court or federal court, 
are just plain stupid.  Judges should beware.  There are hundreds 
of thousands of people today who are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are appalled to hear that this government has brought in 
a bill concerning a pay raise for judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For somebody to tell me, quite frankly, that I cannot refer to 
judges in my riding, I do not accept that.  I am here to 
represent the people of my community.  They know what and who I 
am talking about.  That is the bottom line here, is it not? 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member just said that the people listening to him right now know 
who he is talking about.  The problem is that they do not know. 
He is singling out criminal court judges, yet there are all kinds 
of judges in this country who work not only in criminal courts 
but in civil courts.  This hon. member smears all of them with 
his irresponsible remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that the work of the judges is important.  He then turns 
around and sullies every single judge, whether provincially 
appointed or federally appointed in this country.  I would expect 
a lot more responsibility from a member of the Reform Party who 
is constantly talking about responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments he has made in the last few minutes absolutely 
leave me abhorred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that he would not give any judge one red cent 
until he knows that the system is working properly.  Based on 
what this gentleman says, does anyone really think that the 
judicial system will ever work well in his eyes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just say a couple of things— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if this member does not 
like what I say, that is just too darn bad, is it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is, I made it abundantly clear in each and every case 
that if that specific judge asked me for an increase the answer 
would be no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This thick Liberal mind over here says I smeared every judge. He 
does not understand.  I can appreciate that because it is his 
party and probably a lot of work from himself which has put this 
bill in front of us rather than a bill to change the judiciary as 
even the judicial council would like it to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the members on the other side do not like what is happening 
in the judicial system, then they should change it.  If they are 
not going to listen to the judicial council in this country, then 
I guess they should go on their merry way and allow stupid 
decisions like this to continue.  After all, this is a Liberal 
government, is it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say once again that the bottom line is that they may not 
like what I have to say, but one day they are going to darn well 
listen.

correct me if I am wrong, but I believe we were elected by the 
people of Canada, who are the rightful employers of civil

</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges are civil servants.  What other recourse do the people of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for

may or may not have been directed to the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is too bad we did not 
allow that fellow over there to speak again because I would like 
to have at him for a couple more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the Liberal government does not understand where we come 
from because it is out of touch with some of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read about some very profound issues that are happening 
in or near my riding.  They are happening in every riding, except 
his of course, every day, all day long and people are just darn 
sick of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one piece of advice to give this government.  Do not 
bring in bills like Bill C-37, the Judges Act, to give judges a 
raise until the system is fixed.  What is so hard about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is my duty 
pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows:  the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington, Organized 
Crime; the hon. member for Delta—South Richmond, Fisheries. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, you would think the number of times I rise to speak in 
the House, and the number of times you happen to be the Speaker 
in the chair, that we would be working a little bit closer 
together on my riding, and some other issues of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed a pleasure for me to rise and speak to Bill C-37, 
despite the acrimony we have just witnessed in the Chamber.  It 
is a piece of legislation that certainly needs to have a number 
of points of view brought forward on it.  It is an act to amend 
the Judges Act and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to some remarks that were directed at my 
colleague for Langley—Abbotsford during the question and comment 
period following his presentation.  In speaking to this bill or 
any justice bill we have to address the issue of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the question was asked by the representative for 
Nanaimo—Cowichan that if we cannot raise these specific cases in 
the Chamber where we have immunity from prosecution, as sensitive 
as they are and perhaps as insensitive as it appears we are in 
raising them, then where can we raise them?  I think that is a 
valid question to ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I think my colleague from Langley—Abbotsford was referring 
to is the growing resentment across this nation.  It is 
frightening, quite frankly.  There is a growing resentment on the 
part of grassroots Canadians toward our legal system.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of it is the issue of decisions made by judges.  If we are 
doing our job properly as representatives of the people, we have 
to raise these issues on behalf of Canadians who are crying out 
for justice, those thousands of Canadians who appear every day in 
court perhaps as victims or perhaps as family or friends of 
victims and fail to see justice done in the decisions made by 
judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of nights ago in our shadow cabinet we had the 
advantage of having a police chief from one of the larger 
communities in Canada appear before us to speak about some of 
these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One point came home to me as I listened to this police chief who 
has been involved for a number of years, far too many years, in 
trying to raise the issues of gang related violence, youth crime 
and the drug problem in Canada today.  I could sense his 
frustration as a chief of police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could speak about members of the police force in my riding of 
Prince George—Peace River who have conveyed that same 
frustration to me which they face on a daily basis, not only as 
they go about doing their job but when they appear in court 
before the judges to whom Bill C-37 is to give a raise.  We are 
to reward them and give them a raise.  That frustration is 
growing not only on the part of police officers and crown 
prosecutors who work diligently every day to try to put some of 
these horrendous criminals behind bars but on the part of the 
average citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues said “and keep them there”, a very 
important point.  It is not enough to go through the process of 
the police doing their job collecting evidence, catching the 
criminal and bringing him before the judge and of crown 
prosecutors doing their job if it means nothing in the end, if 
the person either walks scot-free because of a technicality or 
because a judge for whatever reason decides to hand down some 
lenient sentence and the victim sitting in the court that day 
does not see justice done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these decisions cannot be defended.  I believe that is 
what my colleague from Langley—Abbotsford was trying to show. 
Despite the intervention of the member opposite, I do not believe 
the member in his speech was trying to smear all judges. 
Certainly that is not what I got from the speech.  Maybe the 
member opposite heard a different speech from what I heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is terribly important that we as representatives of the 
people raise these issues in doing our job.  How can we do this 
if we have to talk about them as was said by the hon. government 
whip, in generalities and not cite some specific examples? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we make the case for the viewing audience at home that we 
understand and have seen the reports in newspapers about a 
decision that was rendered but we as the official opposition, as 
Reformers, do not agree with those decisions and think they are 
bad decisions?  They are not only bad decisions for us as 
official opposition but they are bad decisions, more important, 
for the Canadian people and for the justice system. 
That is what brings all judges and all justices into disrepute, 
not something my colleague from Langley—Abbotsford could 
possibly say in the Chamber.  It is the stupid decisions, to use 
his term, that have been made from coast to coast about which the 
average citizen reads in his daily newspaper.  Those are the 
things that bring the justice system into the greatest disrepute, 
not what we say here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the gravest injustices would be if we as Reformers and as 
the official opposition ever felt muzzled to the point where we 
could not raise such issues in the Chamber.  It would be a grave 
injustice for every single victim that every felt betrayed by the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, you will grant me a bit of leniency; I 
seem to have strayed a bit from Bill C-37, as did my colleague. 
Justice issues are near and dear to the heart of not only members 
of the official opposition but I am sure to ever member of 
Parliament on all sides of the House.  I believe all members in 
the House care very deeply about justice or injustice in our 
country.  Although we obviously do not share the same points of 
view on how to fix the system, there is an awareness that 
something needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our view that to bring forward Bill C-37 at this time to 
give judges raises—and we can argue on a individual basis 
whether or not it is deserved—is an insult to Canadians when so 
much needs to be fixed in the justice system.  It is not just our 
saying it.  We hear it every time we go back to our ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current justice minister has been talking about making 
changes, for example, to the Young Offenders Act ever since she 
was given that portfolio.  We have yet to see legislation tabled 
in the House dealing with the very serious problems of youth 
crime in Canada.  This was another one of the other issues the 
police chief discussed with the official opposition shadow 
cabinet the other night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is Bill C-37 all about?  It increases the number of appeal 
court judges from 10 to 13.  It increases the number of unified 
family court judges from 12 to 36.  I do not have a problem with 
that.  There is certainly a case to made for more resources in 
certain areas.  The official opposition has noted that there is a 
need for more resources in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get back to the point by one of my colleagues during 
questions and answers on the issue of accountability.  I raised 
the question with the police chief the other night.  Referring to 
the issue of organized crime, he said that they had the people to 
do the job but did not have enough resources.  It costs a lot of 
money to investigate criminal activity. 
Some of these investigations take years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked him what good it did.  I am not opposed to seeing more 
judges in certain areas because there is a need.  What good does 
it do in the case of organized crime if we allocate more 
resources, spend more money, get more investigators, go after 
them, get them in court and a judge rules on a technicality and 
they walk?  What message does that send? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worse than doing nothing.  It is incredibly frustrating to 
police, prosecutors and everyone involved in the case.  Why I say 
it is worse than doing nothing is that once again it sends the 
wrong message.  It sends a message to the criminals that they can 
get away with it, that crime does pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A criminal can do some of the most horrendous things and be 
hauled into court perhaps after years of intense investigation by 
the police or special investigators who have done a superb job on 
a case put together over months by a prosecutor.  The criminal 
goes before a judge and the judge rules on a technicality or on 
precedent and gives a slap on the wrist.  A drug dealer who makes 
hundreds of thousands of dollars gets a fine of a few thousand 
dollars, walks out of the court and laughs in the policeman's 
face.  What message is that sending? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to accountability.  By all means more resources 
should be put into it, but let us ensure that judges themselves 
are held accountable for the decisions rendered.  There has to be 
some way in which they can be held accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the only way to hold them accountable is in the court 
of public opinion.  If enough people from coast to coast get fed 
up with the system and hold rallies, including tens of thousands 
of people on Parliament Hill, then maybe the government will wake 
up and bring in the necessary changes instead of bringing forward 
Bill C-37 to increase judges' salaries retroactively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several members have used various figures:  8.2% combined over 
two years and 8.4% or 8.5%.  I am not a mathematician but I am 
told it would be about 8.3%.  I will take the middle ground.  I 
want to compare it to the RCMP officers on the ground who are 
doing a real tough job.  On Friday, March 27, 1998, RCMP officers 
secured a pay raise of 2% retroactive to January 1.  They will 
receive a second increment of 1% on April 1, 1998 and an 
additional .75% on October 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something is wrong with this picture.  Currently judges on 
average are making about $140,000 a year and are to get 4.1% 
retroactive to last April and another 4.1% for April 1, 1998 to 
March 31, 1999.  From talking to members of the RCMP in my riding 
I find that many of them are moonlighting right now.  I do not 
know if members across the way are aware of this fact. 
They are finding it really tough to raise their families and make 
a go of it on an RCMP constable's wage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People might ask what this has to do with the judges bill.  We 
are talking about one segment of the justice system, the judges, 
getting a substantial increase to what I would consider to be a 
pretty fair wage now of $140,000 on average, whereas the starting 
salary for a third year constable is going to go from $50,508 to 
$52,423, about a $1,500 increase. Under this government's tax 
policy, I would question how much of that is actually going to 
remain in their pockets to help them feed their wife or husband 
as the case may be, and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of a female RCMP officer in my hometown who is 
waitressing on the side to try to make a few extra bucks.  I know 
of another one who lives just down the block from me who runs a 
bulldozer in the oilfield on his days off to try to make enough 
money.  Yet we are giving judges an 8.3% increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying about this bill is not so much whether the bill 
is good or bad but that we have to address the issue of 
accountability.  I want to make it perfectly clear for the 
members across the way I am not saying that all judges should be 
tarred with the same brush.  There are some excellent judges. I 
believe the vast majority are excellent judges, doing a fine job 
and working long hours.  It is those other judges.  It is just 
like people in this Chamber.  It is the same old story.  It is 
the few bad apples who spoil the reputation of all.  We can 
certainly use that same analogy when it comes to politicians, can 
we not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real failing here is not this legislation but the fact that 
it has been brought forward instead of a victims bill of rights, 
instead of amendments to the Young Offenders Act and instead of 
changing the fact that conditional sentencing is still being used 
by some judges to release violent offenders into our communities 
after they have been found guilty and have served no jail time. 
Those are the types of laws the official opposition is looking 
for from this government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to say to the hon. member that we on this side do not want to 
muzzle him or members of the Reform Party when it comes to 
talking about judges or any other particular issue.  We just want 
to have them show some responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member suggested that judges across the country should 
be made more accountable.  It sounds good.  I think we are all in 
favour of accountability but what does that really mean?  For 
example, if a judge renders a sentence that is unpopular to the 
hon. member from Prince George or anybody from the Reform Party, 
does that mean the judge should be fired?  We have to think this 
through.  If we say that to judges, it is a measure of 
intimidation.  Are we going to get the kind of independence from 
judges if that is the kind of accountability the hon. member is 
suggesting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make one other point.  The hon. member from Prince George 
stumbled upon what I think is a very good question.  He asked 
what is justice.  It is a pretty profound question.  I would like 
to ask a question in return.  Does the Reform Party suggest that 
unless we have the death penalty we cannot have justice?  Does 
the Reform Party suggest that if we do not abolish the parole 
system we cannot have justice?  Does the Reform Party suggest 
that if we do not put people away in jail and throw away the key 
that we cannot have justice?  Is that what the members of the 
Reform Party are saying? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of what is justice is very profound. 
However at the end of the day we need a justice system that 
serves the entire populace.  All of us.  The entire community. It 
includes those who have been victimized and those who are 
responsible for protecting our society.  And yes, it includes 
even those who commit a crime. If they are young, 9 or 10 years 
of age, it is not in the interests of the population to put them 
away for 30 or 40 years. We want them changed so they will lead a 
productive life eventually.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was quite a rant. I will 
try to respond to some of the issues the hon. member raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset when he rose to speak in response to the speech 
made by my hon. colleague from Langley—Abbotsford, he suggested 
that my colleague was smearing all judges.  I think I dealt with 
that fairly extensively in my presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member indicated what he was getting at was that the 
official opposition, the Reform Party, should show some 
responsibility. I would contend that we are being responsible for 
the reasons I gave in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we cannot raise these types of issues here, what does he 
want?  Does he want us to sweep it under the carpet?  That is 
what the Liberals have been doing for many years.  They have been 
turning a blind eye to these things. They say “We cannot raise 
that.  We cannot criticize judges. Who are we to criticize the 
decisions made by judges?” Well, if not us, then who? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said I stumbled upon the issue of justice during 
my speech.  I think I laid it out quite clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague talked about the death penalty. Obviously that does 
not sit well with the hon. member.  We Reformers have 
communicated our position on the death penalty very well, ever 
since the party was formed.  We believe, unlike the government, 
in bottom up democracy.  We believe there should be a national 
referendum held at the time of a national election so there would 
be a very small cost to it. Then we would have the will of the 
people on the issue of the return of capital punishment.  I 
personally support that. Ever since I have been an MP I have 
brought forth private members' legislation to reinstate capital 
punishment. The Reform Party's official position is that the 
people should make decisions on moral issues such as this, not 
the politicians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member mentioned that he believes all members in this House 
are in favour of justice.  I would concur that all members indeed 
should be in favour of justice. It is for this very reason that I 
have difficulty supporting Bill C-37.  There is a very serious 
injustice being discussed here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are discussing a bill which would in effect give to judges 
raises of approximately 8.4%. With no disrespect to any judges or 
any group of people which the government might consider giving a 
raise to, I find it difficult to consider giving a raise to 
people when the government has failed and continues to fail to 
settle the pay equity concerns of over 200,000 current and former 
employees of the Public Service Alliance of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous people to whom the government owes money, yet 
the government fails to come to grips with this. It is the result 
of a law that was introduced by the same Liberals 20 years ago. 
We have a complaint that has been outstanding for about 14 years 
and today we are debating a bill that would give others a raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my constituency question me daily regarding what we 
are doing about their pay equity.  They want to know when the 
government will pay them what they are due. And then I am 
expected to support the government giving an increase to another 
group when it fails to look after people to whom money is already 
owed.  I see that as a very serious injustice, one which I think 
should be addressed.  Until that kind of justice prevails, it 
will be very hard to support a bill which gives a raise to any 
group of people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not hear a question in 
my hon. colleague's remarks.  He raises a valid point, although 
his remarks about pay equity I do not think apply specifically to 
Bill C-37 which we are debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has raised the issue of equity.  I tried to deal in a 
small way with that issue as well in my presentation.  I referred 
to the fact that why have we singled out the judges and said that 
they deserve an 8.3% increase compounded over two years but not 
the RCMP officers or that the RCMP officers get a fraction of 
that amount.  What about the crown prosecutors?  What about the 
people who are in the trenches slogging it out trying to make 
this justice system work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said in my presentation that a lot of judges are trying hard 
to make the system work. Despite the comments made by myself and 
others, there are judges who have made a lot of good decisions. 
We could run through a list of them and name them too.  But when 
we want to raise the issue of what is wrong with the system, we 
want to raise the decisions that do not garner the support in the 
real world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this Chamber what we are supposed to talk about when we are 
debating legislation is how it impacts in the real world outside 
these walls, this hallowed hall of Parliament.  That is what we 
are supposed to be talking about.  That is what my colleagues and 
I when we are talking about Bill C-37 are going to be trying to 
bring to the attention of the government and of the viewers 
watching in the real world.  It is, what are the failings of this 
legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from the NDP remarked, he sees the failings as 
the mere fact that the government is bringing forward this 
legislation instead of addressing issues he feels are vitally 
important.  I respect that, as I respect what Reformers are 
trying to bring forward, the long list of changes to the criminal 
justice system that we have been pushing ever since we formed the 
party back in 1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I recognize that the police, the prison guards, the crown 
prosecutors, every single person involved in our justice system 
is frustrated.  We are frustrated here too.  Reformers are 
frustrated.  We have been beating on the doors of government for 
10 long years and we do not have the changes that people are 
crying out for in Canada.  Are they awake over there? 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I rise 
to address Bill C-37 I assume that the debate will end on this 
bill sometime today.  The bill will then go to committee where we 
will be able to examine it through the eyes of those with vested 
interests and concerns in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I listened to the debate today in the House and I listened to 
hon. members from both sides raising concerns and answering 
questions put to them by one another, the first point which came 
to my mind and which I think should be addressed is to whom 
should judges be accountable.  We talk about accountability.  To 
whom are they accountable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges are supposed to be accountable to the law that we pass 
here on behalf of the people of Canada.  As representatives of 
the people, we are supposed to listen to what they are saying, 
bring their concerns here and pass legislation that will address 
those concerns.  Then we appoint judges, and we pay them pretty 
well but apparently not well enough, to do what?  To interpret 
that law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tell the judges what to do by the law we pass in this place. 
The problem is that certainly since I have been in this House and 
for far too long before that, the legislators of Parliament have 
failed to tell the judges clearly what the people are telling 
them they want done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see open ended legislation where judges are allowed to 
decide.  Judges do not like minimum sentences.  Why?  It tells 
them they must at least give a minimum sentence if a person is 
convicted of an offence carrying a minimum sentence. 
We are told that judges do not like this.  They want greater 
flexibility and I understand their rationale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at the minimum sentence that we have prescribed by law 
in Bill C-68. If anyone is convicted of a criminal offence 
wherein they used a firearm, they are sentenced to jail for four 
years. We hear the rationale that there are some circumstances 
where that would be cruel and unusual punishment.  We look at 
that.  I am sure the government, the elected representatives of 
the people, has to weigh that. How serious is it for someone to 
use a firearm in the commission of a criminal offence?  Should it 
carry a minimum four year sentence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the offender from the viewpoint that the offender 
is a victim of society, a victim of his upbringing, a victim of 
whatever, and not accountable for his actions, then of course we 
will feel sorry and say that it is not fair, that it is not just. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, if we look only at the victim and at what has 
happened to the victim, we will say that four years perhaps is a 
fair and just minimum sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to do is draw a balance.  Legislators should be 
doing that.  We should not be allowing judges to tell us what to 
do.  Yet that is what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest reason for this, of course, is charter of rights 
and freedoms that came into effect in 1982. The courts now have 
the right to weigh all legislation against whether it violates 
the charter rights of an individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk for hours about charter rights. People arriving in 
Canada illegally immediately have the protection of the charter, 
criminals fleeing another country. Murderers like Mr. Ng appeared 
in Canada and immediately received the protection of the charter 
of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took our justice system almost six years to get him out of 
the country and back to where he would be able to face the 
charges of murder levied against him in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the proper manner in which to hold judges 
accountable, we have to look at a number of things including 
judicial independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend opposite spoke about intimidation and said that 
it is a measure of intimidation.  Again, we look for a balance. 
If we look at what happened in Alberta when Premier Ralph Klein, 
in an attempt to get spending under control, asked all civil 
servants including teachers and so on to take a 5% rollback, he 
also asked the judges to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My goodness, we saw what happened there.  Judges took that to 
themselves by way of a case.  It was ruled that would be 
considered interference into their judicial independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have here?  There is a supposed a raise in pay 
involved in this statute to the courts.  Are we to assume that if 
federal court judges across the country make a request to 
Parliament for a raise and that raise is denied, it could be 
construed as an interference into their judicial independence?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can defence counsels walk into their court room and ask the 
judge to dismiss the case because their independence has been 
interfered with by the state?  Is that what we are getting to? Is 
that what we are arriving at?  When this bill comes before the 
committee we are going to be calling witnesses.  I eagerly await 
their answers to those kinds of questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the direction it appears we are going in.  If a benefit 
or a remuneration is demanded or requested by the judges and it 
is turned down by the government of the land, provincial or 
federal, it could be construed as violation of their judicial 
independence.  We have to weigh that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at the fairness of the 8.5% increase or whatever it is. 
We had the Kim Hicks family in Parliament before Christmas.  This 
is a family of six, a man, a wife and four young children living 
on $30,000 a year.  Judges are making approximately $140,000 a 
year now.  If this raise goes through some judges will be making 
$150,000 or more.  That is the income that five families in the 
position of the Hicks family would have to live on.  Is it fair? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear people say we have to provide a good salary, otherwise we 
will not attract competent judges because they can make much more 
in the private sector.  Is greed really the motivation to accept 
an appointment to the bench?  Is $140,000 not reasonable for a 
man or a woman, a family, a head of a household?  Is that not 
reasonable?  Ask Kim Hicks that question, if $140,000 is not 
reasonable and we should be going to the lengths we have to in 
order to grant federal court judges greater benefit and 
remuneration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of fairness and balance must enter into this.  We 
know that many civil servants, including RCMP members my 
colleague spoke of, have had their salaries frozen for years. 
What about them?  Why are we making an exception in this case? 
Do we start at the top when it comes to responding to salary 
demands?  We have some of our grassroots military people living 
on $17,000 or $18,000 a year.  What about them?  I have often 
wondered what judges do when they have people appear before them 
accused of crimes of theft or whatever who are destitute.  How do 
they feel when they look at the economic conditions, some of 
which produce crime?  How do they feel? They want another 8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the judges from the Supreme Court of Canada made 
reference to the greed that is all too evident in our legal 
system.  Should we not look for those individuals who are 
competent, who understand and know the law and who have an 
aptitude and a willingness to serve on the bench, to serve Canada 
without the thought of remuneration beyond which many people can 
only dream? 
Should we not be looking for men and women of such calibre where 
they are prepared with their skills and abilities to serve 
Canadians?  They have a lifetime job.  Their remuneration is 
guaranteed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, it is not like you or I where we might be bumped 
off at the next election.  Their employment is guaranteed, 
assured.  Their remuneration as well is guaranteed, assured.  Is 
it fair what they are asking for and what this bill is designed 
to give them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to see what the witnesses have to say when they appear 
before the committee and we ask them some of these questions.  We 
do have a degree of responsibility.  We do have a sense of 
responsibility in this area.  We must guard the independence of 
our judiciary.  We must do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Case after case we can recite in the House leaves the Canadian 
people dissatisfied with the decisions of some courts.  Over 50% 
in an Angus Reid poll last July indicated that they have little 
faith not in our justice system but in our courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Justice Lamer appeared before a group of lawyers 
requesting them—to me it was a plea—to defend the court system. 
The defence of the court system should come from the people as a 
result of feeling well served.  The honour we bestow on the 
courts should come as a result of the people feeling well served, 
that the laws are there to protect them and their protection is 
derived from the interpretation of the law from judges who have a 
keen sense of what their duties and responsibilities are not only 
to the law but to society at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will look forward to the further examination of the bill. 
There are many elements of the bill that must be brought forward 
and fleshed out so that we have a clear understanding of what we 
are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not provide for the appointment of additional 
judges.  Why?  Because we have a court system that is clogged. 
Why do we have a court system that is clogged?  We are not 
intending to increase the judges in the area of criminal law, 
from my understanding.  If we look at the criminal justice system 
it is being clogged.  There are 40,000 cases backlogged in B.C. 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should ask themselves why and what is the judges' role 
in this at those levels, those provincial court judges.  Perhaps 
in most cases as they go up the line to the levels of appeal it 
is federal court judges who deal with that. Why do we have a 
backlog?  Because in legislation after legislation that we have 
examined just since I have been here, which is only four and a 
half years, we see where there are additional levels of appeal 
being instituted into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only amendment that was brought to the Young Offenders Act 
was Bill C-37 under the former justice minister and we introduced 
another level of appeal there.  Now young offenders can be 
transferred automatically to adult court but they have a level of 
appeal where they can appeal to have their hearing held in youth 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw 745, the faint hope clause.  What did we have there? 
Instituted another level of appeal.  So there are levels and 
levels of appeal and what do they do?  They slow down the court 
cases.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a newspaper article on my desk about cases on the east 
coast.  It is now being questioned as to whether or not the cases 
will make it through court because of the longevity of the cases, 
and the Supreme Court of Canada's decision that if a case drags 
on too long it is an injustice to the accused.  Cases are being 
thrown out. One case was thrown out recently in British Columbia. 
Why? Because this government has been bringing in pieces of 
legislation that simply create a traffic jam by allowing more and 
more time to be wasted or used up by appeal after appeal. That is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want all members to take a very close look at this bill.  The 
honouring of our judges should be automatic.  It should come as a 
result of our being well served.  We should always seek out the 
wisdom of our judges to interpret the law that is in the best 
interest of society.  But when our provincial court judges across 
the land allow convicted rapists and other violent offenders to 
walk free through conditional sentencing, a piece of legislation 
never intended to be used in that manner, then we had better 
believe we have reason to be concerned and we have reason to 
question the judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot expect that the honour we should bestow upon judges 
will come forth as a result of decisions like that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
actually thrilled by the kinds of comments my colleague made. 
There is one area I would like him to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the judges' responsibility to interpret 
the law, the judges' responsibility to apply the law fairly and 
with equity and that the punishment somehow be related to the 
crime, all of these kinds of things.  They are very significant 
and important matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether my hon. colleague could say not only is that 
the case but judges, in rendering honest, righteous, fair and 
equitable decisions, inherently have a leadership role that will 
tell the community and young people there is a way to prevent 
further involvement. There is the role of leadership to society. 
Does our society not look toward the judges who interpret the law 
and who are upholders of righteousness, that they will in fact 
provide some leadership to our community? Would he comment on 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  I want to thank my colleague for his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in the days when I was a youngster we looked with awe and 
respect to our judges.  They were bestowed with a wisdom we 
thought few people had.  As a result of that wisdom and their 
common sense, knowledge and skills, we relied upon them.  We 
placed our trust in them to not only understand the law but to 
understand procedure so that when an accused appeared before 
them, a fair trial for that individual was assured. We looked 
upon judges for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a special quality of leadership which we have in this 
country.  We have had it in the past.  That kind of leadership 
has helped build this great nation.  When we find that more than 
50% of Canadians are beginning to lose faith in that kind of 
leadership, then we have to look at why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the debate earlier on and it was rankled and so on.  It 
is unfortunate but we do have to maintain the right as elected 
representatives.  Why do we have immunity in this place?  Why? It 
is so that we can examine those sensitive issues without fear or 
apprehension. 
When something is going wrong in a former hallowed area of our 
system, we can examine it on behalf of the people.  We can 
examine it openly, fairly and honestly in order to arrive at a 
balanced judgment as to what should be done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping that we do arrive at a balanced judgment in terms of 
this bill and whether or not someone making $140,000 deserves a 
raise today when so many people are struggling to keep body and 
soul together on a salary that is a lot lower than $140,000. I 
hope we can strike that balance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member if 
this is another case of legislation from the government side that 
has some aspects in it which might be acceptable and could be 
supported, but also includes other things which make it difficult 
for us to give the government our support on in its efforts to 
amend the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this again one of those situations where there is some good 
but there is a lot of stuff in it that is not acceptable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, this is another one of 
those bills where we can put one foot on one side and the other 
foot on the other side.  It gives rise for concern.  On the 
addition of the judges, we must support that. If I could put it 
this way, it is supportable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there are aspects to this bill which suggest that if the 
judges do not receive this remuneration, it could be considered 
as improper interference in the judicial independence of our 
judges.  If that is true, we will find out when this bill is sent 
to committee.  There is the example in Alberta. It is a reverse 
example because they wanted to reduce by 5% the pay of all civil 
servants, including judges. It was ruled that it appeared to 
constitute a political interference into the judicial 
independence of our judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is a part of this bill, then what does it ultimately 
mean? It means that our federal judges, with respect to them, can 
make a demand upon the public purse.  Even if it is considered to 
be unreasonable, it is almost like a gun is being held to the 
heads of the elected representatives of the country.  If they 
deny it, they will then be in a position where they can be 
accused of interfering with the judicial independence of the 
courts. Any defence counsel can then come into court and say “My 
Lord, I want you to dismiss the case because your judicial 
independence has been interfered with and you cannot render a 
fair and just hearing to my client”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a committee want to look at that.  I will certainly be 
asking questions about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, this bill contains aspects I can personally support but it 
contains aspects that I have real concerns about as well.

to his background.  I too in various capacities served in this 
area.  I served for 25 years as a justice of the peace in 
different areas of the province of Saskatchewan. 
At one time, if the judge was not travelling, he would actually 
have me conduct court and so on.  I am quite used to that 
procedure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I see by the 
clock that I will not have time to complete my intervention 
today, but I would like to say a few words about the judicial 
system in this country.  I am going to cater my remarks to the 
supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give an example of how our judicial system has a 
profound influence not only in criminal matters but in civil 
matters and in civil matters that have widespread consequences to 
Canadians and, in this particular case, to British Columbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to talk about the Delgamuukw case in British 
Columbia.  It was a case where an Indian band, the Gitksan and 
Wet'suwet'en decided some 13 years ago that it was going to lay 
legal claim to about 58,000 square kilometres of land in the 
north central part of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the initial case that was heard by Justice McEachern, the 
learned justice heard over 378 days of testimony.  This is a 
judge from the Supreme Court of British Columbia.  He heard 
arguments put forward by the Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en people, by 
the province of British Columbia and by Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, the justice for much of this sitting was actually 
in Smithers, British Columbia, in my riding, where the Gitksan 
and Wet'suwet'en people live.  This was so that he could better 
understand them, their claim, the other non-aboriginal people and 
the other aboriginal people for that matter in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his reasons for judgment, the learned judge pointed out that 
he not only sat on the bench in Smithers to hear arguments, but 
he also took the time in the evenings and on weekends, rented a 
car and drove around visiting many of the communities.  He 
visited the Gitksan communities and the non-aboriginal 
communities so that he would understand to the best that he 
possibly could what the case was all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After more than two years, after more than 375 days on the 
bench, he rendered a decision.  The learned justice's decision 
was overturned after the supreme court heard arguments for a day 
and a half.  This case now throws a cloud of uncertainty over 
whether British Columbia as a province has the right to assert 
sovereignty and has control over the crown lands of that 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This case has profound implications.  It is a good thing I have 
parliamentary immunity because I am going to say something harsh 
about the court.  Nine justices from the supreme court, 
politically appointed, largely from Quebec and Ontario, decided 
British Columbia's future.  This is unacceptable.

<A NAME="LINK201">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 17 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-247, an act to amend the Criminal Code (genetic 
manipulation), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil—Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
particularly pleased to speak today in connection with Bill 
C-247, because my hon. colleague for Drummond is its sponsor, and 
also because I am a member of the Standing Committee on Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public awareness was suddenly aroused around the world when the 
news was released that an adult ewe had been cloned by a team in 
Scotland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start with a definition of the word “clone”. The 
popular definition is that it is an organism, a person, an 
animal or a plant that is a completely identical or nearly 
identical copy of another organism in terms of appearance or 
function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the biological level, it refers to a population of organisms, 
cells or genetically identical DNA molecules resulting from the 
asexual reproduction of a single organism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns world-wide about cloning human beings are justified. 
First a brief historical overview is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first government inquiry into the new reproductive 
technologies was the 1989 Baird Commission. Its mandate was “to 
look into current and foreseeable progress in science and 
medicine relating to reproductive techniques, their 
repercussions on health and research, their moral, social, 
economic and legal consequences, and their impact on the general 
public, and to recommend policies and protective measures to be 
adopted”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Baird Commission tabled its report only in November 1993. 
The main conclusions and recommendations were broadly similar to 
the foreign studies on this topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the federal government announced in January 1996 the creation 
of an interim advisory committee with a mandate to put the 
moratorium into effect, to follow developments in new 
reproduction technologies and to advise the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, on June 14, 1996, the federal Minister of Health at the 
time, David Dingwall, introduced Bill C-47.  There was no 
provision for the application of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's proposed second stage involved amending 
Bill C-47 to include a regulatory framework for all reproduction 
and manipulation technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite its approval in principle of Bill C-47, the Bloc 
vigorously opposed the establishment of a new national agency 
and deplored the fact that the Criminal Code was not applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the hearings of the Standing Committee on Health, 
witnesses expressed a number of reservations about the content 
of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, at this point in time, there is no justification for 
cloning human beings, regardless of the process used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention that one of the clauses in Bill C-47 prohibited 
human cloning. This clause is found in Bill C-247. It 
criminalizes human cloning, without prohibiting scientific 
research in genetics, which may be beneficial at several levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 2 and 3 of this bill also make liable to punishment 
anyone who deliberately offers to carry out or requests 
experiments in human cloning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc has repeatedly called for government intervention to 
prevent practices related to new reproduction technologies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois called for criminalization of the sale of 
ova, embryos and foetal tissue. In May 1994, the then Minister 
of Justice stated that the bill was slated for introduction in 
the fall of 1994. The moratorium followed only in 1995, and Bill 
C-47, which merely makes the moratorium law, was introduced in 
June 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the use of these technologies challenges our 
values, because it involves the very definition of the 
foundations of our society, our descendants.  Limits must be 
set, but what should those limits be?  We see that the entire 
world is concerned by this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1997, the following comment by Dr. Joseph Ayoub 
appeared in <I>La Presse</I> “France has thus played a role by 
creating, in 1983, a national advisory committee on ethics in 
the life sciences and health.  It advises on the ethical 
problems raised by the progress of knowledge in the fields of 
biology, medicine and health, and publishes recommendations on 
these topics”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 10 years of work, the parliamentary assembly of the 
Council of Europe recently approved a draft agreement on human 
rights and biomedicine.  The approved document allows research 
on in vitro embryos under two conditions:  if it is in the 
interest of their development or if it is related to the 
diagnosis of serious diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But any creation of embryos for research continues to be 
prohibited. 
Now, what remains to be done is to obtain an international 
consensus on the human genome and human rights from the UNESCO 
international bioethics committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British parliamentary inquiry on science and technology 
called for international regulation of cloning, in order to 
prevent any deviation into eugenics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far back as March 1996, the Collège des médecins du Québec 
launched a commission to examine the practice of medicine in the 
year 2000.  Its mandate was to examine the future prospects of 
medicine, the changes it will have to face, and the steps to be 
taken to deal with these new realities in relation to the major 
ethical issues of the day, which mainly affect the beginning and 
end of human life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the commission's recommendations to the Collège des 
médecins was to ensure that human integrity and dignity takes 
precedence over technical progress. 
It also recommended that surveillance systems be put into place 
in order to avoid any deviations, and to create a standing 
committee on ethical issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, cloning raises a number of ethical and legal 
problems.  Cloning does not seem to be a solution for ensuring 
the survival of our planet.  Consequently, the Bloc Quebecois 
supports Bill C-247 introduced by the hon. member for Drummond. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to compliment the hon. member for Drummond 
for introducing this bill to ban human cloning.  It is 
unfortunate, is it not, that a private member has to be 
introducing this important and urgent initiative when in fact the 
government should be making it one of its highest legislative 
priorities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How come the government thinks the Judges Act, raising the pay 
of judges, is more important than this?  Give me a break, Mr. 
Speaker.  I cannot see how that can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the qualified support and several requests for 
amendments made by various members during the first hour of 
debate, I will be voting in favour of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an omnibus bill like Bill C-47 which was introduced in the 
last Parliament is not introduced soon then it will be up to 
individual members of this House to take legislative action, even 
if it is in a step by step fashion.  We should not wait any 
longer for the government to implement a ban on human cloning.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the morale and ethical questions involved with each 
and every aspect of prohibiting and regulating reproductive 
technologies, I think it may be better to debate each and every 
issue separately in this House.  That is how important this is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the vast majority would probably support a ban on 
human cloning, but to prohibit or restrict the use of technology 
to help an infertile couple conceive a child of their own would 
probably seem unreasonable to most.  The question is where to 
draw the line.  The line is right here before us today: ban human 
cloning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last hour of debate on February 17, the member for 
Drummond explained the purpose of her bill and how it would work. 
I agree with her approach, making human cloning a criminal 
offence, although I think a lengthy jail term should be a 
sentencing option for the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-47, the government bill on reproductive technologies from 
the last parliament which died on the order paper last year when 
the election was called, called for a maximum penalty of a 
$500,000 fine and 10 years' imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For everyone's information, here is a list of practices that 
were prohibited in Bill C-47: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sex selection for non-medical purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Buying and selling of eggs, sperm and embryos, including their 
exchange for goods, services or other benefits, but excluding the 
recovery of expenses incurred in the collection, storage and 
distribution of sperm, ova and embryos for persons other than a 
donor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Germ-line genetic alteration:  Manipulation of the genetic 
material contained within the eggs, sperm or embryo.  Any changes 
to the germ-line which may be passed on to the next generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ectogenesis: Maintaining an embryo in an artificial womb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cloning of human embryos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of animal-human hybrids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Retrieval of sperm or eggs from cadavers or fetuses for 
fertilization and implantation, or research involving the 
maturation of sperm or ova outside the human body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commercial pre-conception or surrogacy arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transfer of embryos between humans and other species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of human sperm, eggs or embryos for assisted human 
reproduction procedures or for medical research without the 
informed consent of the donors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research on human embryos later than 14 days after conception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creation of embryos for research purposes only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offer to provide or offer to pay for prohibited services. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was impressed when I read the member for Drummond's words 
“new reproductive technologies raise an extremely serious and 
worrisome problem for the very future of our society as we know 
it”.  She went on “the use of these technologies challenges our 
values because it involves the very definition of the foundations 
of our society, our descendants”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her warning about the scientist who said “cloning and 
reprogramming DNA is the first real step toward taking his place 
beside God” was particularly alarming for me.  When scientists 
start playing God, everyone ought to be alarmed. Parliamentarians 
should be doing something about it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1993 the Royal Commission on New Reproductive 
Technologies released its final report.  I do not think it was an 
accident that the report was titled “Proceed with Care”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Thornhill spoke on behalf of the government 
during the last hour debate.  She informed the House that the 
Minister of Health was in fact planning to table legislation that 
would address many of the issues regarding reproductive 
technologies, including the issue of cloning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the government proceed with care and not try to lump 
issues that have widespread public support with ones that are 
highly controversial.  This is a trick that has been used in the 
past and we should not tolerate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree with her contention that the banning of human cloning 
should be in health legislation and not in the Criminal Code. 
Failing to register a firearm, which is regulation of private 
property, is a Criminal Code offence punishable by up to 10 years 
in jail.  Why cannot something far more serious like cloning of 
human beings not be in the Criminal Code? 
This is another example of the misplaced priorities of the 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree that we should wait for the government to introduce 
comprehensive legislation.  I think we should pass this bill and 
immediately move amendments to strengthen it as suggested by 
members during debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Wanuskewin spoke in favour of this bill. 
He outlined a number of dangers associated with the cloning of 
human beings, including unknown health risks, considerable 
psychological and emotional risks and the moral and ethical 
dilemmas that would inevitably flow from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that these are dangers our society cannot control by a 
voluntary moratorium.  They are dangers that require a clear and 
unequivocal statement by Parliament that in Canada human 
cloning will be a criminal offence.  If scientists want to play 
God, they will have to play it in another country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, I agree with my hon. friend's position that 
fines are not a sufficient deterrent to rich multinational 
companies.  Prison terms for owners, officers and directors of 
these companies will be a deterrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also mentioned that 19 countries in the European Union 
have moved to officially ban human cloning.  I suggest this is a 
list to which Canada should be proud to add its name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read with interest the comments of the hon. member for 
Charlotte on this issue.  I plan to talk to him to learn more 
about the prior political experience he had and the discussions 
in the House in 1989 surrounding the creation of the royal 
commission new reproductive technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have noted my reservations about this omnibus bill and others, 
how members are often forced to accept some bad in order to get 
something good.  Why should this be?  Why can the government not 
just introduce a bill which, with open and honest debate, will 
eventually gain the support of the majority of the public and the 
majority of parliamentarians?   These omnibus bills should not be 
brought to Parliament. I think the bill before us today would be 
supported by the public and by members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I wish to comment on the statement made by the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health in response to 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than issue platitudes to the hon. member who introduced 
the bill and rather than just make vague promises of some bill 
the government will be introducing in the future, he should be 
supporting this bill now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to send a clear message that, regardless of 
the bill to be introduced in the future to deal with a myriad of 
issues, in Canada human cloning will be a criminal offence right 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the message Canadians want to hear from their 
government.  I encourage the government to support this bill. 
Further, when it is passed, the government should propose 
amendments to strengthen it.  When this is done, the government 
should communicate to everyone in Canada that human cloning and 
playing God is banned in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to speak to the issue of the criminal law power in 
prohibiting reproductive and genetic technology such as human 
cloning because it is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-247 proposed by the hon. member from Drummond, Quebec 
proposes an amendment to the Criminal Code of Canada to add after 
section 286 a section that would prohibit genetic manipulation 
leading to human cloning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two practices covered in proposed Bill C-247 were prohibited 
in Bill C-47 which was tabled in this House in June 1996 and 
which passed second reading in November 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1997 the subcommittee of the Standing Committee on 
Health approved the bill with minor technical amendments. 
Unfortunately the call for the federal election came on April 27 
and Bill C-47 died on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the wording used in Bill C-247 is 
exactly the same as that used in Bill C-47 pertaining to human 
cloning.  One major difference is that the hon. member proposes 
Bill C-247 as an amendment to the Criminal Code of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1996 proposal by the federal government was for health 
legislation which relied on the criminal law power to protect 
Canadians' health and safety and to uphold our common values. 
This government does not take the use of criminal law power 
lightly as its means of prohibiting certain uses of technology. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Constitution divides jurisdiction over health matters 
between federal and provincial governments. The federal 
government has the power to make laws when issues relating to 
public health and safety are at stake or to maintain peace, 
order, security and morality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation lies squarely within the Canadian tradition of 
using criminal law to protect Canadians' health, safety and 
values.  Most federal health law is based on the use of this 
criminal law power and the courts have recognized this as a valid 
exercise of the federal government's authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of human reproductive and genetic technologies 
legislative action by the federal government is not only valid, 
it is necessary.  The federal government has a duty to establish 
the basic perimeters of public health, safety and morality on 
which Canadians may rely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure adequate protection for all Canadians in the area of 
reproductive and genetic technologies there must be uniformity 
across the country with respect to what practices are prohibited, 
what practices are allowed and what safeguards apply. As with all 
criminal legislation provinces would be free to take as active a 
role as they choose in prosecuting the offences which were set 
out in Bill C-47. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parallel provincial legislation in the field of reproductive and 
genetic technologies is welcome.  Even if several provinces were 
to enact such legislation this would not diminish the need for a 
federal law to ensure that no region of Canada becomes a haven 
for unregulated practice of these technologies.  To date no 
province has comprehensive legislation dealing with reproductive 
and genetic technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts have traditionally recognized the protection of 
public health and safety and the maintenance of peace, order, 
security and morality as valid exercises of Parliament's 
exclusive authority over substantive criminal law.  Most federal 
health legislation relies on the criminal law to protect 
Canadians' health and safety and to uphold our common societal 
values, for example the Tobacco Products Control Act, the 
Narcotics Control Act, the Food and Drugs Act and the Hazardous 
Products Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a constitutionally valid exercise of the criminal law 
power to define a crime not only by defining what acts are 
prohibited but also by exempting from criminal sanction certain 
acts when they are not carried out under prescribed conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has already recognized the need for some form of 
regulatory regime for reproductive and genetic technologies, to 
regulate those practices which are considered acceptable to 
Canadians.  In one respect, the hon. member's bill is admirable. 
However, Bill C-247 covers only two specific procedures out of 
the 13 which Bill C-47 would have prohibited and does not address 
the need for regulation of acceptable practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the hon. member's bill does address one of the major areas 
of concern with reproductive and genetic technologies, we would 
like to reiterate that human cloning is indeed only one of the 
issues.  There are many other aspects of equal concern which must 
be addressed which include sex selection for non-medical 
purposes, the buying and selling of eggs, sperm and embryos, germ 
line and genetic alteration, maintaining an embryo in an 
artificial womb, the creation of animal-human hybrids, the 
retrieval of sperm or eggs from corpses or fetuses and commercial 
surrogacy arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final report of the royal commission on new reproductive and 
genetic technologies in November 1993 recommended both 
prohibitions of certain practices and a regulatory component to 
the legislation to manage those reproductive and genetic 
technologies which are considered acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's proposed amendment to the Criminal Code would 
deny the possibility of regulations which would make certain 
technologies available to Canadians under certain and carefully 
monitored standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-47 dealt exclusively with absolute prohibitions but it 
was always intended that the regulatory component or conditional 
prohibitions would be added.  Indeed much of the support from key 
stakeholder groups was premised on the understanding that this 
would be so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health is sensitive to the concerns of Canadians 
regarding the need for comprehensive legislation.  The minister 
remains committed to introducing a bill which will accommodate 
the reasonable concerns that are and have been expressed.  The 
overwhelming response to Bill C-47 from virtually all quarters 
was for the addition of a regulatory regime to absolute 
prohibitions to form comprehensive legislation.  The proposed 
additional components outlined in the white paper include the 
establishment of a regulatory agency and its powers of operation, 
licensing to permit acceptable practices, information registry 
and equivalency agreements with the provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These proposals would ensure that acceptable technologies and 
practices are delivered in an ethical and socially responsible 
fashion and in a way that solicits the input of all sectors of 
society concerned with the issues raised by reproductive and 
genetic technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government intends to introduce in the near future 
legislation which will enhance Canadians' well-being by 
permitting them to make choices about their involvement with 
reproductive and genetic technologies, secure in the knowledge 
that their choices do not include any that are unethical or 
harmful to their health or to that of the children they bear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will balance the need to protect the interests of vulnerable 
women and children with the aspirations of individuals to become 
parents and the need of the research that will help them attain 
that goal.  It will set the boundaries within which reproductive 
and genetic technologies can be regulated for the good of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-247 proposed by the hon. member is likely to draw 
criticism from many quarters.  Canadians have clearly shown us 
during the consultations following the royal commission's report 
that there are many issues involved in reproductive and genetic 
technologies which require control, and not just human cloning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada's overriding goal is to protect the health and 
safety of Canadians.  We also seek to ensure the appropriate 
treatment of human reproductive materials and to protect the 
dignity and security of all persons, especially women and 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have told Health Canada, as they told the royal 
commission, they want the federal government to act to manage 
reproductive and genetic technologies in a way that protects 
those most affected and which reflects our collective values. 
Canadians want unethical practices prohibited by law, and so does 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an environment such as this Canadians would criticize passage 
of an amendment to the Criminal Code which merely prohibits human 
cloning.  They have a concern to be answered about the total 
spectrum of reproductive and genetic technologies, and this 
government is committed to such legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is necessary to wait for the introduction of new 
legislation by this government to encompass all the aspects of 
reproductive and genetic technologies which we have seen through 
the consultation process.  They are of great concern to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe proposed Bill C-247, an amendment to the Criminal 
Code, is premature and would be viewed as being heavy handed and 
failing to address the greater part of concerns of Canadians on 
this matter.

New Reproductive Technologies created in March 1989, commonly 
known as the Baird commission. The primary purpose of this 
commission was to analyze the impact on our society of genetic

mothers and artificial insemination.  This study had long been 
demanded by a Canadian coalition of feminist groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was another four years, and millions of dollars, before the

some rough patches, as the House will recall.  The government 
then imposed a voluntary moratorium in July 1995 and 
subsequently introduced Bill C-47, which died on the Order Paper 
when the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That government bill contained an important flaw, however.  It 
did not criminalize human cloning.  Today, we therefore find 
ourselves in a legal vacuum where only the voluntary moratorium 
applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill now before us deals with a very important issue, 
because its purpose is to prohibit human cloning, that is to 
say, the replication of human beings, in Canada.  The chair of 
the royal commission, Mrs. Baird, also called on the federal 
government to bring in legislation in this regard.  However, 
since the election, the government has been slow to take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore urgent, and if it is the pleasure of the House 
to pass this bill, Canada will follow the example of many 
countries, including the United States, Italy, Norway, Australia 
and France, which have already passed legislation prohibiting 
human cloning.

include the Council of Europe, the British parliamentary 
commission on science and technology and UNESCO's Universal 
Declaration on the Human Genome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the World Health Organization has declared that the 
techniques that produced Dolly the sheep cannot be used on 
humans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the World Health Organization did 
not want to prohibit commercial ownership of cloning techniques. 
It protested only against the use of cloning in human 
reproduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, consideration of the subject continued too.  The 
commission set up for the task by the college of physicians 
proposed respect for the absolute precedence of human integrity 
and dignity over technical success, especially at the beginning 
and the end of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you can see, the various experiments at the frontiers of 
science and life have given rise to a major ethics debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, the successful cloning of Dolly the sheep by a group 
of Scottish researchers has revived the debate.  What makes 
Dolly the sheep such a special case and why has it attracted so 
much attention? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dolly is not the result of traditional fertilization involving 
the combination of the genetic material of two creatures of 
opposite sex. Rather, Dolly is the result of asexual laboratory 
reproduction of a single parent.  In other words, Dolly was 
created from a single cell, that of the mother. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to admit that, from a purely scientific standpoint, this 
discovery is quite extraordinary.  Professor Charles Thibault, a 
French specialist in biological reproduction, said that 
understanding nuclear fission and then fusion meant a better 
understanding of matter.  Mastering cell division meant better 
understanding the living, in his opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Great scientific discoveries have improved the lives of men and 
women.  They have also enabled us to kill one another. Does the 
new race to clone mean progress for humanity by separating it 
into two species—the natural and the reproduced, the real and 
the false, the weak and the strong?  This is what the bill 
introduced by my colleague from Drummond is attempting to 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has the advantage of making cloning a criminal act, without 
prohibiting scientific research in genetics, which must also be 
closely monitored. 
For some researchers, for instance, animal cloning and its 
application to human beings is of particular interest to the 
pharmaceutical companies, needless to say, for the manufacture 
of drugs, organ transplants, and research into hereditary 
diseases and cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Animal application of cloning would make it possible to rear 
perfect animals or to save endangered species.  To quote 
<I>Libération</I>,  “the race to clone all species is on.  Now it is 
international, with the British and Americans in the lead, and 
commercial, of course.  What is involved now is improving 
techniques for fast and efficient transgenic cloning—in order to 
provide humanized organs and drug-proteins.  A major industrial 
and medical undertaking”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no denying it, successful cloning is now part of our 
reality. 
Yet it is opening the door to the cloning of all superior 
animals, up to and including man.  This is where the bill of my 
hon. colleague for Drummond fits in, and this is where the 
question arises: are they going to be cloning men, women and 
children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the French publication <I>Libération</I>, American clinics 
already have in hand “catalogues of sperm donors and egg donors, 
with the physical and intellectual characteristics of each , so 
that a genetic cocktail may be concocted which will come as 
close as possible to producing the ideal baby”.

embryos and the “terrifying image of supermarkets where one 
would go and choose one's ready-to-wear baby like a frozen 
hamburger”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not fall into the trap of considering human beings 
merely based on their genomes. 
Are we prepared to live in a society in which it would be 
possible to create armies of identical individuals, for a 
specific purpose, such as to ensure a stock of livers, hearts or 
lungs to be transplanted into other individuals born as a result 
of true fecundation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The newspaper goes on to say that this would lead to “a society 
in which the most incredible scenarios would become reality: a 
dictator duplicates himself ad vitam aeternam, a dead child is 
reborn in her mother's womb, a woman delivers a baby that is her 
husband, her father, even herself”, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are fascinated by science and technology, by irresistible 
challenges and incredible achievements. But there is also a 
human being, with a body and a mind, whose genes are only the 
foundations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This major debate has to do with ethics, with the reversal of 
the natural order, with individual freedom and with values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While all major discoveries bring about significant benefits, 
they also present potential dangers. According to the same 
newspaper, there is already a disturbing split. “The rich 
already send their children to the best schools. Tomorrow, they 
will want genetic improvement, better health and more advantages 
to help their children succeed”. Yet, democratic societies have 
always used science and technology to try to reduce the perverse 
effects of these inequalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the type of society we want? I do not think so. We must 
reflect on this. Where do science and medicine stop? Where does 
the temptation to legitimize a eugenist project begin? It is a 
fine line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To adopt this bill is to refuse to cross that line, which is so 
fine but which can have huge consequences for our own mutation 
and that of human beings in general.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is obviously a fascinating and interesting subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the members of the Bloc said that party is not in support 
of one of the proposals that was in the government's Bill C-47 
which would establish a new national agency.  I understand why 
they would not be in support of a national agency.  They are not 
in support of the national government.  They would like to do 
away with it all.  If the bill had included a suggestion that a 
provincial agency be established perhaps there would have been 
more acceptance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fascinating.  This bill is almost an anomaly.  It is a 
private member's bill based somewhat on the model of a government 
bill that was introduced in the last parliament.  Basically the 
same government is now in power and is saying that it is prepared 
to bring forward a government bill that will address more of the 
issues of concern that are talked about by members opposite.  Yet 
they want to ignore that and go ahead with this particular bill 
which seems to be a halfway solution to the concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Waterloo—Wellington made a very good point that 
this bill only deals with two issues of concern that were 
addressed in Bill C-47.  It does not go nearly far enough.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an opportunity, if members opposite would just have a 
little patience, to have a government bill which would have 
substantially more significance.  It could go to committee.  We 
need to hear from Canadians, rather than just presume they are 
going to accept the changes that exist in a bill.  The way to do 
that is to have the Minister of Health, not the Minister of 
Justice, bring in a full, properly researched bill that would 
deal with all areas of the selling of sperm, eggs and embryos, 
and the reproductive processes that are being discovered through 
science.  Let us do our homework on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting.  Normally we would have the reverse scenario 
where opposition members would be demanding that the government 
bring forward a bill.  Instead they are saying we should support 
this particular bill, even though it does not go far enough.  It 
is just opposition politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not heard anyone in this place say they support the 
cloning of human beings.  Everyone is basically saying that the 
member's bill is the right way to go, but it does not go far 
enough.  We think it should go further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quite agree with members opposite that the voluntary 
moratorium is not sufficient.  It does not go nearly far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would indeed amend the Criminal Code.  That is really 
the crux of the problem and the concern that we have on this 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than deal with the merits of the proposed prohibitions in 
the bill, I want to compare this bill to Bill C-47. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similar prohibitions were contained in separate legislation, as 
was mentioned by other members, back in 1996.  If it was not for 
the fact that the election came about that bill likely would be 
in place today.  It was a dramatically more comprehensive bill 
than the one that is before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code contains provisions for general application. 
They apply to everyone and are aimed at keeping the peace and 
ensuring individual conduct is not a threat to the maintenance of 
a civilized society.  However, what we are trying to do here is 
use the Criminal Code in an inappropriate way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the perspective that I have outlined, the code is not the 
appropriate vehicle for the prohibitions component of a 
comprehensive management regime in the complex area of scientific 
and medical procedures and research.  The proper place, in my 
submission, is for all of this to be wrapped up and put into a 
principal piece of legislation that could then go to the health 
committee.  It would then be taken across the country for input, 
for discussion, and parliament could then enact the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps some of the amendments I have heard other members talk 
about should be in the bill.  Perhaps there should be a way of 
addressing those concerns.  But by simply passing a half-baked 
private member's bill that does not go far enough we will lose 
the opportunity that is before parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real opportunity here is to set the direction for the moral 
infrastructure of our society.  Do we really want to cross that 
line that I have heard other members mention? Everyone says no, 
but let us make sure that no means no, that in this particular 
case we are indeed dotting the <I>i</I>'s, crossing the <I>t</I>'s 
and going far enough to ensure that we have covered all areas of 
the human reproductive system and all areas of scientific study 
of the human reproductive system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When separate legislation containing these prohibitions against 
certain practices related to the new reproductive and genetic 
technologies was introduced in this place the intention was 
expressed to introduce further legislation to add to the 
regulatory controls. 
I would suggest that is very critical.  The bill does not deal 
with the regulatory controls that I think will be so necessary to 
make this effective. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those controls would provide a comprehensive management regime 
for many years for NRGTs.  That made it clear at that time that 
it was not an appropriate subject for a Criminal Code amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask hon. members opposite why the push all of a 
sudden.  Is it just because it happens to have wound its way back 
to the surplus of the legislative agenda that they see fit to 
push this through?  Or, would they not agree that it would be 
more appropriate to take a step back, to make sure that we are 
indeed dotting the <I>i</I>'s and crossing the <I>t</I>'s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that this ongoing management regime is a 
critical issue for the future of all Canadians.  A major 
component of that regime was to be the issuance of licences for 
acceptable practices when it came to these reproductive 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also health and safety issues which were to be 
prominent in the principles guiding the issuance of those 
licences.  I think all Canadians would understand it is important 
that the scientific community has an opportunity to have input in 
a direct way with the parliamentary community through the health 
committee to deal with the issues of health and safety.  It is 
absolutely critical that takes place.  Under the bill that would 
not occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe this regulatory structure would also maintain 
information registries and help surveillance systems on various 
aspects.  The bottom line, from what I can see and what I have 
said here, it seems clear to me, is that any proposed prohibition 
would find its proper place in the integrated structure of 
separate principal legislation sponsored by the government and 
containing a comprehensive management regime for the NRGTs rather 
than being put inappropriately in the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I will be opposing the bill and hopefully 
looking forward to the government introducing a bill that we will 
all be able to support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to address an issue that is part of a much 
larger body of interrelated questions pertaining to new 
reproductive technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In examining the question surrounding medically assisted 
reproductive technologies, we start to see how complex the whole 
body of issues really is.  Questions of human dignity, rights and 
freedoms, genetic engineering and make-up, in vitro 
fertilization, consent for medical research, profiting from 
financial gain of the use of the human body and organ 
transplants, rights to private life and information, and the need 
for public debate and consultation are only some of the issues on 
the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know many of these issues were touched on and analysed 
through the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies 
which reported in November 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the hon. member for Drummond, introduced 
legislation that specifically addresses one aspect of the realm 
of complex questions, that of cloning and genetic manipulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government claims that it will introduce its own 
legislation on reproductive technology, but it has also indicated 
that the government's legislation will not amend the Criminal 
Code.  In a debate in the House, the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Health indicated that the government would treat 
reproductive technologies as a health issue and just a health 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a consideration of some of the complex issues that I 
just listed reveals that increasingly the domains of health and 
medicine, science, law, ethics, safety, human rights and privacy 
are all interwoven.  We cannot easily distinguish how these 
issues are connected to the realms of business, society and 
government as the lines blur and the relative roles of the 
players constantly adapt and change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are social, legal, economic and human rights and 
scientific and medical interests at stake when we start talking 
about new reproductive technologies.  It is naive to think that a 
clear distinction can be made so that these questions could only 
be classified as being health related. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus we cannot hope to adequately address the risks and concerns 
related to human cloning without also addressing the need to 
amend the Criminal Code to explicitly prohibit a practice which 
cannot be justified by any ethically acceptable motive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the government introduced Bill C-47, the Human 
Reproductive and Genetic Technologies Act, which did not make 
practices or techniques an offence under the Criminal Code.  Bill 
C-47 was also to include a regulatory framework on all techniques 
of reproduction and genetic manipulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have waited long enough for the Liberal government to act. 
Voluntary co-operation is simply not enough in an area that so 
drastically affects the life, security and safety of Canadians 
and the integrity of the value of health and justice that we hold 
dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the hon. member for Mississauga West, asked 
members in opposition to wait.  He wants members to wait.  I ask 
him how long he wants Canadians to wait for legislation in this 
area.  Does he want us to wait until after human cloning has 
begun? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my hon. colleague from Drummond for taking action, for 
she has seen something that needs to be addressed.  She has gone 
ahead with the bill and has asked other members to support it. 
She has seen inaction on the government side, and we in 
opposition are taking action in this area.  That is why we are 
addressing this concern today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of timing is important.  How present is the 
danger and fear about the possibility of cloning humans?  In 
<I>Nature</I>, the scientific journal published the Dolly paper to 
which we are all now referring, indicated that “cloning humans 
from adult tissues is likely to be achievable any time from one 
to ten years from now”.  That is why my hon. colleague is 
bringing the bill forward.  There needs to be action on this 
issue and we do not see any action coming from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there have been many concerns and risks raised related to 
the cloning of humans from adult cells, none has been able to 
offer any ethically acceptable reason for cloning humans.  The 
suggestion that humans might be cloned to provide spare parts for 
their progenitors has been widely condemned by individuals and 
groups all around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note the premise of convention considering 
what we are debating today.  The convention that is happening in 
Europe around this same topic starts from the premise the 
interests of human beings come before those of science or 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that in Canada we take pride in being an 
international leader in areas of health, safety and quality of 
human life.  It is important that we take action on this issue 
and set the ethical basis for further biological and medical 
developments both now and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly questions of this nature will continue to permeate our 
social, legal, ethical and medical institutions.  It is critical 
to address the issue now.  As we see in the European example, 
criminal penalties are included as stipulation for state 
legislation.  This same logic should be applied to our own 
consideration as we face larger issues in bioethics and law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its final report the Royal Commission on Reproductive 
Technologies concluded: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have judged that certain activities conflict so sharply with 
the values espoused by Canadians and by this commission and are 
still potentially harmful to the interests of individuals and of 
society that they must be prohibited by the federal government 
under threat of criminal sanction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of activities specifically mentions cloning.  It is 
time that we in Canada follow suit with the initiatives of other 
members of the international community and explicitly prohibit 
this practice.  That is why I will be supporting the bill and 
encouraging all other members of the House to do so.

the manipulation of a human ovum, zygote or embryo at various 
stages of the development of a fertilized ovum for the purpose 
of producing a cloned zygote or embryo. It will also prohibit 
altering the genetic structure of an ovum, sperm, zygote or

other prohibitions and which died on the <I>Order Paper</I> during the

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been evidence that cloning of human embryos is 
technically possible.  However, there is no evidence that 
germ-line genetic alteration is being carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies 
recommended that cloning of human embryos be illegal.  The royal 
commission did not support the practice of germ-line genetic 
alteration since it was at odds with the commission's guiding 
ethical principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the Health Canada bill was introduced in the last House, 
a member asked that prohibitions dealing with new reproductive 
and genetic technologies take the form of amendments to the 
Criminal Code.  She considered that a separate federal statute on 
new reproductive and genetic technologies would be invasion of 
the provincial jurisdiction over health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An official of the health legal services met with this member 
and explained that the relevant prohibitions were properly the 
subject of separate federal legislation and that there was no 
intention to amend the Criminal Code for this purpose.  This is 
still justice's position and that of the government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In introducing the bill on the new reproductive and genetic 
technologies, the then Minister of Health indicated it was the 
government's intention to bring in a second bill setting out a 
regulatory framework, which would affect the first one, dealing 
with prohibitions. The purpose was to establish a comprehensive 
management regime for new reproductive and genetic technologies. 
However, the second bill was never introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not discuss the merits of the proposed prohibitions. I 
understand that there were similar prohibitions in a separate 
bill introduced in this House in 1996. The document entitled <I>New 
Reproductive Technologies: Setting Boundaries, Enhancing Health</I>, 
published under the authority of the Minister of Health, 
outlines the government's intentions at the time. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code contains provisions of general application,

I was disturbed by recent reports which suggested that some 
police officers and prosecutors have backed away from 
investigating motorcycle members fearing for the safety of their 
families. I do not know if this is accurate or not.  What I do 
know is that threats, harassment and intimidation have long been 
used as favourite weapons of bikers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is understandable how this can have an impact and a chilling 
effect on police officers and prosecutors.  It is especially 
understandable because of the pressure it places on their spouses 
and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot at stake here.  This is not about bikers riding 
around on their motorcycles.  This is about money.  This is about 
big business which is illegal.  This is about the sale of illicit 
drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a society and as a country we need to ensure that our police 
officers and our prosecutors can continue to carry out their 
duties without fear of threats, harassment or intimidation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again ask the solicitor general to fully outline what exactly 
the federal government is doing to protect our police officers 
and our prosecutors from these kinds of threats, harassment and 
intimidation by motorcycle gang members.  We owe them our full 
protection.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank the member for Waterloo—Wellington for his question.  I 
praise him for the interest he has shown in the field of 
organized crime and protection of Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done numerous things.  In 1996 we implemented 
the Witness Protection Act.  In 1997 we implemented the Criminal 
Law Improvement Act.  The most recent thing we did was implement 
the anti-gang legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are tools that we feel have gone a long way to help police 
attack gang activity and criminal activity.  The RCMP as well as 
all the other law enforcement agencies throughout the country 
have one goal and that is a unified approach with a national 
strategy to combat outlaw and motorcycle gangs. However the 
responsibility and the jurisdiction for enforcement falls with 
the local authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We consider all threats to the safety of police officers a very 
serious matter. I can assure the hon. member that all threats, 
whether made to the police or to a prison guard for example, are 
investigated fully and acted upon fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to deal with the problem of motorcycle gangs and more 
specifically with organized crime in a very organized way.  I 
would like to inform the hon. member that to that end the 
Ministry of the Solicitor General on April 24, 1998 will be 
bringing together all law enforcement agencies from across Canada 
to assist in developing a national strategy against organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done some good work.  There is still some work to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. member again for his question.

<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on February 9 I questioned the minister of fisheries on 
his response to a British Columbia provincial court decision 
which ruled that aboriginal communal fishing licence regulations 
were invalid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In granting me an absolute discharge for participating in a 
protest fishery that challenged the legality of the minister's 
regulations, Judge Thomas noted that I had acted in good faith 
and served notice that the courts of British Columbia will not 
enforce the minister's program of racially based commercial 
fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge Thomas' words are clear and unambiguous.  The regulations 
allowing for an aboriginal commercial fishery “have no legal 
validity and are therefore null and void”.  Judge Thomas stated 
“the fishery was not lawfully open to anyone”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the courts have ruled a set of regulations to be invalid, 
it is not open to the minister to say the regulations are valid. 
Yet the minister has done just that.  Within an hour of the 
conclusion of my sentencing hearing, the minister issued a 
statement saying “I appreciate the views of the judge in this 
case.  However, opinions are opinions.  Such opinions are not 
binding on superior courts of British Columbia”.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stated further that this decision does not suspend 
or nullify the aboriginal communal fishing licensing regulations. 
He noted that it does not preclude the department from 
authorizing aboriginal commercial fishing under the existing 
regulatory regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is right when he says that the decision does not 
bind the Supreme Court of British Columbia.  But it does bind the 
minister. The Supreme Court of British Columbia can overturn a 
lower court decision, but the minister of fisheries cannot.  That 
is the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to the courts to decide if regulations established by 
the government are consistent with an authorization given by 
Parliament. When the court decides that regulations were not 
authorized by Parliament, it is not open to the minister or the 
government to ignore the clear and unambiguous words of the 
court. The government may write regulations, but it does not have 
the last word on their validity or legality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge Thomas challenged the government on February 6 stating 
that if it was not happy with his decision, then it must appeal 
it to a higher court. Judge Thomas concluded his remarks to the 
court on February 6 with the following admonition.  He said “It 
is, I think, appropriate to note that the rule of law does exist, 
not just for individuals but also for the government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country and this Parliament is founded on the rule of law. 
The crown made much of that at my sentencing hearing on February 
6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 23, 1998 the minister was quoted in the <I>Hill 
Times</I> as saying “it would be a strange impression for a 
minister to give, to break the law”. On March 6, 1998 the 
minister was quoted in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> as saying “but 
you have to recognize that everyone has to obey the law, or the 
law breaks down”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the minister to live up to his words, to obey the 
law and respect the decisions of our courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister believes that the judge has erred in law, then 
he must find a way to take the matter to a higher court for a 
ruling on the issue. Until that is done, the law in British 
Columbia is clear.  The aboriginal communal fishing licences 
regulations are invalid and have no legal authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now time that the minister acknowledged that the 
government is not exempt from the rule of law. It is now time for 
the minister to stop using the courts to harass fishermen who 
protest fisheries regulations already found to be invalid by the 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently 30 fishermen are before the courts on trumped up 
charges.  Such a flagrant abuse of power smacks of jackboots and 
the KGB, not the fisheries minister in a democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Order. The time has 
expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member 
alleges that the minister is defying the courts and that the 
policy of pilot sales should be dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO is not defying the court.  The judge offered opinions, only 
opinions, on the validity of the aboriginal communal fishing 
licensing regulations. Those comments were made in obiter, in 
passing so to speak, and had nothing to do with the case before 
him, which was the hon. member's prosecution for illegal fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decision does not cancel the aboriginal fisheries strategy. 
It does not nullify the aboriginal communal fishing licensing 
regulations. It does not preclude DFO from authorizing aboriginal 
commercial fishing, including pilot sales arrangements under the 
existing regulatory regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, there is nothing in Judge Thomas' decision that alters 
the minister's authority to allocate and manage fisheries 
resources in the interests of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge's comments were taken seriously by the minister.  He 
asked for a review of the regulations and the legal basis for 
pilot sales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the week of February 2, 1998, based on expert advice, he 
concluded that the current regulations provide a sound legal 
basis for the pilot sales fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister intends to continue with the pilot sales program in 
1998.  Pursuant to this decision, DFO officials are currently 
discussing with all affected parties how to refine and make 
improvements to the fisheries that will be acceptable to all 
parties in the fishing community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.39 p.m.)
