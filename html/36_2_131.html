Speaker, as we apparently get into an election campaign after 
less than three and a half years since the last election, let us 
look at the Liberals' record on keeping promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On taxes, they promised to cut, to scrap, to abolish the GST. 
They did not.  They did deliver 50 tax increases in the last five 
years alone.  For the past three years they have promised tax 
relief, but have members looked at their pay stubs lately? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the environment, they promised legislation to protect 
endangered species and they failed three times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On agriculture, they promised farmers $1.9 billion to compensate 
for losses due to unfair trade.  They have delivered 42%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On crime, they promised to overhaul the Young Offenders Act. 
After seven years they have failed again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the biggest crime of all is that this government thinks 
Canadians will believe their hollow promises again.

how the government of Lucien Bouchard, through its ministers Paul

the American company Bowater Pulp and Paper to demolish the Sugar

is going to send junk mail, she should at least make sure that 
she does not trash a health care agreement that all three NDP 
premiers enthusiastically support.  She should be consistent and 
responsible.  She should decide whether to stand with her NDP 
premiers or stand for opportunism.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the auditor general has again slammed the Liberal 
government for its mismanagement of CIDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been the same old story about CIDA since 1993.  Half of 
the contracts over $100,000 were non-competitive.  There was an 
$8.5 million sole source contract for the Ivory Coast without the 
approval document signed by the minister.  There was a $6.4 
million sole source contract for the Chinese dam project.  No 
other Canadian firms were allowed to compete.  There was a 
contract for $13 million to reform Mali's income tax system 
without the required conditions and expertise in place, and a 
$4.7 million non-competitive contract in Mali, again without the 
needed reforms in place.  CIDA gave 3,000 contracts of over 
$25,000 to individuals, including pensioned public servants, 
lacking treasury board approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weak, arrogant Liberal government has no credibility when it 
comes to managing Canadian tax dollars.  Canadian workers will 
hold the Liberals accountable at the ballot box.  The Liberals 
cannot be trusted to help the poorest of the poor.

Sabine Sonnemann of Ontario, Cherry Kingsley of British Columbia, 
and Bindu Dhaliwal of Ontario, who received the youth award, a 
new award this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past weekend I met with one of the recipients, Ms. 
Kingsley.  She recounted how through most of her young life she 
lived with addiction, abuse and exploitation.  At the age of 22 
she reconnected with her first nations roots, taking action by 
spreading her story and encouraging other young women and youths 
to tell their stories.  In addition to holding conferences, Ms. 
Kingsley now works as a consultant for the Ontario government on 
policy matters concerning youth and sexual exploitation within 
the province.  Her efforts are but one example of how to make a 
positive change for women in our communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 71 years ago today it became official 
that women were officially persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the monument is unveiled today on Parliament Hill for the 
Famous Five, I am sure that Emily Murphy, Henrietta Muir Edwards, 
Louise McKinney, Nellie McClung and Irene Parlby would appreciate 
the irony of Ottawa as the home of this tribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a dozen years the Famous Five battled Ottawa to get 
recognized as persons.  While the Alberta government ruled that 
women were indeed persons, in Ottawa five successive Liberal and 
Conservative federal governments refused to change the law.  When 
the Famous Five got to the supreme court in 1928 they were turned 
down there as well.  It took a 1929 decision from the British 
privy council to finally declare that women were persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we celebrate the Famous Five's accomplishments today, we need 
to remember that they achieved what they did despite the federal 
government, not because of it.

<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today is 
an important anniversary for the women of Canada.  Seventy-one 
years ago five formidable women won their long fight to have 
women recognized as full persons in this land.  The Persons case 
is a landmark victory in the fight for women's equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the achievements of the Famous Five be recognized on 
Parliament Hill through the dedication of a fabulous monument is 
fitting.  However, the Famous Five would have regarded it as an 
even more fitting and lasting tribute for the federal government 
to fulfil the 13 feminist dozen demands to end poverty and 
violence against women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week tens of thousands of women from across Canada marched 
on Parliament Hill calling for urgent action.  Nellie McClung 
once said “No nation rises higher than its women”.  It is my 
hope that this government will heed that message and finally take 
steps to advance true justice and equality for all of the women 
of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>—HRDC has initiated quite extraordinary corrective action to 
address these serious problems.  We concluded that the Department 
was on the right track...we did in fact spend a fair bit of 
effort to assess the adequacy of their implementation or 
corrective action plan and we found that the plan is serious, is 
working, and is going in the right direction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

selective as he wants.  In fact the auditor general continues to 
speak about the fact— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, he calls his MPs nervous 
nellies and we certainly saw a display of that right there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been pointed out that the Prime Minister, in his own 
riding gave a grant to someone who was unqualified to receive a 
CIDA grant but who was a close friend of his.  This is just one 
of a depressing catalogue of things that have not been done 
properly by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he will not fix them, as he indicated he will not, will he at 
least make Canadians feel a little bit better on the apparent eve 
of an election by saying that he is sorry and apologize? 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is the hon. Leader of the Opposition who should say 
that he is sorry.  He made another mistake.  That party keeps 
making mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to a grant.  It was not a grant.  It was a contract 
and the contract was $2.5 million, the lowest price.  We saved 
$2.5 million by giving the contract to the lowest bidder. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

contract went out, it was a grant.

has said, will he apologize for what the information commissioner 
has said?

Three billion dollars a year, it can happen.  Canadians are very 
forgiving, and I say that sincerely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the eve of a possible election call, which he says will be

for everybody and we try to correct them.  I have heard 
accusations of very bad things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member was a provincial MLA he was happy to 
welcome a $20 million loan guarantee from the Alberta government 
to Fletcher Fine Foods in his riding saying that it would create 
local jobs.  He, like many other MPs, wanted his riding to have 
jobs.  Unfortunately the deal went bad and the government of 
Alberta was left with a bill of $14 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

reviewing my record which is encouraging to me because he may 
learn something from my record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general talked about the policies I put in place as 
the finance minister, which were highly effective, and I received 
praise for those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main difference between my record of involvement with any 
kind of grants, or whatever it may be, is that 
none of my involvements have required RCMP investigations, but his 
have.

had to take place? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, members opposite make accusations by association and so 
on.  They have no respect.  They always talk about dishonesty. 
What the auditor general had to say yesterday addresses the 
question of dishonesty.  “I am quick to point out that we did 
not identify any cases of malfeasance by public servants in those 
programs.  The main factor was an imbalance between the desire 
of their department to provide fast service and the need to have 
control over the spending of public funds”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite have been talking for months about the 
boondoggle of $1 billion.  The auditor general said that he could 
not find any proof of anyone stealing in the department.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

dogs before and we are seeing it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess we have got it wrong.  According to the Prime Minister, 
the auditor general did not say that he wasted $3 billion.  According 
to the Prime Minister, I guess the information commissioner did 
not say that public servants felt threatened, did not say that the 
Prime Minister undermined democracy.  I guess we have got it 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister not just say that we are all wrong, 
every media report is wrong and the Canadian public who are 
phoning and e-mailing by the thousands are wrong? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is quite evident that the Leader of the Opposition is 
speaking too often with Jesse Helms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be very surprising that in order for a Prime Minister, 
a francophone from Quebec, to correct the Leader of the 
Opposition, I should perhaps invite the House of Commons to stand 
up and sing <I>God Save the Queen</I>.

more restraint, less arrogance and cynicism, and a greater sense 
of responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wake of the reports from the auditor general and the 
information commissioner, which confirm what we have been saying 
here for months, how can he justify the unjustifiable?

their words very carefully.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

closer to the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien: </B>Again today, the papers reported that, 
in the case of Transélec, the auditor general's staff have 
indicated that there had been absolutely no political 
interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his report, the auditor general said that an examination of 
all these files did not reveal a single person from the public 
service—and we, as MPs and ministers, are part of the public 
service—and clearly said that there had been absolutely no 
wrongdoing by politicians or public servants in any of these 
cases. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
words were very carefully chosen. There was no better way to put 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to talk about the truth, the truth is that his 
friend, Claude Gauthier, is involved in both the Placeteco and 
Transélec scandals.  The truth is that there are four RCMP 
investigations ongoing in the Prime Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that it was not $250 that was misspent;  millions 
have disappeared.  The truth is that perhaps this Prime Minister 
wants an election before the investigations are concluded, 
before the law gets involved.  He does not want to know what is 
going to happen—

to say that, in one instance, it was my office that called the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:  </B>Right now, the auditor general has

they would be in the Parliament of Canada

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize that, 
on the eve of an election, it is trying for the Prime Minister 
to realize that his score in Quebec will be no more than 20

going to knock him flat in this election.

that the whole Human Resources Development Canada scandal

not realize that there is a very serious problem in the—

<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
few minutes ago I quoted the auditor general, who said that the 
Minister of Human Resources Development had taken the steps 
necessary when she put her six point program in place to ensure 
that any abuse would be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that one of the department's problems was its desire to 
provide very quick service to the public and the fact that files 
were not totally complete as the result.  However, he said that 
no politician or public official had tried to benefit from all 
of these transactions or succeeded in doing so.   The member 
should recognize this if he is at all honest. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the subject 
of recognizing things, should the Prime Minister not be 
recognizing the fact that it was only after some ten 
interventions in the House, after he denied it and the Minister 
of Human Resources Development denied it, that the government 
was forced to face facts and, to avoid totally losing face, 
ordered investigations, including an unprecedented four in his own 
riding? 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
know they are incapable of establishing anything clearly and so 
they try to make people guilty by association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has said that no official either in 
my office, or in the department or any of those involved, 
including myself, had any involvement in these files.  This is 
what the auditor general said and he thanked the minister for 
setting up a program that works.  He is very satisfied with what 
we are doing now. I can see that the Bloc Quebecois is 
rather discouraged by the situation.

I want to refer to Downsview Park.  The auditor general said:

in council.  Will he tell the House of Commons what he was trying

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we did not try to 
hide anything.  The creation of this corporation was undertaken 
in a manner which was consistent with the role and authority of 
parliament as expressed through legislation governing crown 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Downsview Park does not receive any appropriations from the 
Government of Canada.  Almost all revenues for the development of 
the park are generated by leasing lands adjacent to the park.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Kings—Hants, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
auditor general says during 1999-2000 national defence spent 
approximately $4.8 million.  Is that nothing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of National Defence.  Because 
the auditor general said that those funds were not a valid charge 
against the national defence budget, why did the Minister of 
National Defence let that money be spent on purposes that were 
invalid?  Will he stop those practices and get the money back to 
national defence?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

purposes.  This property is still in the ownership of the 
Department of National Defence.  There are defence uses on that 
property.  There has been for quite a number of years moneys paid 
from national defence for the upkeep of those properties to the 
corporation responsible for managing the entire site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a sum of money that went through one of the accounts, 
a vote 1 account from parliament which was the wrong account.

purposes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

on HRDC is completely shameful.  When the Liberals took office in 
1993 they knew there were deep management problems in that 
department.  A new audit in 1994 confirmed that.  Just yesterday 
the Auditor General of Canada found more of the same, and I 
quote: “We found widespread problems.  We found that controls 
had broken down”.  He said that public money had been put at 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can Canadians trust a Liberal government that let this mess 
get worse year after year? 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must use this question to clarify 
something very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and again the leader of the Alliance Party has said that $3 
billion has been wasted and that has been repeated by his party's 
members.  I want the House to understand that when he says that 
he is saying that the $15 million we invest every year for the 
Canada student loans program is a waste.  He is saying that the 
$1 billion we transfer to the provinces every year for labour 
market training is a waste.  He is saying that the $100 million 
we invest in communities across the country for homelessness is a 
waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of that party will either stand up and say that they 
will cut these programs or they will come clean and say they do 
not know what they are talking about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, is that not interesting?  The auditor 
general yesterday had something to say about that kind of answer. 
He said “The government has continued to understate the 
problem”.  He confirmed that his findings of widespread 
mismanagement went beyond the problems we already knew about. 
Are misleading, hiding the truth, and grossly mismanaging public 
funds the real Liberal values? 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what the auditor general did say is that 
the actions and plans address the deficiencies that we found in 
our audit.  He writes that the “commitments in the action plan 
are being met” and that “corrective actions go beyond the six 
point plan”.  He said that HRDC has corrective actions planned 
and being implemented in response to the problems identified in 
its 1999 internal audit and “the actions and plans also address 
the deficiencies we found in our audit”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance has gone back to his creative 
accounting tricks but was caught yesterday by the auditor 
general.  The auditor general said that the five year tax 
reduction plan announced in the last budget was overstated by $7 
billion.  The tax reduction is just not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Finance.  If the auditor

add up?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

statement put out by the official opposition, he would have 
verified that there is about a $25 billion black hole there which 
is totally unaccounted for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that hon. members wait for 
about 65 minutes.  In a few minutes we will be hearing directly 
from the minister on this very important announcement affecting

<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

billion overstatement in the tax reduction and the way that he 
presents his numbers are suspect. The auditor general said “In 
our opinion, this results in misleading financial disclosure”. 
It is a serious indictment.  Why should taxpayers believe the 
numbers this afternoon, when the auditor general said that the 
last ones do not add up?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

there respecting Canadians' right to see what is open and what is 
evident.  Unlike the opposition we are not going to hide and we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa—Vanier, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Health.  A few months ago 
Health Canada issued an advisory that the drug known as Prepulsid 
would no longer be available to Canadians from pharmacies by 
summer's end. It also said that patients who do not respond to 
alternative therapies could obtain it through a special access 
program. Yet today patients who need this drug cannot access it, 
cannot obtain it.  My question is why?  What is Health Canada 
doing about this? 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in May of this year Health Canada took this particular drug off 
the market because of reported difficulties with cardiac 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that there are some Canadians who do not respond to 
alternative treatments or therapies. Health Canada is doing two 
things.  First of all, it is trying to persuade the manufacturer 
to make it available on special access requests. So far it has 
not but discussions continue.  Second, we have identified a 
generic form of the drug, Cisapride, that can also treat serious 
gastrointestinal conditions. I am happy to announce that a source 
of Cisapride has been identified and authorized release from this 
source is currently in progress.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley,

Liberal government has for Canadian taxpayers: weaknesses in 
contribution agreements; amendments made without supporting 
rationale; payments made for ineligible costs and expenses; and 
payments made without having claims submitted.  This is 
taxpayers' money.  On top of that there is the building of 
fountains in the Prime Minister's riding.

because the figures I wished to give come from the report on 
party financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report on party financing is a public report.  According to 
the report of the chief electoral officer, Groupe SM donated 
$1,098 to the Liberal Party in 1993; $4,379 in 1994; $232 in

the case of a contribution to the party in office.  In all these 
cases the Chair allowed these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before you rise, I would simply like to point out that there is 
a problem. We cannot obtain information because documents

to proceed.

Listening to the preamble and to the question, at least the 
portion of the question we are able to hear, it will be clearly 
seen that it is a matter of a government decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP)</B> moved 
for leave to introduce Bill C-510, an act to establish the 
Holocaust Memorial Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, it is my honour to introduce an act to 
establish the Holocaust memorial day.  Many of us in the House 
have been touched in some way by the horrors of the Holocaust. 
For me it was a recent pilgrimage marking the 55th anniversary of 
the liberation of Holland and a visit to Camp Westerbork where 
the Dutch Jewish population was sent on route to the death camps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total, six million Jewish men, women and children perished as 
the result of a deliberate and planned state sponsored 
persecution and annihilation of European Jewry by the Nazis and 
their collaborators between 1933 and 1945. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes to establish a national, annual Holocaust 
memorial day to be called Yom haShoah.  Why do we need this as a 
nation?  It is because the terrible destruction and pain of the 
Holocaust must never be forgotten.  It is because systematic 
violence, racism and hatred continue to occur.  It is because as 
a parliament we must do everything to uphold human rights and 
value the diversity and multiculturalism of Canadian society. 
It is because this part of our history must never be allowed to 
repeat itself.

Given the extremely serious allegations made by the information

official who is complaining about the operation of the 
government, as well as about relations with the Prime Minister's

matter with all due haste.

<A NAME="LINK154">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House support the economic policies of the government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I wish to table a notice of ways and means 
motion and I ask that an order of the day be designated for 
consideration of the motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little more than eight months ago we presented the first 
budget of the new millennium.  It was a budget that invested in 
health, education, the environment and children.  It was a budget 
that introduced the most important structural changes to the tax 
system in decades.  It was a budget that provided the largest tax 
cuts in 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time we said that we hoped to go even further in the 
future.  What I would like to do today is to build on that budget 
and to confirm because of our strong economic growth that we can 
indeed go further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada begins the 21st century in a position of renewed 
strength, with greater resources and more choices than we have 
had in many decades.  Our nation's success has been written by 
many hands.  That success is a tribute to the hard working men 
and women of this country and a tribute to their effort and 
commitment.  It is as a result of their dedication that a future 
once beyond our imagination is now within our grasp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, seizing that future will depend on the choices we make 
now.  Ours must be a vision which understands that in an era of 
globalization it is more important than ever to have a national 
perspective, one based on the aspirations of all Canadians.  It 
must be a vision that sees Canadian society as more than a 
collection of competing interests.  It must understand that, yes, 
we have as stewards a responsibility to manage our finances 
wisely, but we also have as citizens an obligation to one 
another. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country's recent economic performance has been striking. 
The last three months marked the 20th consecutive quarter of 
growth, the longest sustained period of gain since the mid-1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our current account is in the largest surplus position in its 
history. Our foreign indebtedness, as a percentage of our 
economy, is at its lowest level in more than 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 12 months Canadians have created more than 360,000 
new jobs. Our unemployment rate has fallen to 6.8%, approaching 
its lowest level in 24 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And as a result, for the third year in a row Canada has the 
best job creation rate of any G-7 country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the crucial area of productivity our rate of growth for this 
year is almost twice the average of the last 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more importantly, Canadians are starting to see their real 
per capita disposable incomes rise, leaving more money in their 
pockets at the end of each month. In many ways, this is the true 
test of any economic program, the surest touchstone of real 
economic progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rising disposable incomes mean that more and more Canadians 
are participating in our nation's prosperity and that the progress 
we have made in our nation's finances is beginning to make a 
real difference in the finances of Canadian families.

which we can be proud.  That being said, the purpose of today's 
statement is not to talk about where we have been but about where 
we must go because far more important than the progress of the 
past are our prospects for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In planning for next year and beyond, the government has once 
again asked the chief economists of Canada's major chartered 
banks in four leading forecasting firms to develop economic and 
fiscal projections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the government, I want to thank all of those who 
participated in the exercise.  Their contribution was invaluable 
and ensured that the fiscal projections we make for planning 
purposes are based on the most rigorous possible analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results are as follows: First, the average private sector 
forecast is for our economy to grow by 4.7% this year, 3.5% next 
year and roughly 3% thereafter.  Second, based on these 
forecasts, and after adjusting for the contingency reserve and 
prudence, and also after deducting the amounts arising out of the 
recent agreements on health and early childhood development, the 
average of the economic forecasts for the planning surplus is as 
follows: for the year 2000, $12.2 billion; for 2001, $10.9 
billion; for 2002, $11.5 billion; for 2003, $11.3 billion; for 
2004, $7 billion; and for the year 2005-06, a planning surplus of 
$10.7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are encouraging numbers but make no mistake, these 
surpluses are not a licence to spend freely.  Rather, they are an 
opportunity to choose wisely.  They represent a chance to improve 
the lives of Canadians and to increase the flexibility we will 
need to succeed in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question we therefore have to address is, on the basis of 
these planning surplus projections, what is the proper balance 
among paying down debt, reducing taxes and making key 
investments?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The question, therefore, we have to address is, on the basis of 
these planning surplus projections, what is the proper balance 
among paying down debt, reducing taxes and making key 
investments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we require a plan, a long-term plan. One that 
understands the economy of today, but even more importantly, 
recognizes the changes we need to make for tomorrow. There can 
be no doubt that we are in the early stages of an unprecedented 
revolution, of a new economy founded on a cascade of 
technological breakthroughs, in a world without frontiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a few countries will become the leaders in this new world. 
We want Canada to be one of them. 
For this to happen Canada needs to be at the forefront of 
technological change, the first to corner untapped markets. We 
should be the standard by which other nations measure 
themselves. We must be an economy of innovation, not 
replication. As well, ours must be a society that recognizes 
that success begins with equality of opportunity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal cannot simply be to put up better economic numbers.  It 
must be to lift up greater numbers of people, to provide the kind 
of strong foundation on which Canadians can build better lives. 
That is why our plan advances on four crucial fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First is investing in the social fabric of this country, in 
health care and in other areas that reflect the responsibility 
Canadians feel to one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is strengthening education, research and innovation, for 
in a knowledge economy these are the surest paths to success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third is paying down the debt because we owe it to our 
children.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A successful plan strikes the right balance across a broad array 
of choices.  On the one hand, Canadians demand that their tax 
dollars be managed with the same care with which they handle 
their own personal finances, and they are right to do so. 
Therefore let there be no doubt, we will continue to be frugal. 
Over the next five years we will hold the rate of growth in 
program spending to less than the rate of growth in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, Canadians want us to invest in those areas 
that matter most.  Governments are judged by the priorities they 
set and our priorities have been clear.  From the time we 
balanced the books in 1997-98 and including the measures we are 
introducing today, almost three-quarters, 75%, of our new 
spending has been devoted to health care, to children and to 
education.  These are the priorities of Canadians and these are 
the right priorities, for a country is not a balance sheet, it is 
the embodiment of the hopes and the dreams of its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing is more fundamental to Canadians than quality health 
care.  Nothing speaks more clearly to the collective 
responsibility we have to one another.  That is why the agreement 
reached last month by the Prime Minister and the premiers to 
renew health care is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal commitment to this agreement is $23.4 billion, one 
of the largest single expenditures by any Canadian government in 
our nation's history.  Of this, $1 billion will be invested in 
much needed medical equipment such as MRIs and CAT scanners and 
$21.1 billion will be added to the Canada health and social 
transfer, this so that the provinces and the territories can 
accelerate the changes necessary to ensure that Canadians receive 
the high quality health care they deserve, to increase the 
number of doctors and nurses, to shorten waiting lists and to 
reduce the time spent in emergency rooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area where government must spend to ensure the health of 
its citizens is the environment.  The quality of our individual 
lives is deeply rooted in the quality of the environment we 
share, in clear air and in clean water.  That is why in our last 
budget we set aside $700 million for environmental initiatives. 
It is why the plan set out today incorporates the recent 
announcement of an additional $500 million to address the key 
challenges of climate change and air pollution, bringing our 
total investment in environmental measures this year alone to 
$1.2 billion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have spoken of the need to become a nation that excels at 
innovation, of the need to be leaders in the new economy. For 
this to become a reality, all levels of government and all 
sectors of society must come together to ensure that knowledge 
in school, in the workplace and in all of its many facets, is at 
the very heart of the national agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make no mistake, success in the new economy will not be 
determined by technology alone, but by creating an environment 
of excellence in which Canadians can take advantage of their 
talents, their skills and their ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This begins at the earliest age. That is why $2.2 billion was 
aimed specifically at early childhood development. These 
resources are to be used by provinces and territories to invest 
in promoting healthy pregnancies, birth and infancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are to be devoted to pre-school programs and child care, 
family support and parent information. With this funding in 
place we can help ensure that our young children get the best 
possible start in life and arrive at school ready, and able, to 
learn. Children prepared to learn become adults equipped to 
succeed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Ensuring that Canadians enjoy the best learning and research 
opportunities here in Canada has been a priority in each of our 
last four budgets.  Today we will do more.  Canadian students 
rely on the education tax credit to offset the cost of books, 
lodging and other expenses.  As recently as 1995 the amount on 
which the credit was based was $80 per month.  Over the past 
number of years we have raised it to $200.  Today we will go 
further.  This January we will double that amount to $400 a 
month.  This will put an additional $1 billion into the hands of 
one million students over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past four years the government has introduced an 
unprecedented series of strategic initiatives to rebuild the 
research infrastructure of our universities in order to attract 
and retain the best minds and to expand their opportunities here 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is the Canada research chairs, Genome Canada, the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research or the Canada Foundation 
for Innovation, we want Canadians to be able to do world class 
research right here in Canada.  Therefore, to reinforce Canada's 
capacity to be a global player in cutting edge research, the 
Canada Foundation for Innovation will allocate up to $100 million 
of the funding it received in budget 2000 to support the capital 
costs in Canada of several large collaborative projects involving 
Canadian universities and facilities around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, one of the key requirements for effective world class 
research is establishing the critical mass necessary for success. 
Therefore, in order to build the cluster of leading researchers 
that Canada needs, the CFI will allocate $250 million of the 
funding set out in budget 2000 to provide new infrastructure 
support for each recipient of a Canada research chair.  This will 
be provided in a way that helps smaller universities so that the 
benefits will be more evenly distributed across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next and most important, we are announcing today $500 million in 
new funding for the Canada Foundation for Innovation, $400 
million of which will allow it to assist universities and 
research hospitals to meet the operating costs associated with 
new research facilities provided by the foundation, and $100 
million to help Canadian researchers participate in leading edge 
international projects, because doing their best research means 
being able to collaborate with the best scientists from around 
the world and from a strong Canadian base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, if Canada is to be a leader in the new economy, we need 
to understand its opportunities and how to seize them, its 
educational requirements and how to meet them, its management 
skills and how to develop them.  More, we need to make lifelong 
learning a reality.  To these ends, we are announcing today a 
special allocation of $100 million over the next five years to 
the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, so that 
Canada will be at the forefront of this vital research into the 
new knowledge economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important steps we can take to ensure a better 
future for our children is to reduce the burden of debt on their 
shoulders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than a generation, Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio rose 
relentlessly. Over the past four years, however, both as a 
result of our debt repayment plan and a growing economy, that 
ratio has been falling from a peak of 71% in 1995-96 to about 59% 
today. This is the steepest decline among all G-7 countries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must continue on that downward track and we will. Indeed, as a 
result of the actions we are taking today we project that 
Canada will reach a debt to GDP ratio of about 40% within the 
next four years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago we announced a $12.3 billion paydown of our 
national debt for the year 1999-2000, bringing the total debt 
reduction over the past three years to more than $18.7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today and going forward, the government is adding a new element 
to its debt repayment plan.  We will continue the practice of 
setting aside $3 billion as a contingency reserve.  However each 
fall from now on we will announce whether a greater amount should 
be dedicated to that year's debt paydown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some years we will be able to do so.  In other years we will 
not.  It will depend on the economic circumstances of the day. 
When times are good Canadians pay down their credit cards. 
Similarly, when times are good governments should pay down debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we are announcing today that for this year, 2000-01, 
we will pay down a minimum of $10 billion in debt. This means 
that over the last four years we will have reduced the national 
debt by $28.7 billion, resulting in interest savings of $1.7 
billion for each and every year going forward, money that will 
now be available to meet the priorities of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn to taxes. Our tax plan is designed with the 
following objectives in mind: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, providing tax relief to all Canadians but to moderate and 
middle income families in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, helping those who need it most through a number of 
general and targeted measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, promoting job creation and economic growth to give 
Canada and Canadians an advantage in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more importantly, our plan will achieve these objectives by 
legislating, not promising, the largest tax cut in Canadian 
history, 
and by bringing our measures into effect by January 1, 2001, less 
than two and a half months from now. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the central themes of both our last budget and this 
ensuing economic statement is the need to foster a culture of 
innovation and entrepreneurship in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If companies are going to invest, we want them to invest in 
Canada.  If they are going to create jobs, we want them to create 
jobs in Canada.  If young people are going to have opportunities, 
we want them to have opportunities in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our tax structure should provide incentives, not impediments, to 
achieving these goals.  This is something that small businesses, 
particularly new start-ups, have been telling governments for 
some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, in order to increase the amount of capital available 
to small businesses, budget 2000 introduced a limited tax-free 
rollover of capital gains for eligible small business 
investments.  Effective immediately, this measure will be 
expanded to raise the amount of the rollover from $500,000 to $2 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the size of business eligible for the rollover will 
be increased from $10 million to $50 million.  This will help 
existing Canadian businesses to look for new opportunities, to 
innovate, to expand and to hire new employees.  For new 
businesses it will mean greater opportunity to secure the 
resources they need to succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, self-employed Canadians get a 17% credit on both 
the employer's and the employee's contributions to the Canada and 
Quebec pension plans.  This puts them at a disadvantage with 
incorporated businesses which can deduct the employer's portion 
of these contributions.  To remove this disadvantage, effective 
January 1, 2001 the employer's portion of the contributions to 
these plans will be 100% deductible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of our approach to encouraging entrepreneurship and the 
creation of new jobs in Canada for Canadians, budget 2000 reduced 
the capital gains inclusion rate from three-quarters to 
two-thirds.  Effective today we will go further.  We will lower 
the inclusion rate to 50% and provide similar tax relief for 
employee stock option benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An internationally competitive corporate tax system is essential 
to sustaining economic growth.  At the present time we have a 
small business tax rate of 12%.  For larger companies, there are 
a number of Canadian industries that enjoy a competitive tax rate 
of 21%.  However there are other sectors, like high tech where 
much of the new job creation is occurring, that face a tax rate 
of 28%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In budget 2000 we set out a five year plan to lower that rate 
from 28% to 21%.  The plan called for a one point drop next year 
with the remaining reduction taking place by the end of five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, to assure that these companies remain internationally 
competitive, we are accelerating the plan.  In addition to the 
one point reduction in the general corporate tax rate scheduled 
for the coming year, we will now legislate a two point cut in 
each of the following three years.  By accelerating and 
legislating this timetable, companies can invest with certainty, 
knowing precisely when and by how much their taxes will fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn to the most important aspect of our tax plan, 
personal income taxes, and let me begin by telling the House what 
our plan means for Canadians, especially moderate and middle 
income families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiatives we announced in our last budget eight months ago 
would have reduced taxes for Canadians by an average of 15%. 
Today we will deepen these cuts to an average of 21%.  For 
families with children we will do more, providing an average tax 
cut of 27%.  As a result of the measures we announced in February 
and those we are announcing today, let me give some examples of 
the tax savings for Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now describe our approach to tax relief for low income 
Canadians, those who need it most.  This is where our tax cuts 
began even before our books were balanced.  Over the past three 
years we have raised the threshold at which no net tax is paid, 
removing one million Canadians from the tax rolls altogether. 
Eight months ago, the most important measure of budget 2000, we 
restored full indexation to our tax system, a measure designed to 
help low income Canadians in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is not our final word. We have always said that as 
resources permit we would do more for low income Canadians and 
we will do so in each and every budget going forward.  Today we 
take the latest but not the last steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we will lower the 17% rate to 16% effective this January. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in order to assist those families with children, we will 
increase the national child benefit supplement by $100 per child. 
This is in addition to the $200 increase announced in budget 
2000, bringing the increase in the supplement to $300 per child 
effective next July 1.  By 2004 this increase in the supplement 
will mean a total benefit of more than $2,500 for the first 
child with corresponding benefits for additional children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, as the colder months approach, Canadians are concerned 
about the impact of rising energy prices on their home heating 
bills.  This concern is particularly acute for those on low 
incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three weeks ago the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, on 
behalf of government members, proposed an amendment to an 
opposition motion in order to ensure that relief is targeted to 
those who need it most.  We agree.  We are therefore announcing, 
at a cost of $1.3 billion for 11 million Canadians a one time 
relief of $125 per individual, $250 per family to assist low and 
modest income Canadians in dealing with their home heating 
expenses.

priorities that cannot be deferred. Assisting Canadians with

$3,500.  We will increase the amount for the disability tax 
credit from $4,290 to $6,000.

families bear as a result of an aging population, we introduced

will not exhaust every penny of surplus on tax cuts leaving 
virtually nothing to fund the core services, nor will we base our 
actions on the rosiest of predictions.  Sound financial 
management allows for the possibility of rain even in the 
sunniest of forecasts.  In the past, governments have got into 
real trouble by forgetting that lesson.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our approach has served Canadians well.  It has taken us from 
massive deficit to surplus, from rising to declining debt, from 
credit downgrade to credit upgrade.  So to those who say that we 
should gamble with Canadians' money we say no. We will not turn 
the nation's finances into a day at the track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we will not bring in the 17% flat tax.  We will not 
bring it in tomorrow and we will not bring it in in five years. 
It is untried and it is unfair.  It is unfair today and five 
years from now will not make it any fairer.  It is unfair because 
it gives someone earning $1 million a year a tax cut of $130,000 
compared to $500 for somebody earning $25,000.  It is unfair 
because it would give the top 1% of all income earners in Canada 
$8 billion in tax cuts.  That is almost 30% of the entire flat 
tax package.  It is unfair even under the 17-25 interim flat tax 
plan because that would still give the same top 1% of income 
earners 16% of the total tax relief provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These results do not occur by accident. They are the intended 
effects of those who propose the flat tax. It is a clear 
reflection of the kind of society that they would build. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would deliver to upper income Canadians tax relief that 
rightly belongs to the middle class and that is wrong. It 
rejects the progressive tax system, one based on an individual's 
ability to pay, and that is wrong. It offends the basic compact 
we have made with each other as Canadians to build this country 
together, and that is wrong. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have spoken of the choices we face as a country, of 
the need for a vision that is broad enough to encompass all 
Canadians. A vision that shares opportunity across all regions 
and all income levels. A vision that rests on our mutual 
commitment as citizens of this remarkable country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 133 years we have proven that we could build a nation of 
opportunity and still provide for those who cannot provide for 
themselves.  We have always known that we did not have to settle 
for less because Canada was capable of so much more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always understood that true community only comes from 
working together in common cause and shared purpose, by doing 
what our heart says is right in a way that our head says will 
work. We cannot subscribe to the view that it is everyone for 
himself, that it is winner take all.  How can we fulfill our 
promise as a nation if our vision of the national interest is so 
constricted by self-interest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada stands at the threshold of its greatest era.  Together we 
have come far and done much, but we know that prosperity is not 
a quiet cove where we rest; it is a journey that we must 
continually chart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every generation of Canadians has understood the responsibility 
to take what is passed to them and to make of it something 
better. Today that responsibility falls to us to translate the 
potential that we have into the prosperity that we seek, to build 
a Canada where our people feel there is nowhere else they would 
rather be than here because there is nowhere else where they can 
achieve so much. That is the true challenge we must meet. That is 
the challenge we will meet.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Minister of Finance on behalf of 
the official opposition for the unprecedented gesture of spending 
a significant portion of the government's budget speech talking 
about the opposition's fiscal plan.  We appreciate the attention 
very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the nervous nellies across the way.  I can understand 
that reaction.  Canadians will continue to be nervous when they 
see the details in this fiscal plan and understand that the 
government continues to be committed to its sincerely held 
conviction that politicians and bureaucrats know better than 
working families or entrepreneurs how to spend an extra dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document tabled in the House today has made the fundamental 
differences between the Liberal government and the Canadian 
Alliance opposition even more evident.  It takes a huge portion 
of the taxpayer overpayment, which the government calls its 
surplus, and directs it to new spending in low priority areas. 
This is the very type of spending that has been roundly 
criticized and condemned in its mismanagement by the auditor 
general this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a $52 billion spending increase above and 
beyond what had already been projected by the government, $27 
billion of which is not even related to reintroducing the health 
care funding slashed by the government in 1995.  The $27 billion 
of new spending to go into low priority areas is not going to be 
kept in the pockets of working families and entrepreneurs to 
create new wealth, growth, hope and opportunity for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say at the outset that the finance minister talked about 
the state of the Canadian economy.  We can all be glad that 
Canadians are finally seeing growth, but growth that 
unfortunately is largely being driven by exports to the United 
States, exports that themselves have been fueled by unprecedented 
low currency rates.  Today our currency is at only 65 cents 
against the U.S. dollar.  Before this government's time, the 
1970s, our dollar was at par with the U.S. dollar.  Much of the 
growth we are experiencing is in fact a reflection of the 
impoverishment of our currency and standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect I would like to reference the views of an 
eminent Canadian economist.  In a speech earlier this year he 
said that Canadian living standards measured by real disposable 
income per capita fell by 2% through the decade of the 1990s 
while American living standards rose by 18% over the same period. 
As a consequence, Canadian living standards fell from an 
estimated 74% of U.S. levels in 1989 to 61% in 1999.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that if we extrapolate this trend of the 1990s 
over the coming decade, Canadian living standards will have 
declined to a mere 50% of U.S. levels.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue that there is a real danger of a continuation of Canada's 
relative income deterioration under status quo policies, to the 
detriment of Canada and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By status quo policies, I mean a business as usual attitude in 
Ottawa, including a continuation of the Red Book promise to 
direct half of all federal surpluses into higher government 
spending. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who said that?  None other than the Liberal Party's candidate in 
the riding of Markham, Mr. John McCallum, who said there is a 
very real risk that we will continue to see a diminishment of our 
standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, that diminishment, which he and all other 
reputable private sector economists talk about, will continue 
under the fiscal direction outlined in the document before us 
today.  There is too little tax relief and debt reduction too 
late.  There is too much spending in this mini budget, with mini 
tax cuts and no real legislative long term plan for debt 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, this document outlines $52 billion in new spending by 
2005.  This money could be going to tax relief.  The Canadian 
Alliance has tabled before Canadians a plan to provide $125 
billion in tax relief over the next five years.  This would 
constitute the single largest tax reduction in the history of 
Canada, increasing the after tax income of average families by 
over 40%.  This is substantially more than that contemplated by 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would do that by getting our priorities straight.  First of 
all, we would not further complicate the tax system by 
introducing four tax brackets as the minister proposes to do in 
this fourth rate budget.  By reducing the marginal rates we would 
reduce the disincentives for people to work, save and invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe those at the low end of the income scale, such as the 
working poor, single mothers, seniors on fixed incomes, and all 
those struggling to get ahead deserve the biggest and best tax 
relief.  This is precisely why, under the Canadian Alliance fair 
tax plan, we propose to increase the basic personal exemption 
from the paltry $7,700 proposed by the minister to $10,000 and to 
match it with a spousal exemption.  This would help eliminate the 
unfairness against single income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has chosen today to continue the unfair 
discrimination against single income families who choose to raise 
their children at home.  The Canadian Alliance tax plan would 
level the playing field for all families with any choice of child 
care by introducing a generous $3,000 per child deduction.  Under 
our plan a family of five would pay zero federal tax on their 
first $29,000 of income.  A single mother who earns $16,000 a 
year and has two children would pay zero tax under the Canadian 
Alliance proposal.  Under our proposal 1.4 million low income 
Canadians would be lifted off the tax rolls.  These are the same 
Canadians the government will continue to force to pay taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the minister would like us to believe this tiny reduction 
in the bottom rate from 17% to 16% will somehow help those at the 
lowest income level.  For a single income mother who earns 
$16,000 a year and has two children the minister's plan means a 
cup of coffee in terms of a year's tax savings.  Under the 
Canadian Alliance plan she would be paying no tax.  It would be a 
100% tax cut.  That is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of a couple with two children, with one 
parent earning a salary of $40,000.   They would pay $317 less 
under the Alliance plan in this fiscal year and nearly $1,700 
less than under the minister's tax and spend budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan would provide greater tax relief for income earners at 
all levels.  We do not apologize for that.  We do not apologize 
for lifting 1.4 million taxpayers off the rolls.  We do not 
apologize for giving a 100% tax cut to low income mothers and 
parents.  We do not apologize for providing family tax fairness. 
We do not apologize for suggesting that those who work hard and 
innovate and get ahead and have high incomes in particular years 
should also get tax relief.  These are the people who help create 
wealth and jobs.  They help create the environment we need for 
long term and sustained economic prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister used the demagogic rhetoric of class warfare at the 
end of his speech.  This millionaire who himself engages in the 
most aggressive form of tax avoidance through his steamship 
lines, with its ships flagged in such tax havens as Liberia and 
Panama, would stand in this place and play class warfare politics 
by suggesting that those who carry the biggest burden, those who 
are successful, ought not to see tax relief.  That is 
disingenuous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the consequences of this kind of class warfare rhetoric. 
We see it every year when 65,000 talented, bright, contributing 
Canadians, the equivalent of a Canadian city, leave to pursue 
economic opportunities elsewhere and find lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget will fundamentally do nothing to bring Canada closer 
to catching up with such major competitors as the United States, 
neither in personal taxes nor in business taxes.  The government 
fails to reduce the small business tax rate which the Canadian 
Alliance would reduce from 12% to 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget fails to move fast enough to reduce the capital gains 
tax burden on investment and innovation.  The government proposes 
to reduce the inclusion rate for capital gains from two-thirds to 
50%, as do we.  The difference is that a Canadian Alliance 
government would tax those gains at eventually the single low 
rate of 17%.  That means an effective capital gains rate of 
nearly half of what the government proposes, a capital gains 
rate that would actually match those of our major economic 
competitors and would begin to approach the levels imposed by 
some of the European countries, including Germany and Ireland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our proposal we go much further in terms of capital gains. 
Why?  We choose to leave that money in the pockets of taxpayers 
and not in Ottawa to be handed out by politicians or bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me move on to the question of debt.  It is a question that 
my Liberal friends opposite are expert on.  They are principally 
responsible for having created the $565 billion national mortgage 
that is a weight on this economy and on future generations.  It 
is a debt that costs us still $40 billion a year in annual 
interest payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians said they would like to see a legislated, 
politician-proof commitment to pay down the debt.  What do they 
get in this budget from the government?  More rhetoric, more 
maybes, more ifs, more possibilities and no legislative 
commitment for debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals say that they will turn the contingency fund into a 
possible debt reduction fund.  Before that happens, that money 
has to get through a cabinet populated by the likes of Brian 
Tobin, the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Minister of 
Human Resources Development.  One can call me a sceptic, but I 
believe that money will end up in new pork barrel spending the 
likes of which the auditor general has just criticized.  It will 
not be used to pay down our national mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely why the Canadian Alliance has proposed an 
absolute rock bottom, solid minimum in the worst case year, in a 
politician-proof locked box, of $6 billion a year in debt 
reduction, to be matched by 75% of any unexpected surpluses and 
on top of that a very generous contingency reserve and prudence 
factor of $7 billion a year.  In the fifth year of our plan, if 
the economy grows as the minister projects, we would see annual 
debt reduction of nearly $20 billion.  That would be real action 
to eliminate the national debt within, we would hope, four to 
five decades and not the much longer period of time proposed by 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, on debt reduction, because the government instead decides 
to spend more through politicians and bureaucrats in Ottawa, we 
will not get nearly as much as Canadians demand and need to 
secure our economic future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On so many other issues this budget falls short.  When it comes 
to gas tax relief the vast majority of Canadians have said that 
they want meaningful, immediate and permanent relief in terms 
of fuel taxes.  People are struggling to pay prices of 72 cents 
and 74 cents at the pump.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do they get from the government?  They get a one time 
election cheque being sent out to a hand selected small number of 
Canadians.  What we really need, what the Alliance proposes to 
deliver, is a permanent elimination of the so-called deficit 
reduction surtax on fuel and the stopping of the odious practice 
of applying the GST on tax.  We would deliver a permanent 
reduction of 3.5 cents per litre in the price per litre for all 
Canadians, not just for a hand picked few.  We would not just 
hand out a one time election year cheque as the minister 
proposes to do in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also move much more quickly and aggressively to enhance 
the retirement security of Canadians by increasing the maximum 
amount people can contribute to their registered retirement 
savings plans.  We would raise that immediately to $18,500, which 
the government will not do even within the fifth year of its 
plan.  We understand that Canadians need a reliable income for 
their retirement and we will provide the tax room for them to 
create that future.  We would also raise the foreign property 
content limit in RRSPs, which would allow Canadians to diversify 
their investments and have a safer retirement in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also reduce the general corporate tax rate much more 
quickly than the government proposes and equalize it so that we 
no longer penalize the services sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mini-budget, with its mini-tax cut, its huge spending and 
its non-existent debt reduction strategy, presents Canadians with 
a clear and stark choice as we move into the weeks ahead.  It is 
a choice between visions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the vision of Canada that says politicians in Ottawa 
know better how to direct the economic future of working families 
than those families themselves. It is a choice in regard to 
a government that believes the billions spent by the human 
resources minister in pork barrel politically controlled spending 
is somehow more creative than that money left in the pockets of 
working Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a choice between a vision that says a $565 billion debt is 
an afterthought which can be tended to almost by accident and 
incidentally, and a vision that says the national debt is a 
disgrace and a burden on the future, which must be paid down 
legally, without any choice for government, in order to begin to 
reduce it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essentially a choice between a government vision that does 
not apologize for the fact that Canada will continue to have the 
highest personal income taxes in the G-7 and will continue to see 
its standard of living, its competitiveness and the value of its 
currency deteriorate, as Mr. McCallum says, under the kind of 
spending plan proposed today, and the vision of the Canadian 
Alliance, which is one of a country that rewards risk taking, 
entrepreneurship and the kind of creative and dynamic economic 
activity that founded this great land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the official opposition look forward to the debate around 
the misplaced priorities of the government, its return to pork 
barrel spending, its election driven and politically driven 
agenda, and the vision we present which allows greater freedom 
and greater opportunity for Canadians in all parts of the 
country at all income levels.  We look forward to the debate 
that is about to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would move: 
<A NAME="LINK156">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “that” and substituting the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the Government for failing to provide 
the vision and leadership that Canadians need as they face a new 
century with new challenges and opportunities, for burdening 
Canadians with personal income tax levels that are the highest 
among the world's largest economies, for allowing incomes and 
productivity to fall behind the United States and other 
countries, for creating a mountain of debt for their children and 
grandchildren to bear, for causing long waits for medical 
treatment by making deep cuts to health care which have yet to be 
fully restored, and that this House condemns the government for 
its arrogance in giving grants and contracts to political 
supporters, and in mismanaging billions of taxpayers' dollars in 
grants and contributions over its seven years in office.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the mini-budget brought down today by the Minister of Finance 
would do any member of the Canadian Alliance proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a budget that leans to the right.  It is a budget that 
will satisfy a certain cross-section of taxpayers in Quebec and 
in Canada, but which ignores a large chunk of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the staggering, not to say exploding, surpluses at the 
disposal of the Minister of Finance, we were expecting that he 
would do something for those who were really responsible for 
helping put the fiscal house in order, those whose efforts have 
made the last three years of zero deficits possible and are still 
being gouged by the federal tax system, those who are the reason 
the minister can stand here today and boast about surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought that the main beneficiaries of these tax cuts would 
be low and middle income families, not families at the top end of 
the scale, those earning $250,000 and up, not the millionaire 
friends of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were expecting that a major effort would be made to provide 
relief for the neediest families, those who are responsible for 
Canada's improved finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, we see tax cuts for those at the top, those earning 
$250,000 and up.  Many of them are listening today.  We see tax 
cuts for these folks that are 40 times the tax cuts for a 
Canadian family earning $35,000.  That is 40 times higher.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax cuts for a family with one dependent child and a $35,000 
income represent 1% of that family's income, whereas tax cuts 
for families with an income of $250,000 or more represent 8% for 
that income bracket. What kind of fairness is this? It is worse 
than the flat rate advocated by the Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the tax cuts, the change in the capital gains taxation, and 
the elimination of the surtax, a family that has an income of 
$250 000 will get a $20,000 reduction in its tax bill this year. 
This is $20,000 after taxes for people who do not need it and 
did not contribute to the surplus. 
So this family will get $20,000, and a single income family 
with one dependent child and $35,000 will get only $500. That is 
$20,000 compared to $500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we imagine what we could have done by transferring to low 
and middle income families the tax cuts being granted to the 
rich? We could have eliminated all federal income tax for 
families with an income of $40,000 or less. Families in need, 
families that are in need because of this government and this 
callous finance minister, could have been dropped from the 
federal income tax roll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the finance minister candidly gave us an interesting bit 
of information. 
We have often risen in the House to ask him to do something to 
ensure that single parents with one dependent child earning less 
than $35,000 not pay any tax. He has always said “It is already 
taken care of, those people no longer pay any tax”. How can he 
explain now that he wants to reduce the income tax level for 
this bracket of income when these people supposedly no longer 
pay any tax? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After saying just about anything about the surplus, after hiding 
the real figures from the Canadian people to prevent any public 
debate on the Liberals' priorities right wing priorities, they 
are now fudging the figures on income tax reduction. They want 
Canadians to believe that they will benefit from extraordinary 
income tax cuts and from the government's  generosity, but this 
is not the case at all. 
The only ones who will benefit from all this, as was the case in 
the last two budgets, are Canadians with very high incomes, 
friends of the party, and they say that there are income tax 
cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the last budget for the same family earning no more than 
$35,000, there is a $200 reduction. For a family earning 
$250,000 and more, there is a $9,000 reduction. Is that the kind 
of fairness the government is talking about? Is that what is 
meant by responsibility in the minister's documents? So much for 
social justice. Our viewers will not be fooled. They will 
realize that for the vast majority of taxpayers there might be 
some tax cuts, but inadequate cuts, since the Minister of 
Finance has surpluses coming out his ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year he dares to say that the surplus will reach $6 billion 
only, whereas close to $12 billion has already been accumulated 
in the coffers of the federal government. That is more than 
double his forecasts for this year. He might have doubled the 
effort he is making now, but for ordinary people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the proposals that are made, I think that is pretty clear. 
Over the next five years $74 billion will go to tax reductions, 
but these should be directed at the real people. Nine taxpayers 
out of ten should get tax reductions because they are the ones 
who paid in order that public finances could be placed on a 
sounder footing. We are talking about people earning less than 
$80,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what should be targeted, that is the unfairness that 
should be corrected, for these are the people who paid for 
fiscal improvement. These are the people who are still getting 
bled white by the tax system so that very affluent families can 
enjoy those incredible tax reductions. People within those same 
income brackets workers and small business people contributing to 
the employment insurance system are funding, through the surplus 
accumulated in the EI account, the tax reductions the finance 
minister is giving today on a silver plate to the very rich 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking also about the unemployed men and women who are not 
receiving any EI benefits since they were literally thrown out 
of the system because of the drastic cuts made in this system 
and because of the tightening up of the eligibility criteria.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> They are further right than the 
Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> That is right. That is the choice the voters 
are given, to vote for people who serve the very rich, the 
millionaires and the billionaires. That is what the government 
did first with the family trusts and now with the tax reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing goes for the Alliance and its flat rate. It will 
increase the gap between the rich and the poor. Low and middle 
income families will continue to pay, while the rich gets richer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois, are ready to manage the real things, 
the real surpluses. For four years now, we have been talking 
about the real surpluses the government has. We do not wail until 
the eve of an election to release the real figures and talk about 
our real priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois, believe the minister could have done 
things differently. His priorities could have been different than 
those he has listed. 
He could have addressed the real problems. He could have given 
massive tax cuts to middle income earners. He could have 
reorganized the employment insurance system instead of literally 
stealing the surplus from the workers every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could have done more to help the poorest families faced with 
the oil crisis. A senior citizen, for instance, or a woman living 
alone, will receive a cheque of $125 to make up in part for the 
increase in the price of oil heating. Actually, the price of oil 
has almost doubled since last year, from $600 to more than 
$1,000. What good is $125? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, if the government had not given a $20,000 income 
tax cut to those earning $250,000 and more, it could have been 
more generous. We could have done more for those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also have given a hand to the trucking industry. Some 
people are in difficulty right now because of the oil crisis. We 
could have helped taxi drivers or farmers who are going through 
an incredible crisis because of oil prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the government has chosen the easy way, the flag on the 
cheque. It chose to give $125 to make up for the constant 
increase in the price of oil and as a means to help the poorest, 
the ones the government has hit hard with such drastic measures 
as the cuts to social transfer payments or the restrictive rules 
of eligibility for employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what it has done. A $20,000 income tax cut for 
millionaires and a $500 cut for middle income families and the 
poorest families during an unprecedented oil crisis. It has 
given them $125. 
It is the flag that counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> This is political marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> It is political marketing, and political 
opportunism too to come out with such things just before an 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is shameful to come out with such things. It is shameful for 
two reasons. The government forgot to say who actually cleaned up 
the public finances. We did not forget those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that those who had to bear the brunt of most of the $25 
billion increase in taxes, to which bracket creep must be added, 
since 1993 are low and middle income families, those who earn 
less than $80,000 a year. We did not forget them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not forget the unemployed either, because by being robbed 
of the EI fund surplus, they are the ones who are paying for the 
tax relief given to the rich. We did not forget them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the next election campaign, we will fight with all our 
might to force the Minister of Finance to go back to the drawing 
board and apply tax resources to the priorities of ordinary people, 
whom we have consulted. We have been consulting people for seven 
years since we were elected here. We know what the priorities 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For his part, the minister consults his friends the millionaires 
and people from big corporations, like Thomas d'Aquino, before 
deciding what would be good for society as a whole. Of course, he 
ends up helping a few millionaires.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will know what the priorities are. Here they are: tax cuts as 
high as those proposed generally by the Minister of Finance, but 
for families that really need them. As for employment insurance, 
it is a reform that would use up most of the surpluses generated 
in the next five years, the rest serving as a contingency fund, 
to improve the system so that more than 40% of Canadians are 
eligible. For women and young people, the exclusion rate is even 
higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will fight against the fact that there has been no index 
adjustment to the Canada health and social transfer for health, 
social assistance and especially education which has been 
neglected by the government for the last seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also ensure that the social priorities mentioned by 
various groups are recognized. It is urgent that sufficient funds 
be awarded to social housing nationally. The government could 
even afford to spend $8 billion on social housing over the next 
five years if it rethinks its priorities properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time, the Minister of Finance and the Bloc 
Quebecois have forecast the same surplus. Eminent economists had 
to speak out last week before the minister finally recognized 
the existence of surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has the means to act. He could also increase old age security 
benefits. 
According to a recent report by the National Council of Welfare 
the rate of poverty for single and older women is 47%. These 
women live below the poverty level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are budgets to increase old age security benefits for 
these women whose poverty rate is incredible. There is more 
money available than what has been spent so far on the 
environment. There is money for shipyards. Instead of having his 
ships built in China, the Minister of Finance could have them 
built in Quebec or elsewhere in Canada and could provide tax 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of workers are waiting for this. He could have come 
with an announcement today, but no, he has his ships built in 
China. He pays taxes in the Caribbean and asks us to tighten our 
belts while he gives handouts to his buddies. This is 
incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could have put a lot more money into international aid. This 
is really shameful. We are now at 0.3% of GDP while the 
established goal is almost 0.7% of GDP. He could have done this. 
He could have stopped squandering public funds to really control 
grants and how they are handed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is management at the Department of Human Resources 
Development doing with our money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member: </B>It is used for friends, it is cronyism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> That is it, cronyism. 
There are five RCMP investigations in the Prime Minister's 
riding. This is no joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could have announced some measures to put public finances on 
a healthier footing, to make fair use of the proceeds of that 
operation of putting policies and fund allocation on a healthier 
footing.  He could have announced that he was giving them to 
those in need.  No, in keeping with his last two budgets, as 
soon as he began to accumulate major surpluses, his priorities 
were to please in this order: number 1, the highest income 
group; number 2, big business; and number 4, 5 or even 6, his 
last priority, to help out ordinary people. Those are this 
government's priorities.  It has shown us that again today.  The 
next election campaign will be one based on truth.  People will 
have to choose between the Liberal right and the Alliance right. 
I believe that the Bloc Quebecois has demonstrated that it is 
the true defender of the interests of Quebecers and even of 
Canadians, when possible.  The real interests of real people who 
must be served by democracy, not the millionaire buddies of the 
minister or the Prime Minister, but real people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today that is not the priority of the Minister of Finance.  His 
priority has gone directly to the people with the highest 
incomes.  The minister may have forgotten that Halloween falls 
on October 31.  He has already put out his pumpkin and started 
distributing his goodies.  The goodies are for the rich; the 
poor will get the crumbs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the conclusion that can be drawn from this mini-budget. 
We are going to fight with all our might to send the minister 
back to the drawing board and to have the truth come out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are going to see that real income tax cuts are not for 
those who are watching us, the nine out of ten taxpayers who 
earn $80,000 or less and who are not going to benefit from it, 
but they are the ones who are going to pay, through their 
contributions to the UI fund for tax relief for those who make 
upwards of $250,000. I think people are going to find out about 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move the following amendment to the amendment: 
<A NAME="LINK158">&nbsp;</A>

</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment be amended by adding after the word 
“restored” the following:

</I></B></P><P align=left>“, for not having given enough tax relief to lower- and 
middle-income families and too much relief to high-income 
earners, for having done nothing to resolve the Employment 
Insurance problem, for not having solved the social housing 
problem and for not having indexed the Canadian Social 
Transfer, for having provided those who are most in need 
with completely inadequate compensation for the rise in oil 
prices, and for having done nothing to help the trucking, 
taxi and agricultural industries facing this crisis;”. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, there is nothing there about Mosel Vitelic either. 
We would have expected to be pleasantly surprised by the finance 
minister telling us that Mosel Vitelic was a done deal, that the 
government was going to participate and it would happen in 
Quebec. Unfortunately not. When it comes to job creation and 
economic growth in Quebec, we are the poor relations. This is 
not a priority for the finance minister and the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I would say we are going to fight the government 
every inch of the way and the truth will come out even more than 
it has in the past.

Unfortunately what we usually get from the Bloc is a diatribe. 
The member talked about defending the interests of Quebecers and 
almost as an add on said and of course Canadians as well. 
Unfortunately what we get from the Bloc is a diatribe about more 
taxes, more of this, more of everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance's speech this afternoon was about two 
visions of Canada.  Sure he has introduced some tax reductions. 
He was following behind the Canadian Alliance.  He was playing 
catch up to the Canadian Alliance policy of tax reduction.  The 
problem is he cannot make it because of the auditor general's 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report contained a whole litany of waste and mismanagement 
about the HRDC billion dollar boondoggle which is now perhaps a 
$3 billion boondoggle.  Grants were given to the Prime Minister's 
friends in his own riding.  A $6.3 million CIDA contract was 
given to somebody who did not qualify, apart from the fact that 
he happened to be the Prime Minister's friend.  Another one of 
the Prime Minister's friends is under investigation. I am talking 
about a $5 million grant by Industry Canada that was given to 
someone who is under police investigation by HRDC.  The litany 
goes on and on.  That is why the Liberals cannot offer the tax 
relief that we would offer. We want to clean up all of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance talked about more grants and money going 
to the poor.  Through the income tax returns we would take them 
right out of the Income Tax Act so they would not have to pay 
money to the Government of Canada in the first place and then get 
the money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we are looking at an election.  It sounded like an 
election style statement by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of the Bloc see that tax reduction is feasible by the 
Liberal government and that tax reduction is feasible by the 
Canadian Alliance, why are they still ranting on about their 
agenda of separation when they recognize that if we all work 
together, we can build a great country? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, I find the latter part of the 
member's question irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the Canadian Alliance's tax reduction 
proposals.  Last week I had the opportunity, along with other 
economists, to speak with the Leader of the Canadian Alliance in 
Montreal.  I can tell the House that as far as progressivity 
goes, the tax system proposed by the Canadian Alliance is a bust. 
It does not make the grade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one found the Canadian Alliance proposal credible.  It 
increased disparity among the various income levels and did 
little to solve the real problems of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the other hand, have been working hard since 1993 to 
observe and analyse this taxation system and have reached the 
conclusion that the important thing is not the rates of taxation 
but deductions, tax credits.  We analysed all that, as well as 
the taxation structure.  I would remind the Canadian Alliance 
member that the discrepancy in tax cuts is worse with the 
Canadian Alliance proposal than with any other proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, we looked at a family with one dependant earning 
$250,000.  The tax cut would be 14 times greater than that for a 
middle income family.  It would be 11 times greater for the 
Liberals.  They are still leaning to the right, but the Canadian 
Alliance proposal is far from being a solution to the problem and 
being fiscally fair.  On the contrary.  Relatively speaking, tax 
cuts for top income earners are far higher than for middle income 
earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, Quebecers are paying $35 million in taxes to the 
federal government.  This is a huge amount of money.  They are 
therefore entitled to have a say in how this money is spent, 
particularly in light of the government's patronage, cronyism, 
and squandering which the member mentioned.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP): </B>Madam Speaker, I have 
a question for the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he 
must know that when it was announced recently that there was a 
$12.3 billion surplus in the general revenue fund, 75% of that 
money came from the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was young we used to say that Robin Hood stole from the 
rich to give to the poor. Today Robin Hood steals from the poor 
to give to the rich. What is happening in the House today is 
another example of stealing from the poor to give to the rich; a 
3% tax cut for the rich and a 1% tax cut for the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot to comment 
on the fact that 75% of the federal government's surplus comes 
from the employment insurance fund. Today, more than 800,000 
people are no longer eligible for EI benefits. Children are going 
hungry because of the cuts made by the Liberals to the employment 
insurance program in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, they are singing their own praises to win votes. I want 
to hear the member on this. Does the Minister of Finance and the 
government think they still can buy votes as they did in the 
past? I can assure the members today, as I did last week, that 
we, in Atlantic Canada, are not for sale at such a laughable 
price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Acadie—Bathurst for his particularly relevant question and 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has grown wealthy on the backs of the most 
disadvantaged.  It has always been so.  We are talking about the 
employment insurance fund.  For six years the fund has had 
significant surpluses contributed by workers and employers. The 
federal government does not contribute a cent to it any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet it has the gall, on page 101 of its budget document, through 
its Minister of Finance, to liken cuts to employment insurance 
contributions to tax cuts.  It does not contribute one red cent 
to the employment insurance fund and it considers cuts to 
employer and employee contributions to be the equivalent of cuts 
in income tax.  How twisted can one get? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is right. By creaming off $38 billion in surpluses 
since 1994 the Minister of Finance has funded most of his 
surpluses from the surplus in the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, savage cuts were made in funding for health care, 
education and social assistance to the provinces.  It took a 
first ministers meeting and the realization that the government 
could no longer reasonably say that it had no surplus when 
surpluses were arriving by the shovel full to get the government 
to react and repair the damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From one end of the country to the other, Canada's health care 
system was cracking while the Minister of Finance was cracking 
under the weight of the surpluses.  Is it not shameful to wait 
until a few weeks before an election may be called to announce he 
was putting money back into health?  People have been waiting for 
that for years.  The system was cracking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expected an employment insurance reform because, as my 
colleague accurately pointed out, only 43% of unemployed workers 
qualify for EI benefits. Some people are on the street because of 
the Minister of Finance. Since a surplus of between five and 
seven billion dollars was generated each year for the past five 
years, we expected the Minister of Finance to allocate more to 
improving the program than the $250 million announced a few days 
ago by the Minister of Human Resources Development. We expected 
that the unemployed, the poor and the families on the street 
would benefit from the minister's generosity, not the 
millionaires. But we were wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the Liberals are electoral opportunists when they 
make people believe that there are tax reductions and so on, they 
cannot even manage to do so in a way that will benefit them. This 
budget is clearly a budget for the wealthy. It is not a budget 
for the middle class, the poor, the unemployed, or for young 
people striving to get an education. There is not any additional 
money for education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a budget for the poor, who are faced with the oil 
crisis. It is not a budget for the elderly or for the women who 
marched in the streets to call for special measures for them. 
This is unbelievable. The hon. member is right and his comments 
are to the point.

<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to respond with very mixed feelings to the government's 
economic statement.  In one sense I have a heavy heart about the 
choices the government has made as expressed in today's 
mini-budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say in another sense I have a real feeling of optimism 
about what Canadians are going to say about the priorities 
expressed in this budget.  I have a feeling of optimism about 
what Canadians are going to do to seize the opportunity the 
upcoming election will give them to take corrective action and 
corrective measures to try to put the federal government back on 
a more progressive course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budgets and economic statements are an expression of a 
government's values.  They are an expression of its priorities 
and its choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again what we have seen today is that the government has 
chosen to leave a great many Canadians out in the cold. Once 
again the government has chosen to give a major nod and a major 
boost to the tax cut lobby in the country.  It has chosen to 
continue the Liberal obsession of catering to the interests and 
dictates of large corporations and the wealthy elite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For seven years the Liberal government has had the opportunity 
to make different choices.  Yet at every turn it has chosen to 
cut services for people who need them and now to cut taxes for 
the wealthy and the powerful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have chosen to cut taxes over cutting waiting lists 
for hospital beds and for cancer treatment.  They have chosen to 
cut taxes over cutting rates of child poverty, over cutting down 
on the numbers of homeless, over cutting pollution of our air and 
our water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's economic statement sounds more like a page from the 
reform alliance platform than a progressive vision for Canada's 
future. They actually seem proud of that.  The member for St. 
Albert actually stood and said that this budget is playing catch 
up with the reform alliance vision for Canada.  I say that this 
is a government that has swallowed whole the reform alliance 
vision for Canada.  We could hear the loud burp of the 
indigestion of members opposite on that revolting decision to 
swallow whole the reform alliance platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Some contest of values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Some contest of values my colleague 
says.  He would want to say that again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals together with the other party are boasting about the 
size of their tax cuts.  It is as if they are caught up in a game 
of one-upmanship; my tax cuts are bigger than your tax cuts. 
Meanwhile the federal Liberal government turns its back on 
Canadian families who are struggling to make ends meet, who are 
struggling to pay for their own home care and who are struggling 
to pay for the prescription drugs they need. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have paid dearly so that Liberals could flaunt around 
and boast about their big surplus and the big tax cuts they are 
making. But for the vast majority of Canadians, the government 
has tragically replaced the fiscal deficit with a social 
deficit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that social deficit around us every day.  We see it in 
the unacceptable waiting lists for vital health services, like 
radiation therapy for women with breast cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the social deficit among our students.  Tuition has risen 
by 126% over the past decade.  Graduating students from last year 
faced average debt loads of $25,000 and we know it continues to 
rise.  The debt load continues to rise in every province except 
the NDP provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the social deficit on the streets of our largest cities. 
For example in the city of Toronto 5,000 children are homeless 
every night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the social deficit on farms.  Families are trying for the 
third straight year to make ends meet in the face of falling 
commodity prices, high input costs and reluctant and inadequate 
federal support.

government.  It is too busy figuring out its tax cuts for its 
elite friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the real record of the Liberal government.  It has a 
great deal of answering to do to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past five years the government has taken $50 billion 
out of social spending, $30 billion out of unemployment 
insurance, and another $25 billion from health care, education 
and basic social welfare services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has chosen to give the banks a $500 
million annual tax cut instead of reducing child poverty.  The 
Liberal government has chosen to eliminate regulations instead of 
standing up to polluters with new tougher national standards. The 
Liberal government has worked harder to stall the loophole case, 
which my colleague raised again this afternoon in the House, than 
it has at ensuring Canada's tax system is fair for everyone, not 
just the country's wealthiest families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has slashed funding and retreated to the 
sidelines while some provinces welcome in private hospitals 
instead of working with the provinces to build up our health care 
system so that it is there when people need it; there when people 
need it regardless of their financial circumstances and 
regardless of where they happen to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent deal with the provinces fails to restore the level of 
federal funding for medicare even to its pre-Liberal cutback 
level of 1994-95.  It fails to restore the level of funding for 
medicare to what it was under the Mulroney government when the 
Liberals took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another vision of what Canada can be.  Canadians know 
that Canada could be so much better. There is another vision to 
which the vast majority of Canadians aspire.  It is a vision 
where governments are on the side of working families, where 
government is committed to the services that ordinary Canadians 
need, where the hopes and dreams of ordinary Canadians can be put 
first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need a federal government that shows the kind of 
leadership that truly restores funding to our health care system, 
the kind of leadership that halts the growth of for profit 
medicine, the kind of leadership that extends medicare so that it 
includes the home care that people need and includes the basic 
prescription drug that people in many cases need to stay alive or 
maintain some kind of quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need leadership that sets tough national standards to 
stop pollution and to protect people's health.  They need 
leadership that attacks the shame, the national disgrace of child 
poverty and attacks it head on by reinvesting in our children and 
in our young people through increased child tax benefits and a 
national child care program, a national child care program 
promised by the Liberal government from the day it came to 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need leadership that makes sure our young people have the 
skills that they need to succeed in today's knowledge based 
economy.  We need to roll back tuition fees because if not, we

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do better in Canada. The federal government can afford to 
invest in the future, in our children, our families and our 
communities. It can do it without adding to the debt. It is a 
matter of choice and priorities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of political will, the political will to invest 
in the priorities that we share in common as Canadians: medicare, 
education and training, housing, community development and 
environmental protections.  We need the political will to say no 
to the dictates of the banks and the wealthiest Canadians, to 
re-establish the role of the federal government as the true 
guardian of medicare and national standards for other social 
programs as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has shown us today that the government and 
the Prime Minister simply do not have the political will to do 
any of those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have clearly indicated what their priorities are. 
Today the Liberals have clearly shown that so-called Liberal 
values mean very little to most Canadians because the fact is 
that capital gains cuts will not pay for nurses.  Corporate tax 
cuts will not shorten waiting lists for hospital beds or cancer 
treatment.  Despite our aging population and rising health care 
costs, the Liberal government still has not restored health 
funding to the 1993 Mulroney level.  Let us remember Liberal 
commitments on pharmacare and home care.  They have been shoved 
right off the Liberal agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great budget for a homeless person who has a big, fat 
stock portfolio.  The Liberal's notion of what the reality is for 
most Canadians is that they all have big, fat stock portfolios. 
This budget will be great for them because they will enjoy tax 
benefits of $25,000, $30,000, $35,000 from the government's tax 
measures.  There are $100 billion in tax cuts while over one 
million children grow up in poverty in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say shame and the vast majority of Canadians say shame as well 
to a government that puts tax cuts for the wealthy ahead of 
dealing with the reality that we have one million children in the 
country growing up in poverty.  By medical assessment, 57,000 
children go to bed hungry and are considered to be suffering the 
effects of malnutrition because of hunger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals just do not seem to understand what it does to our 
young people to tell them that they absolutely have to have 
higher education in order to participate in the knowledge based 
economy and then turn around and saddle them with debt loads of 
$25,000 and $30,000 on average, and that is just for students 
getting an undergraduate education.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members should think about that.  The average student debt 
that our students have had heaped on their 
shoulders is larger than the per capita share of the national 
debt.  Yet what we see in this mini-budget today is $10 billion a 
year for the national debt and not one single red cent for 
student debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not believe my ears when the Prime Minister said 
yesterday that the biggest problem the government faces is that 
it has too much money.  Then I thought about it. I thought 
maybe that was a promising sign of what we would see in the 
mini-budget.  When we look at the size of the social deficit, the 
health deficit, the education deficit, the environmental deficit 
and the infrastructure deficit that have been run up by the 
Liberal government over the last seven years, heaven knows there 
are some real priorities for which that bundle of too much money 
the Prime Minister talked about yesterday is desperately needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy is that today we saw a mini-budget that completely 
fails to address the hardship and the heartache that have been 
suffered by a great many Canadians as a result of the priority 
choices the government has been making over the last seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that not only are there individuals and families 
in many corners of the country suffering from these misplaced 
Liberal priorities, but whole communities are paying the price. 
Whole regions of the country are paying the price.  In the 
process a lot of division and tension has been created in this 
country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sense of pride that we have in ourselves in the kind of 
country we are has been eroded.  The only thing I can say is what 
I said at the beginning, that I receive this mini-budget with a 
heavy heart but also with a sense of optimism. The fact that the 
federal Liberals will have to start accounting for themselves in 
an upcoming election is a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government thinks the most important thing to do is 
to brag and to congratulate itself for the big bucks that are 
available because of the surplus that has been created by the 
social deficits the Liberals have heaped on people.  But 
Canadians have a very different set of values.  I am absolutely 
optimistic that Canadians will understand the cynicism, the 
crassness, the self-serving nature of the choices the government 
has made in the budget it has introduced today. It is a reminder 
of why we should be grateful for the fact that we do live in a 
democratic country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government does not care about the 
hungry and the homeless and the people who suffer from the lack 
of health care and education because they do not have the private 
bucks the government is pumping up with its tax cuts for the 
wealthy.  However, Canadians do care about those things. On 
election day Canadians will have their say. They understand how 
important it is that the values, the social democratic values of 
the New Democratic Party be well represented in the House.  A lot 
more New Democrats are needed in the House to push back against 
this meanspirited, cynical, crass approach to governing.

It is a new paint job but no one will buy its philosophy or

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  It was simply a post-dated cheque. The

no plan for the future and no guarantee that moneys will be there

</I></B></P><P align=left>My leader would want to see established the sixth principle of 
health care: dependable, stable funding so that provinces would 
have a road map or plan for the future.  The government is devoid 
of all planning in the health care field.  Its record speaks to 
that.  There is no plan and no ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The headline in the next election should simply be no ideas, no 
votes.  The Liberals have demonstrated that for seven years, 
seven years without leadership.  What did they do when they 
balanced their books?  They did it on the backs of the poor, the 
sick, the elderly and the unemployed. They took the most 
vulnerable in society and decided to balance the book on their

going to be able to get away from me that easily in the next 20 
days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak in relation to questions I put with regard to 
the HRDC file.  Yesterday, as hon. members know, the auditor 
general pulled the mask off the government's attempts to convince 
Canadians that it has the means and the ability to properly 
manage their money.  He uncovered a litany of errors and 
mismanagement and he confirmed the House's worst fears about the 
problems in the human resources development department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general said “It was more than just sloppy 
paperwork.  We found that controls had broken down, putting 
public funds at unacceptable risk”. He went on to say “This is 
serious, because taxpayers have a right to expect that the 
government will follow due process when it spends public money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general studied the same four programs as the now 
infamous internal audit of the department.  These included the 
transitional jobs fund and Canada jobs fund, the youth internship 
Canada program, the sectoral partnership initiatives program and 
the social development partnerships program.  He concluded that 
there were widespread deficiencies in the management control of 
all four programs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“We found breaches of authority, payments made improperly, very 
limited monitoring of finances and activities, and approvals not 
based on established processes.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He concluded that many practices were not acceptable. I quote: 
“Proceeding without required approvals, relying on oral 
contracts and paying for ineligible expenses.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, he adds: “Inappropriate practices had become the 
routine, accepted by management.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While almost all attention revolved around job grants last year, 
this year we learned that while $25 million was poured into the 
Youth Internship program over three years only 5% of the files 
were properly assessed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast to the findings of the auditor general, the minister 
repeatedly defended the success of her programs.  She stood in 
the House and said that everything was fine within HRDC. 
Yesterday she admitted in the House “we did not document 
appropriately the data that would support the numbers employed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general stated “We could not support the 
department's findings on the effectiveness of the transitional 
jobs fund”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These problems did not happen overnight.  They were warning 
signs that a vigilant minister should have acted upon.  In 1998 
an internal audit of the Atlantic groundfish strategy found 
serious weaknesses in all aspects of the project's life cycle. 
Why was corrective action not taken then?  Why was a major 
overhaul of all grants and programs not initiated at that point? 
Why did the department under two different ministers wait until a 
crisis erupted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC has put forward a six point action plan which it claims 
will deal with the issues.  That is not the judgment of the 
Auditor General of Canada.  That is not the judgment of the 
House.  The administration of this program has been a scandal and 
it is a scandal that continues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on May 12 I asked the Minister of Transport whether he realized 
that his decision to purchase a used ferry for an additional 
ferry service between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia instead of 
buying a new one was wrong and totally unacceptable, and all the 
more so because it was not in line with the so-called 
preferential procurement policy of the Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what the minister answered: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—perhaps the hon. member knows something more about shipbuilding 
than most other people in Canada but to say that we could have 
had a ship designed and constructed within the last 18 months to 
put in service in the next couple of weeks on the gulf between 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland just defies any logic. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundlanders have been demanding this ferry for 
years. The minister cannot say he was taken by surprise. The 
minister has been aware for a long time of the need for this 
ferry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It bears repeating that the federal government did the same 
thing in the case of the ferry between Newfoundland and the 
Madgalen Islands. The minister hinted that he could implement 
the procurement policy in the future. He had two opportunities 
to do so and one more this year but he did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans agrees to 
have coast guard patrol vessels built from American plans. Quite 
a recognition for Canadian engineers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time the Liberal government ignores its 
own policies. 
It was reminded of that last week by the official languages 
commissioner. The government does not even comply with the 
Official Languages Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, the information commissioner said that the government 
does not even honour the spirit of the Access to Information 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried many times to have my bill passed by the House this 
week, but in vain. On Monday a Liberal member objected to the idea 
of adding one hour to our sitting even though, in the end, our 
sitting was 20 minutes shorter than usual that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again today a member could not be here for private members' 
business. I asked the unanimous consent of the House to replace 
him, not to extend our sitting, but just to replace him I had 
his permission. 
That request was denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to conclude that even though the Liberals voted 
in favour of the principle of the bill on March 29 of this year 
and even though in committee all the members including 
Liberal members, voted unanimously in favour of the bill in the 
clause by clause study, this is a terribly hypocritical 
approach. While we had the opportunity to pass this bill before 
an election is called, it will simply be left to die on the 
order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very frustrated with this situation. Tomorrow I will go to 
Newfoundland where I was invited by the former premier of that 
province, who is now our Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will be called upon to give advice to the government with 
regard to shipbuilding. 
I hope that in his new role he will be consistent with the 
position he supported as a premier. On two occasions at 
federal-provincial conferences he and the other premiers asked 
the federal government to implement a national shipbuilding 
policy. I hope he will be consistent and tell us before the 
election what he intends to do to help workers in the 
shipbuilding industry.

floor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>   Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière for giving me the opportunity to 
speak to the subject of consultations on the shipbuilding issue. 
I am pleased to be able to respond to the hon. member this 
evening because in fact a great deal has been accomplished over 
past months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to note that the former Minister of Industry and 
his officials conducted extensive consultations with a broad 
representation of shipbuilding and repair industry stakeholders 
over the past several months.  The consultations revealed both 
convergent and divergent views.  Most stakeholders felt the need 
for action to capture emerging opportunities in the offshore oil 
and gas market, the Great Lakes fleet replacement market and 
other niche markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shipbuilding and repair industry is very diverse.  The 
interests of those businesses and workers sometimes are at 
variance with other stakeholders such as shippers, shipowners and 
shipping companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stakeholders generally agreed on the current state of the 
industry and on the main issues.  The key issues clearly are 
foreign subsidies, which distort the markets, trade barriers, 
global and domestic overcapacity, and the need to refocus 
traditional approaches to capture and exploit best market 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite these challenges there are many examples of innovative 
approaches and success stories in Canadian shipbuilding and 
repair.  In general, smaller yards are co-operating at a higher 
capacity by pursuing new niche markets, while the larger yards 
are having a more difficult time, especially with the new 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shipbuilding forum is being held in Newfoundland this 
Friday.  Therefore the federal government is still listening and 
learning— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must interrupt at 
this point.  There is no more time.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on September 18 in a question I put to the 
minister I talked about her insensitivity to the terrible 
consequences our seasonal workers and their families are faced 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in the budget update that was brought down today would 
correct the inequities of the current Employment Insurance Act. 
Let me give the House the most dramatic example I can think of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between July 9 and September 17, 2000, workers in the lower St. 
Lawrence and the North Shore regions had to work 525 hours to be 
entitled to 21 weeks of EI benefits. Following pressures exerted 
by various stakeholders, it was decided that on September 21 we 
were going back to 420 hours of work for 32 weeks of benefits. 
But that left a huge void. During a month and a half a second 
class of citizens, of workers, was created and this winter 
these people will be entitled to only 21 weeks of benefits 
instead of 32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I asked this question the minister introduced Bill C-44 
amending the Employment Insurance Act. Why did she not correct 
this inequity? Why does she not take the opportunity to add a 
clause eliminating this infamous provision that is totally 
unacceptable in a society like ours? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the government talked about distributing billions of 
dollars and it is not even able to give back to seasonal workers 
the ten weeks of benefits that are rightfully theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's budget speech there is a lot of money for people who 
earn $150,000 and more. They will get an $8,000 tax cut. Do hon. 
members know that someone who is currently on employment 
insurance and earned $400 a week when he was working receives 
$220 in benefits? If he had been given 60% instead of 55%, he 
would receive $240. When one lives on $240 a week an extra $20 
is a lot of money because it can put bread and butter on the 
family table. These are people who make $20,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government not be more sensitive and show greater 
respect for what seasonal workers are going through?

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message in today's budget is that if you are in the new 
economy, if you have technical, professional or university 
training in a specialized field, the government will help you. 
Fine. But the others who do not fall into that group are left to 
fend for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the parliamentary secretary to the minister tell us today 
that, yes, the government will amend Bill C-44, yes, it will 
treat with justice and fairness those who were penalized in 
July, and yes, it will give the same status to seasonal workers 
across the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal work has nothing to do with economic activity as such. 
In the forestry, agriculture and tourism industries, it is often 
possible to work for 18 or 20 weeks. But even if the economy is 
running at full speed, even if we enjoy strong economic growth, 
there are not necessarily more jobs for these workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the government not pay more attention so that these 
citizens can feel they are getting some respect from it? These 
people helped eliminate the deficit and they funded the $32 
billion surplus in the employment insurance fund. Could these 
people not get part of that surplus? Could the government 
not stop making a mockery of their plight, as it just did with 
Bill C-44, which provides only $500 million, when the employment 
insurance surplus is $32 billion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the government is telling us that these billions will be 
used to help people earning $150,000 or more. 
This is revolting. But I expect that in the end the 
government will budge. There is still time to do so before the 
next election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
remind the member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques that the Liberal government has in fact done many things 
and intends to do many more as the Minister of Finance has 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance announced a few minutes ago in the 
House, at a cost of $1.3 billion, a one time relief of $125 per 
individual or $250 per family to assist low and modest income 
Canadians in dealing with their home heating expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a one time item, a clear and specific item the Minister 
of Finance has just provided.  There are others.  This is one I 
could find very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the member opposite that we are continuing to take 
our inspiration from the principles which guided the 1996 reform 
and which were responsible for the creation of employment 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These principles are to make the program fairer, to encourage 
greater participation in the labour market, and to help people 
find jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are well aware that seasonal industries underpin the 
economies of a great many communities throughout the country. 
We feel, however, that EI is only a partial solution and that 
local economies must be stimulated to provide alternatives to 
seasonal work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is required to improve the lot of these seasonal workers is 
a concerted effort by governments and we are there to make that 
effort, with our partners, businesses, local leaders and 
individuals, in order to increase the number of jobs available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working locally, provincially and territorially in order 
to come up with long term solutions that will improve the 
situation.  How?  By ensuring, for instance, that seasonal 
workers have access to education and training opportunities and— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Unfortunately, I must 
interrupt the parliamentary secretary.  Her time is up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 9 a.m., pursuant to order made on Tuesday, October 17, 2000.
