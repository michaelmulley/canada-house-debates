	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity today to offer my sincere 
congratulations to young David Belhumeur, a resident of 
Pierrefonds in my riding, who just won the World Cup freestyle 
skiing in the combined.
<P>
	Quebec is well represented in this category, when we consider 
the achievements and reputation of Brassard, Langlois and 
Laroche.
<P>
	After winning this important event, David now belongs to the 
new generation of Olympic champions.
<P>
	I urge this young athlete to keep up the good work. He has a 
very promising future ahead of him.
<P>
	On behalf of all residents of Pierrefonds-Dollard, I wish him 
good luck and every success in his next events.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday in an important statement in the Quebec 
National Assembly, Gérald Tremblay, Minister of Industry and 
Trade, asked the federal government to meet its commitment to 
support conversion of defence industries.
<P>
	The federal Minister of Industry was reassuring about the 
future of Oerlikon in Saint-Jean and referred to an apparently 
well-filled order book.
<P>
	However, it is not clear whether the company will be able to 
maintain its operations in Quebec. If the Minister of Industry 
were to act in a manner consistent with the commitments of his 
own party to defence conversion, he would examine the 
company's plan for diversifying toward environmental 
technologies, which would guarantee its long-term survival.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Quebec Minister of Industry and Trade said he 
was prepared to consider such a proposal, provided the federal 
government agreed to participate. What is the minister waiting 
for?

	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in the House to express my concern 
regarding the appointment of the environmental secretariat to 
Montreal. How can a government that claims to be fair, honest 
and open on the one hand turn around and admit openly that a 
major government decision was made through partisan politics 
of the past?
<P>
	I would like to state in this House that the city of Edmonton 
would have been an excellent host for the environmental 
secretariat. The city of Edmonton met the original requirements 
and therefore should have been a front runner, yet it was not.
<P>
	The west wants in. We want the federal government to stop 
pandering to the wants of one region over another and start 
treating all provinces as equals.
<P>
	I call on the government to reconsider the decision to

it is in Quebec that aboriginal peoples have the best chance of

the Quebec Department of Education and the open-mindedness 
of Quebecers. Studies carried out in 1991 show that 47 per cent 
of Quebec's aboriginal people speak a native language,

Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. Yesterday, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs discounted the 
possibility of an agreement with Quebec on the transfer of 
federal responsibility for manpower training prior to any social 
program reform.
<P>
	We now know that Ottawa is considering a simple temporary 
agreement limited to the joint leasing of buildings. This kind of 
intransigence prompted the Premier of Quebec, Mr. Johnson, 
inspired no doubt by healthy fear of the eve of the election, to 
ask the following question: ``Who is in charge in Ottawa? The 
political powers or the bureaucracy?''
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister refuse to conclude the 
agreement that Quebec has been urging its federalist ally to 
sign? And, following Mr. Johnson's lead, I would also like to ask 
him this: Who is in charge in Ottawa? The Prime Minister or his 
bureaucrats?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my government has entered into negotiations on this matter with 
all of the provinces, including Quebec. We are making progress. 
We have undertaken a complete overhaul of federal social 
programs and we are trying to eliminate as much duplication as 
possible. The answer given yesterday by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs was correct. We are trying as best we 
can to work out an agreement. If the hon. member would take a 
moment to think about it, there is no question that the real power 
lies on this side of the House, not on his side.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> That is 
right, Mr. Speaker, the perverse power to say no to Quebec, to 
deny it jurisdiction over pressing matters-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> The Prime Minister is fully aware that the 
unemployed are the ones who are paying the price for the 
arm-wrestling match and endless discussions between Quebec 
and Ottawa.
<P>
	I wonder if he shares the opinion of his federalist ally, the 
Leader of the Quebec government, Mr. Johnson, who says that 
Quebec is in the best position to deal with such matters. If the 
Prime Minister does agree with this statement, why then is he 
putting off transferring to Quebec responsibility for a sensitive 
area such as job creation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
all these programs contains an element of equalization. Under 
the Canadian federal system, money can be transferred from 
those who are employed to those who are not. And 
unfortunately, Quebec has more unemployed people than the 
rest of Canada. The situation is worse still in Atlantic Canada 
where the  unemployment rate tops that in Quebec. These 
programs were introduced to allow us to take money from the 
more prosperous regions in Canada and redirect it to areas which 
are not as well off. And it is in this spirit that we want to resolve 
the problem. We believe that all of Canada can work together. 
There is nothing twisted about wanting to ensure that the least 
fortunate in Canada receive money from the rest of the country. 
Our system is based on generosity and we are not about to 
dismantle it on a whim.

<P>
	We are currently undertaking an in-depth review of the 
system and we will listen to the views of all parties in this House 
in order to devise a system that will satisfy all Canadians. To 
resolve only part of the problem would be like taking a step 
backward, rather than forward. We have at heart the interests not 
only of Quebecers, but of the less fortunate provinces as well. 
We want to ensure that social justice prevails throughout 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has just described Quebec's deepest 
aspirations as a whim. This is one issue on which all players in 
Quebec, be they economists, politicians, employers, employees 
or trade unionists, firmly agree. It is shameful to dismiss in this 
manner an issue which has brought together all players in 
Quebec, both in the public and private sectors.
<P>
	My question for the Prime Minister, since his proposal-one 
which has not yet been formally made but which has been 
announced by his minister-has already been rejected by the 
head of the Quebec government and since it would maintain the 
current mess and the single window system for all federal and 
provincial programs, a system which confounds everyone, is 
this: Will he now admit that he must review this stillborn 
proposal to bring it in line with Quebec's aspirations?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Leader of the Opposition, his voice breaking with emotion, 
is trying to be convincing, when he knows very well that even if 
we did have an agreement in this area, tomorrow morning he 
would still want to take Quebec out of Canada. This from the 
same member who, only a few years ago, defended 
francophones outside Quebec and who today, does not have the 
courage to rise in this House to defend bilingualism in this

<P>
	However let me say as well that the budget we are directing in 
Industry Canada is very much targeted at those sectors of the

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is a waste of time of the House of Commons and a lack of 
imagination of the leader of that party. I know he has a problem 
with his neighbour next door. He should work with him in order

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	This morning's <I>Toronto Star</I> confirms that the government is 
about to launch its jobs plan for youth. This strategy will include 
an apprenticeship program for young people. But in Quebec, 
where the procedures are different, this program does not work 
and, according to the daily newspaper <I>Le Devoir</I>, only $2 
million out of a total of $225 million will be spent on young 
Quebecers.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Human Resources Development admit 
that the federal apprenticeship program cannot be adapted to 
Quebec's own needs and realities and will only increase the 
inefficiencies and overlap already hampering job training in 
Quebec?
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I may be allowed one small 
correction, the proposals we have put forward for the 
employment of young people across the country were not 
announced in today's Toronto <I>Star</I>. They were announced in the 
red book campaign platform last October which was endorsed 
by something like eight or nine million Canadians, including a 
large number of people in Quebec. That is the real source of the 
youth employment program.
<P>
	The member will see that the benefits of the program we hope 
to be able to announce very shortly will be broadly shared by all 
Canadians in every province and in every region.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, instead of dodging 
the issue, could the minister promise today to give Quebec its 
share of the apprenticeship program funds so that it can invest 
them itself according to its own needs and priorities?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

strange that the hon. member is building a whole set of questions 
upon an event that has not yet happened.
<P>
	It is about as accurate as the figures used by the Leader of the 
Opposition yesterday when he said that there were 20,000 
people still waiting to receive training in Quebec. In fact the 
number has been reduced to 14,000 in the last five months of this 
government because there has been a change in government and 
a change in attitude.

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

members of cabinet must have talked this matter over. I hope the 
minister of defence is not the only minister who is bearing the 
brunt of these cuts. I know he is pulling his hair out over them.

those significant expenditure reductions so I will direct my

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. During 
his recent visit to Regina, the Prime Minister made an ardent 
plea for bilingualism to support his particular vision of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	The report of the Commissioner of Official Languages once 
again pointed to a major decline in access to federal services in 
French across the country and deplored the fact that 
French-language education was still not available in many 
locations in Canada.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that despite all the rhetoric we 
have heard from the Prime Minister, especially today, the 
implementation of the government's policy on bilingualism has 
been a failure, a fantasy from the Trudeau era, and that it is false 
to claim, as he does, that a person can live, work and receive a 
decent education in French anywhere in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when I see people who want bilingualism everywhere in Canada 
but do not want it in Quebec, I see people who want a double 
standard.
<P>
	I maintain that the French fact has made considerable 
progress in this country. We have 325,000 anglophones in 
French immersion across Canada. My colleague next to me 
learned French in Hamilton, Mr. Speaker. We have come a long 
way.
<P>
	I agree that in some locations service to the public is not 
adequate. A committee of the House of Commons, chaired by a 
French Canadian from outside Quebec, will examine the 
problem and help the government ensure that its policy on 
bilingualism operates as it should. It is not perfect, but we have 
made considerable progress, and we intend to keep up the good 
work, although francophones outside Quebec are complaining 
that Quebec's separatist francophones are undermining their 
efforts to maintain the French fact outside Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with all due respect, I wish the Prime Minister would 
read the commissioner's report, because he would see that all 
this progress is an illusion. We are not getting anywhere.
<P>
	I want to say to the Prime Minister, who hails from Quebec 
and who keeps talking about his French Canadians, that he 
should treat them as well as English-speaking Quebecers are 
treated. We treat them well in Quebec. When will you start 
treating French Canadians as we treat English Canadians in 
Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata): </B>I wonder how 
the Prime Minister can expect to maintain his credibility and can 
sing the praises of bilingualism, when in its latest budget, his 
government cut financial assistance to all francophone 
associations outside Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have a problem here. On one side we have the Reform Party 
that wants us to more or less get rid of bilingualism across 
Canada, and on the other side we have people rising in the House 
today with a lump in their throats, and I really appreciate that, to 
defend the cause of francophones outside Quebec, but as soon as 
they achieve their objective to separate Quebec, one million 
francophones will lose their language because of the 
irresponsible actions of these people. That is why we intend to 
defeat them in their quest to separate Quebec from Canada.

would have a chance to see where he would cut. We have asked

<P>
	Will the Prime Minister please tell Canadians which ministers 
are going to be cutting their budgets to fulfil his commitment of 
yesterday? It is not only us who want to know. Canadians want to 
know. Investors who are buying their bonds want to know. We 
feel we deserve an honest and forthright answer.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have presented a budget to this House of Commons. It was 
voted on and it is the budget of this government.
<P>
	What I said in the House of Commons is it is the task of the 
Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and every other minister 
to make sure that every expenditure in every department is 
looked at very carefully. When they find some opportunities for 
cuts they should come forward right away.
<P>
	I have asked the minister responsible for the renewal of the 
public service to do that task with every department. Already 
ministers are coming forward with suggestions. There will be a 
lot of rationalization.
<P>
	Fundamentally the budget that we presented and which was 
approved by this House of Commons is the base of our economic 
policy. We will achieve our goal. As we mentioned so clearly in 
the budget, in our program in the period of three years the deficit 
in relation to GDP will be 3 per cent. We are determined to 
achieve that goal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister committed himself and his government to additional 
cuts beyond what was presented in the budget yesterday. We are 
trying to find out how much these cuts are, who is going to be 
cutting and where they are actually coming from.
<P>
	Since he will not answer that question, will the Prime 
Minister please tell us how much we can expect in additional 
cuts beyond what was presented in the budget? His figures 
regarding the deficit and the cost of the debt are out to lunch 
because of rising interest rates through their mismanagement of 
government.

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> I will repeat 
the statement I made a minute ago that every minister is working 
to have more reductions. More reductions will be announced

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Prime Minister. Since the Official Languages Act was 
passed 25 years ago, we have witnessed an accelerated erosion 
of the number of francophones living outside Quebec. Statistics 
Canada tells us that the proportion of francophones outside 
Quebec has dropped by 40 per cent over a period of 20 years.
<P>
	My question is this: Does the Prime Minister realize that the 
alarming assimilation rate of francophones outside Quebec is 
proof that Canada's bilingualism policy is a total flop?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the actual number of francophones outside Quebec has 
increased, and the francophone community outside that 
province is more dynamic than ever. That community now has 
universities. It seeks to protect its rights. However, it also 
deplores the fact that some francophones like the Parti 
Quebecois and Bloc Quebecois members are the ones who create 
the most serious problems for it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, beyond the 
issue of costs, will the Prime Minister recognize that the mere 
fact that the Commissioner of Official Languages recommends 
eliminating bilingualism bonuses is, in itself, another proof of 
the failure of the bilingualism policy coast to coast?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe the Commissioner said that we have to look and see if 
these bonuses are still useful and necessary. The Leader of the 
Opposition said that such an exercise was necessary. I think so 
too, and we are going to review the situation. The fact remains, 
however, that considerable progress has been achieved.

	For example, last month I had the pleasure of visiting the

university and some of its students are anglophones from all

institution which was set up after official bilingualism became a 
fact of life in Canada. The same situation exists elsewhere in the 
country. Progress was made but nothing is perfect. If the hon.

Canadians to live in French outside Quebec and to live in

Employees are subject to a refund of Canada pension plan

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice or the

<P>
	The government continues to talk about gun control for 
legitimate gun users.
<P>
	In August 1993 Frederick Stephen Dieno was arrested in a 
shootout with the RCMP in Surrey, B.C., while fleeing after 
robbing a pharmacy with a gun. Mr. Dieno was originally 
charged with 40 offences, including eight armed robberies and 
accompanying use of a firearm during an indictable offence. 
However, in a plea bargain  arraignment last week Mr. Dieno 
pleaded guilty to two charges of robbery. All charges of using a 
firearm were dropped.
<P>
	How can the minister ensure that Canadians can feel safe from 
the improper use of firearms when charges of using a firearm 
during the commission of an offence are routinely plea 
bargained away?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for the next few weeks the Minister of Justice and the 
department will be studying very closely the possibility of 
making changes to the gun control laws. These changes if 
decided upon will be brought forward and dialogued with all 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	I want to say that questions relating to the administration of 
justice and plea bargaining are under provincial jurisdiction. As 
such they are not within the responsibility of the Minister of 
Justice.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see there will be co-operation with 
the government side in making some changes to the gun control 
legislation. Unfortunately, I have every reason to believe it is in 
the wrong direction and it is against legitimate gun users.
<P>
	We are asking for changes in the law. We want to know if the 
government is prepared to make changes in the law to prohibit 
plea bargaining away existing gun control on the illegal use of 
guns.

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the very large cuts that the government made, especially in

criticized by the opposition, when we always said that we would 
make those cuts. That is the basis of our budget. I said in 
Edmonton and here that the ministers could try to reduce 
government spending outside the budget, on a daily and weekly 
basis.
<P>
	The results of this operation will be known every week or in

some ministers will have an opportunity to announce that some 
programs or institutions in their departments can be abolished 
right now. They will make announcements when they are ready.

recommendations. If members of the Bloc Quebecois and the

are there. They sit every week and I am sure that all committee 
chairs will be very pleased to consider all recommendations for 
spending cuts and that will make the hon. members very happy. I

immigrants from Europe. I ask the minister to assure this House 
he has no intention of introducing ethnic or racial criteria into 
the government's immigration policy.
<P>

However on a more general type of question perhaps the 
minister would like to respond to that.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, this side of the House is having 
some degree of difficulty in trying to understand the nature of 
the question.
<P>
	On the one hand the hon. member is talking about the 
legitimate promotion of our immigration program through 
Europe. On the other hand he talks about a program in terms of 
ethnic or cultural lines.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is we have a balanced program. We have 
a number of doors through which individuals can apply to enter, 
whether it be the refugee stream, humanitarian, family class, 
independent skilled, or business.
<P>
	When I was in the London, England office which is our 
biggest office in Europe, I on behalf of my government 
suggested that the perception in Europe that our doors are closed 
is wrong. I believe we need to promote immigration from that 
part of the world and also to target it with respect to business 
class and independent skilled. Many trades, such as aerospace, 
are overheating in Great Britain. We could certainly do with 
those skilled tradespeople coming over.
<P>

the minister, in trying to attract more immigrants from Europe, 
is he suggesting that immigration from other parts of the world

numbers be increased? It has to be one way or the other. Which is 
it?

	If the hon. member looks at the immigration plan we 
presented to the House just a few weeks ago, he will note that we 
increased, as per the red book, the number of independent 
skilled people. Canadians, including I am sure members of his 
own party, have wanted to take advantage of skilled individuals 
who can find an economic niche.
<P>
	All I am saying is that the proportion of people with 
independent skills coming from Great Britain and the rest of 
Europe will increase over 40 per cent in keeping with the 
increase in our independent skill levels.

the facts have been before him. The process has been slowed up 
a little bit and interrupted by the launching of a lawsuit by some 
Prince Edward Island growers and the government has no 
alternative but to defend itself, and the government will.
<P>
	In the meantime, the minister will continue to treat this as 
seriously and as thoroughly as he has in the past. It is now in the 
hands of the courts and nothing more can be said at this time.

unaddressed mailing to so advise Canada Post Corporation and 
stop receiving such material.

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honour to present in both official languages the first report in 
this Parliament of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans in relation to the Atlantic fisheries adjustment 
programs.
<P>
	I want to thank all the individuals who have co-operated with 
us, most particularly members of the committee on the Liberal 
side, the official critic and the member from the Bloc Quebecois 
as well as members from the Reform Party.
<P>
	I also want to thank the over 92 witnesses who participated, 
allowing us to come to some consensus on a number of issues 
relating to the tragic situation of the collapse of the Atlantic 
groundfishery.
<P>
	Some of the technology that we used such as 
teleconferencing, which at first perhaps some, including myself, 
were a little leery of, has proven to be very beneficial in 
allowing Canadians access to their parliamentarians and to 
committees.
<P>
	I hope that at least some of the recommendations in this 
committee report find their way into government policy.
<P>
	This was broadcast live from coast to coast. The process we 
went through does show Canadians that Parliament can work 
better and that it can work without animosity and that 
partisanship can be put aside when we do the job. Our job 
obviously as members of this place is to represent to the best of 
our abilities the interests of the citizens of this country, no 
matter where they live and no matter the political stripe of the 
individuals who sit on a committee.
<P>
	I also understand that we have some minority reports which 
will be appended to the document and there may be one of the 
members opposite who may wish to add a few words to the 
record.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, given what the 
chairman just said, I think I have the unanimous consent of the 
House to append our document as mentioned. We had to proceed 
and co-operate with the government to hear the 92 witnesses 
who testified before us. It was not easy and that is why, given the 
need to proceed quickly, the Bloc Quebecois as the Official 
Opposition party wants to point it out. We also want to append to 
the Standing Committee's majority report a minority report 
stating the missing elements that, in our opinion, would enable 
the government to make the right decision.
<P>
	Our report is generally concerned with the lack of industrial 
strategy. There is also the question of job training on which a lot 
of money will be spent. There is a constitutional dispute on the 
Quebec-Canada agreements, and we wanted to point it out in the 
House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will start by asking, as the hon. 
member indicated, for unanimous consent to give him the floor. 
Is there unanimous consent for the hon. member from the

get the reports together.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ELECTORALBOUNDARIESREADJUSTMENTSUSPENSIONACT,1994">ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES READJUSTMENT 
SUSPENSION ACT, 1994</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (for the Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons)</B> moved that Bill C-18, 
an act to suspend the operation of the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Suspension Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have this opportunity to speak at third reading of 
this very important bill which has been introduced in the House 
and which has received considerable support on all sides.
<P>
	I recognize there is some opposition in the Reform Party to 
this bill but I suggest it is misplaced opposition and that in the 
end the Reform Party will really appreciate the fact that this bill 
has been introduced and dealt with in the House because it will 
be so pleased with the final result of the thing when 
redistribution has finally been accomplished.
<P>
	The member for Kindersley-Lloydminster shakes his head 
and looks dubious but that has been his problem all along. He 
has been a doubting Thomas in respect of this bill and I think 
when he sees the outstanding work that the committee of which 
he is a member will do in coming up with a new law he will be 
gratified with the results and say he cannot understand why he 
did not agree with this bill in the very first place.
<P>
	The hon. member knows, and all members know, that in 
dealing with a subject of such importance as redistribution, of 
great importance to the members of this place, a government is 
always loathe to act unilaterally and in a way that is unfair, or 
perceived as unfair, to the other players in the political process.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	In this case I suggest that what the government has done is 
move in a very fair and reasonable way. What has happened as a 
result of this bill? The purpose of the bill is to shelve the current 
redistribution process for a period of 24 months. If at the end of 
that time there is no new mechanism put in place by legislation, 
the redistribution commissions will restart their work, 
presumably using much of the material they now have and come 
up with a new set of maps.
<P>
	There will be public hearings that follow as there are under 
the current regime, and everything falls back in place again. 
This is simply a delay of 24 months. Let us look at the history of 
this. Why is the government operating in this way? Why would 
we argue for a 24-month suspension at this point?
<P>
	Redistribution should have been effected following the 1991 
census at an earlier date than this because the very first figures 
released in 1992 on that census were the ones for redistribution 
of seats in the House of Commons. However, the previous 
government, the Mulroney government, introduced a bill in this 
House to delay the process for 12 months because there was a 
committee doing a study of the report of the Royal Commission 
on Electoral Reform and Party Financing which had been 
presented to the country by the royal commission in early 1992. 
Maybe it was late 1992, I cannot remember the date, I must 
admit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2982"> 2982 </A></B>
<P>
	That report was referred to a special committee of the House 
of Commons. It was to study the report and come up with 
recommendations. It seemed pointless at the time. There were 
one or two in the NDP who disagreed but almost all members 
agreed that the proper course was to defer consideration of 
redistribution until there had been a study of the royal 
commission's report because the royal commission 
recommended changes to the redistribution law of Canada. The 
aim was to have that study by the committee done so that 
legislation could be introduced in Parliament to make changes.
<P>
	The committee ended up with a short timeframe for such an 
extensive study of the act because the referendum intervened in 
the process and disrupted the entire committee work. It took so 
much time to do the referendum bill and then Parliament did not 
sit for months and months because of the referendum.
<P>
	Nothing was done in respect of the redistribution 
recommendations contained in the royal commission report and 
nothing was done to change the redistribution law. The law was 
left in place and began its operations during the summer of 1993, 
just when Parliament had been adjourned for the summer, and at 
the subsequent election because Parliament did not sit again 
until well after the election was called.
<P>
	There we were in a situation in which these commissions were 
beavering away across the country preparing draft maps that 
were subsequently made public and members suddenly 
discovered that redistribution was back on the table, here were 
the maps and the public hearings started in another month. 
These maps were unacceptable to the vast majority of members 
in this House.
<P>
	We heard yesterday at length from members of the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	They made several speeches. It was unbelievable to hear so 
many speeches on that issue yesterday, but each of these hon. 
members had problems with the boundaries in his or her 
constituency.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We responded to this. That is partly why the government acted 
with alacrity to bring in this bill and suspend the process. We 
spoke in advance with members of the other parties to ensure 
that there was some agreement on this. We suggested a motion to 
refer various matters to the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs in order to allow that committee to do a 
detailed study.
<P>
	We invited comments from the opposition and we got some 
very constructive comments from both parties in opposition. We 
included in the motion various items at their specific request to 
make the committee process more palatable to them, to make 
sure we covered the points that were of concern to the 
opposition. I think we have covered them all.
<P>
	The difficulty was that some hon. members on the other side 
have made speeches in the House decrying this. They wanted us 
to write in what the committee was to do; that is, if the 
committee was to bring in a report saying this. We as a 
government said we will let the committee make its own 
decision on how it will report to the House. It will consider all 
these matters but the report is the committee's decision. We 
would not prejudge it. We would not instruct the committee to 
do certain things such as limit the number of members of the 
House of Commons to 295 or reduce the number of members of 
the House of Commons or increase it no more than by <I>x</I> number. 
We said the committee would have to look at all the options and 
come up with a report. That turned some members of the 
opposition in the Reform Party in particular into nervous 
Nellies. They became quite upset at the thought that the 
committee might-
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Wise owls.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster says: ``Wise owls''. I say: ``Nervous 
Nellies''.
<P>
	They were afraid the committee would go out of control and 
come up with something worse than we now have. I suppose that 
is possible, but I think the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster needs to look at the composition of 
the committee. He is a member of it and a very responsible 
member of it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Bellechasse also sits on that committee 
and he is very competent. We have several competent members 
and, as chairman, I can do certain things to assure committee 
members that everything will go just fine. So, I support this bill 
because we now have a motion on the Order Paper to refer all 
these issues to the committee, and that motion is acceptable to 
the vast majority of members in this House. I am convinced that 
once the legislation is passed, the Reform Party will support our 
motion to the effect that the whole issue should be referred to the 
committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I know their doubts will vanish. The committee will be able to 
conduct a study and come up with a new bill.
<P>
	How is the new bill to come into operation? I would hope we 
would have the bill passed so that we would not have the 
24-month delay any more. It will simply get rid of the current 
system and replace it with a new one which would start as soon 
as the new bill has passed Parliament.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2983"> 2983 </A></B>
<P>
	The question is when it will pass. That matter rests very 
substantially in the hands of the committee because we have 
adopted for the motion to be referred the new procedure in 
Parliament of instructing the committee to bring in a bill on the 
issue.
<P>
	The committee would come back with a bill to the House. The 
government could then table the bill. Debate on second reading 
stage would be very short, as hon. members know, assuming the 
bill complied in all respects with what the committee 
recommended. We would have shortened debate and rapid 
passage of the bill based on the new procedure. The committee 
would do the work and would do it in advance.
<P>
	I know hon. members will strive to have the committee 
achieve agreement on all major points before it. We will look at 
the alternatives that are available for dealing with the issue for 
the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
	Some members of the Reform Party have said there is not a 
public outcry on the issue. Of course there is not a public outcry 
on the issue. Members of the public are not particularly involved 
in the redistribution process and have never shown a particular 
interest in the redistribution process. Most members of the 
public do not worry particularly about where they are voting.
<P>
	When the new boundaries are in place there will be outcries 
from people: I do not want to vote with that group; why do I have 
to drive this far to vote; why is my part of the riding cut off from 
all the rest, all my friends and neighbours that I normally voted 
with; why are we suddenly lumped in with so-and-so as our 
member of Parliament?
<P>
	That will not happen until the redistribution is complete, the 
election campaign starts and people find they are in different 
ridings. In spite of all the advertisements of the commissions 
most people do not look to see which riding they are in. I have 
gone around my constituency and have asked, and most of the 
people I would be losing to the neighbouring riding in this 
scheme-and there are not many-are totally unaware of it. 
Members of the public do not know and there is no public outcry.
<P>
	The people who are interested in the legislation for the most 
part are right here in the House. It is members of Parliament who 
have to work with those boundaries during the time they are 
elected to serve the people in their own geographic areas.
<P>
	Imagine, if the redistribution came into effect today or very 
shortly as planned, what members of the House who are losing 
their ridings would do for the next four years. Who are they 
going to be representing? Would it be the people who elected 
them or the people whose ridings they think they are going to be 
running in the next time?
<P>
	From the point of view of the public the bill makes sense 
because it defers the process so that if redistribution is 
completed in time for the next election it will be done shortly 
before but not a long time before the election. Members of the 
public will be fully  represented by their MPs during the time 
they are elected to serve them, without having to cast an eye on 
neighbouring ridings where members might be running the next 
time. That is important. It is a significant advantage for 
members of the public, let alone for MPs. To ignore that reality 
is perilous, and there are many constituencies that are 
disappearing.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I suggest that members of the Reform Party, many of whom 
are suffering substantial shifts in the process and know it, 
particularly those in British Columbia, must be apprehensive 
about it. I know they are. I know many members of that party are 
very concerned about the boundary proposals that have been put 
forward.
<P>
	Here is a chance to come up with a new scheme. I am not 
saying the committee is going to sit there and draw boundaries; 
far from it. We will come up with a new arrangement that will 
allow for a redrawing of boundaries on a more equitable basis. 
We think we can come up with something that is fairer and better 
for Canadians.
<P>
	It may be that there should be a more specific requirement for 
consultation with members of Parliament on the issue, or at least 
with political parties in the existing constituencies. I do not 
know what will be the best solution, but the reference to the 
committee is open-ended and we can look at all possible 
solutions in the committee.
<P>
	I know hon. members on the other side are anxious to get on 
with the work. As chair of the committee I am anxious to 
undertake the work to see what we can discover. There are plenty 
of experts on the issue of redistribution in Canada who are 
familiar with it. Members of these commissions may have views 
they wish to make known to the committee. It is important for 
the committee to get on with the work and hear from those 
people. Passage of the legislation will ensure that will happen.
<P>
	I invite members on all sides to bury the hatchet they have 
been wielding in recent days and support the bill. I know the 
hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster particularly has his 
doubts, but I invite him to cast his doubts aside and walk with 
confidence into the future the redistribution process holds for all 
members and for the benefit of the Canadian public. It is a good 
bill. I know the hon. member in his heart of hearts thinks so and I 
invite him to support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak on third reading of Bill C-18, 
an act to suspend the operation of the electoral boundaries 
readjustment process in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2984"> 2984 </A></B>
<P>
	I listened with interest to the speech made just now by the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands, and I am sure he will want 
to show the same interest in what I have to say about this bill at 
this particular stage.
<P>
	When considering a bill that has long-term implications for 
the future of the Canadian federation, it is always necessary to 
define the role of the sovereigntist member with respect to such 
legislation. I have never made a secret of the fact that I was 
elected by the constituents of Bellechasse to defend and promote 
the interests of Quebec, which includes promoting the 
sovereignty of Quebec.
<P>
	As was pointed out, not by the hon. member from Kingston 
and the Islands but by the hon. member for Calgary West and 
also by the hon. member for Fraser Valley West, the seats in this 
House are ours on a temporary basis. We have them in trust, as it 
were. We do not own them. It is up to our constituents to 
determine who will sit in those seats. Of all the members sitting 
opposite during the 34th Parliament, only one member is left in 
this House, and this happened when constituents across Canada 
freely expressed their will that it should be so. It is always useful 
to recall that this House is not owned by anyone, that these seats 
are not anyone's property and that we occupy them on a 
temporary basis, until we are recalled by our constituents or 
decide otherwise or reach the end of our career.
<P>
	That being said, I may be a sovereigntist, but it would be 
irresponsible of me to deny that a decision on the sovereignty of 
Quebec is still a decision that must be made by Quebec voters in 
a referendum that will be held in a few months, in Quebec. It will 
be held after the Quebec elections which, according to the 
Canadian Constitution, will have to take place in the fall, at the 
latest.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Since we, on this side of the House as on the other side, of 
course, are all in favour of supporting the rule of law, the very 
essence of democracy, we must operate within the confines of 
the present legislation.
<P>
	At the present time, we still belong to the Canadian 
federation, and we must think ahead in case our ultimate 
goal-we can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel, since 
the Quebec referendum is only a few months away-should that 
light fade away for one reason or another, these seats will still be 
Quebec's. That is why we cannot afford to ignore the 
implications of this bill, if there were a change in the 
membership, since the Bloc Quebecois was elected for a specific 
term. That is why I took an active part in the study of Bill C-18 
at every stage.
<P>
	I must point out that once again, the government has acted 
belatedly in presenting this bill. They could have presented it 10 
or 15 days earlier, so that it could have followed the normal 
process. But they chose to wait until the last minute when 
provincial commissions, especially in Quebec, had already 
started to hear witnesses or were  about to hear them. As a matter 
of fact, these commissions are operating at the present time.
<P>
	The way the debate has been going on has forced the 
government to bring a motion for time allocation, commonly 
called closure. My colleagues from Calgary West and 
Kindersley-Lloydminster rose in opposition to that motion. 
They were protesting against closure, and rightly so, I think. We 
did the same, even though we support the bill, because we will 
never accept closure on such a bill. We have been just as vocal as 
our colleagues from the Reform Party in opposing it.
<P>
	The bill was passed at second reading and referred to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs which 
tabled its report in the House. Then my colleague from 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, seconded by the hon. member for 
Calgary West, proposed three amendments at report stage. And 
curiously, the party which complained so bitterly about time 
allocation, because debate was cut short, hardly intervened on 
its own motions. It is the Official Opposition which had to do the 
job of the Reform Party, which is a bit ironic. Why did they 
complain about time allocation, and choose not to speak 
yesterday? There is a logic there that I do not get. Could it be 
that their caucus meeting, Monday night, caused a number of 
them to lose their voices? I do not know.
<P>
	Anyway, we will do our job at third reading. I do believe that 
Bill C-18 is necessary if we want to review the 30-year old rules 
on electoral boundaries readjustment. In my humble opinion, we 
should start this review process, immediately after the bill is 
passed, by studying carefully section 51 of the Constitution Act, 
1867.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	It is the basis for the entire decennial readjustment process 
provided for by our Constitution. It will no doubt be the first 
section we will have to consider in hearing testimony and 
debating various amendments to provisions of section 51 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867. We may also have to review section 
51(<I>a</I>), the so-called senatorial clause, which prevents a 
province from being represented by fewer members in the House 
of Commons than senators in the Senate and which presently 
applies only to Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	Perhaps there should also be a section 51(<I>b</I>) forcing the 
government to take a member from Prince Edward Island from 
within its ranks and make him or her a cabinet member, which is 
presently lacking. Why does a province with such a glorious 
history as Prince Edward Island have no Cabinet members in 
this government?
<P>
	There is another question, but I will not get into it either. We 
can ask ourselves the question anyway. The criteria have not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2985"> 2985 </A></B>
<P>
been reviewed since 1964. I have no intention of going through 
the whole list, but it is high time that they we review them.
<P>
	In 1964, the government of the day, the Pearson government, 
had the brilliant and worthwhile idea of taking the electoral 
boundaries delineation process out of the hands of Parliament 
and members of Parliament and putting it in the hands of 
independent commissions.
<P>
	Grasp all, lose all, the saying goes. Perhaps the right balance 
has not been struck between the role of the legislator and that of 
the commissions. These are also questions we have to ask 
ourselves because a number of members have risen in this House 
to disagree with plans currently before the various provincial 
commissions.
<P>
	We need to act, not hurriedly, but swiftly nonetheless, as we 
are facing some form of danger, a constitutional danger I would 
say. As I see it, the danger results from the fact that, during the 
24 month period when readjustment is to be suspended under 
Bill C-18, during that time, the Procedure and House Affairs 
Committee will have to continue to work. The government will 
make its bed and eventually present a bill or accept the one 
proposed by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs. But we should not face the next federal election with a 
seat distribution based on the 1981 census.
<P>
	One thing is certain, for the legal security of all Canadians. 
With all due respect, I wonder whether it is appropriate for the 
government to submit Bill C-18 with all its consequences, 
namely that we still have a distribution based on the 1981 census 
and that the 2003 election could still be based on 1981 census 
figures. Are we not in violation of section 51 of the Canadian 
Constitution, which provides for a decennial census and a 
readjustment of representation after each decennial census?
<P>
	The Constitution is there for a reason. If it requires us to 
conduct a census, a census will be conducted, and then we will 
say, ``We need a readjustment''. If every time we are about to 
undertake such a readjustment, some bill cancels or postpones 
it, it is as though this provision were no longer enshrined in the 
Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	I urge the Canadian government to use the authority of the 
Governor in Council to refer the constitutional problem to the 
Supreme Court of Canada for advice, so that any challenge is not 
left to ordinary Canadians already overburdened by taxes, and 
so that it can be dealt with as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-18 also provides for the abolition of existing 
provincial commissions, a measure which we fully support since 
we cannot keep on standby-in spite of the comments made by 
the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster, which will 
certainly be corrected later-and pay the members of those 
commissions to do nothing.
<P>
	This provision should also apply. We can start all over again 
later. When I say ``we'' I mean this House, because we do not 
know what the situation will be in 24 months, and what the 
House will look like. Who knows, there may be 75 fewer seats. It 
is pointless to discuss the architecture of this House. After all, if 
the 75 seats from Quebec disappear, there will be enough room 
for larger desks, to accommodate those who have put on some 
weight because they do not have time to exercise in the 
Wellington or Confederation building. This could prove a lot 
cheaper than tearing down walls, as suggested by our friends 
from the Reform Party.
<P>
	We Quebecers will do an immeasurable service to this House 
by freeing a little more than a quarter of the seats here.
<P>
	Of course, I am pleased because I did not hear any terms such 
as break up or collapse. Things went smoothly and I was able to 
discuss the issue. In fact, I wonder why, when I raise the issue of 
sovereignty for Quebec, I hear some hon. members use those 
expressions- but not everyone, far from it. In fact, fewer and 
fewer do so, and it may be because they understand more and 
more that Quebec's sovereignty is not directed against anyone: 
rather, it must be done for our own good. As I mentioned 
yesterday to the hon. member for Stormont-Dundas, Quebec 
will always be as open as it is now with its neighbours, and 
particularly its Ontario friends, who are very close, not only 
from a geographic point of view but also in terms of the 
affinities which we have developed. Quebec is a state which 
tomorrow, just as it was yesterday and is today, will remain open 
and receptive to the world around it.
<P>
	Again, Quebec's sovereignty is not directed against anyone. 
Let me give you an example. If, tomorrow or in the near future, 
the people of British Columbia decided to become sovereign, I 
will not get frantic. I will simply say: very good, this is your 
decision as British Columbians. That is fine, let us try to make 
some agreements, this is an emancipation for you, this is your 
choice and I see no point in criticizing it. I will not say that 
someone is trying to dismantle the country, to tear it apart, to 
blow it up or whatever. I think that we will have to consider very 
calmly the implementation of new structures for this country 
which has already gone through several structual changes. Since 
1763, it has been known as Canada, but during the period when it 
was made up of Upper and Lower Canada, and even before that, 
at the time of the Quebec Act and the Royal Proclamation, it was 
a small country. It grew quietly, over the years.
<P>
	My comments are totally relevant to the debate, Mr. Speaker. 
In 1949, Newfoundland joined the Canadian federation, but 
Newfoundland was not destroyed because it decided to give up 
its status as an independent Dominion. Newfoundlanders were 
never told that they had destroyed their country. They were 
congratulated on choosing to join the Canadian federation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2986"> 2986 </A></B>
<P>
	In the second 1949 referendum, because there were two of 
them, Newfoundlanders voted 52.34 per cent in favour of 
joining Confederation, while 47.66 per cent voted against. 
However, that referendum was somewhat special, and we will 
not have the same kind of referendum in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	For instance, in the riding of Labrador, the number of 
registered voters in the second referendum on July 22, 1948, was 
2,886. The number of votes cast was 3,447, which means a 
participation rate of 119.44 per cent in favour of union with 
Canada. The people in the riding of Labrador were way ahead of 
the riding of Ferryland, where 3,791 voters were registered but 
3,965 cast their votes, which meant a participation rate of 
104.59 per cent in the second referendum, which is not bad!
<P>
	The first referendum was held on June 3, 1948. There again 
the participation rate showed that the people of Newfoundland, 
and probably their ancestors as well, were interested in voting in 
the referendum, because as they say, we have to vote, not just for 
our own sake and our children's, but for the people in the 
cemetery. I think that is what happened there!
<P>
	If we look at the riding of Grand Falls, in the first referendum 
on June 3, 1948, the number of registered voters was 11,458, but 
the number of voters on June 3, 1948 was 12,580, which gives us 
a participation rate of 109.79 per cent, which is quite good! 
Grand Falls had the best rate, closely followed in second place 
by Humber, with 10,745 registered voters and 11,588 people 
who cast their votes, producing a very respectable participation 
rate of 107.84 per cent. St. John's West was a close third with 
19,586 registered voters and 19,880 votes cast, producing a 
participation rate of 101.5 per cent.
<P>
	And last but not least among the ridings with a participation 
rate of more than 100 per cent-something not even members of 
the former Soviet Union have been able to do, the best record so 
far being 99.9 per cent in one of the former Soviet 
republics-the riding of St. John's East, with 16,313 registered 
voters and 16,322 votes cast, producing a participation rate of 
100.5 per cent. A number of ridings reached 95, 98 or 99 per 
cent. But in spite of all that, the final result was 52 to 48. That 
did not prevent the Right Hon. William Lyon Mackenzie King, 
then Prime Minister of Canada, from saying in this House, after 
the results of the second referendum in Newfoundland were 
announced, that ``It was clear from these figures that the 
majority of the huge number of voters who cast their votes were 
in favour of Confederation. It would seem that the outcome of 
the plebiscite was ``definitely beyond a shadow of a doubt'' a 
sign of support for union between the two countries. The 
government, and surely the Canadian people as well, welcomed 
the results of this plebiscite''.
<P>
	I trust that with the standards now in effect and Quebec's 
legislation that is almost unmatched for its rigour, a result of 50 
per cent of the vote, plus one, will be accepted when Quebec 
makes its decision.
<P>
	That being said, you will no doubt allow me to say a few 
words about my own riding, which is also affected by the bill as 
all other ridings are. Several of my colleagues in the Official 
Opposition spoke about their ridings yesterday and I did not yet 
take the opportunity to talk about mine in the other stages of the 
debate.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I invite you to visit my riding of Bellechasse. 
You will always be welcome and I will be pleased to host you if 
you do not have anywhere to stay, but there is excellent 
accommodation almost everywhere. Anyway, it will be a 
pleasure for me to receive you when you come. The limits of the 
federal riding of Bellechasse are as follows: it is bounded on the 
east by the riding of Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, 
represented by my hon. colleague. On the west, it is bounded by 
the riding of Beauce; on the east, by the State of Maine in the 
U.S., and on the north, by the St. Lawrence River, although my 
riding also includes some islands in the St. Lawrence, one of 
which is Grosse Île, where thousands and thousands of Irish 
families stayed on their migration to Quebec or Canada.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The riding of Bellechasse could now be described as a 
rectangle going from Saint-Pamphile in the southeast to 
Lac-Etchemin in the southwest, and from Saint-Jean-Port-Joli 
in the northeast to Saint-Anselme in the southeast, 
Saint-Anselme being the parish adjacent to my own parish of 
Sainte-Claire-de-Dorchester.
<P>
	With the new electoral map as proposed, which takes into 
account regional county municipalities or RCMs, the riding of 
Bellechasse would include two more parishes in the RCM of 
L'Islet, namely Saint-Roch-des Aulnaies and Sainte-Louise, 
which are now in the electoral district of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, so that the whole RCM of 
L'Islet would be in the riding of Bellechasse.
<P>
	More to the west, the riding of Bellechasse would gain the 
municipalities and parishes of Saint-Cyprien, 
Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague, Sainte-Rose-de-Watford, 
Saint-Benjamin, Saint-Prosper, Sainte-Aurélie and 
Saint-Zacharie, which are all located in the RCM of Etchemins. 
My federal riding of Bellechasse would then include every 
parish of the RCMs of L'Islet, Montmagny, Bellechasse and 
Etchemins, for a total of about 64 parishes and enormous 
distances we still measure in miles because the numbers are too 
high when they are measured in kilometres.
<P>
	The homogeneity is very nice, but the distances are a little 
ridiculous as a single member of Parliament responsible for 
such a vast area cannot properly serve all of his constituents. 
The criteria for readjusting electoral boundaries in Canada must 
be reviewed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2987"> 2987 </A></B>
<P>
	In closing, since we are talking about redistribution, it would 
be interesting to say a few words on the redistribution of seats in 
the other place. We would be in favour of an immediate and total 
redistribution of the 104 seats in the other house where 
unelected people are highly paid to sit. I think our friends in the 
Reform Party would wholeheartedly agree with us that we 
should abolish, in their present form, all the constituencies in 
the other house of the Parliament of Canada. We do not need a 
second house whose members would be working as they are 
now.
<P>
	I for one am in favour of the proposal put forward by the 
Reform Party, namely a triple-E Senate, an equal, elected and 
effective Senate. In my view, that respects the principle of 
equality among provinces, where all provinces would have the 
same number of representatives and all regions would be 
represented.
<P>
	Even though I said I would be in favour of such a proposal, I 
do have one very fundamental reservation. The proposal would 
probably be acceptable to English Canada, but never to Quebec. 
Quebec does not belong in another house where there would be 
equal representation of all provinces. Quebec will have nothing 
to do with that, nothing at all.
<P>
	In 1965, the premier of Quebec, or the man who would 
become premier the following year, in 1966, Daniel Johnson Sr., 
the ``real one'' as some people call him, wrote in a book entitled 
<I>Égalité ou Indépendance</I> that Canada will be binational and 
biethnic or it will not exist.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	It is up to my colleagues and of course to you, Mr. Speaker, to 
determine if Canada has become binational and biethnic. Not 
only do we not hear the word biethnicity anymore, but outside 
the province of Quebec, a lot of people even deny the existence 
of the Quebec nation-and I use the word nation in the English 
sense of the word, in its sociological sense, where it means 
people rather than country. No matter what Mr. Trudeau says in 
his private meetings, the word nation in French can apply to the 
existence and values of the Quebec people today, a people who 
have demonstrated their collective willingness to live in a given 
territory, to prosper there in their own language while respecting 
their minorities and to create within this territory a national 
state, a home for francophones in America.
<P>
	That is the goal that we, the Official Opposition, along with 
Quebec sovereignists and nationalists, will continue to pursue 
until we succeed, hopefully within a few months, in convincing 
our friends and colleagues in Quebec that Quebec sovereignty is 
as good for Quebecers as Canadian sovereignty is good for 
Canadians and as American sovereignty has been good for 
Americans. Quebec sovereignty is the affirmation of a people 
who have finally achieved political maturity. In that spirit, we 
will vote in favour of Bill C-18 at third reading.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to participate in the debate on third and final reading of 
Bill C-18, an act to suspend the operation of the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act. First of all, I want to state my 
party's position. We in the Reform Party are against this bill and 
continue to oppose it. It is obviously a waste of the time of 
independent commissions established under legislation passed 
by this House. Also, it is rather strange to stop the process as 
public hearings are starting or about to start.
<P>
	I will be discussing the policy of this government as well as its 
motives. I must also comment on the remarks made by my 
colleague from the Bloc Quebecois and his party's position. I 
understand that the Bloc supports this bill, but I cannot figure 
out why.
<P>
	Basically, I do not see why the Official Opposition would 
support the government in establishing boundaries in Quebec 
for elections which, they say, will never be held because Quebec 
will have achieved political independence. I understand the 
Bloc Quebecois's position on Quebec's independence, but not 
their position on representation in this House. I do not 
understand their position on this bill, not at all. I am puzzled by a 
number of things.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Bellechasse mentioned that we 
Reformers had moved amendments to this bill yesterday. We 
made the points we wanted to make. Five or six of our members 
have spoken on the bill. Now the Bloc, which supports the bill, 
continues to debate the amendments we moved and that they 
oppose, thereby delaying passage of a bill they support. I do not 
understand that and, as I said earlier, I do not see the point, for 
the Bloc Quebecois, of supporting suspension of the 
readjustment of electoral boundaries and of the number of seats 
in a future election if, as they claim, they are not interested in 
those seats because they would have no use for them in view of 
the events to come in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is a position I do not understand. I understand somewhat 
better the position that the government has put forward. I 
listened very carefully today to the words of the parliamentary 
secretary who gave for the first time somewhat of an explanation 
of how the government arrived at its position and how it has 
conducted itself. I will not comment on that at length. I have said 
a great deal about it already in the House and in committee.
<P>
	If one examines very carefully the position of the 
parliamentary secretary, what he really is saying is that 
politicians should decide whether these boundaries are 
appropriate or not. Many of us, Liberals and apparently 
Bloquiste aussi, think they are not and therefore that really 
justifies the bill. I know there was more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2988"> 2988 </A></B>
<P>
sophistication to the argument than that. But I heard that as the 
core of the argument and that troubles me a great deal. It is a 
fundamentally different concept than the one  we have about the 
redrawing of political boundaries. It is the reason we are 
concerned about delaying the process for two years and 
diverting it to a parliamentary committee, dominated by the 
government majority and then, of course, having on that 
committee an official opposition that does not think these seats 
are going to be important to it four years from now.
<P>
	Let me just comment a little further on that. We had a 
committee hearing on this bill. We passed the bill on the 
Thursday before the House rose. Within hours we were in 
committee and within a couple of hours of that the bill was 
passed.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster and I were 
there. Officials from Elections Canada including the Chief 
Electoral Officer, Mr. Kingsley, appeared before the committee. 
I want to put on the record part of the exchange from that 
committee if I could because it is very instructive on what the 
motivations for bringing this legislation were. Let us be clear. 
They have very little to do with the process that is now under 
way. I will summarize a few points from that hearing.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster asked Mr. 
Kingsley:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-were you yourself or Elections Canada in general consulted about the 
suspension of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act prior to its 
introduction into the House of Commons?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kingsley: -there was not what I would call consultation with me or my 
office about this bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Hermanson: Is this unusual?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kingsley: Well, I've been in the position for four years, and previous 
amendments to legislation relating to the office have involved consultation with 
my office-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Hermanson: -I want to know if the commissions have completed their 
work under the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act to this point? Would 
that be fair to say overall?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kingsley: The answer is yes, they have. They've done their work in 
accordance with the schedule and in accordance with the requirements of the 
statute. They are on time.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Hermanson: Do you know whether they're on budget?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kingsley: In terms of the budget that had been fixed, the answer is yes, 
they are on budget.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Hermanson: Were the commissions themselves properly constituted as 
required under the act?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kingsley: To the best of my knowledge, yes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Hermanson: Was there any indication of incompetence on the 
commission? Were there any obvious errors or mistakes reported to you or that 
you observed in supervising their work?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kingsley: The answer is no.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Hermanson: Are you aware of any meetings having been held 
improperly, say, without a quorum or something like that?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kingsley: I am advised the answer to that question is no.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Hermanson: Do you feel Elections Canada was able to meet the needs of 
the commissions by providing the maps, the census information and other 
information you were required to provide to them?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kingsley: That is certainly my view because I have heard absolutely 
nothing to the contrary from anyone.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Hermanson: There has been no suggestion there were inaccuracies in any 
of the information received? The census information was correct?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kingsley: No information to that effect at all.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Hermanson went on to ask whether the commissions have 
the latitude if they hear representation from the public in the 
public hearing process to make more largely definable changes 
in the boundaries. Mr. Kingsley replied that in accordance with 
the statute the commissions have all the latitude they wish on 
that matter. That is the point of the exercise. I will go on.
<P>
	I had asked Mr. Kingsley to confirm that the first notification 
was really with this particular bill. Did it occur after the tabling 
of the new proposals or the new maps? In other words I was 
asking if the government showed any particular interest in this 
to Elections Canada before there were specific boundary 
proposals that affected Liberal members. Mr. Kingsley 
confirmed essentially that yes it was after the tabling of the 
maps that the question was drawn to his attention.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Hermanson: Are there already a number of people who have applied to 
meet before these commissions? Are you aware of that?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kingsley: Apparently requests have come in throughout the land.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I know that because I was one who along with several other 
members of our caucus had prepared submissions and made 
contact with the commissions. I should add that considerable 
money had already been spent setting up the public hearing 
process which is now under way.
<P>
	Mr. Hermanson asked if a review were going on in committee, 
in other words the review proposed under the government's 
motion to look at the process, would it hamper in any way the 
current work of the commissions. Mr. Kingsley replied that 
from a purely technical point of view he would have to answer 
no. Of course we do have the bizarre situation that the hearings 
are now proceeding because the commissions have to do that in 
law. Of course there is still the intention to shut down the 
process.
<P>
	I asked Mr. Carol Lesage, assistant director of operations, 
electoral boundaries, whether some of the people on the 
commissions were qualified. Mr. Lesage made the following 
observation: ``In the majority of cases the commissioners are 
university professors in political science and in most cases 
specialize in questions dealing with representation''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2989"> 2989 </A></B>
<P>
	In fact when I asked my research assistant to find some 
detailed articles on these questions so we could call some 
witnesses it turned out that many of the names she came up with 
were in fact commissioners.
<P>
	I asked Mr. Lesage whether to his knowledge the 
commissioners had any particular partisan background. Of 
course the answer to that was no.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Hermanson: Has Elections Canada received extensive complaints that the 
process is too slow, or too fast?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kingsley: I am advised that we have not received any complaint in that 
respect.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Hermanson: Have you had a large number of calls requesting more 
information or registering complaints regarding the maps that were distributed?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kingsley: I remember looking at some statistics. The number of calls has 
increased recently as a result of this exercise at the 1-800 number.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It would appear furthermore he went on to say, that a number 
of those calls were directly related to the fact there were 
advertisements that the public hearing process was about to 
begin. It is now under way.
<P>
	It is fairly clear there is no malfunction in this process. It 
simply does not suit the political self-interests of members of 
Parliament, particularly members of the government. It 
apparently does not suit the political interests of members of the 
Bloc Quebecois. However I do not understand precisely what 
those interests are. I am sure they have nothing to do with the 
referendum in Newfoundland 50 years ago.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	There has been a certain amount of public reaction to this 
event and this bill in the media. Let me just review that because 
this is what people are reading across the country concerning 
this piece of legislation.
<P>
	I will not go on and on about this but the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> said: 
``So much for fair play''. That was its editorial on March 25.
<P>
	The Calgary <I>Herald</I> of March 25 urged the government to 
play by the rules. The Calgary <I>Herald</I> said: ``The Reform Party 
is right. On this issue, Reform at least appears willing to play by 
the rules rather than work them to its own self-interests''. I have 
to mention that because I certainly do not have an endorsement 
from the Calgary <I>Herald</I> for the election and I do not suspect I 
will have one in the future. However, I think it is worthwhile to 
note that endorsement.
<P>
	Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I>, March 26: ``A Liberal fiddle''. It goes 
on to point out the inequities that this legislation will 
perpetuate.
<P>
	The Montreal <I>Gazette</I>: ``Redrawing the boundaries. Ridings 
should reflect reality, not Liberal politicking''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In <I>La Presse</I> of March 29, Pierre Gravel wrote: ``Electoral 
map-millions wasted''. He points out, and I agree with him, 
that ``Since they arrived in Ottawa, the Bloc has pleasantly 
surprised its opponents, even in English Canada, by behaving as 
a responsible opposition party.'' This is an editorial from 
Quebec. But he also adds that ``This is the first important issue 
on which one can criticize it for not playing its role.''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, March 26: ``So much for principles. 
Crass partisan interference by the Liberals in the redrawing of 
electoral boundaries ensures the next elections will be unfair''.
<P>
	Edmonton <I>Journal</I> March 26, Norm Ovenden: ``Liberals 
protect personal kingdoms. Proposals from independent 
commissions for new riding boundaries would have cut some 
MPs out of the political picture''. Of course some of them may 
be cut out in any case.
<P>
	The <I>Globe and Mail</I> wrote a number of articles on this. One in 
particular I want to quote at length: ``Ottawa moves to scuttle 
revisions to riding boundaries. Grits cut off debate, introduce 
law to help process of redistribution. Using arguments that 
affected MPs traditionally raised at boundary revision time, 
Liberal MPs said yesterday that the proposed changes would 
disrupt traditional communities and social links within ridings 
and would eliminate historical riding names. The realignment of 
rural ridings to give them similar numbers of residents to urban 
ridings would also make them larger and more difficult for MPs 
to travel''. That is what we heard.
<P>
	``However, at a closed caucus meeting two weeks ago, Liberal 
MPs from central Ontario said that the boundary revisions 
would adversely affect local campaign organizations especially 
in weakly held ridings. The MPs burst into applause when 
Solicitor General Herbert Gray, the minister responsible for 
elections legislation, promised that the government would block 
the process. The government's move to close off debate 
yesterday prompted some dissension within the Liberal caucus. 
Some senior ministers objected to using time allocation so early 
in the party's term on an issue not crucial to Liberal policy or 
programs''.
<P>
	``Sources say some Liberal MPs facing another four years 
with hugely overpopulated constituencies were persuaded to 
support the move with warnings that realignment could boost 
the Reform Party's chances in Ontario. Other MPs were told the 
government will assign additional constituency staff to crowded 
ridings''. I should add that all three parties have agreed to assign 
this additional staff through the Board of Internal Economy, 
which we did in any case.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2990"> 2990 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	We all know we cannot believe everything we read in the 
newspapers. However this is a disturbing report, not refuted to 
my knowledge by anybody in the government to this point. I 
think the motivations, perhaps not as openly painted by Liberal 
members as in the article, have been clearly expressed in the 
Commons that this does affect personal political needs.
<P>
	I want to shed a little more sympathetic light on this situation. 
First of all I am glad to see in that article, and I did suspect and 
have reason to believe there are Liberal MPs and cabinet 
ministers who do not support what is going on. I wish they had 
been listened to here.
<P>
	However I do think there is a problem we should be frank 
about. Why has this particular issue proceeded this way at this 
time? In the past there has been a ruckus and concern about 
riding redistribution. There always will be. Sometimes in the 
past Parliament has intervened to change the process but it has 
always given a public policy reason before. It has changed the 
amending formula in the Constitution that only it can alter, some 
of the particulars of that. It has through that suspended the 
process and it has restarted again. Never has it stopped the 
process without a clear public policy objective other than to 
study it.
<P>
	Why did that happen this time? I think the reason is very clear. 
I saw the map in the Ottawa airport recently. The partisan map of 
Canada after the last election is very interesting. I know there 
are some differences here and there, but if you stand back a few 
feet you see a green bar on one side, the Reform Party and our 
strength in Alberta and British Columbia. You see a red bar 
through Ontario where the Liberal Party won most of the seats. 
You see a purple bar through Quebec where the Bloc Quebecois 
won almost all of the francophone majority ridings; most of the 
ridings won by the Liberal Party were ridings with larger 
anglophone or allophone populations. Then there is another red 
bar on the other side of Quebec in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	What does that mean? It means that you cannot go to an 
independent commission and make proposals that appear to be 
sticking up for your own riding without appearing to be against a 
caucus colleague. You cannot say your riding should be altered a 
certain way and therefore change the riding next to yours, unless 
of course you get together as caucus colleagues. That has made 
it more difficult. I sympathize with that situation because we 
have had to deal with that in our caucus in terms of preparing our 
own submissions.
<P>
	As difficult as that situation is, that cannot block 
redistribution forever. It certainly is not right to have people 
represented in the year 2000 on a census that was conducted in 
the early 1980s. That is ridiculous.
<P>
	With that all said this is an argument for many, many things. It 
is an argument for the independence of the process. As the hon. 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster pointed out to me today, 
it is  probably also in many ways an argument for the Reform 
Party policy of fixed election dates every four years.
<P>
	It is an argument for some of the things that have been raised 
to restore the Senate to its role of regional representation. It is 
also an argument for the need for a second chamber. When there 
is a dominant majority in this Chamber that operates on 
confidence and insists that the most wildly unjustifiable thing 
go through and it slams it through as quickly as possible, there is 
an argument for an elected independent or second legislative 
chamber. I repeat elected. It would reconsider that measure and 
force the government and force the House of Commons into 
some reasonable compromise.
<P>
	The Senate itself is in a very awkward position in these kinds 
of situations. The Senate has a clear legal and constitutional 
mandate which allows it to revisit and to block any piece of 
legislation. Its unelected status puts it in an extremely difficult 
position. I am not going to mince words on this, but I hope the 
Senate studies this thing as carefully as it believes it should be 
studied. I hope it examines very carefully all the questions, 
including the constitutional question. To delay this past the year 
2000 is in fact a potential violation of our Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	If the Senate believes that is the case, the appropriate thing for 
it to do, because of its unelected nature, would be not to block 
the bill, not to vote it down, but insist that the government get a 
constitutional reference to the Supreme Court on this so that we 
can be sure that we are not doing anything that is 
constitutionally or legally untoward. That is very important.
<P>
	I have spoken a lot on this bill before. I have spoken at length 
today. Our point is clear. There will be other speakers from the 
Reform Party and I believe they will all be opposing the bill and 
we will be opposing it at third reading.
<P>
	In closing I would like to move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``that'' 
and substituting the following therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-18, an act to suspend the operation of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment 
Act, be not now read a third time, but that it be read a third time this day three months 
hence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion appears to be in order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to speak on Bill C-18 at third reading. I would like to remind 
you that during debate on second reading, I stressed the 
fundamentally democratic nature of the Bloc Quebecois and its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2991"> 2991 </A></B>
<P>
intention to respect the character and autonomy of the people it 
represents in every riding of Quebec.
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of the member from Calgary 
West, who is wondering about our intentions, trying to 
understand our approach, to the strongly held democratic beliefs 
of the Bloc members. I would add that one of our party's main 
objectives-particularly when it comes to Quebec 
independence-is, as I have already said, to follow the 
democratic process every step of the way.
<P>
	We are taking part in this debate for much more significant 
reasons than party politics, since, as a number of my colleagues 
stated in this House, the decentralization process started a few 
years ago in Quebec is being accelerated and decision-making 
powers are being transferred back to the regions.
<P>
	Today I want to say again that the Bloc Quebecois is in favour 
of Bill C-18, a bill to suspend the operation of the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act for a two-year period and abolish 
the 11 electoral boundaries commissions. Our goal in supporting 
this legislation which suspends the operation of the Act for two 
years is, as you will have understood, to respect the regional 
character of the population and, at the same time, to avoid 
hampering the process of decentralization towards these same 
regions that is now under way in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday, I was pointing out in this House that the 
government in office, the Liberal government, does not usually 
understand the deep meaning of decentralization. In our 
fundamental reasons in favour of that readjustment, we are 
stressing that if, and I repeat if, Quebec is still in the 
Confederation when this step takes place, we would want to 
make sure at that time that all of this decentralization pursued by 
Quebec would be fully respected.
<P>
	However, as I mentioned yesterday, the Bloc Quebecois 
supports Bill C-18 with some reservations. First of all, it seems 
essential that we denounce once again the arbitrariness and 
inconsistency of some boundaries established in the past. To that 
effect, we must emphasize the importance of administrative 
divisions in Quebec. I remind you that these administrative 
zones not only have a strategic importance for Quebec, but they 
are also based on fundamental geographic, economic, industrial 
and cultural considerations, and we must fully understand all the 
work done by the economic, cultural and geographic 
communities in Quebec.
<P>
	As long as Quebec remains part of the Canadian 
Confederation, the federal commissions readjusting electoral 
boundaries will have to take into consideration regional county 
municipalities as well as administrative regions.
<P>
	As I said in my first speech, and this is the reason for our 
second reservation about Bill C-18, we consider 
decision-making an essential element of regional policy for the 
year 2000. Yet decentralized economic and social development 
is absent from Canadian policy as seen by the highly 
centralizing Liberal government. Again, the Liberal 
government's centralizing thrust works against the process and 
the work being done in Quebec.
<P>
	Let us not be afraid of words; let us not deny history; it is high 
time that Quebec broke free from this centralizing federalism 
which is extremely costly and leading us to bankruptcy.
<P>
	Decentralization of the political and economic decision 
making process appears to us equally essential to the creation of 
jobs in RCMs, particularly in my area of Sherbrooke, in 
Val-Saint-François and in the Asbestos region. Therefore, in 
the spirit of the reform of the Minister of Regional Development 
of Quebec, Mr. Picotte, and following the consolidation of 
regional development councils, the Bloc Quebecois commits 
itself to entrust the regions with political and economic 
decision-making.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois proposes that the Government of Quebec 
should not be the only one involved in the developing of a 
consistent economic policy. The general direction of 
development must be defined by the regions in the first place.
<P>
	I personally support the approach proposed by the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission, according to which regional 
authorities are synonymous with regional government. Regional 
development councils will enjoy the credibility that comes with 
being elected and have the authority to pass regulations and 
raise taxes.
<P>
	The rest of the provinces have to be told that. This way, 
Quebec remains original and authentic in its approach to 
regional development.
<P>
	Decentralization of a central government, this bureaucratic 
monster which is well known to civil servants, must come from 
political sovereignty.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes that decentralization of 
government funds and political power is the only way to 
promote development in eight regional strategic areas defined 
by the regional council of Eastern Townships, which brings us to 
the redistribution of all constituencies in the Eastern Townships.
<P>
	Last spring, in the five-year development plan for the Eastern 
Townships, local decision makers were able to identify three 
major development themes.
<P>
	First, development strategies are defined according to 
problems caused by delays and all the catching up to do. By 
promoting resource development, manpower training, research, 
technological development and business networking, these local 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2992"> 2992 </A></B>
<P>
decision-makers are influencing economic development 
throughout the country.
<P>
	Hence, we truly believe that people should feel they belong to 
their region and that ridings should be defined according to 
common interests shared by municipalities. That basically 
explains our position on Bill C-18.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Second, in any forward looking approach, it is primarily at the 
local level that development policy can be defined based on 
natural and cultural assets of the RCMs and on environmental 
protection.
<P>
	Third, we should always start from a decision at the local 
level, when defining a set of criteria for building on our 
strengths through investments to modernize our agriculture, 
forestry and mining sectors and make them more competitive. 
Therefore, it is primarily for structural reasons that we support 
this bill.
<P>
	If my colleagues will bear with me, I will try to explain the 
reasons behind specific actions by Quebec. Human resources 
development, manpower training, the potential for natural and 
cultural development, research and development, 
environmental protection, natural resources industries and 
business networking are a priority for my team, and we believe 
that the RCMs of my riding of Richmond-Wolfe and other 
Quebec ridings, and the revised electoral boundaries, will be the 
basis for economic development.
<P>
	My question is: Should we be always waiting for federal 
subsidies to boost research and development in the RCMs of 
Val-Saint-François and Sherbrooke? No. The Bloc Quebecois 
replies that the time has come to repatriate all powers and public 
funds which belong to us as a sovereign country and to share 
them with the regions which represent the real power.
<P>
	In Richmond-Wolfe, the Bloc Quebecois wants to do more 
than change the structure and the riding boundaries. We want 
some logic.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Good.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> The members across the 
way are reacting to these words because they are not familiar 
with them. Do they know the words logic and decentralization? 
Decentralization is part of a logical process of regional 
self-management based on grass-roots democracy. Does that 
mean something to you?
<P>
	Our approach favours the emergence of very decentralized 
and unbureaucratic organizations. Having read the Auditor 
General's report, we know the high cost of this bureaucratic 
monster, which is leading us straight to bankruptcy. In short, we 
oppose all authoritarian social and economic management 
policies of unified and centralizing administrations, like the 
Liberal government, which are ruining this country's finances, 
let us get that clear it once and for all.
<P>
	By favouring the decentralization of decision-making, we 
will help the people in the ridings work for regional 
development instead of trying to develop an impossible Canada.
<P>
	Adopting Bill C-18 on third reading is a good thing, but, in 
closing, I wish to say to hon. members that the next stage, 
consideration by the Senate, is not really essential for us. That 
institution costs us $43 million a year, but does not produce 
anything. Nevertheless, Bill C-18 is now at third reading, and 
we support it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the speech of the hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe and I had the feeling that maybe the one who 
wrote his speech is the same person who wrote the speech of the 
hon. member for Bellechasse, because both have nearly the 
same theme. I wonder why he can discuss sovereignty or the 
separation of Quebec in a speech on new electoral boundaries 
throughout Canada. It is incredible! Maybe logic defies reason 
in his speech. In any case, I have a question for the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Does he think that he will stay in this House after a 
referendum, if Quebec says yes to Canada and wants to stay here 
with other Canadians? If that is the decision, will he remain a 
member in this House and will he participate as a member, as he 
is doing now, and abandon his ideas of sovereignty and 
separation in order to defend his constituents' real interests?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased that the hon. member is so receptive to the idea of 
openly discussing sovereignty in this House and that he is 
prepared to accept some of the arguments that have been raised 
here so that together we can consider what lies ahead for us.
<P>
	Our course of action will be quite straightforward. Yes, the 
Parti Quebecois will win the next election in Quebec. A 
referendum process will be launched and will be won by the 
Parti Quebecois. The members of the Bloc Quebecois will be 
pleased to work in Quebec with considerable open-mindedness 
with a view to laying the groundwork for negotiations with 
English Canada. Yes, we will be participating in the process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would simply like to comment on the speech by my 
colleague from Richmond-Wolfe. In my opinion, his 
comments were most relevant to this debate, unlike what the 
government member had to say.
<P>
	He spoke at length about decentralization. I would like him to 
explain to us a little more how he would go about ensuring that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2993"> 2993 </A></B>
<P>
the will of local communities is respected if and when the 
process of redrawing the electoral map is undertaken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, to provide an 
adequate answer, I must point out that regional county 
municipalities in Quebec-as my colleagues have explained in 
detail-are municipalities grouped together and whose 
economic, cultural and social activities are closely related and 
involve people commuting between home and the workplace. 
These regional county municipalities were asked to develop 
strategic plans and first review all the problems experienced in 
their region, in terms of employment and social, educational and 
cultural development.
<P>
	Once the diagnosis was established, a strategic plan was 
developed for each regional county municipality. Let me use the 
example of the Eastern Townships, where there are seven 
regional county municipalities. Together, these municipalities 
examined and put together their strategic development plans, 
and then quickly selected major thrusts and common 
development projects, favouring a decentralization of the 
Quebec government to the regions, a transfer-the hon. member 
opposite should listen-of funds to the decision makers at the 
regional level and, consequently, a decision-making process 
with real spending power.
<P>
	When we look at the proposed electoral reform, we realize 
that this structure is not understood and is simply ignored. The 
powers that be in Ottawa do not understand this structure and 
they draw electoral boundaries which systematically undermine 
an effort which has already been going on for some ten years in 
Quebec. These are the major structuring arguments which lead 
us to participate in this debate, and this may be the reason why 
some hon. members are not listening to what we are saying.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	If hon. members are receptive, they will understand that what 
is taking place in Quebec is really a decentralization in favour of 
the real decision makers, those who are key players in the field. 
First, these people can identify problems and, second, they can 
provide original and effective solutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to join the debate on the proposed 
suspension of the operation of the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act. I rise to oppose Bill C-18 and to support the 
Reform amendment to that bill.
<P>
	There are three issues here that need to be addressed and have 
been addressed. I would like to put my thoughts to them. The 
first one is the issue of government interference with due 
process; the second is the issue of proper representation for the 
people of Canada; the third is the proper use of funds and the 
affordability of the process that we are looking at.
<P>
	In terms of government interference there are several things I 
feel the government is doing in proposing this bill. In 1964 the 
Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act put into place a system 
that was non-partisan and operated under general principles, a 
system to look at electoral boundaries within our country and 
make a choice in a system to make it fair to Canadians.
<P>
	On a whim the government has decided to dismantle a due 
process. The people of Canada look at the motivation and 
wonder what motivates this and what in future might happen the 
same way, as well as government interference in the process 
here in this House in terms of time allocation and the closure on 
bills.
<P>
	I have a quote here from a few years ago of a former member 
of this House who represented a constituency in B.C. when 
closure was enacted by a former Conservative government to 
enact the legislation that this government is trying to annul.
<P>
	Let me quote from <I>Hansard</I> of December 17, 1985. The Right 
Hon. John Turner stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The proposal of the government to impose closure on Bill C-74, an act which 
in effect amends the Constitution of this country with regard to the number of 
members who have the right to sit in this Chamber, cuts very deeply into the 
ability of the House to represent adequately the people of Canada. The House of 
Commons, its make-up, its essence and how we operate should not be tampered 
with in a careless, callous and cavalier fashion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I warn those who sit on all sides of this House, particularly those who sit on 
the backbenches of the Conservative government, to take heed and pay close 
attention to what the government is attempting to do, because it affects all of us 
and our ability to represent adequately the people who did us the honour of 
sending us to the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is the first time in the history of the House that a government has made 
redistribution a partisan issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Now we have a second time.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At all times previously redistribution, a measure to redivide the seats of the 
House of Commons, has been done in a non-partisan, impartial manner. There 
was all-party agreement, in fact for 30 years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If the action so heartily condemned by the leader of the 
Liberal Party was wrong then, why is it suddenly so right now? 
Does time change these things, or is it power? Suddenly debate 
and a thorough review of the best approach to take in an 
atmosphere of freedom are no longer valid concerns when he is 
the one in power.
<P>
	Is it any surprise that MPs on this side of the House are now 
suspicious of the government's motives and undefined plans?
<P>
	Government interference is also in the fact that it is allowing 
or seeks to allow or disallow the input from the public, from 
Canadians. Instead it wants to put the decision to a 
parliamentary committee of which of course it would control the 
outcome.
<P>
	The very act of redistribution takes at least two and a half 
years, possibly longer. It involves the striking of  commissions, 
it takes a look at geography, drafts boundaries, involves 
consultative processes and perhaps, as we saw in 1981, court 
challenges in the process.

<P>
	Besides that, Elections Canada has to look at it and put into 
place all the returning officers needed. Polling districts have to 
be set up.
<P>
	The 1988 election had to operate from a 1981 census. The 
potential of the process that we now see if this is delayed for two 
years as suggested would be looking of course at something that 
would take us into the year 2000 before we had redistribution.
<P>
	We would be looking at 1981 numbers and I would like to 
reflect that in my own area. My constituency right now is made 
up of three centres, Coquitlam, Port Moody and half of Port 
Coquitlam, and happens to be one of the fastest growing areas in 
the lower mainland.
<P>
	In the 1992 referendum there were 77,900 voters and in the 
1993 election there were 86,324 voters. According to Statistics 
Canada in the three centres the population in 1991 was 136,000; 
in 1996 that is projected to be 158,000; in the year 2006, 
197,000.
<P>
	There was 21 per cent growth from 1986 to 1991 in Coquitlam 
alone, and 26 per cent growth in that same period in Port 
Coquitlam. By the time we come to the year 2000 which is 
potentially where we would be if the process is shut down and 
the representation is not there we would be looking at numbers 
that do not reflect the proper representation by population. The 
skewing would be that much worse than it has been.
<P>
	I was interested to see the numbers that were assigned to this 
project that has happened and hopefully in the public 
consultations this will be looked at.
<P>
	The target number in our particular area was 96,000 voters. 
Certainly some of these things need to be reviewed.
<P>
	I was interested to review that the United States House of 
Representatives has in total 435 representatives. They represent 
ridings of approximately half a million people. That maximum 
is set by their constitution and like ours their boundaries are 
adjusted every 10 years.
<P>
	Britain, on the other side of the scale, has 651 members. There 
are so many members and so little room in the House they cannot 
accommodate these members. In fact to vote they have to file 
past the Speaker. This limits debate. It shortens the question 
period.
<P>
	We do have to look at numbers and in fact the Canadian people 
are saying they do not want the numbers increased. The cost is 
high enough in this House.
<P>
	What do the Canadian electors want? My second point is they 
want proper representation. Effective representation comes 
from representation by population. The numbers that come from 
each constituency should reflect the population. Those numbers 
should be equal as much as possible for the constituency.
<P>
	However, outside in rural areas to make up for that we need 
reasonable regional representation.
<P>
	Once again I would make a point of the importance of the 
other place, representing regionally and equally across this 
country, an elected Senate that is effective and therefore equal 
representation of all Canadians.
<P>
	The third thing we have to remember is the affordability of the 
process. The process that is in place has met the criteria 
proposed by the body that the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act is proceeding on budget. It has accomplished 
to this point its purpose on budget and would be wasted if the 
process were put aside. I propose that what we do need is proper 
use of funds. We should let this proceed to the point at which the 
public can be consulted, the input is in place and we get the 
feedback that Canadians want from this process.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	It is true that we do not need more seats in Parliament. The 
Reform stand is that Canada is already one of the most governed 
countries of the industrialized world. Do we need more 
representation? No, we need better representation. Do we need 
more costs? No, we need better representation.
<P>
	We need representation by population. We need regional 
representation. We need proper use of the money that has 
already been spent and a step in the right direction for public 
input on how best to spend money in future electoral processes.
<P>
	With these comments I would like to support the motion for 
the amendment to put aside or to postpone Bill C-18, as 
proposed by my Reform colleagues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Port Moody-Coquitlam in her speech stressed 
very greatly the importance of not increasing the number of 
members of this House.
<P>
	In the negotiations that were carried on there was some 
discussion about that issue and I know that members of the 
Reform Party pressed to have a committee to not only consider 
whether there would be any increases but to have a commitment 
that it be frozen. It would have been happy had such a clause 
been included in this bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2995"> 2995 </A></B>
<P>
	I have two questions for the hon. member. First, did she in 
making her statements bear in mind the fact that this bill merely 
suspends the process for two years? It is not a bill that in any way 
interferes with the process or changes it. The process will 
resume in two years time if nothing else has been done. Did she 
bear that in mind when she quoted from the speech by the Right 
Hon. John Turner who was after all criticizing a bill that 
changed the process right away? This was not a case of a 
suspension bill, this was a change in the process. I note there is 
no change in this process in this bill.
<P>
	Second, would she support this bill if it contained a clause that 
limited the number of members of the House of Commons to 
295?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, in answer to the first question, a 
suspension of process, what does that mean? That means an 
interruption in a process that is already in place. What this does 
is take it to a Liberal dominated committee again. What is its 
intention? We do not know. Why suspend it if you feel that it will 
proceed? Let us carry on with what is there and use the process 
that is there.
<P>
	As to the other question, if the number of members were 
limited to 295, certainly that would be an improvement and from 
the feedback from my constituents they would heartily endorse a 
freeze on the number of members of Parliament. Perhaps this 
should be looked at more carefully over time and perhaps that 
could even be reduced depending on what we would find to be 
the proper representation by population and the proper regional 
representation model that would apply to the Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario):</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend the 
hon. member on her comments. She certainly made some efforts 
at researching this issue. The hon. member has also referred to 
her own riding in the context of where she might be if we do not 
have redistribution in the next 10 years.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member may not know that my riding currently has 
about 210,000 constituents. I had absolutely no difficulty in 
attesting to and recommending that this government proceed 
with the legislation as it had planned for the very simple reason 
that the riding next to me had only one-third the number of 
constituents.
<P>
	The member talked about the prospect of capping the number 
of seats that we have in this great House. Given the situation in 
which one may have a riding that does not have as many as the 
hon. member's riding does, would she not agree that it might be 
better to redistribute between the existing ridings?
<P>
	Perhaps more important, rather than talking about the waste 
that might occur by having to suspend the electoral boundaries, 
we might be doing something that helps the Canadian public and 
the taxpayer.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are many things that can be 
done to help the Canadian public and certainly-I hope the 
Liberals are listening-the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	It is not simply electoral boundaries and that is another thing I 
hear loud and clear. There are inequities in the system right now. 
There are very large ridings and very small ridings but with the 
process in place, I believe in the public input that would be given 
to that process. Many of the things that the hon. member asked 
would be put on the public agenda and discussed. Then 
something very real could come out of that.
<P>
	I feel that should be put in place and followed through as it is 
already very much along the way. Finish it and get the public 
input. It is not just the hon. member and I. The public wants a 
voice in this as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Mr. Speaker, as some of 
the other speakers have in this debate offered an invitation to 
you and indeed to the rest of the House to visit their ridings, I 
would also like to do that. I am certainly proud of my riding.
<P>
	I would have to admit that I am just a little biased as far as that 
riding is concerned. I was born in that riding as was my father. 
His father was born pretty much in this area of the country and 
then emigrated to Alberta and homesteaded in this constituency. 
I am about the third generation Johnston in that area. I guess 
members can understand my affinity for it.
<P>
	As far as redistribution is concerned, or representation by 
population, I guess it is always difficult to arrive exactly at 
representation by population when one considers what a huge 
country Canada is and that over the last many years the 
population has more or less gravitated from the countryside to 
the larger cities.
<P>
	In my opinion to try and arrive at true representation by 
population would be extremely difficult if one does not take into 
consideration, as one would have to, some method of 
considering the size and vastness.
<P>
	My riding has many small towns in it. The population 
continues to grow as opposed to some in rural Saskatchewan 
where the population shift is really dramatic from the country to 
the city.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the guidelines state that Alberta 
constituencies should not exceed a maximum population of 
122,000 approximately or a minimum population of around 
73,000. Certainly my riding does fit into those upper and lower 
limits.
<P>
	I agree with my colleague who included an amendment to this 
bill that would limit the amount of seats in the House of 
Commons and put a cap on it at 295. I would feel quite 
comfortable supporting the bill in that form. Why the 
government chose not to put that in the bill is really a mystery to 
me. This could have been one time when we had unanimity in the 
House.
<P>
<B></B>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="2996"> 2996 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	The west side of my constituency is quite sparsely populated. 
As we move into the cities, which are along the corridor of No. 2 
highway, they are really the largest populated centres of our 
constituency. As we move to the eastern side of the constituency 
again we come into an area where the population dwindles off.
<P>
	In one of the local papers recently faxed to me the editorial 
was that they have not seen much of their MP lately. That is a 
problem. The larger the constituency gets as far as area is 
concerned, the bigger problem that becomes. It becomes a 
physical impossibility to be seen the desired number of times in 
a given area of the constituency. It is something that we find in 
these large areas. If one tried to get anywhere near 100,000 
people in southeastern Saskatchewan one would have to take in a 
very large area of that province. To a certain extent that holds 
true in the southern portions of Alberta as well.
<P>
	My party suddenly needed a speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> We could have a vote right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> At any rate, it certainly gives me an 
opportunity to brag about my constituency. I also have to say 
that we have an extremely well informed electorate there as is 
evidenced by the fact that I am here today. It was given a choice. 
We presented the constituency with six candidates to choose 
from and I was the fortunate person to come here and share this 
experience with the House.
<P>
	As far as postponing the process, I have in my constituency 
many people saying that they would like to present briefs to this 
panel and have their views heard as to what they plan to do as far 
as the constituency and what they would like to see done. I am 
really at a loss as to what to tell these people. I tell them that we 
would really like to see this bill die in the House but that we do 
not think there is any danger of that. We have to recognize the 
simple mathematics that the people who introduced the bill 
certainly hold sway over the result of the bill.
<P>
	As a result of that I have people in my constituency looking to 
me and asking what to do. Apparently there is very little they can 
do. Maybe what they should be doing is preparing their brief 
now for what will take place in maybe a year or two from now.
<P>
	We talk about the difficulty of trying to represent a rural 
riding. I have never had the opportunity to try and serve an urban 
riding but I would assume that the transportation problem, the 
physical problem of trying to get around the constituency is 
somewhat less of a burden. It would seem to me that whatever 
formula the committee ultimately comes up with must take into 
consideration the actual physical territory that the member has 
to cover. Surely it is not just the plains that have this difficulty. I 
know my neighbours to the west in British Columbia have large 
tracts of terrain they have to cover.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I would like to invite you to my 
constituency. I would be pleased to introduce you at our annual 
stampede and rodeo, and that goes for all members of the House. 
It is an event that is second only to the Calgary Stampede as far 
as being an excellent show. I am a little prejudiced but I think 
that you are a little closer to the action at our show. I believe the 
Speaker has actually been to the Ponoka Stampede and I would 
very much like to invite all members of the House to come and 
join us on the July 1 long weekend.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great attention to the speech of the hon. 
member and I congratulate him on the discourse. He said, if I 
heard him correctly, that if the bill had a cap on the number of 
MPs at the present level of 295 members-I think he said 195 in 
his speech but I am sure he meant 295-he would have 
supported the bill.
<P>
	That being the case, how can he justify the comments of his 
colleague who moments before him said that the bill distorted 
representation by population. If that is true, how could he vote 
for such a reprehensible bill?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 100 per cent sure if I 
have the question straight, but to answer a part of the question, if 
the bill did cap the number-the hon. member is completely 
correct, I meant 295 not 195-I would be tempted to support the 
bill.
<P>
	Perhaps my colleague is not prepared to support the bill. That 
is her prerogative. But I would be prepared to at that point.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really 
appreciated the speech by the hon. member for Wetaskiwin. I 
thank the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands for allowing 
a more adequate vision of the hon. member for Wetaskiwin.
<P>
	The hon. member gave us a good description of the role of a 
member of Parliament representing a rural riding, as I do. Does 
the hon. member agree with current standards allowing a 
variation of 25 per cent of the provincial quota for a riding, in 
many if not most cases, to compensate for the size of the 
territory and reduce the number of constituents the member 
must represent when he or she has many communities to visit?
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Wetaskiwin said that some of his 
constituents had not seen him since the beginning of this 
Parliament. Well, it sometimes takes several months or even an 
entire year to cover a whole riding.
<P>
	I also want to ask how the hon. member for Wetaskiwin can 
reconcile his party's objective of limiting or reducing the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2997"> 2997 </A></B>
<P>
number of electoral districts with that of adequate 
representation for rural ridings requiring much more travelling. 
And while we are on the road, of course, we cannot meet with 
anyone.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, in an attempt to answer the 
member's question, the 25 per cent allowance for geographic 
size in many cases would be adequate. In my view there are 
cases where it would not be adequate.
<P>
	It is most difficult in larger ridings. We find that people in the 
large ridings, the electorate, are really very mobile. They have 
to be in order to live in areas that are sparsely populated. Rather 
than MPs continually make house calls it would be incumbent 
upon them to have meetings in a central area, advertise them 
well and make sure that people got there to make their 
representations.
<P>
	Further, it is most important to reform the Senate to the point 
where it is elected, equal and effective. It is most important in 
my view. In that way we would be looking after more regional 
representation. It is one of the facts of Canadian life that the 
population is very widely but not very evenly distributed.
<P>
	Therefore it is all the more important that we have regional 
representation, a Senate with equal representation from each 
province that is actually effective in blocking, revising or 
sending bills back to the House or committee and is elected by 
popular vote. That is absolutely essential in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my colleague from Red Deer, as many Reform MPs 
have suggested, recognizes the importance of representation by 
population as well as regional representation.
<P>
	We have had debate on Bill C-18; we are coming to the end of 
it. The Liberals proposed that something was terribly wrong. 
Reform looked at the situation. We were sincere in reviewing it. 
We were sincere in our agreement with Canadians that there 
were too many seats. We looked for ways and looked for a 
commitment from the government to find solutions. When that 
was not forthcoming my colleagues and I became very 
concerned about the whole process.
<P>
	We are amused at why Bloc members who do not seem to have 
an interest in the matter would be so concerned. Once again it 
is-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I gather from the hon. member's 
remarks that he is speaking on debate rather than on questions or 
comments. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> I have a question. I am trying to say we hear 
Bloc members and wonder who they are speaking for. We hear 
the Liberals and we know they are speaking for themselves. 
Canadians have to ask who can represent them on this issue. On 
many issues it seems like Reform has been representing the 
people.
<P>
	Has the hon. member for Red Deer consulted with 
constituents? Does he feel he is representing them on Bill C-18?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Just to correct my colleague, Mr. Speaker, the 
riding is Wetaskiwin.
<P>
	Actually I have consulted with my constituents not only 
federally but at the provincial level as well. I made 
representation a couple of years ago to the commission that was 
looking at redrawing the electoral divisions in Alberta. I think I 
am representing the wishes and views of my constituents here 
today.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question is on the amendment. Is it 
the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the amendment

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should immediately take 
the required measures to authorize the construction of a high-speed train (HST) 
linking the cities of Windsor and Quebec City, as well as the necessary 
infrastructure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise again today 
to speak about the high speed train between Quebec City and 
Windsor.
<P>
	For the Bloc Quebecois, this public transit system, which is 
effective, fast, convenient, comfortable, pleasant and 
environmentally friendly, is a key component for the economic 
development of our main urban centres in Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	We all know that communication links inevitably entail trade 
deals and industrial business. This was well understood by our 
ancestors who invested in railroads between both our provinces 
to start with, and then throughout Canada.
<P>
	Traditionally, prosperity in Quebec and in Canada has been 
very closely tied to our investments in transportation. Our 
standard of living and our competitive position largely depend 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3000"> 3000 </A></B>
<P>
on decisions that are taken today regarding the transportation 
infrastructure of tomorrow.
<P>
	Unfortunately the railroad network and facilities used for the 
transportation of passengers and goods in Canada are 
considerably behind and our obsolete infrastructure has 
progressively given a competitive edge to other means of 
transportation such as cars, buses and airplanes.
<P>
	Has the government forgotten that the increasing use of 
airplanes between Montreal and Toronto has put more pressure 
on airports and the highway system? Has it forgotten that 
increased dependency on cars has wasted more energy and hurt 
the environment? The government appears to have neglected 
facts which are nevertheless obvious.
<P>
	It is more important than ever that Canada and Quebec have 
an efficient public transportation infrastructure which promotes 
the use of non-polluting and renewable energy resources in 
order to protect our ecosystems as much as possible, in keeping 
with the concept of sustainable development.
<P>
	The government must consider this high-speed train project, 
which will make the transportation system more productive and 
provide technological benefits as well. It must establish a 
general policy involving Canadian transportation technology 
considered one of the most advanced in the world. It offers a 
unique opportunity to engage in an international industrial 
strategy that will allow Canadian and Quebec entrepreneurs to 
be leaders in introducing the high-speed train to North America 
and to the developing world.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	The high-speed train, also called the HST, or the TGV in 
French, is the logical way to develop passenger rail 
transportation in Canada. Some 10 million people, that is 40 per 
cent of the total population of Canada, live in the 
Quebec-Windsor corridor. This section, which covers the most 
densely populated area of Canada, is used every day by 10,000 
people. The Canadian HST could take over at least 35 per 
cent-and, according to another realistic scenario, up to 45 per 
cent-of the total passenger market between Montreal and 
Toronto. Such a concentration is sufficient to support an HST 
which will definitely improve the quality of service in the most 
densely populated urban corridor of Canada and relieve 
congestion in the airports and on the roads.
<P>
	Besides, we firmly believe that the government should have 
committed itself to putting into place permanent job-creating 
projects that would really help stimulate economic growth while 
reducing unemployment. For the Bloc Quebecois, a high-speed 
train for the Quebec City-Windsor corridor is an initiative 
which largely meets these objectives.
<P>
	The HST will bring about the creation of some 120,000 jobs, 
directly or indirectly related to the construction of the system 
and its equipment, operation and maintenance, to the 
technological transfers and to the industrial agreements to 
follow, not to mention the positive impact that it will have on the 
tourism industry.
<P>
	The crucial role of the corridor for the Canadian economy has 
been stated many times and the high-speed train is practically 
the most efficient mode of transportation between larger cities. 
The European experience clearly shows that the high-speed 
train draws people to hotels, office buildings, convention 
centres, restaurants and other commercial or tourist activities.
<P>
	A high speed train service will have additional economic 
spinoffs beyond those directly related to building and operating 
the train. Indeed, the increased number of passengers travelling 
the Quebec City-Windsor corridor will spend money for meals 
on board, accommodation and entertainment, and developers 
will invest in infrastructure to provide additional services 
needed to meet the growing demand.
<P>
	Thus, a high-speed train will encourage the public and private 
sectors to better promote their communities and to develop 
package deals for tourists travelling aboard this train. Several 
communities along the corridor will also benefit from a faster 
connection to much larger cities and, consequently, improve 
access to their numerous facilities.
<P>
	At the same time, connections to other modes of 
transportation intended to improve the total passenger 
transportation system will be an important advantage for some 
of the communities close to cities on the HST line.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	I take the case of Trois-Rivières and Kingston which will also 
be able to benefit from considerable social and economic 
spin-offs. That might facilitate the transportation to Kingston of 
our future students who will have to abandon the college in 
Saint-Jean.
<P>
	Keep in mind that a community located close to a high speed 
train line would regain prestige because it would be seen as a 
modern and expanding community. The proof of this can be 
found in France where communities located close to the high 
speed train line capitalize on that in their written and oral 
publicity.
<P>
	The Bloc's proposal is not just to promote tourism or 
economic development of local communities and job creation. 
We also consider it essential that Canada and Quebec invest in a 
railway infrastructure that is modern and better adapted to the 
realities of the 21st century. With improved facilities, we will be 
better able to face the challenges of the year 2000.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3001"> 3001 </A></B>
<P>
	To do so, we must opt for a rail transportation system that will 
reduce ground and air traffic which has reached the saturation 
point, that will use non-polluting and renewable energy 
resources, and that will improve our industrial co-operation 
with a series of technological transfers between different 
European and Canadian companies, allowing them to become a 
technological bridge-head of high speed rail on the North 
American continent.
<P>
	Research, development, innovation and technology transfer 
are one of the best solutions to economic problems and that is 
why we must speed up our efforts in that direction.
<P>
	In Quebec and Canada, we have a critical mass of high-tech 
companies that creates a favourable climate for the development 
and implementation of advanced technologies. In addition to 
providing attractive opportunities for our scientists and 
technicians, these companies are a source of major spin-offs in 
terms of production and exports in the manufacturing sector. It 
is therefore essential for the future of our economy that we 
promote research and development and technological upgrading 
by supporting the strengths we already have in our high-tech 
companies. One of our serious problems in this respect is the 
delay in disseminating and implementing new technologies. The 
construction of a Canadian HST would make good use of our 
industrial capabilities in one of the sectors in which we excel, 
namely transportation equipment.
<P>
	How much have governments invested in the past 20 years in 
developing or upgrading our airport facilities and how much 
will have to be invested in the years to come? What does it cost 
to maintain our road network and how much will future 
improvements cost?
<P>
	We agree all these investments are necessary, but it is high 
time we took the same kind of action to rejuvenate our passenger 
train services. More government subsidies for developing 
transportation by bus or by air means the Canadian HST project 
is less likely to be realized.
<P>
	We all know the HST project has been examined a number of 
times in the past ten years: there was a study by VIA Rail in 
1982-84, updated in 1989; there was one by GEC, 
Alsthom-Bombardier in 1988-89 and another study by the 
Quebec-Ontario rapid train task force in 1989-91.
<P>
	All these studies come to the same conclusion, which is that 
the potential market is sufficient to ensure the profitability of a 
high speed railway transportation system. The HST project 
would certainly enjoy the support of communities that would be 
able to take advantage of an HST service.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	In June, a feasibility study on the construction of high-speed 
rail lines in the chosen corridor is to be made public by the 
federal, Quebec and Ontario governments. It will be very 
interesting to see the results of the cost benefit analysis carried 
out by the tripartite committee on  technologies available to 
build a high speed train. Hopefully, all these exhaustive studies 
on a high speed train will eventually result in its construction 
and not gather dust on a shelf. On the other hand, once convinced 
of the undeniable potential of this project, governments and the 
private sector should jointly undertake a comprehensive 
feasibility study to determine the cost of the whole project and 
how to share responsibilities for this venture.
<P>
	It is estimated that it will take $7.5 billion over ten years to 
build a high-speed line between Quebec City and Windsor. The 
tax revenues generated by this project over the construction 
period should reach $1.9 billion. At this rate, the high-speed 
line will be paid for very quickly. One must also take into 
account that the government's expenditures will be reduced 
since the high-speed train will provide transportation between 
cities at a much lower cost than that of upgrading the road and 
air networks. This is what you call rationalizing government 
expenditures.
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois recommends the construction 
of a high speed rail transportation system which will provide the 
following advantages: 120,000 jobs per year in Canada during 
construction; nearly $1.9 billion in tax revenues also during 
construction; funding provided mainly by the private sector; use 
of a well proven Canadian technology allowing speeds of 300 
kilometres an hour; new construction and urban renewal in 
communities all along the HST corridor; increased 
competitiveness for the corridor cities; a more economical and 
accessible mode of transportation for individuals as well as for 
businesses and communities established along the corridor; an 
environmentally-friendly mode of transportation; decreased 
highway and air traffic, reducing the need for new 
infrastructure; finally, technological expertise giving Canadian 
industry a strategic leading edge on the American high speed 
train market valued at approximately $250 billion.
<P>
	Without any hesitation, the Bloc supports the HST project 
because nowadays, no society and no region can afford not to 
use its innovative resources.
<P>
	Construction of the HST would guarantee Canada and Quebec 
a prosperous future filled with benefits like those I mentioned 
earlier.
<P>
	Construction of the HST in the most densely populated area of 
Canada is a unique investment opportunity. By investing right 
now, Canada and Quebec would reap dividends for decades. 
There would be immediate spinoffs during construction, and 
benefits for Canadians and Quebecers would continue to accrue 
throughout the project.

<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	The Quebec City-Windsor high-speed train project is 
undoubtedly a much more useful and desirable investment than 
the defunct helicopter project was. Particularly in the greater 
Montreal area, which was so badly hit by unemployment, it will 
provide an opportunity for industrial conversion in a field where 
export opportunities and therefore job opportunities are 
excellent.
<P>
	I will conclude by telling you that, with the high-speed train, 
Canada will make the most profitable investment in 
transportation in its entire history. This investment by the 
Canadian government will not increase the Canadian debt and 
will contribute to VIA Rail's profitability. I hope that my 
colleagues will understand the importance of supporting this 
project, which fits part of our natural economic development 
and a good way to use the skills we have acquired.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I recognize the parliamentary

	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the members 
of the House for the opportunity to clarify what has been a 
misunderstanding of a statement I made at the end of question 
period today. Unfortunately the time allotted to me did not allow 
me to make a very critical part of that statement regarding the 
PVY-n virus in Prince Edward Island and the potato growers 
there.
<P>
	As I said then, the minister recognizes and continues to give 
serious attention to the issue, as he has for the number of months 
he has been appointed. He recognizes that legal proceedings are 
inevitably lengthy and expensive to all parties that may be 
involved. The minister sincerely hopes that protracted litigation 
may be avoided and can be avoided. He will seek through legal 
counsel and continuous discussion with the industry to achieve 
that result.
<P>
	I apologize to the industry for any misunderstanding that may 
have been caused by the incomplete statement earlier today.
<P>
	I again thank the House for the opportunity to clarify this.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to 
thank the member for Joliette for his very informed speech on 
high speed trains.
<P>
	I have no quarrel whatsoever with his enthusiasm for a 
technology that we are obviously considering. He alluded to the 
fact a report and a study on which $6 million is being spent by 
Ontario, Quebec and the federal government is to be released in 
June. Surely he wants to be true and honest with Canadian 
taxpayers by at least waiting for the report and until such time as 
government and Parliament can make a decision on it.
<P>
	As I said, the governments of Quebec, Ontario and Canada 
have embarked on a major study to determine the viability of a 
high speed rail system in the Quebec City to Windsor corridor.
<P>
	The present study covers a broad range of subjects that have 
been identified in previous works and is so designed to provide 
the most comprehensive evaluation of the potential of high 
speed rail in the corridor.
<P>
	The three governments hired a consortium of consultants as 
managers of the project. The consortium is responsible to 
produce the benefits and the costs and the financial analysis for 
the overall project.
<P>
	In addition the consortium is supervising and co-ordinating 
the following component studies, all very important to the 
decision making: data gathering, passenger and revenue 
forecasting, technology assessment, including the operating and 
strategy and costing.
<P>
	The member alluded to one technology but he also should 
know that two technologies were under consideration. New 
technologies are being developed even as we speak.
<P>
	The member talked about $7.5 billion. I do not know where he 
got those figures. The study has not been finished yet and some 
of his figures, unfortunately, are from previous reports or 
previous studies that have been done.
<P>
	Also included are the industrial strategy and the economic 
benefits, institutional options and the legislative and labour 
issues, trends in intercity passenger transportation and 
government support, environmental aspects, impacts of the 
urban system and settlement patterns and the light freight and 
station concessions. This study builds on the findings and 
recommendations of the Ontario-Quebec task force report 
which identified several shortcomings in its work and the work 
of previous studies.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	One of the main concerns in the task force report work was the 
inadequacy of the data that formed the basis for the passenger 
and revenue forecasts. To address this concern one-third of the 
total allocated budget of $6 million for the current study has 
been devoted to the gathering of data concerning travel patterns 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3003"> 3003 </A></B>
<P>
and attitudes  of the travelling public and to the forecasting of 
future usage.
<P>
	This is the most critical aspect of the high speed proposal. 
Will people use it if in fact it is built? Previous studies of 
passenger travel in the corridor were conducted in a short 
timeframe and did not address the seasonal variances that may 
exist.
<P>
	The quality and reliability of the base data have also been 
greatly improved over previous works. We have obtained 60,000 
survey responses, three times more than had been obtained in 
the previous studies. This level of response was possible 
through the full co-operation of all the carriers in the corridor. 
Complete access to their passenger facilities and equipment was 
obtained to facilitate the conduct of the surveys. This is the first 
time researchers have been able to gain this unconditional 
co-operation. The survey results were also provided to the 
individual carriers to validate accuracy and reliability.
<P>
	We have exerted a great deal of effort to improve the quality 
of the data to be used as the base for the study. This information 
is presently being incorporated by many of the consultants who 
are still in the midst of their work. It would be inappropriate and 
naturally premature to presume the outcome of their work.
<P>
	In October 1989 the federal government established a royal 
commission on national passenger transportation with the 
objective of reporting on a national integrated, intercity 
passenger transportation system to meet the needs of Canadians 
in the 21st century. The commission reported its findings in 
1992 and recommended with respect to high speed rail that 
governments only invest in high speed rail if the overall benefits 
exceed the costs and taxpayers do not have to pay an operating 
subsidy.
<P>
	Furthermore, the commission recommended that there be 
public consultation on the implications of the government's 
decision and that the government establish a regulation under 
which high speed rail would operate, including safety and 
environmental regulations.
<P>
	Clearly the royal commission has indicated through its 
recommendations that a hasty decision should not be promoted 
and that the full impacts of high speed rail are known prior to 
making a decision.
<P>
	The Canadian debate on high speed rail has been ongoing for a 
long time and has intensified over the last few years with the 
release of several independent reports. These reports indicated 
that the governments will have to play a major role in any high 
speed project in Canada. The scope and the nature of the federal 
government's participation are yet to be determined or defined.
<P>
	The House of Commons Standing Committee on Transport 
addressed the question of the role of the federal government in 
high speed rail and reported its findings in March 1992. The 
Member should know that the theme of that whole report was a 
leap of faith.
<P>
	The standing committee's recommendations are to a large 
extent addressed in the many component studies underway 
within the scope of the present study. Once again, these results 
will not be known for some time and the government should 
have all the information at hand prior to deciding on the future 
of high speed rail.
<P>
	Canada's national rail passenger service has undergone many 
changes over the past few years. VIA Rail operations have been 
downsized in order to reduce subsidies. High speed rail is an 
option to improve the quality of service that is presently 
provided by VIA Rail.
<P>
	A decision on the role of the federal government on high 
speed rail should not be made in isolation but would have to be 
addressed in the light of the broader context of the overall 
transportation needs in Canada. Canada's freight railways, CN 
and CP, have incurred substantial financial losses over the past 
10 years. The railways are preparing proposals for the 
consolidation of their networks in Canada and some rail 
rationalization may be inevitable. This does not mean that 
valuable right of way which can be redeveloped for future 
purposes will be forgone. However, it would be beneficial to 
include this aspect in the decision on any high speed rail system.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	As I stated earlier, the creation of jobs is a priority mandate of 
the federal government. A high speed rail project during the 
construction period will create significant employment. We do 
not argue with that. The economic impact study which has yet to 
be completed will quantify the levels that would be generated by 
a high speed rail project.
<P>
	The choice of technology is another area that must be 
identified. As I have indicated, we are looking at more than one 
technology. A high speed rail project will not see the light of day 
without significant contributions from the private sector. The 
motion should not be moved forward without the benefits of the 
study.
<P>
	We are prepared to further discuss this matter once the $6 
million study, paid for by the Canadian taxpayers, is brought 
forward and presented to Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in the House today to speak on Motion No. 112 proposed 
by the hon. member for Joliette.
<P>
	The motion calls for the federal government to authorize the 
construction of a high speed train link between Windsor and 
Quebec City. That is something which has been talked about in 
government circles, not to mention within the transport industry 
itself for many years but to little avail.
<P>
	Before such a rail line could even possibly be seriously 
considered by the federal government, a wide array of important 
details and snags would have to be studied and worked out after 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3004"> 3004 </A></B>
<P>
a long period of planning and public consultation. This is a 
project that could have far reaching ramifications to Canada 
well into the 21st century.
<P>
	Although the good side of the coin is pretty evident for all to 
see, we should first take a good hard look at what some of the 
potential downsides of such a plan might be. I do not believe the 
hon. member's motion really addresses any of the essential 
specifics needed by the House before it could possibly see itself 
as being well enough informed to consider such a complicated 
issue.
<P>
	Transport Canada is presently studying the high speed rail 
issue at length. Until it releases its report on the matter 
tentatively for some time in June, I certainly would not consider 
it wise for this House to blindly approve the sweeping motion 
put forward by the member for Joliette.
<P>
	I understand as this is a private member's motion I am 
speaking on at the moment, it has little chance of successfully 
passing the skeptical eye of government benches. I nevertheless 
feel I have not seen enough by way of concrete information that 
would allow me to support the motion in good faith.
<P>
	At present the motion before us in the House is simply a 
standard motion. It basically says there is something we should 
do and that is about it. There are no details, no dollar figures and 
of course nothing concrete or of an analytical nature.
<P>
	Let us not be mistaken here. Properly constructed, a high 
speed rail line would cost somewhere in the neighbourhood of 
$5 billion to $7 billion. That is a little more than pocket change 
even for free spending members on the other side of the House.
<P>
	The first question I would have to ask the hon. member for 
Joliette is where he would suggest the funding for such a project 
might appear. Is it expected to miraculously materialize out of 
thin air? Or, does the member actually have some ideas in mind 
as to where he would raise the necessary funding for this bold 
and innovative proposal? There is no mention at this point in his 
motion. Quite frankly that concerns me.
<P>
	There have been all sorts of rumours flying of late as to who 
would or should shoulder the burden for such a major 
expenditure. On one hand let me say right now I would be much 
more apt to throw my support behind a high speed rail proposal 
if I had some concrete assurances that the entire multibillion 
dollar cost of such a major undertaking would be handled 
entirely by private industry. Unfortunately I have been hearing a 
number of disconcerting things that would have me believe 
otherwise.
<P>
	The concept of a 50:50 funding split between the private 
sector and various levels of government, including our own here 
in Ottawa has been discussed and certainly has not been ruled 
out. From what I understand this possibly means the federal 
government could be asked to shell out as much as $2.8 billion 
toward the construction of something that sure sounds nice but 
carries the potential of turning into a bottomless money pit.
<P>
	If this $2.8 billion figure is anywhere near accurate and 
truthful as the truth now stands in the mind of the hon. member 
for Joliette then I would strongly suggest it may be time to set 
the alarm bells ringing over this one.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	The arguments that have been floating around in favour of 
publicly funded high speed rail lines are always the same ones 
we end up hearing when requests for government handouts come 
up, something to the effect of ``do not worry, Mr. Prime 
Minister, sure you are putting up a big chunk of money but do 
not be concerned. This is a profitable enterprise and we are 
going to cut you a chunk of the profits''.
<P>
	As charitable and generous to the government as this offer 
may seem at first glance, let us be realistic. In the past so-called 
profitable endeavours the government has been foolish enough 
to get itself into have turned out to be total financial busts more 
often than not. The record of government involvement in the 
sphere of industrial development has been a dismal one as far 
back as most of us can remember.
<P>
	This rotten record speaks for itself and it speaks volumes. 
Ottawa is unable to effectively manage its financial investments 
in the private sector and this will probably never change, nor 
should it.
<P>
	If the high speed train link is supposed to be such a financial 
benefit for the federal government in the long haul with all the 
profit sharing that will take place why let us in on a share of the 
profits in the first place? Certainly it cannot be because private 
business has suddenly become enamoured with the likes of the 
Ottawa political crowd.
<P>
	Considering that the political elites of Ottawa have not had 
the competence to turn an annual budgetary surplus since the 
early 1970s, I would certainly be surprised if any viable industry 
would want to enter into a working partnership with the federal 
government.
<P>
	What could possibly be the justification for government 
participation in this high speed proposal? In short, the crux of 
the issue is very simple. If the rail line is a financially viable 
project then the federal government should give its full 
legislative backing to such a plan, provided there is no fiscal 
component involved. If that is not proven to be fiscally viable, 
why then would the government want to sink any of its 
non-existent money into such a plan? It certainly would be nice 
for us to be the North American pioneers of high speed rail 
transportation. If the logic is not there, neither should the 
taxpayers' money be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3005"> 3005 </A></B>
<P>
	The whole issue of taxpayers' dollars becomes even more 
acute when one considers the potentially far reaching 
ramifications of the upcoming Quebec referendum. If Jacques 
Parizeau and his Parti Quebecois are successful in their next run 
at the voters, as many polls seem to indicate, then we would 
certainly expect to see the whole separatism issue shoot to the 
forefront, a public debate yet again.
<P>
	As unappealing as I personally find this considering my 
preference for a strong and united Canada, we certainly must 
take this situation into account when we examine the possibility 
of assisting any major infrastructure project between Quebec 
City and southern Ontario. As distasteful as this may sound to 
some ostrich-like Liberals with their heads buried in the 
political sand, it stands to reason that the federal government 
should have the common sense to refrain from throwing any 
further multi-billion dollar funding allotments to Quebec until 
such times as the future of that province is settled 
democratically and decisively, hopefully once and for all.
<P>
	Even if the government had wads of money spilling out of its 
coffers at this point, which it certainly does not, there would be 
no sense in undertaking a major high speed rail link, a third of 
which would be located in Quebec, as long as the separatist 
threat continues to loom over the economic and political 
well-being of this great country.
<P>
	As with the citizens across the rest of Canada, voters in 
Quebec are no longer willing to allow their support to be bought 
off with their own taxpayers' dollars. That time has long passed. 
People from the Atlantic to the Pacific are aware that the 
national and provincial treasuries are as bare as the trite 
promises contained in the Liberal's red book. They are no longer 
willing to let their elected representatives throw oodles of their 
own hard earned money at dubious megaprojects, especially 
ones that would be completely lost to Canada in the event of a 
successful Quebec separatist effort.
<P>
	These are the hard facts of the late twentieth century, and 
though they may seem confrontational or narrow minded they 
are not meant to be so. They are simply meant to set out the 
honest truth, alarming and brutal though it may be.
<P>
	I have not arrived at my conclusions lightly, nor have I arrived 
at them without significant consultation with other various 
official sources within the transportation sector. This includes 
extensive and recent meetings with representatives from 
Bombardier, the Quebec based company hopefully planning to 
receive a significant chunk of any contractual work which would 
arrive out of this high speed link.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	Despite the admittedly optimistic outlook of Bombardier 
officials I am afraid past experience has shown Canadian people 
that their politicians should look a little more before they leap. 
That is precisely what I am  attempting to do now by avoiding 
making hasty commitments to this very shaky concept. As such I 
find I am unable to support the motion made by the hon. member 
for Joliette.
<P>
	The homework has not yet been done. I believe the proposal 
for a high speed train line, though intriguing, is simply too much 
too soon at this point in time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I would like to say that Quebecers who are listening to us, 
and also some Canadians, must be convinced, when they hear 
comments such as those coming from the Reform Party, that 
Quebec should become sovereign. I thank the Reform members 
for behaving in such a way, because they are helping our cause.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank you for allowing me 
to support my colleague from Joliette who moved this motion in 
the House, by asking him to demand that the government take 
the required measures to authorize the construction of a 
high-speed train linking Quebec City and Windsor.
<P>
	As early as February 1, I had the opportunity to address this 
House and explain why the government should implement this 
project as soon as possible. I was recently followed by the youth 
wing of the Quebec Liberal Party, which is determined to 
pressure the Johnson administration to hold to it. That same 
federalist youth wing tabled this resolution at the policy 
conference of the Quebec Liberal Party in Montreal in March. 
The leader of the Parti Quebecois, Jacques Parizeau, often asked 
the former premier of Quebec, Robert Bourassa, to put this 
project forward as an economic recovery tool. I am telling you 
all this because the implementation of the HST in the Quebec 
City-Windsor corridor has almost universal support in Quebec. 
To be convinced of that, you simply have to look at the 1991 
report of the Task Force on the Quebec-Ontario High-Speed 
Train, co-chaired by the honourable Rémi Bujold, the former 
member of Parliament for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	I know that the government is expecting a report by this 
summer, which will make comparisons between competitive 
technologies. However, this is a question of form, not of 
substance. I am sure that the report which will be presented to 
the Minister of Transport will indicate a strong desire to go 
ahead with the HST and will suggest several ways to do so. 
Recently the dollar has been in a free fall while interest rates 
have been rising-we cannot know how high they will go-and 
the stock market has been very volatile.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3006"> 3006 </A></B>
<P>
	In these circumstances, it would be easy to criticize the 
Minister of Finance for not having reduced our deficit. It would 
be easy to criticize the Governor of the Bank of Canada for 
having allowed a rise in interest rates. It would also be easy to 
ask the government to review its borrowing policy on foreign 
markets in order to protect ourselves from the fickleness of 
foreign investors from all parts of the world. But, Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are worried and in need of a leader, of a government 
which will restore their self-confidence, a government which 
will give them hope in a better economic future in the short term, 
with an extraordinary venture, the construction of a high-speed 
train.
<P>
	Why such a train? The government claims that it is ready to 
provide venture capital to promote high-tech industry, but are 
these empty promises? What is it waiting for to give the go 
ahead to the HST project? In two years it will be too late. The 
Americans will have forged ahead, depriving us of any hopes of 
winning contracts for high speed lines. We will not be able to 
export $200 billion worth of technology over the next 10 or 12 
years. At stake are many value-added jobs as well as our 
competitive edge in the high tech transportation field.
<P>
	Why a high speed train? Because it will travel a corridor more 
than 1,200 kilometres long. It means more than 120,000 jobs 
over a 10-year period.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	A high speed train will allow municipalities in the corridor to 
build the infrastructure necessary for the economic 
development of their citizens and will give them hope for a 
better future for their children. This venture, worth some $7.5 
billion, will be the highlight of this last decade, a landmark 
future generations will remember about the 20th century in 
Canada.
<P>
	When I have the opportunity to meet people from all walks of 
life in my riding of Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, the 
same two issues keep cropping up: the fears of seniors and the 
exasperation of our youth with our generation.
<P>
	Let us look at the fears of seniors. They are concerned about 
developing our country, educating the next generation, 
establishing in our society all the required structures for 
education, hospital and other health services, transportation, 
environmental protection and good quality of life in general. 
Ten years ago, these people were not worried about their future, 
they believed the next generation would take care of them and 
they would reap what they had sowed a hundredfold. But as soon 
as they meet with economic difficulties, all governments, 
including the one in place, ask seniors to pay the bill.
<P>
	Let us look now at young people, those who dreamed of a 
better world, those who worked hard to acquire a specialty and 
university degrees, those who were promised a leisure society in 
the year 2000, those who are presently discouraged, jobless and 
frustrated because  they see the previous generation-our 
generation-enjoying conditions they will never be able to 
obtain. We have to give them faith in and hope for a brighter 
future. We must leave them something besides an accumulated 
debt of $500 billion. We must show them that we were daring 
and that we left them with big projects and the opportunity to 
develop them in the years to come.
<P>
	The HST project is exciting, visionary and affordable. 
Affordable in the long run if we learn to expand it according to 
our means; affordable because each dollar invested will create 
real jobs for the long term, not temporary employment like the 
municipal infrastructure program.
<P>
	Railway companies are less and less interested in operating 
regional lines. They would rather be travel wholesalers 
operating only the main lines. After studying the situation in 
several countries like Italy, Germany, Japan and the United 
States, we concluded that rail transportation is a state 
responsibility almost everywhere. Decisions on operation and 
expansion are always taken by government, which is also 
involved directly in construction and financing either through 
subsidies or loan guarantees.
<P>
	There would be nothing wrong with following the same model 
used for the bridge between Prince Edward Island and New 
Brunswick, which will be done with the help of the private 
sector and some generous subsidies from the federal 
government. As for the environment, it is interesting to know 
that, even when running at 300 kilometres an hour, the HST uses 
close to half as much energy as a car and four times less than 
passenger jet aircraft.
<P>
	The HST would not cause air emissions and would use a type 
of energy that is abundant in Ontario and in Quebec. Following 
the cancellation of the agreement with New York State, these 
provinces have an enormous electrical potential to support this 
new transportation mode. Besides, this means of transportation 
is not so new since most big North American cities used this type 
of energy for their transit from the 1900s to the 1950s. There is 
no need to reinvent the wheel, our ancestors left us everything 
we need. Now, all we have to do is demonstrate a willingness to 
innovate in a transportation corridor that presents many 
opportunities.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	Finally, I strongly urge this House to adopt the motion 
presented by my colleague from Joliette and to demand that the 
government rule immediately on its substance, in other words to 
give the go ahead to the HST, subject to a review of the terms and 
conditions which will be presented to the Minister of Transport 
in June.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to make a brief remark before I start my 
speech on the TGV.
<P>
	Goodness knows I am a federalist and I am a deeply 
committed Canadian. I feel very differently from the people 
across the way in the Bloc Quebecois. At the same time I would 
be less than truthful if I did not feel hurt as a resident of Quebec, 
as a citizen of Quebec, by some of the remarks made by the 
member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke.
<P>
	I do not believe extreme statements about any part of the 
country, whether it be Quebec, the west or Atlantic Canada, help 
Canadian unity. I have always believed in constructive dialogue. 
We are adversaries at times. At the same time I do not think that 
loud and extreme statements help.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to address today the motion presented by the hon. 
member from Joliette that the government should immediately 
authorize the construction of a high-speed rail service between 
Quebec City and Windsor.
<P>
	Before stating the government's position on the motion, I 
would like to provide some background information which will 
assist in understanding our response to the motion put forward 
by the hon. member for Joliette.
<P>
	In November 1991 the federal Minister of Transport of the 
day, along with the ministers of transport from Quebec and 
Ontario announced a joint study of the feasibility of operating a 
high-speed train service in the corridor between Quebec City 
and Windsor where the prospects for viability are surely the 
highest in Canada. This study was to take between 18 and 24 
months to complete, at a cost of $6 million to be shared equally 
among the three governments.
<P>
	The decision to conduct the study was based upon the 
recommendations of a joint Quebec-Ontario task force report 
released in May 1991 which examined the merits of high speed 
rail service in the corridor. This task force was created by the 
premiers of Quebec and Ontario in 1989.
<P>
	The task force concluded that a final decision on whether to 
proceed with a high speed train project could not be made 
without undertaking a more detailed study covering such areas 
as traffic forecasts, routing, available technologies, 
environmental issues and funding alternatives by the private 
sector and the three governments. The report also recommended 
that the Government of Canada should be an active participant 
in this new study.
<P>
	So, in keeping with these recommendations, the federal 
government agreed to participate with Ontario and Quebec in 
undertaking this more detailed work.
<P>
	Based on the foregoing, the objective of this feasibility study 
is to recommend whether governments should initiate and/or 
support the development of high-speed rail service in the 
Quebec City-Windsor corridor.
<P>
	The study is based on a review of representative technologies 
which would operate over various routes. Six such technologies 
are currently under consideration. The study enables realistic 
projections of impacts, including revenues and costs, to be 
evaluated and involves the participation of some thirty 
consultants on various aspects of the analysis. Obviously, we are 
talking about a very serious examination.
<P>
	The study was initially scheduled for completion in the fall of 
1993 but has been delayed as a result of the magnitude and 
complexity of the work. I should point out, however, that the 
study is still within its original $6-million budget, which, as I 
said, is shared equally between the three governments. The 
present schedule provides for the completion of a draft final 
report a few months from now.
<P>
	As we are just coming out of a recession, we are faced with 
very high unemployment. Owing to high deficits, governments 
will want to ensure that projects will not require large amount of 
public funds. It could be argued, on the surface, that the 
implementation of a high-speed rail service would be a major 
initiative for considerable job creation and a major economic 
stimulus. The results of the economic impact studies will give 
an idea of how many jobs could be created by such a project.
<P>
	The jobs would not be created in the short term, however. 
Should this project be approved, it would require at least several 
years of detailed environmental studies and assessments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government is faced with another reality which has been 
addressed by the Minister of Finance in a recently tabled budget, 
namely the deficit and the question of deficit reduction.
<P>
	The government has demonstrated for the benefit of all 
Canadians its commitment to deficit reduction in the budget. We 
must address the unemployment problem in a constructive 
fashion. Care must be exercised in ensuring that any potential 
job creation initiatives will not have an adverse impact on the 
deficit but, on the contrary, should be such as to result in a 
steady reduction of both our deficit and national debt.
<P>
	The benefit, cost and financial analysis will only be known at 
the completion of the study which as I mentioned previously 
will not be available for some months. Therefore it would not be 
appropriate to speculate on the results and to precipitate a 
decision as tabled by the hon. member for Joliette.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3008"> 3008 </A></B>
<P>
	It is obvious that for a national government any decision on 
the potential of a high speed rail service must be examined in the 
light of the broader context of the overall transportation needs in 
Canada of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore a decision of the potential of a high speed rail 
service should be examined in light of the broader context of the 
overall transportation needs in Canada, as I mentioned earlier. 
High-speed rail service has gained prominence throughout the 
world. France, Sweden, Spain, Italy and Japan are some of the 
countries that have benefited from the introduction of high 
speed rail services.
<P>
	While recognizing the very obvious merits of such 
technology, we should be cautious and not jump to the 
conclusion that high speed rail service could have similar results 
in Canada, at least not until the review now under way is 
completed. Conditions that exist in Canada such as climate, 
demographics, intermodal competition, and the institutional 
and regulatory environment are all real concerns and could 
determine whether a high-speed rail service is viable or not.
<P>
	Much closer to us, all attempts to initiate a high-speed rail 
service in the United States have failed. The most promising, 
namely the Texas project, has failed to raise the required private 
funding.
<P>
	At the present time, it appears that only one high-speed train 
project will proceed in the United States. That is the Northeast 
corridor project between Washington, New York and Boston. 
The success of this project depends, to a great extent, on major 
government subsidies.
<P>
	The difficulties encountered in the United States are a 
valuable lesson that we should not ignore and provide a further 
incentive to proceed carefully only once we have all of the 
information needed to make a sound decision.
<P>
	While we treat the initiative proposed by the hon. member for 
Joliette with all the objectivity and seriousness it deserves, and 
we think it should be considered objectively and seriously, I 
believe that it would be wise and appropriate to wait to review 
this matter until the joint study has been completed. It would be 
totally irresponsible to rush into a project of this magnitude 
without taking the time to review it from every angle.
