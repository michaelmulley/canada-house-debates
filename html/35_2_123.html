	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour 
to rise in the House today to thank the captain and crew of the 
HMCS <I>Athabaskan</I> for their warm welcome during my two day 
stay on board this week.
<P>
	The HMCS <I>Athabaskan</I>, captained by Commander Denis 
Rouleau, is a 5,120 tonne Iroquois class destroyer which serves as 
the Atlantic task group command ship. It has an array of 
anti-missile defences, including state of the art SM-2 stand 
missiles. It can carry two Sea King helicopters, is a completely 
bilingual unit and can carry a crew of up to 280 souls.
<P>
	The level of excellence, the level of professionalism, the level of 
general quality which emanates from the captain and crew is 
worthy of great pride and respect by all Canadians.
<P>
	It is with great appreciation and pride that, if I were wearing one, 
I would take off my hat to HMCS <I>Athabaskan</I> today for a job well 
done.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal government promised to be transparent; now it is hiding 
even the most insignificant information.
<P>
	Last week, the Bloc Quebecois tried to find out from Heritage 
Canada the cost of operation <I>Take It to Heart</I>, an initiative to 
highlight Canadian citizenship.
<P>
	At the minister's office, we were told this information could only 
be obtained under the Access to Information Act. Obtaining 
information from Heritage Canada has never been easy, and the 
lengthy response times testify to that.
<P>
	What does the government have to hide that it will not provide 
basic information that should be available through a simple 
telephone call?
<P>
	If the government sees fit to hide this kind of information, it is 
no wonder that it does so for more serious and complex issues, such 
as Somalia, Airbus and Pearson Airport.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, most Canadians believe it is not possible to commit 
murder and get away with it. Unfortunately, this is not the case.
<P>
	Susan Klassen was killed by her estranged husband. She was 
killed by strangulation. Her killer choked her so hard that he 
bruised both thumbs and then used a pillow case to finish the job.
<P>
	Susan Klassen's killer will be eligible for full parole in less than 
two years. How is it that our society values Susan Klassen's life so 
little that her killer is released in just two years?
<P>
	Susan Klassen was betrayed by the very justice system pledged 
to protect her. Her killer was able to claim provocation and the 
charge was reduced to manslaughter. How could cold blooded 
murder by strangulation possibly be considered manslaughter?
<P>
	Did Susan Klassen deserve to die because her husband's feelings 
were hurt?
<P>
	Legislators have a responsibility to Susan Klassen and to her 
family to ensure such a travesty will never happen again. 
Parliament must send a signal to the judiciary. Canadians have zero 
tolerance for family violence.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, a year 
and a half ago the Yukon community was saddened by the death of 
Susan Klassen who was strangled and killed by her husband. He 
was found not guilty of murder and was sentenced for the lesser 
crime of manslaughter and could be eligible for day parole in a 
year.
<P>
	In a matter of days, 900 people in the Yukon signed petitions 
demanding an appeal of the case. Another 300 gathered for a 
protest march in minus 40 degree weather. I understand there were 
1,200 letters sent from Edmonton where Ms. Klassen's family 
resides and many other requests for action have been received.
<P>
	The community outrage at the sentence resulted in an 
unprecedented mobilization for two demands. The first asks the 
Minister of Justice to obtain a second legal opinion to ascertain 
whether there are grounds for an appeal. The second calls for 
changes to the Criminal Code to amend the statutory defence of 
provocation.
<P>
	I ask the minister to seriously review these requests and respond 
to them publicly.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTHCARE">HEALTH CARE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
people of Canada elected a Liberal government to protect our much 
valued health care system. It is for this reason our government 
convened the National Forum on Health to propose solutions to the 
challenges that our health care system will face in the 21st century.
<P>
	I would like to report to the House that the residents of York 
North played an active role in the national forum's work. We held a 
town hall forum on health and a number of meetings to develop 
solid suggestions to respond to the strains of rising health care 
costs and an aging population within our fiscal framework.
<P>
	Our conclusions were clear and straightforward. In order for 
Canadians to take greater responsibility for their health, they need 
better access to accurate information. Furthermore, participants 
called upon the federal government to preserve and enhance the 
publicly funded elements of our universal health care network and 
uphold the principles of the Canada Health Act. I am pleased to tell 
the House that these suggestions are reflected in the forum's final 
report ``Building on the Legacy''.
<P>
	The residents of York North are firm believers of the public 
consultation process. They have seen historically their suggestions 
become government policy.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANCITIZENSHIP">CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the aftermath of the second world war a Canadian 
cabinet minister visited the graves of Canadian soldiers who 
perished at the battle of Dieppe. Paul Martin Sr. decided then and 
there that Canadians fully deserved their own unique citizenship.
<P>
	Today we celebrate the foresight of the father of our Minister of 
Finance for he was the political father of the Canadian Citizenship 
Act.
<P>
	Many new Canadians and members of Parliament, such as 
myself, were born in other countries and have become citizens of 
this great country. Canadian citizenship is a sought after prize 
among people born in other countries where civil rights are limited 
or non-existent. It formally guarantees freedom of religion, 
expression and lawful assembly, and freedom from discrimination 
on the basis of gender, ethnic origin or disability.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	It is an honour to rise in this House today to commemorate the 
50th anniversary of the Canadian Citizenship Act.

	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday in Washington, D.C. a three-day world 
microcredit summit came to a close. Three thousand delegates 
from around the world took part in this historic event. Through 
promotion of microcredit policies, organizers hope to reach 100 
million of the world's poorest families, especially the women of 
those families, with credit for self-employment.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to attend this summit as a member of the 
Council of Parliamentarians. I firmly believe that microcredit can 
be used as a powerful tool in the struggle to end poverty and 
economic dependency both in underdeveloped and industrialized 
countries.
<P>
	I want to congratulate the efforts of Results Canada and 
particularly the members of Results Canada in my riding of 
Annapolis Valley-Hants for their work in promoting microcredit 
lending. I want to call upon our government to promote the 
microcredit concept as an important means of eliminating poverty 
and creating opportunities for a sustainable future.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in a report on human rights recently released by the 
U.S. State Department, Quebec received high marks for respecting 
the rights of its minorities.
<P>
	According to Washington, since the 1995 referendum, the 
Quebec government has clearly been striving to curb political 
tensions while reaffirming the important role played by the 
anglophone minority in Quebec society. Such statements sound 
infinitely more realistic and reasonable than the wild imaginings 
conveyed by federalist spokespersons these past few months.
<P>
	Let us hope that, for once, our colleagues opposite will be able to 
set their fear-driven politicking aside and read this major U.S. 
report carefully. They will probably realize that their hysteria of the 
past few months has doing nothing to further the debate and has 
simply clouded their vision. Perhaps if they came to their senses, 
we could finally have constructive talks and eventually establish a 
new partnership between our two peoples.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bob Fowler and 
his family go way back with the Prime Minister and the Liberal 
Party. It all started in the seventies when young Fowler was a 
protégé of the Prime Minister's friends, Mitchell Sharp and Pierre 
Trudeau. During this time he got to know the little guy from 
Shawinigan. He has known him ever since.
<P>
	Moreover, Bob Fowler's sister married another good friend and 
patronage appointee of the Prime Minister, Roméo LeBlanc, the 
Governor General of Canada. Let us not forget Mr. Fowler's wife 
who was a senior bureaucrat in the office of another friend of the 
PM, André Ouellet, who was the Minister of Foreign Affairs until 
he also got his Liberal patronage plum as head of the post office.
<P>
	Then it was Fowler's turn. Just when the Somalia affair 
threatened to engulf him, whoosh, he was swept off to become 
ambassador of the UN thanks to the Prime Minister's patronage.
<P>
	I do not think the Prime Minister is fooling anyone. He protected 
his friend from the Somalia affair and on that the record it is very 
clear.

	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to draw the attention of the members of this House to some good 
news for the Montreal region. On January 21, the Multimédia 
CESAM consortium, of which the Government of Canada has been 
a partner since the very beginning, announced the creation of the 
Bell Mediasphere, in Montreal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada occupies an important place in the multimedia market 
which is an area of tremendous growth. This project will reaffirm 
Montreal's position as a leader in this area.

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
take this opportunity to mention another strategic initiative on the 
part of our government.
<P>
	On January 31, the Minister responsible for the Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec announced in Montreal that five 
partnership agreements had been reached with five different 
financial institutions.
<P>
	These agreements will result in the setting up of loan programs 
to provide better access to financing for small and medium size 
businesses in the new economy, which are the ones that best reflect 
the future of our country. A total of $150 million will be made 
available to Quebec's technology based businesses.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	Our government just fulfilled another commitment made to 
entrepreneurs in this country, namely to provide them with better 
means to ensure their own growth and to create long term jobs for 
all Canadians.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Premier Bouchard has reneged on his solemn promise that 
language would not become a health issue.
<P>
	Quebec law directs regional health boards to review access plans 
to health and social services across the province. Qualified French 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7708"> 7708 </A></B>
<P>
and English experts determine health services that are required to 
adequately  serve all Quebecers. There is no legal or moral reason 
to refer this matter to the Office de la langue française, for 
language is a diagnostic and therapeutic tool.
<P>
	This is pure political harassment that has sparked a new wave of 
protest and deep concern within the English speaking community, 
justified concern. The level of distrust has rightly reached new 
heights.
<P>
	Premier Bouchard, when you ask for trust, your actions belie 
your words. The paramount issue here is not the language of work 
but the right to the language of treatment.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in his last report, the auditor general pointed out that 
Correctional Services is not achieving its objective of ensuring the 
satisfactory reintegration throughout the country of offenders who 
pose a threat to the long term safety of the public.
<P>
	In this same document, we learn that there are no caseload 
standards for case management officers, the people who must give 
an opinion to parole board commissioners on whether or not to 
release an offender, leaving the auditor general to conclude that 
``initial training for case management officers is inadequate''.
<P>
	For three years now, the Bloc Quebecois has been calling for an 
overhaul of Correctional Services. How can the Liberal 
government claim to be looking after public safety, when it is 
giving more attention to punishing offenders than to finding 
solutions?

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians across the country have been voicing increasing concern 
about the proposed changes relating to child maintenance 
enforcement.
<P>
	The changes make non-custodial parents, usually men, solely 
responsible for supporting children of divorce. The amounts these 
parents will be forced to pay will rise steeply and will have to be 
paid out of after tax dollars regardless of the financial resources of 
the custodial parent.
<P>
	The bill is absolutely silent on the equally important issue of the 
right of non-custodial parents to have access to their children, 
access that is critical to the emotional stability and well-being of 
Canadian children of divorce.
<P>
	This bill has been strongly criticized as rigid, unfair, 
scapegoating men, increasing stress on families and not in the best 
interests of children.
<P>
	On behalf of the tremendous number of people who are speaking 
out against these proposed maintenance enforcement provisions, I 
urge this government to listen to their concerns and make important 
changes to Bill C-41.

	Today, I am pleased to inform you that a Quebec City institution 
has returned from the Team Canada tour with an interesting

<P>
	The Collège technique Aviron de Québec, which employs 25 
teachers, offers college level courses in computer repair, 
electronics and computer assisted design. The college signed a 
contract with a company in Bangkok to set up a technical college in 
Thailand. This contract will generate estimated revenues of $1.5 
million in the coming years.

instrumental in opening up new markets for Quebec businesses 
emphasizing exports and, of course, Canadian know-how.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PERSONALINCOMETAX">PERSONAL INCOME TAX</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I shall be very brief. Today, the Bloc Quebecois released 
its analysis of the federal personal income tax system. There has 
been no real examination of the Canadian tax system for over 30 
years. It would, however, be easy for the Minister of Finance to 
increase the equity of the Canadian tax system and to recover cash  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7709"> 7709 </A></B>
<P>
from numerous tax shelters which are costing us dearly at a time 
when no one is having an easy time of it.
<P>
	At a time when the government is squeezing the unemployed, 
cutting transfer payments, hunting for money everywhere, how can 
the Minister of Finance provide us with any serious explanation for 
the fact that, in three and a half years, he has not found a way to 
systematically assess personal tax expenditures in Canada, 
particularly those of rich taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the Leader of the Opposition will understand that I have only just 
learned of his report and am therefore not in a position to comment 
on it. The hon. member must be aware that, since coming into 
power, we have studied the taxation system in depth. Moreover, as 
he knows, our study will be ongoing, since the taxation system is 
constantly evolving.
<P>
	I have before me a list, which I could read out, at least three 
pages long, of tax shelters we have done away with in order to 
make the taxation system more equitable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, is the Minister of Finance for Canada not concerned by 
the fact that, with the services of a tax specialist with any skill at 
all, many rich taxpayers in Canada manage to avoid paying a red 
cent? Is he not troubled by this, as Minister of Finance, if he has 
any concern for equity whatsoever?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member must realize that the federal taxation system bears 
a great resemblance to the provincial tax systems, including that of 
the province of Quebec. I would be greatly interested to learn how 
my counterpart, Mr. Landry, reacted to the previous Bloc 
Quebecois report. I saw no public comments.
<P>
	As for myself, I can state that it was the federal government 
which abolished the lifetime $100,000 capital gains exemption. It 
was the federal government which broadened the minimum 
replacement tax base. It was the federal government which did 
away with the tax advantages offered by the use of trusts. I could go 
on and list many more. We have made a good deal of progress in 
three years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance is offering me a great opportunity 
here. He knows very well that, as long as Quebec is not a sovereign 
country, the Quebec Minister of Finance, like those in the other 
provinces, is required to harmonize his taxation system with what 
the federal minister decides on. When Quebec is sovereign, things 
will no longer be the same. For the moment, we are stuck with him. 
I profoundly regret bringing partisan politics into this, as I did not 
intend to, but I have to remind him of an unfortunate reality.
<P>
	From 1984 to 1993, 1,500 Canadians earning in excess of 
$100,000 paid not a red cent in tax. In 1993, the  Conservatives' 
last year, there were 2,230 Canadians earning in excess of $100,000 
who paid not a red cent in taxes, and in 1994, the last year for which 
there are statistics-and this is my question for the Minister of 
Finance-what is his reaction to the fact that 4,260 Canadians paid 
not a red cent in taxes on earnings of over $100,000?
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance not consider that this would be 
worthy of his attention, and ought to have received it a long time 
ago?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member knows full well that the main reason certain rich 
individuals paid no income tax is the existence of that $100,000 
capital gains exemption. That is the loophole we closed when we 
came into power.
<P>
	Secondly, the hon. member refers to the situation of Quebec and 
the federal government. Representatives of the Quebec 
commission on taxation and the funding of public services have 
stated the following: ``Overall, there is little difference between 
taxable income for federal income tax purposes and for Quebec 
income tax purposes''. They went on to say: ``Since March, we on 
the commission have learned that there is no hidden tax treasure we 
can unearth anywhere in Quebec''. The same holds true for Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I would like to say to the Minister of Finance 
that although there may be no hidden treasure, there certainly is a 
small part of the Canadian population that has its hand in the till.
<P>
	For three and a half years we have been asking the Minister of 
Finance to cut down on all these corporate tax loopholes. But the 
Minister of Finance keeps repeating the same old story: We are 
engaged in a process in the course of which we have improved the 
situation. For two years he has waved those three pages containing 
a list of the loopholes he closed. I would ask the Minister of 
Finance to table those pages for the benefit of the House. Let him 
table them. We would like to see them.
<P>
	Second, as far as the tax system-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know the question is on its way. The member 
will please get to the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> I was getting to my question. He did nothing for 
individual taxpayers either.
<P>
	Here is my first question for the Minister of Finance. Would the 
minister agree that by making sweeping changes in the corporate 
tax system, as the Bloc suggested last November, he could collect 
as much as $3 billion which he could use to create thousands of 
jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if 
the hon. member wants me to, I would be delighted to table the list 
of all the loopholes we put in  place. It is too bad we have to table 
them for the hon. member to see what they are. Since we did this 
for every budget, I would have thought the hon. member, being the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7710"> 7710 </A></B>
<P>
opposition finance critic, would know about these loopholes. In 
any case, we will table them.
<P>
	Meanwhile, I would like to congratulate the hon. member on the 
start of his campaign for Mr. Duhaime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> I want to 
thank the Minister of Finance for the publicity he gave my 
candidate for the leadership. He is a great man for the job.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance actually said, actually referred to the tax 
loopholes he put in place. Just imagine. He produced these tax 
loopholes and that is the problem: he did nothing about it. In three 
months and a half, with a small team, the Bloc Quebecois did what 
he failed to do in three and a half years. That is a fact.
<P>
	I have a second question. Regarding the changes in personal 
income tax, is the Minister of Finance prepared to give serious 
thought to a proposal by the Bloc Quebecois for creating a kind of 
employment RRSP to help people who are unemployed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first I would like to correct a mistake. Obviously, we closed the tax 
loopholes on this three-page list, and we intend to table those 
pages.
<P>
	Meanwhile, we have introduced many measures to help people 
save. For instance, I was told, since I did not have a chance to read 
it, that in its report the Bloc Quebecois mentioned ways of helping 
students. The hon. member should know that we are well ahead of 
the Bloc Quebecois in this respect.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	For instance, in our last budgets we increased the education 
credit from $80 to $100 per month; we raised the limit on the 
transfer of tuition fees to those who are paying for a student's 
education from $4,000 to $5,000 per student; we raised the annual

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the Liberals came to power in 1993, the Prime 
Minister made a commitment to high ethical standards that would 
guarantee the integrity of his government.
<P>
	On November 6, 1996 he said: ``I have guidelines for ministerial 
conduct which have been transmitted to the ministers. They have 
read them and they follow them''.
<P>
	We are wondering what kind of ethical guidelines would allow 
denial of the broken GST promise, political interference in the 
Somalia inquiry, the use of the justice department for a political 
witch hunt and the stonewalling of the inquiry into tainted blood.
<P>
	Do any of these activities violate the Prime Minister's ethical 
standards, or by his standards are all these activities ethically 
acceptable?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we formed a government three years and two months ago. 
The ministers have shown that the government is a government that 
is very ethical and respects all the norms. No ministers were 
involved in any scandals of any nature.
<P>
	In political debate we may have differences, but to tackle this 
very negative approach by the Reform Party, as it was published 
Monday morning in the Toronto <I>Star</I>, that it will be only negative, 
is a big contrast with the promise he made when he became the 
leader that he was to have the highest standards in this House.
<P>
	I know they want to do everything, even have the people in the 
gallery to protest, people ready to go in the scrum and say they are 
journalists.
<P>
	On top of that, I learned this morning that to succeed in that, the 
leader of the third party is trying to become an actor. He has hired 
somebody to train him how to look mad when he is not mad.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in 1991 the Prime Minister did proclaim one of his ethical 
guidelines. He promised that every minister in his cabinet would 
assume full responsibility for any bungling in their departments.
<P>
	How is letting the defence minister gag the Somalia inquiry 
assuming full responsibility? How is letting the justice minister go 
on a political witch hunt with the justice department assuming full 
responsibility? How is the Prime Minister's promising to scrap the 
GST and denying the promise was made assuming full 
responsibility for the commitment?
<P>
	When the Prime Minister promised to hold his ministers 
responsible for any bungling, did he mean what he said or was this 
just another empty promise like killing the GST?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not a witch hunt. The leader of the third party has 
been taking lessons from someone so he could act in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence has given until the month of 
June to finish the inquiry. There were three extensions before. The 
minister of defence has explained very well the reason why. What 
is very surprising is that he is just responding to the request of the 
leader of the third party, urging us to terminate it quickly so that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7711"> 7711 </A></B>
<P>
there  will be no inquiry during an election. We are doing exactly 
what he is asking.
<P>
	Why would the man who is talking about integrity say that in 
October and today say exactly the contrary to what he said at that 
time?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we want truth before the election.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's vague and confusing answers on ethical 
questions lead many of us to believe that there are no ethical 
guidelines.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	Time and time again we have asked the Prime Minister to table 
those guidelines in the House and he has not done so. Perhaps, like 
his homeless friends, they are imaginary or maybe they got caught 
in the shredder somewhere. When he and Mr. Mitchell went up on 
the mountain perhaps they forgot to bring down one of the tablets, 
the one about accountability, integrity and responsibility.
<P>
	How can Canadians trust the Prime Minister to enforce ethical 
standards for his government when the Prime Minister will not let 
the public see those ethical guidelines?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, speaking about integrity, what about the Reform Party's 
question period strategy which I read about in yesterday's<I> Toronto 
Star</I>, asking negative and accusatory questions, coaching Reform 
sympathizers to take part in media scrum, causing disturbance in 
public galleries, disrupting royal assent in other places. What 
happened to the Reform Party pledge to do politics differently?
<P>
	I have never seen a party use and abuse an institution to try to 
move up in the polls. This is something I know will not succeed.

the Minister of Health.
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Minister of Health intimated that he is

legitimate concerns of the organizers of sporting and cultural 
events.

fine and the commission can have all the time it needs. Now he 
says that it is good enough and it will just be shut down. This 
government and this defence minister have castrated the 
commission. It is as simple as that. They have cut it off. They 
have not allowed it to do its work. This Prime Minister knows 
full well that it is not able to get to the post-deployment phase, 
which it thought it was going to have time to do.
<P>

	We need to hear from witnesses like Major Buonamici and Barry

Fowler be forced to testify?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and

I am sure that the people to whom the hon. member has referred are 
more than available to come before the commission if, in the

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
ignoring Canada's historical positions on culture and ignoring his 
own party's promise in the red book assuring Canadians that the 
Liberals would defend culture, the Minister for International Trade 
last week called into question all of Canada's cultural protection 
measures over the years. In the meantime, however, the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage said that the cultural exemption was a vital part 
of international trade agreements.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. With the remarks of his 
Minister for International Trade, it is a  grave moment for Quebec's 
and Canada's cultural sovereignty, and the Prime Minister cannot 
remain silent. He must respond. Which of his two ministers 
represents his government's position? The one he made responsible 
for culture or the one ready to fritter culture away.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there has been no change in government policy. 
Certainly the government wants to continue to promote Canadian 
culture both in the domestic sense and on the international stage. In 
fact, over the last few years Canada's exports in terms of its 
cultural sector have grown enormously. It is now a $3 billion 
industry.
<P>

respect to how we go about continuing in our promotion of culture, 
particularly in the context of trade and globalization.
<P>

together to ensure that the government continues to promote the 
cultural product of this country, of all parts of this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to find out whether the government is on the same 
wavelength. I would remind you of the 1994 Tassé report, because 
all recent commissions agree on the need for cultural protection 
and funding of cultural development.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage says she will appeal the 
decision of the World Trade Organization in the matter of <I>Sports

	Air Canada's 900 regional pilots, whose collective agreement

opportunity to give you an update on the situation.
<P>
	As he rightly pointed out, from the outset the federal mediation 
and conciliation service provided assistance to the parties to try to 
achieve a negotiated settlement. Federal mediation and conciliation 
officials are still working at it as we speak. They are trying to get 
the parties to at least come back to the bargaining table and look for 
a solution.

	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and

federal insurance policy, which covers at least 30,000 federal 
public servants in Quebec, offers more than the minimums required 
by the Quebec legislation for 98 per cent of those insured.
<P>
	Our policy covers a wider range of drugs. It includes medical 
items such as glasses, which are not covered under Quebec's health 
insurance plan. Our deductibles are also lower.

	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given that 
the vast majority of employers and insurers in Quebec have already

people, including retired public servants and their family

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and

false to say that keeping our policy unchanged adversely affects

independent third party to do an audit of those improvements and 
let us know whether we have done enough.
<P>
	That is the approach we have taken to this problem and it reflects 
ministerial responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is clear the 
justice minister bungled this case. He could have stopped this 
action by withdrawing the letter on which the $50 million lawsuit 
was based. He chose not to do it.
<P>
	The million dollar Airbus deal was designed to protect the 
reputations of the justice minister, the solicitor general and Brian 
Mulroney. The justice minister apologized to Mr. Mulroney. Is he 
now prepared to apologize to the Canadian taxpayers for the 
needless waste of millions of their dollars?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am the first to acknowledge 
because I am the minister responsible that the procedure put in 
place 11 years ago had its shortcomings. It has now been fixed.
<P>
	The hon. member refers to accountability and responsibility. I 
want to remind the hon. member that he and his colleagues in the 
Reform Party are accountable as well. They are required to act 
responsibly.
<P>
	Earlier today in question period the leader of the Reform Party in 
a question to the Prime Minister referred to my use of the justice 
department for a political witch hunt. I want the hon. member and 
his leader to know that if they know anything, if they have any 
allegation against me to justify the assertion that I used the justice 
department in a political witch hunt then they should put it on the 
record. They are accountable and if they use that kind of 
irresponsible language without something to show for it, they will 
be held responsible when we go to the people.
<P>
	In vernacular I hope the hon. member will understand, on that 
account he ought to put up or shut up.

	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health. Tobacco lobbyists are telling 
young people who work in variety stores that they will be fired if 
Bill C-71 is passed. The Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council 
is distributing information alleging that anyone under 18 years of 
age will lose his or her job in a corner store under the new 
anti-tobacco law.
<P>
	Can the minister put an end to the tobacco lobby fearmongering 
and assure young Canadians that this legislation will not take away 
their jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for the question. He is quite correct. A lot 
of misinformation is being put out concerning the contents of Bill 
C-71. The hon. member knows this information is inaccurate and 
the claims people are suggesting are absolutely false.
<P>
	I wish the record to be clarified and I thank the hon. member for 
the question. Yes, retailers will be able to continue to hire persons 
under the age of 18 to sell tobacco products.

	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. In the last election 
campaign the Liberal Party promised to create jobs and, in fact, 
was given a mandate to create jobs. Three years later the 
unemployment rate is still at 10 per cent and there are over a 
million and a half Canadians unemployed.
<P>
	In her heart does the Deputy Prime Minister believe the promise 
to create jobs has been fulfilled? Can she indicate whether she can 
feel the pain and anguish of unemployed Canadians not being able 
to pay rent or to put food on the table? If she does, what does she 
intend to do-

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

clear to the hon. member, who was a part of the government for 
most of that period, that during the period in question this 
government created more jobs than England, France, Germany and 
Italy combined.
<P>
	It is also true that there are still too many Canadians who cannot 
find work. As far as I am concerned and as long as I am a member 
of Parliament, if there is one person in the riding of Hamilton East 
who wants to work and cannot, then I have more work to do.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, yesterday in the House we had an 
unfortunate incident and there was an allegation of the use of 
unparliamentary language by some of our members of Parliament.
<P>
	I have discussed the situation with the Speaker who was here at 
the time. I have reviewed not only the blues but <I>Hansard</I>. I have 
reviewed the video tapes and also the sound tracks.
<P>
	In my view, for whatever reason, unparliamentary language was 
used in the Chamber and I would like to remedy that situation 
because the two members of Parliament who were involved are in 
the Chamber now.
<P>
	This is the situation as I understand it. One member of 
Parliament for the Reform Party, the member for 
Okanagan-Shuswap, was on his feet giving a speech and in the 
course of his speech there were exchanges. According to <I>Hansard</I> 
and according to what I heard and saw, the hon. member for 
Scarborough Centre interjected a word. That word I judge to be 
unparliamentary. Because the hon. member is here now I will 
address him directly and ask him to please withdraw the statement 
he made in this House yesterday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for the opportunity to clarify as to how this word was 
used or not used. I certainly want to state, as I have all along, that 
the word was used in a plural sense, not a singular, and certainly not 
addressed to the hon. member.
<P>
	Out of respect for you, Mr. Speaker-
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> These situations are always unpleasant in the 
House. I put it to the hon. member directly and clearly, will he 
withdraw categorically the word he used, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Out of respect for you and the House, Mr. Speaker, 
I do.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Thank you.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am dealing with this matter. I will come to the 
point of order in just a minute.
<P>
	Evidently the word that was used by the member on the 
government side was reacted to, of course, by the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Shuswap. He, in his excitement, and we sometimes get 
excited in the House, used words which in my view were 
unparliamentary.
<P>
	The hon. member for Okanagan-Shuswap is here now. I would 
ask him to please withdraw those remarks from yesterday which 
were unparliamentary.

Speaker, I respect your request that I withdraw my statements. 
However, the member for Scarborough Centre has made 
statements which demean me and my colleagues in this House, 
as well as millions of Canadians. He has made statements to the 
same effect-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know hon. members want to explain but for our 
purposes here in the House, I simply want to address the matter of 
unparliamentary language which was used. I put the question to the 
hon. member for Okanagan-Shuswap: will he withdraw, 
categorically, the unparliamentary language that was used 
yesterday, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Yes I will, Mr. Speaker, but I would like to defer to 
tomorrow at three o'clock.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I have addressed the hon. member 
and I thank him for withdrawing categorically, as the other member 
did.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning, it was an unfortunate situation that 
happened. Points were brought up. I have asked for withdrawals 
from both sides. I do have the withdrawals now and as far as this 
situation is concerned, unless members have other points of order 
they want to bring up, this situation as it refers to yesterday, as far 
as the House is concerned, is closed.

did not only just say he had called one a racist but that it was in the

``The truth hurts, doesn't it guys?''

again. We are in the profession of using words as weapons. We also 
use them to compliment, many times.  Surely we use words to 
defend our constituents and those things which we believe in.
<P>
	Like all of you who are here, I would hope that debate would be

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THELATEJEAN-ROBERTROY">THE LATE JEAN-ROBERT ROY</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness 
that we learned of the death, last December 28, of Jean-Robert Roy, 
who had been the Liberal member for the former riding of Timmins 
in the House of Commons.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Jean Roy was first elected in 1968 in the riding which was then 
called Timmins in northern Ontario. He was re-elected in 1972 and 
in 1974 and served until 1979 when he had to leave politics for 
health reasons. I know that his constituents would have loved for 
him to have represented them for much longer.
<P>
	He went on to serve on the international joint commission for the 
Great Lakes and as president of the Standards Council of Canada.
<P>
	Jean Roy was born in Timmins in 1923 and took great pride in 
his home town, the town where he spent most of his life. Deeply 
devoted to his family, he was a very special person, gifted with a 
strong and wonderful personality and with many talents which he 
put to the service of his fellow citizens.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	A successful businessman, he contributed to the economic 
development of his beloved Timmins. If in the best interests of his 
community there was a board to serve on or a committee to start up, 
Jean Roy was always there. His many and significant achievements 
will serve the people of Timmins for many years to come.
<P>
	During his 11 years in this Chamber, Jean Roy was never very far 
from his constituents. He was always ready to serve them with a 
helping hand and an attentive ear. He will be remembered as an MP 
who wanted the best for his riding and as a parliamentarian who 
was not afraid to stand up for causes he believed in.
<P>
	A man of vision as well as of action, he was inspired by Liberal 
ideals that secure real opportunity for every  citizen in a just and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7718"> 7718 </A></B>
<P>
caring society. As Timmins Mayor Vic Power so aptly put it, Jean 
Roy believed in Canada for all Canadians.
<P>
	Jean-Robert Roy was a politician in the most noble sense of the 
word, someone who committed his life to the service of his fellow 
citizens. We in northern Ontario have lost a friend, a champion for 
our region. The Liberal Party of Canada has lost an outstanding 
member. On this side of the House, we all know of his dedication to 
our party and to its ideals.
<P>
	On behalf of the Government of Canada I would like to extend 
our deepest condolences to his family, his friends and his 
colleagues.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Roy was a francophone and proud of his heritage. A man 
with an engaging personality, Jean Roy used his talents to serve his 
fellow citizens. As the member for Timmins, he was also sensitive 
to the concerns of those he represented in this House.
<P>
	On behalf of the Government of Canada, and of all my 
colleagues in the House, I offer our sincerest condolences to his 
wife Georgette, his son Jean and his daughter Louise.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a fellow Ontarian and former member of 
Parliament. Jean Roy was first elected to the House of Commons to 
represent Timmins, Ontario in 1968. He was re-elected in 1972 and 
1974.
<P>
	Mr. Roy devoted much of his life to public service. Born in 1923 
in Timmins, Mr. Roy attended school in that city before setting off 
to Queen's University in Kingston. His career began as an 
accountant before entering into the construction industry in the 
United States and other parts of Canada. He spent three years as a 
construction estimator in Buffalo, New York and then returned 
home in 1955 to become a partner in Roy Construction Limited.
<P>
	He immediately became active in his community, serving on the 
board of directors of the Children's Aid Society, the board of 
governors of St. Mary's Hospital and as a trustee of the Timmins 
High School board where he later served as chairman.
<P>
	Jean Roy was a member of the Canadian Institute of Quality 
Surveyors. He and his brother Octave were partners in the Senator 
Hotel in Timmins and Sudbury.
<P>
	Mr. Roy's devotion to public service was second only to his 
devotion to his family. In 1947 Mr. Roy married Georgette 
Clément. He was a father to two and a grandfather to two. Jean Roy 
passed away last week. To his family we offer our sympathy. He 
will be missed by all who knew him.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
my colleague from Sherbrooke and the Progressive Conservative 
Party, I would like to convey our deepest sympathies to the family 
of Jean Roy.
<P>
	I did not have the pleasure of knowing Mr. Roy personally but I 
understand he was a tireless worker on behalf of his constituents. 
His involvement in his home community, serving on the board of 
the St. Mary's Hospital, the Timmins High School board and the 
Children's Aid Society is an example to all of us.
<P>
	Mr. Roy had a lengthy career in public life by serving 11 years in 
this House of Commons. Mr. Roy is noted as being the driving 
force behind the expansion and modernization of the Timmins 
airport during his time as an MP.
<P>
	His former campaign manager was quoted as describing him as 
being a born leader and always striving for the best for the riding 
and never accepting second best.
<P>
	It is with great sadness that I express our heartfelt condolences 
for Mr. Roy's wife Georgette, and his children Jean and Louise.
<P>
	The Progressive Conservative Party extends our prayers and best 
wishes for the family of Jean Roy.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to add my words to those of others who 
have spoken with regard to Jean Roy.
<P>
	Jean Roy was a personal friend of everybody in this House 
during his days here. He was a loyalist to his community, he was a 
loyalist to this House of Commons and he was a loyalist to Canada. 
His heart was in what he was doing. He was a man of principles. He 
never laid back in the harness; he was always there pulling his 
weight.
<P>
	I want to say to his wife Georgette and his family today how 
proud I am, as others are, to have been their friends over the years. I 
say to them that they have every reason to be proud of that 
wonderful Canadian, Jean Roy, who served so well in this House of 
Commons, in his community, across this country and in the 
business world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of my colleagues in the New Democratic Party caucus I too 
would like to join with Jean Roy's many colleagues here in this 
House and former colleagues, family and friends in honouring his 
memory and expressing our gratitude for the service that he 
rendered to Canada as a member of this House for 11 years.
<P>
	I did not know Mr. Roy; he left the House of Commons the year 
that I arrived. But one can certainly tell from the information that is 
available about his life  that he was a person who served his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7719"> 7719 </A></B>
<P>
community well in this House of Commons and in a variety of 
other ways and in the community-
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the hon. members from the Bloc 
Quebecois-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Yes, the hon. member has an excellent 
point.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to ask all our colleagues to pay close attention for a 
few minutes. The member has raised a very serious question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> I am sure if we were talking about one of their 
people they would be quiet.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I was saying that Mr. Roy served the community of 
Timmins well, as we can see from the information that is available 
to us. He was one of those people of which there are many 
thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands in this country. Far away 
from the national limelight in communities like Timmins, Sudbury 
and other northern and rural communities, they are known to 
people in those communities as people who are willing to do 
almost anything to advance the well-being of their community. It is 
with that notion in mind that we in the NDP join with others this 
day in celebrating the life of Mr. Roy and in extending our 
condolences to his family and friends.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Thalheimer (Timmins-Chapleau, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was struck with sadness when I was informed that my 
good friend and former parliamentarian Jean Roy had suddenly 
passed away at his home in Timmins on December 28.
<P>
	Yesterday Jean and his good wife Georgette would have 
celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. The longevity of their 
marriage speaks volumes of how Jean viewed all his relationships 
with people, whether that relationship was in matrimony, in family, 
in business, in friendship and with his colleagues in this Chamber.
<P>
	For 11 years, from 1968 to 1979, Jean occupied this seat from 
which I address this House. He won three consecutive elections and 
no doubt would have continued to serve his constituents and his 
country but for a heart attack in 1977. This event forced Jean to 
retire from active political life and was the reason he did not seek 
re-election in the 1979 general election.
<P>
	He loved this Chamber. He worked endlessly. He was never shy 
to express his strong views on any major topic or issue, whether in 
caucus, in this House or in public. He was a great parliamentarian.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	Although Jean was forced to retire from his political career at a 
young age, he never ceased to be involved in politics. He loved 
talking about politics and was involved  in every election after his 
retirement. He was deeply involved in his many community 
initiatives and contributed much to the community. As a young 
man I was very much involved and contributed much of my time to 
his elections in 1968, 1972 and 1975.
<P>
	I am convinced that was the reason Jean sought me out to be one 
of his golf partners after he retired. Much of our conversation on 
the golf course was about the political climate of the day and the 
future of our country. Jean always had strong opinions and was able 
to express them clearly.
<P>
	Jean prompted me to offer my candidacy as a Liberal candidate 
in the 1988 general election and again in the 1993 general election. 
Jean had by then become one of my greatest supporters and closest 
advisers and a friend. As a personal friend of Jean, I benefited 
much from his optimism, his positive outlook and his political 
counsel.
<P>
	Jean was a man who gave everything of himself not only to those 
around him but also to the society in which he lived. He was a good 
family man and a good provider. Jean's wife Georgette, his 
children Louise and Jean, and his grandchildren were always his 
first priority. Jean served his family and his country well. When all 
else has been forgotten, service to others endures. What we have 
done for ourselves alone dies with us. What we have done for 
others remains and is immortal.
<P>
	Jean loved much and he was loved by all. Love is the greatest 
transformer. It turns ambition into aspirations, selfishness into 
service, greed into gratitude, receiving into giving, and demands 
into dedication. Jean loved much and his deeds will truly live 
forever.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, 
we did not know Mr. Roy. However it is clear from the tributes paid 
him by his former colleagues and those who knew him that his 
reputation was well deserved, and I would therefore like to join 
with his colleagues in offering his wife and two children the most 
sincere sympathy of all members of the Bloc Quebecois.

	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week I was saddened to learn of the loss of a former member of this 
House, the hon. Norman Fawcett. Mr. Fawcett served in this House 
as the member of Parliament for Nickel Belt from 1965 to 1968.
<P>
	Norman was a community leader in the town of Capreol and in 
the region of Sudbury. More important, he was a family man and a 
highly respected member of his community. He will be sadly 
missed by his family, friends and the community.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7720"> 7720 </A></B>
<P>
	Norman was originally from Adanac, Saskatchewan where he 
grew up and later took up farming before moving on to British 
Columbia to take a job as a logger. He later settled down in 
northern Ontario, in Capreol, where he worked as a miner and then 
as a conductor with the CNR. He retired from the CN in 1975. 
This breadth of experience and pan-Canadian view of things 
provided Norman with a unique and penetrating insight that served 
him and his constituents well throughout his political career.
<P>
	In my youth I vividly recall following his political career in 
Capreol and Ottawa. His years of public service began in the late 
forties with his election to the executive of a local of the 
Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen as it was then known.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	In this difficult period for the labour movement, Norman was 
known as a man who stood by his members and his principles. The 
membership later rewarded Norman and I believe they rewarded 
themselves by appointing Norman to various positions of strategic 
importance to workers' rights and to collective bargaining.
<P>
	In the early 1960s he entered municipal politics where he served 
as a councillor and deputy mayor for the town of Capreol. In 1965 
he moved to the federal scene as the member of Parliament for 
Nickel Belt. In 1969 he returned to municipal politics and served as 
the mayor of Capreol and later on as a councillor and deputy 
mayor. He retired from municipal politics in 1991.
<P>
	I do not think it is possible to walk through Capreol without 
seeing or touching the works to which Norman contributed, the 
parks, the athletic field, the museum, the library and so many 
others.
<P>
	However, for Norman elected office was only one part of public 
service. The other was community activism and volunteerism. I 
believe that Norman will be remembered as much for his 
volunteerism as for his political contributions. I believe it is what 
defined him as an individual. He gave of himself.
<P>
	The library board, the horticultural society, the local 
conservation authority, the Capreol Credit Union, the Lions Club, 
the Capreol senior's housing development and more all benefited 
from his leadership and commitment to his community. Public 
service, volunteerism or to offer one's self to the democratic 
process is a noble calling.
<P>
	Mr. Norman Fawcett's life, his accomplishments and his 
contributions testify to this statement. However, as all members of 
the House know, it is family and friends that really matter. Norman 
lacked neither. Norman lacked neither.
<P>
	He was a committed and devoted family man. He leaves behind 
his wife Elizabeth, seven children, 20 grandchildren and 21 great 
grandchildren. I know they will miss him.
<P>
	On behalf of the people of Nickel Belt and the members of the 
House, I wish to offer Elizabeth and her family our sincerest 
condolences on the loss of her husband. He was a great Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
my colleagues in the Reform Party, I would like to pay tribute to a 
former member of this House, Norman Fawcett, who passed away 
on January 26 at the age of 86.
<P>
	One word comes to mind when reading about Norman Fawcett, 
and the word is devotion.
<P>
	Although Norman Fawcett only served in the House for one term 
from 1965 to 1968 as the member for Nickel Belt, his entire life 
was devoted to public service. Besides his involvement in various 
community organizations and boards, he served on the municipal 
council for the town of Capreol where he held the positions of 
councillor, deputy mayor and mayor before finally retiring from 
politics in 1991.
<P>
	He was a conductor with CNR for over 30 years and was also a 
lifelong member of the United Transportation Union and also of the 
New Democratic Party.
<P>
	Mr. Fawcett's dedication to public service is carried on through 
other members of his family with their service to their community. 
Several of his family members are currently involved in municipal 
and provincial politics in the province of Ontario. His legacy and 
commitment live on through them.
<P>
	On behalf of the Reform Party, I would like to express our 
sincere condolences to his wife, children and other members of his 
family. He will most surely be missed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the federal NDP caucus to pay tribute to Norm 
Fawcett, who died on January 26, 1997 at the age of 86.
<P>
	As has been pointed out, he was federal NDP MP in the House 
starting in 1965 and served for three years. Norm spent his whole 
life, not just his time in the House, but an entire lifetime working 
on behalf of other people. Although his service in this House was 
brief, he had a lifetime of service to his community and to his 
country. He was very much a community based man. He started by 
helping his fellow workers with the railway unions in the 1950s. He 
was a conductor with CNR for over 30 years, retiring in 1975.
<P>

<B><A NAME="7721"> 7721 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	Although I never met Mr. Fawcett, I certainly sense in him, 
coming from Transcona, a railway town, a kindred soul and of 
course, given his origins in western Canada,  my fellow New 
Democrats appreciate that as well, those of us who come from the 
west.
<P>
	He was chairman of his union's grievance committee and served 
as the local union representative. Norm Fawcett served as chairman 
of the Capreol Association of Railway Running Trades and worked 
hard to represent the united front on behalf of union members from 
conditions imposed by CNR.
<P>
	This power struggle resulted in a wildcat strike. As a result of the 
strike, he was one of two members appointed to appear at board of 
transport commission hearings to present the union's case.
<P>
	Even during these tense times, Norm Fawcett was described as a 
man who spoke with quiet authority. He gave thought and heart to 
what he said and people listened.
<P>
	As well as being a federal politician, Norm Fawcett served as a 
municipal councillor in 1962 and also deputy mayor. He was 
elected as mayor of Capreol in 1969 and served four years. He was 
again elected to council in 1976 and served seven out of nine years 
as councillor and deputy mayor, retiring in 1991. He also served on 
the Capreol hydro commission.
<P>
	It was not enough, however, for Norm to be involved just in 
collective politics on behalf of his community of Capreol; he was 
also involved in sports projects such as the minor baseball league, 
economic development with the Capreol Community Credit Union 
and served as a represent with the Nickel district conservation 
authority. He was a life member of Masonic Order and a member of 
the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Capreol Lions' 
Club.
<P>
	Norm Fawcett is survived by his wife Elizabeth and his children 
Donna, Gaye, Penny, Pat, Ken and Heather. He was a grandfather to 
20 grandchildren and great grandfather to 21 great grandchildren.
<P>
	Norm Fawcett was a role model for many NDP activists. They 
were inspired by Norm's quiet and persuasive ways. They watched 
in awe as Norm fought CNR from closing the Coniston, Ontario 
railway station. His thoughtful manner won the day and the station 
remained open.
<P>
	In 1972 Norm Fawcett did not run again in the federal election 
and passed the NDP mantle along to John Rodriguez who went on 
to represent Nickel Belt for many years.
<P>
	His hard working and steadfast style also inspired his own 
family members. His son-in-law is former NDP MPP Elie Martel 
who represented the provincial riding of Sudbury East from 1967 to 
1987. Elie was always proud of the fact that for one year, in 1967, 
he was the provincial NDP representative at the same time as his 
father-in-law was the federal representative.
<P>
	Norm Fawcett's granddaughter, Shelley Martel, also followed in 
her grandfather's footsteps and was elected as the NDP MPP for 
Sudbury East in 1987 and remains the MPP today.
<P>
	The NDP federal caucus offers its deepest condolences to the 
family.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
on behalf of my colleague, the hon. member for Sherbrooke, and 
the Progressive Conservative Party to pay tribute to the late 
Norman Fawcett. We wish to extend our heartfelt condolences to 
Mr. Fawcett's family.
<P>
	Although I did not know Mr. Fawcett personally, after reading 
his background I wish I had had that opportunity for I found out 
that Mr. Fawcett and I shared many similarities. Mr. Fawcett was a 
railway man. He served as a railroad conductor with CNR for over 
30 years and he knew the importance of rail and watched how its 
introduction built this great nation of ours.
<P>
	Mr. Fawcett also served on municipal council. He was first 
elected in 1962 and was again elected in 1964. He also served as 
the deputy mayor.
<P>
	In 1965 Mr. Fawcett was elected to Parliament as a New 
Democratic member representing the riding of Nickel Belt. As the 
MP for the area, he fought successfully to prevent the Canadian 
National Railway from closing the Coniston station. He served one 
term as MP and later went on to be elected mayor of Capreol.
<P>
	His political career spanned 17 years of dedicated service to his 
community and his country.
<P>
	The Progressive Conservative Party extends our prayers and our 
best wishes to Mr. Fawcett's wife Elizabeth, his children, as well as 
the many members of his extended family.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we did for 
Jean Roy, and for the same reasons, we wish to offer Mrs. Fawcett, 
his children and all those Mr. Fawcett leaves behind, our sincerest 
condolences.

(enforcement of the duties of the government).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill is to ensure that the federal 
government complies with the Official Languages Act. As you 
know, sections 41 and 42, set out in Part VII of the act-a crucial 
part in terms of enforcement-are being flouted by the federal

	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member withdrew his statement,

means that he was calling me and every one of my colleagues in the

withdrawn.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I understand the hon. member's point 
very well. The hon. member is aware, as all of us are, that what 
happened yesterday has hurt all of us. I hope the hon.

	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to present a petition which is signed by 32 people from the 
riding of Bruce-Grey. The petitioners want to draw<B> </B>to the 
attention of the House  that 38 per cent of the national<B> </B>highway 
system has fallen below accepted standards and that the national

development, the saving of lives and the avoidance of injuries 
among the benefits of the proposed national highway program.

highway system upgrading possible, beginning in 1997.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
the pleasure to present petitions from over 900 Yukoners who are 
concerned and want to draw to the attention of the House that these 
citizens believe that the provocation defence as it is currently used 
in wife slaughter cases inappropriately and unjustly changes the 
focus of a criminal trial from the behaviour of the accused and his 
intention to murder to the behaviour of the victim, who from then 
on is identified as the one responsible for the accused's violence.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>

relevant provisions of the Criminal Code to ensure that men take

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
petition from more than 300 citizens of Peterborough who are 
concerned about social housing in Canada, particularly co-op 
housing.
<P>
	The petitioners point out that Parliament is negotiating with all 
provinces to assume the administration of all social housing. The 
government of the province of Ontario has not respected its legal 
operating agreements and it has said publicly that it wants to sell 
off public housing. The co-operative housing sector is unique and 
separate from all other social housing.
<P>
	Therefore, these petitioners call on Parliament to recognize the 
co-operative housing sector as a unique and separate entity from all 
other social housing and that Parliament seriously consider the 
transfer of the administration of co-operative housing to a 
non-government organization as proposed by the Co-operative 
Housing Federation of Canada.

<P>
	These people are concerned about the injustice in the way those 
who are convicted of driving while intoxicated are sentenced. They 
believe there are profound inadequacies in the sentencing practices 
concerning individuals convicted on impaired driving charges.
<P>
	Therefore they pray and request that Parliament proceed 
immediately with amendments to the Criminal Code which will 
ensure that the sentence given to anyone convicted of driving while 
impaired or causing injury or death while impaired reflects both the 
severity of the crime and zero tolerance by Canada toward this 
crime.

following questions will be of particular interest to my colleague 
from Trois-Rivières. Questions No. 87, 88 and 89 will be answered 
today.
<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question no. 87-<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to family trusts: (<I>a</I>) exactly how many family trusts have been 
recognized by Revenue Canada since 1972; (<I>b</I>) how many family trusts have 
accumulated assets in the following amounts: (i) $100,000 and less, (ii) $100,000 to 
$500,000, (iii) $500,000 to $1 million, (iv) $1 million to $5 million, (v) $5 million to 
$25 million, (vi) $25 million to $100 million, (vii) $100 million to $500 million, 
(viii) $500 million to $1 billion, (ix) the number of family trusts worth $1 billion or 
more, with an individual description of each and (c) specify what percentage of all 
the trusts in each category is held in each province?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> In 
response to (a), the term ``family trust'' is not a defined term in the 
Income Tax Act. The term ``personnal trust'' is, however, a defined 
term in the act and includes: (i) testamentary trusts, established 
upon the death of the individual; and (ii) inter vivos trusts, 
established while the settlor of the trust is alive, for which 
generally no amount is paid by the beneficiary for the interest in the 
trust.
<P>
	The terms ``family trust'' and ``personal trust'' are often used 
interchangeably. Based on 1994 statistics, there were 117,642 
returns filed for personal trusts. Revenue Canada did not begin 
collecting trust data by computer until 1992. However, of the 
personal trusts that existed in 1994, 15,832 were created prior to 
1972.
<P>
	In response to (b), just as individuals are not required to file a 
balance sheet which indicates assets owned with their personal 
income tax returns, neither are trusts. This is so because individuals 
and trusts are subject to tax on annual income generated by assets 
and not on the basis of assets themselves. Therefore, Revenue 
Canada does not have information with respect ot the dollar 
amount of assets held by trusts.
<P>
	In response to (c), as explained in the answer to (b) above, 
Revenue Canada does not have information with respect to the 
dollar amount of assets held by trusts.
<P>
	The number of returns filed by personal trusts in 1994 was 
117,642. The breakdown by province is as follows:
<P>
	NF	400<BR>
 	PE 	329<BR>

 	YK 	130<BR>
		177,642
<P>
Question No. 88-<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What is the impact on the Canadian tax system of the shortfall since 1972, per 
year, from the establishment of family trusts?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Trusts are subject to tax on their annual income except to the extent 
the income is allocated to beneficiaries, in which case the income is 
subject to tax in the hands of the beneficiaries. Therefore, all 
income is subject to tax.
<P>
	Questions concerning the shortfall of tax revenues arising from 
the establishment of family trusts were raised in 1994 by the 
Standing Committee of Finance during the committee's study on 
the taxation of family trusts undertaken pursuant to Standing Order 
108(2).
<P>
	At that time, the committee attempted to ascertain the applicable 
tax revenues that might have been assessed on deemed taxable 
capital gains had the extension to the 21-year rule not been enacted 
by the previous government. Such a determination required 
knowledge of both the cost base and the current value of assets held 
by those trusts. However, as trusts are not required to file annual 
balance sheets, information regarding the assets held by trusts was 
impossible to obtain.
<P>
	Hence, attempts to speculate on the value of assets held in trusts 
and the anticipated shortfall in tax revenues as a result of the 
extension of the 21-year rule were not successful.
<P>
Question no. 89-<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to family trusts: (<I>a</I>) to date, how many family trusts have taken 
advantage of the ruling Revenue Canada issued on December 23, 1991 enabling 
them to transfer their assets abroad tax free and (<I>b</I>) what is the value of the assets and 
the province of origin of each of the family trusts that have been transferred abroad?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> In 
response to (a), no trust has requested a ruling similar to the 
December 23, 1991 ruling and to date Revenue Canada has no 
knowledge that any trust has proceeded with a similar transaction.
<P>
	In response to (b), as explained in the response to (a), Revenue 
Canada has no knowledge that any trust transferred assets abroad in 
circumstances similar to the 1991 ruling.

<P>
	Unless my memory serves me incorrectly, the custom of this 
House has been on the occasion of a tribute for the first tribute to 
any particular former member of this House, or a member of this

the party for which the member sat, or in some instances the sitting 
member for the riding for which the former member sat.
<P>

Belt it was a sitting member that was recognized. I fully expected 
that the next member recognized would be a member from the New

I consider to be the tradition in this House, a tradition of which the

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> So, it is about the GST as it applies to books.
<P>
	I am very pleased to discuss this provision of Bill C-70 
concerning the partial zero rating-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I want to make a 
correction. Motion No. 1 is in the name of the government. The 
mover of a motion is always entitled to speak first. In this case, I 
made an error. I now give the floor to the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to </B><B>Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Motion No. 1 in Group No. 1 pertains 
to clause 26 of Bill C-70. It enacts new subsections 177(1.2) and 
(1.3) of the Excise Tax Act which sets out the sales tax treatment of 
goods sold by auction. Subsection 177(l.2) provides that the tax on 
such goods must be collected and remitted by the auctioneer.
<P>
	In response to concerns raised by some registrants that 
frequently sell goods by auction in large lots, typically at the 
wholesale level, the Standing Committee on Finance passed an 
amendment to add new subsection 177(1.3). This subsection allows 
an auctioneer and a registered principal to jointly elect to have the 
auctioneer instead pass back the tax to the principal that would be 
required to report and remit it.
<P>
	This election could be made where all or substantially all of the 
proceeds from the sale of goods on behalf of the principal at the 
particular auction were attributable to prescribed goods that are 
often wholesaled in this manner, such as motor vehicles, certain 
construction equipment, horses and flowers.
<P>
	The purpose of the motion before the House now is to correct a 
deficiency in new subsection 177(1.3). The correction adds that the 
election applies only with respect to sales by auction in respect of 
which the principal would otherwise be required to collect the tax. 
That only seems a fair and appropriate correction.
<P>
	As a result, the general rules that apply to sales by auction 
continue to apply, for example, to personal use property of the 
registrant sold by auction.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	That concludes what I have to say with respect to Motion No. 1. 
However, I need some guidance from the Chair as to whether we 
would be debating Motion No. 1 or whether I could make some 
comments on Motion No. 2 as well at this time.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The short answer is yes. In fact, the 
parliamentary secretary is only entitled to speak once in this group 
so he had better do it now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to Motion No. 2, 
which my hon. colleague will be speaking to in a  few moments, I 
might reserve my comments, as the same issue comes up later on. 
It does speak to the issue of books and the possibility of zero rating 
books and deleting the rebate which has been provided for in Bill 
C-70.
<P>
	We feel quite strongly that the provision with respect to the 
purchases of books by certain libraries and public institutions 
responds very directly to the concerns of those who care about the 
important issue of literacy in this country, that the proposal instead 
that we are going to hear about in a few moments would be costly 
and not effective in responding to the literacy needs of this country.
<P>
	The provinces that are harmonizing at this time are also offering 
point of sale rebates which will also go a long way toward 
addressing some of these concerns. I will reserve my further 
comments for later on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am particularly pleased to speak to this clause of Bill 
C-70 concerning a partial lifting of the tax on books purchased by 
libraries and literacy organizations, which the government has 
decided should be exempt not just from the new sales tax that 
applies in the maritimes, but also from the GST in the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
	We applauded this measure, but we also told the government that 
it was not going far enough in this objective of exemption from the 
GST or from the new national sales tax in the maritimes. All books 
bought by educational institutions, by institutions, by literacy 
organizations, as well as those bought by consumers must be 
exempt from the sales tax.
<P>
	In Quebec, there is no provincial sales tax on books. We have 
understood that culture is important to a people. We have 
understood that taxing books is taxing ignorance, something the 
government has not yet figured out.
<P>
	Before going any further with this analysis of the clause in the 
bill, I would like to remind the House that the initial seven 
members of the Bloc Quebecois were the only members in this 
House to defend the exemption from the GST of all books sold in 
Canada. They were the only ones to say that the GST should not 
apply to books, because culture is important, knowledge is 
important, and that consideration must be given to the fact that 
Quebec and Canada constitute two distinct cultures that must be 
protected and promoted, and that their authors must be protected as 
well.
<P>
	I would like to pay tribute to those who defended this principle: 
the former member for Lac-Saint-Jean, Lucien Bouchard, now 
premier of Quebec; the former member for Shefford, Jean 
Lapierre; the former member for Hull-Aylmer, Gilles Rocheleau; 
the member for Rosemont; the member for Longueuil; and the 
member for Saint-Hubert. Without their conviction regarding two  
cultures, Quebec's and Canada's, there would never have been any 
talk in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7727"> 7727 </A></B>
<P>
this House of tax exempting books and culture generally. They 
were the sole defenders.
<P>
	I wonder why, and actually I think I know why the government 
does not abolish all taxes on books. This is a government made up 
of ignorant people. This government has no culture and does not 
care about culture, not even about the Canadian culture it claims to 
defend. It cares even less about Quebec culture and the 
preservation of that culture.
<P>
	Not long ago, the Minister for International Trade gave us a good 
idea of what he thought about protecting Canadian and Quebec 
culture. Everything is on the table. Canadian and Quebec culture 
are just pawns in the new trade relations with Canada's partners. 
Nothing is sacred.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Traditionally, those who called themselves Canadian nationalists 
and those who call themselves Quebec nationalists and still do as I 
was saying, all Canadian nationalists were intent on preserving 
what make them different, just as Quebec nationalists and 
especially sovereignists are intent on preserving what they are and 
the very basis of what they are, their culture and also their 
literature, which is an important cultural link.
<P>
	But this government is breaking with every tradition. This 
government has chosen to ignore all the principles defended by the 
greatest federalists, the greatest Canadians in our history. It is true 
in the cultural sector and it is also true in Canada's external 
relations.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Pearson who 
was a great Canadian Prime Minister. Mr. Pearson was the image of 
a diplomat who was a supporter of world peace and a defender of 
freedom and human rights. And he stubbornly defended this 
typically Canadian policy.
<P>
	Today we have a government that could not care less about 
human rights. It does not mind doing business with countries that 
ignore human rights and basic freedoms. The important thing is to 
sign trade agreements.
<P>
	The government has broken with a tradition of defending 
Canadian and Quebec culture. It has broken with a tradition of 
conducting a foreign policy intent on preserving and promoting 
peace and basic freedoms. This government is destroying 
everything it claims to defend as being fundamentally Canadian.
<P>
	If there were no Société des auteurs dramatiques or Union 
nationale des écrivains or their Canadian counterparts to defend 
and promote Quebec and Canadian culture, this government would 
certainly not do it for them.
<P>
	If we did not have people like Mr. Beauchemin, for instance, one 
of our well-known authors, the author of <I>The Alley Cat</I>, and if we 
did not have Margaret Atwood on the Canadian side, this 
government would certainly not defend Canadian culture.
<P>
	Ms. Atwood is a great writer to whom I want to pay tribute, 
because her last two books are truly outstanding. I really enjoyed 
reading <I>Wilderness Tips</I> last year, and the <I>Robber Bride</I>, published 
recently by Ms. Atwood. She is one of the greats. So, if Ms. 
Atwood had not vigorously defended Canadian culture, this 
government would not have been there to do so.
<P>
	Recently, again, she was not afraid to stand up to the attitude of 
these lowbrow governments, which do not care about their own 
culture and ridicule Quebec culture with such stupid and shameless 
decisions as the one to put everything on the table during trade 
negotiations, when no one was protecting Quebec and Canadian 
culture.
<P>
	The government penalizes learning. Every day, the government 
is killing off Canadian and Quebec culture and the likelihood of 
developing new authors and keeping the ones we have, like Mr. 
Beauchemin and Ms. Atwood.
<P>
	The government does not realize it is destroying what it claims 
to be representing. It prefers to spend tens of millions of dollars 
promoting the flag. Behind this flag, however, there is a cultural, a 
patriotic, reality it claims to be defending. When I hear the 
Minister for International Trade and see the government taking 
positions such as this, which resolve a minor part of the problem, 
when we should be removing all tax on cultural products, I say 
these people are irresponsible.
<P>
	The position of the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, as 
contained in the first group of motions, is that books should be 
exempt from the GST, as they are from the sales tax in Quebec. 
That seems clear. There are not hundreds of millions of us in 
Quebec or Canada. It seems to me that each of the two peoples has 
a distinct identity, which it wants to promote both within and 
outside its borders.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	I think it would be worthwhile to give these two cultures a hand 
up so that their influence can spread across Canada, in Quebec and 
even abroad. If the Minister of International Trade wants to discuss 
trade, he should talk about the real thing. Before cultural products 
can be traded, a favourable environment must first be created for 
their production.
<P>
	We have to start by promoting authors, and the sale of their 
books so that they can earn a living and go on producing the master 
works they make us so proud of every year.
<P>
	Seeing how ignorant and unrefined this government is, and how 
insensitive it is to the Canadian identity, let alone to the Quebec 
identity, one can understand why it  has such a hard time doing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7728"> 7728 </A></B>
<P>
things that come naturally between two peoples that respect one 
another.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-70 and, in particular, some of the 
motions that are being moved with respect to Bill C-70.
<P>
	I must say that although this is the new year, 1997, and my first 
speech here in the new year, it is unfortunately not very new 
legislation. Although there have been some amendments which had 
been discussed in the previous year, and although there has been a 
hue and cry from many corners of the country about this 
legislation, it remains substantially unchanged. Therefore it is quite 
unacceptable to the Reform Party.
<P>
	I want to start by touching on some of the major objections that 
we have heard not only from people in Atlantic Canada but from 
national retailers who do business in Atlantic Canada. I do not 
know if members have been following the papers, but it is 
absolutely flabbergasting to me that the government still insists on 
pushing forward with many components of this bill even though 
there is a groundswell of opposition to it.
<P>
	Probably the most obvious example of that is the tax in pricing 
component. During the finance committee hearings a couple of 
weeks ago here in Ottawa we had retailers from across the country 
come to Ottawa and say to the government repeatedly they do not 
have big concerns about harmonized sales tax with the single 
caveat that it should not include tax in pricing at this time. Some of 
them had other concerns and there were some minor objections that 
they raised with respect to other issues, but with almost with one 
voice they said they do not see any point in bringing in tax in 
pricing at this time when it is only going to happen in one part of 
the country. They raised a number of objections.
<P>
	One of the objections they raised, which is so obvious, is that if 
we bring it in in one part of the country but not in the rest of the 
country then we do not have tax simplification, which is what the 
government said it was aiming for, but tax complication and 
confusion. Now we have different prices for the same goods on 
different sides of the border, depending on whether one is outside 
of Atlantic Canada or inside Atlantic Canada. When I say Atlantic 
Canada I should exclude Prince Edward Island because it did not 
become part of this deal. People obviously have big concerns about 
this. It is going to add all kinds of regulatory burden.
<P>
	If it were only regulatory burden that would be bad enough, but 
business leader after business leader came before the finance 
committee and said that it was going to mean extra costs and extra 
costs can be reflected in several ways. It will mean higher prices 
for consumers. It will mean that people will have to be laid off or in 
some cases businesses will have to close.
<P>
	I see the parliamentary secretary here. He was at the same 
meeting I was at where the representative from Carleton Cards said 
that they would close 19 stores if this legislation came in as it was 
because they had 19 stores that were marginal, stores that were 
either just barely making it or slightly unprofitable. They said that 
this legislation would mean that they would no longer be profitable 
and would have no prospect of becoming profitable and therefore 
would close.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	Obviously in Atlantic Canada where the economy has been in a 
shambles for a number of years, this legislation is going to hurt 
those people and there is no reason for it. So far the government has 
been unable to come up with a single shred of evidence to explain 
why tax in pricing has to come in at this time in Atlantic Canada. 
There is not one piece of evidence.
<P>
	At one point a poll was conducted which, by the way, it was 
suggested was worded so that somehow the people of Atlantic 
Canada wanted tax in pricing. When the poll was looked at closely, 
it was discovered very early on when people discovered that tax in 
pricing was going to mean extra costs for them, the support 
dropped. Actually only a minority of people in Atlantic Canada, 
even according to the Nova Scotia government poll, supported tax 
in pricing. That is a major concern.
<P>
	It is going to cost jobs. Woolworth Canada has said it could close 
as many as 30 per cent of its 125 stores in Atlantic Canada. Another 
group has already closed a number of stores in New Brunswick 
specifically because of tax in pricing. Again, I do not understand 
why the government is going after the people of Atlantic Canada 
and hurting them with this legislation.
<P>
	The next point I want to make is that for the life of me I cannot 
understand why, when I proposed a motion in the finance 
committee that the hearings be extended and moved to Atlantic 
Canada where people will be most affected by this legislation, the 
Liberal members voted against taking the hearings to Atlantic 
Canada. To me that is unbelievable. Here is legislation, probably 
the most important tax legislation to affect the people of Atlantic 
Canada in a generation, and they are not given a voice on what 
kinds of changes should be made or whether or not the legislation 
should even go ahead. It is certainly taxation without consultation, 
and I would argue it is taxation without representation.
<P>
	I heard one Liberal member say: ``In my riding of Atlantic 
Canada I personally put out some notices that said we would fly 
people from Atlantic Canada to come to the meeting''. That is 
ridiculous. People in Atlantic Canada have a right to demand that 
their government come to them when it is proposing a taxation 
system that in some cases will have dramatic effects on their own 
personal economic well-being.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7729"> 7729 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the effects of the harmonized sales tax is that people 
on fixed incomes in particular will be hard hit. Those people who 
are on fixed incomes and who perhaps are disabled should have 
a right to be in their own community, whether it is Truro, Nova 
Scotia, or St. John's, Newfoundland, or Saint John, New 
Brunswick, wherever it is they should have a right to call the 
government to account in their own community. They should not 
have to apply to see if the government will bring them to Ottawa 
and take a day or two away from their families. That is 
fundamentally wrong. It is contrary to democracy.
<P>
	I do not want to try to anticipate what the government is going to 
do with respect to limiting debate on this legislation. If on the one 
hand the government does not let people in Atlantic Canada have 
hearings on this legislation, and on the other hand the government 
tells Canadians it is not going to let the opposition point to the 
flaws in the legislation and introduces time allocation, then people 
will have every right to be as cynical as they are today about the 
lack of democracy in this country.
<P>
	When we go door to door, people say that we have an elected 
dictatorship. If I have heard it once, I have heard it a thousand 
times. The government has a chance to prove that is not the case, to 
a small degree this time, if it says it will not introduce time 
allocation. I will not go on about that any longer.
<P>
	I do want to touch on the issue of GST on books. I see a Liberal 
colleague across the way who has spoken out on the GST on 
reading materials. The government had a prime opportunity this 
time around to introduce new legislation that would fulfil a red 
book promise, a promise to the Don't Tax Reading Coalition, a 
promise that was made in two successive Liberal policy 
conventions that they would scrap the GST on reading materials.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Instead, the GST will now be doubled on reading materials in 
Atlantic Canada. No matter how we look at it, that is not fulfilling 
the promise. In fact, it is mocking the people to whom the Liberals 
made the promise before, that they would get rid of the GST. There 
is just no other way to put it.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I know my time is running short. I will simply 
conclude by saying that this legislation is wrong and that these 
amendments do not fix the bill. I encourage all members in this 
House and especially members from Atlantic Canada to scold the 
government by not voting for it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
address Group No. 1, which concerns the GST on books and which 
is made up of Motions Nos. 1 and 2.
<P>
	The Liberals claim that books will no longer be taxed. This is not 
true and, as regards the GST credit on books, the government does 
not go far enough. Ever since Quebec introduced the QST, all 
books have been exempted from the provincial sales tax, not just 
those purchased by literacy institutions, schools, public libraries 
and so on. All books are QST exempt, including those purchased by 
consumers in bookstores, which represent the bulk of GST 
revenues on book sales.
<P>
	The measure announced by the Minister of Finance and which 
the parliamentary secretary explained earlier this afternoon is a 
half-measure designed merely to enable the Liberals to boast that 
they have eliminated the GST on books, when in fact they have 
done no such thing.
<P>
	Taxing books means taxing knowledge. It means taxing 
education and, in the longer term, it means taxing employment, 
given how important education is to finding a job in the new 
economy that is emerging in Canada.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has been fighting since the very beginning, 
even under the Conservatives, to have books exempted from the 
tax. But this can only be a total victory if all books are exempt from 
the GST, not just those bought by literacy and educational 
institutions.
<P>
	With the federal election looming ahead, this government is 
resorting to a favourite strategy of the Liberal Party, that of the 
coverup. Whether it is the Somalia inquiry, the Krever 
commission, the Airbus affair or the Pearson Airport issue, the 
Liberals want to hide the truth from Quebecers and Canadians at 
any cost. They want to sweep everything under the rug as quickly 
as possible, before the election campaign.
<P>
	The Liberals display exactly the same attitude, which is 
something of a tradition with them, toawrd the GST. The Liberal 
government is obviously embarrassed by the broken promise made 
by the Prime Minister and the heritage minister to eliminate the 
GST, a tax which they claim to hate. In order to avoid having to 
explain this broken promise, the Liberals want to reach an 
agreement at any cost with the maritime provinces on GST 
harmonization, so as to be able to claim that they at least did 
something, however little, to change a tax that is resented by all 
Canadians.
<P>
	It is not the first time that Liberals make a colossal error which, 
in the end, ends up costing hundreds of millions of dollars to 
Canadian taxpayers. However, this time the Liberal government is 
also making a mockery of democracy by preventing elected 
members from the opposition to properly carry out their duties as 
parliamentarians.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Unbelievable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Indeed, as per usual.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7730"> 7730 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Just before Christmas, we criticized the manner in which the 
Minister of Finance tabled these documents. The official 
opposition-I remember, I was there-had fewer than 24 hours to 
examine a technical bill over 300 pages long, for which we had not 
received explanatory notes before debate at second reading.
<P>
	But last January, we witnessed a spectacle that was even more 
disgraceful for anyone who still believes in the quality of 
democratic life in Canada. First, the Liberals allowed only three 
days of public hearings on a bill as vital to the maritimes as Bill 
C-70. This was last January 20, 21 and 22, you will recall.
<P>
	The opposition parties asked the government to extend the 
consultations and to travel to the maritimes to be able to hear what 
these people have to say, but the Liberal majority on the Standing 
Committee on Finance, including the parliamentary secretary, 
defeated this motion in committee.
<P>
	I also remember tabling this motion in the finance committee 
last January 22, at the end of the day, and the Liberals simply 
brushed it aside. Yet the Liberals came up with 13 important 
amendments-those were their words, ``13 important 
amendments''- to Bill C-70, the very evening of the third and 
final day of public consultation, claiming that these amendments 
were a response to the complaints heard during the three days of 
hearings.
<P>
	If it was possible to find 13 amendments in three days, imagine 
how many we would have had if we had been able to extend the 
public hearings by one week, as the official opposition had 
requested.
<P>
	In their haste to leave behind the embarrassing issue of the GST, 
the Liberals do not want to hear what people have to say; they are 
afraid that people in the maritimes will tell them the plain truth: 
Bill C-70 is a botched job, a very bad bill. The Liberals are standing 
in the way of democracy by preventing citizens from expressing 
their views, and by moving full steam ahead, worrying more about 
their electoral agenda than about doing a good job of serving the 
citizens who will pay for this new tax.
<P>
	That is not all. The very evening of the clause by clause study of 
Bill C-70 in committee, the Liberals introduced, at the end of the 
day, 113 amendments for a bill that had 272 clauses. This in itself is 
irrefutable proof that Bill C-70 has received amateur treatment 
from the Liberal government and that more public consultation is 
needed if citizens' needs are to be met. We are already at third 
reading. The Liberals turned down the Opposition's request to 
continue the hearings; it is therefore too late, unfortunately.
<P>
	Still more distressing is the fact that the official opposition's 
research service was given only an hour's briefing by the Minister 
of Finance's staff concerning the 113 amendments the government 
was planning to table  two hours later in committee, and no 
document was left with them for consultation.
<P>
	As a Bloc Quebecois member, I sat on the committee the entire 
day of January 22, and I was given a copy of the 113 amendments 
under embargo some two and a half hours before the clause by 
clause study.
<P>
	As a result, the Bloc Quebecois was not in a position to play its 
role as the official opposition effectively and appropriately on the 
finance committee at that time. In a way, the government was 
asking us to trust it implicitly, to give it carte blanche, to take it on 
its word, and above all not to hold it back in accomplishing its 
game plan before the next election.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois proposed a motion to suspend the work of 
the committee for a week, allowing it the time to examine the 
Liberal amendments; this motion was rejected by the chair of the 
finance committee himself.
<P>
	Even this week, the opposition had not even received the printed 
copy of Bill C-70 reflecting the amendments received in 
committee, 24 hours before resumption of the debate on third 
reading. On February 3, we learned from the <I>Téléjournal</I> that the 
chairman of the finance committee was still in the process of 
reviewing the legislation, and that it was possible the government 
would back down on its plan to include the tax in the price.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	How can anyone do a proper job under such conditions? The 
Liberals are shamelessly thumbing their noses at democracy. We 
can be sure they will pay dearly in the next election for their 
arrogance.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to state that the government is 
deceiving the public by saying that the GST has disappeared. In 
fact, the Liberals are not living up to their commitment on this, nor 
have they ever. The GST is still with us, although it was supposed 
to quite simply disappear from the books, and to do so as quickly as 
possible.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-70, 
which is the son of the GST, the most hated and the most reviled tax 
we have had in Canadian history, has been revisited upon us, 
especially upon those people of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	The government said that it would axe, scrap and abolish the 
GST. It did not say it once, it said it on innumerable occasions 
during the election campaign.
<P>
	In previous speeches I have read into the record the Prime 
Minister and other members of the Liberal government who stood 
in this House and condemned the GST. They said that at the first 
available opportunity they would get rid of the GST. Canadians 
who voted for the Liberals at the last election believed that they 
would follow through on their commitment to axe, scrap and 
abolish the GST.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7731"> 7731 </A></B>
<P>
	Today we are debating the son of the GST. The son is larger 
than the parent. It now means more tax, not less tax. It now means 
that we are going to tax more areas. We are not going to take the 
government of out people's hair, we are going to expand it 
everywhere.
<P>
	We had a debate a few months ago in the House about books. 
Books and learning materials are important to all Canadians. They 
are important to our young. They are important to many people in 
the information society in which we live, yet the tentacles of 
government have reached out and now cover books as well as 
everything else.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance thought that he would make a grand 
gesture and say: ``Yes, books are important to students. Books are 
important to schools. Books are important to universities. 
Therefore, the books purchased by universities are going to be 
exempt from tax''. However, students will still have to pay the tax. 
The universities are going to be exempt, but the students are going 
to have to pay. That means that the government, through its smoke 
and mirrors policy, through its sleight of hand policy, is saying: 
``Books to the universities are going to be tax free, but students are 
going to get squeezed even more''. The Minister of Finance cannot 
keep his fingers off anything.
<P>
	We have seen how the government has cut transfers to the 
provinces for health and education. We have seen it in the headlines 
of the newspapers. In Edmonton last week there was a headline 
which pertained to the University of Calgary that stated that fees 
are going to go up $300 a year. Fees are going up not because it 
costs more for the university, but because the government is going 
to pay less.
<P>
	While the government is going to pay less, it is going to take 
more from university students. It is going to take more by way of 
the GST and the students will have to pay more for their university 
tuition while the Minister of Finance stands in the House and brags 
about how he is bringing down the deficit. It is despicable that he 
would have the gall to have a smile on his face while he is bringing 
down the deficit on the backs of students and on the backs of the 
people who we need to be educated to maintain our standard of 
living in the future. It is amazing how shortsighted the government 
is, that it would smile and take the credit for this type of thing. 
University students, which include my son, have to scrimp and 
save and do without so that the Minister of Finance can sing his 
song of deficit reduction. Shame.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	I remember it being said in debate when the GST was first 
introduced that second hand goods would not be taxed, that the 
government would tax goods once and once only. That is why it 
said that it would put a tax on new housing but that it would not put 
a tax on used housing. The Liberal Party at that time condemned 
the Tory government and forced it into making the  commitment 
that goods would be taxed once and once only.
<P>
	Now the Minister of Finance has introduced this son of the GST, 
and what has he done? He has taxed used cars. Every time a car 
goes through a car lot the Minister of Finance picks up the GST 
because that is one of the new rules contained in the son of the GST. 
Therefore, car dealerships in Alberta and right across the country 
will now have to suffer greater competition from the backyard 
dealerships, the private sales and so on. Livings will now be harder 
to come by because the Minister of Finance squeezed them for 
more money. Every time a car goes through their lots, he now 
collects the GST.
<P>
	That is what we are up against, a tax grab anywhere, everywhere. 
Is there anywhere that the Minister of Finance has not looked for 
tax? Is there a stone he has not turned to look for another tax dollar? 
I doubt it very much. That is why this government no longer has 
any integrity. That is why the Prime Minister's popularity is 
coming down in the polls. People out in this great country of ours 
are starting to realize that what the Prime Minister says and what 
the Prime Minister does are two different things.
<P>
	Surely we deserve better. We thought we could get better but 
unfortunately the government is quite content to maintain this 
double standard.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Your leader is just cruising along the bottom, 
bottom fishing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> I hear some heckling coming from the other side. 
We had some heckling yesterday that caused a little ruckus in the 
House. I hope these people do not get back down to that level again 
today because that seems to be where they are most of the time, 
down somewhere around the gutter. They do not have the moral 
fortitude to stand up and deliver on their word.
<P>
	They like very much to shout epithets across the House which 
they would never dream of saying outside the House. They accuse 
other people and other parties with their broad brush 
statements-plural, have no doubt, Mr. Speaker. They make sure 
that nobody is missed with the wide sweep of their broom. They 
feel they can denigrate other people's ideas, but they only drag 
themselves down.
<P>
	This country should have better government. The Minister of 
Finance tells us how the deficit is coming down and how his 
policies have achieved great deficit reductions. Yet when we take a 
look at the figures, which include the small figures, we realize that 
while the deficit has come down by $25 billion, revenues have gone 
up by $25 billion.
<P>
	My point is that the GST only brings in $15 billion. The Minister 
of Finance stood up in this House and said, ``I can't live up to my 
promise because if I got rid of the GST I would have to get another 
tax to replace it'. That is a deliberate misstatement of the facts. He 
is now  collecting $26 billion more. He could have eliminated the 
GST and still had $10 billion more than he had when he started 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7732"> 7732 </A></B>
<P>
three years ago. He could have lived up to his promise on the GST. 
He is now collecting more revenue than what the GST creates in its 
entirety.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	That is the type of deception that we have to get out. We have to 
make sure the people understand the type of information that is 
being disseminated by this party on the other side. When I tell 
people back in my riding they say: ``I had no idea. Is that right? If I 
had known.'' Let us tell them the deception that is going on, the 
smoke and mirrors. As I said, I do not think the Minister of Finance 
will leave any stone unturned.
<P>
	I saw another bill this morning. I am not sure if it was Bill C-69 
but it was a tax implementation act. It had about 20 different 
categories to squeeze out some more, broaden the rules to collect 
more, close the loopholes to make sure that nobody is missed.
<P>
	I could go on and on, but I think I have given a picture at this 
point in time. I will allow my colleagues to continue on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am grateful for this opportunity to speak to Bill C-70. I 
salute the parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for St. Paul's. I 
know he is a gentleman and a scholar. I had the opportunity to 
discuss a variety of topics with him, and I know he is a humanist 
with all that entails.
<P>
	I must admit I cannot understand why he supports, why he goes 
along with a bill which, after all, deals a harsh blow to our culture 
by maintaining the GST on books. It is a harsh blow to culture in 
Quebec but also to culture in English Canada.
<P>
	I may remind the parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for 
St. Paul's, that his riding is an important centre of intellectual life. 
Will he be able to show his face in his riding this weekend? I fear 
for his safety. Will he be able to visit the upstanding citizens in his 
riding with a proposal like the one he has just tabled?
<P>
	I think we have to go back to the basics. We believe that for all 
kinds of reasons which are typical of our time, of our era, until a 
few years ago, literature was appreciated both as a discipline and as 
a source of knowledge. The printed word was a part of our lives. 
The hon. member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies is well aware 
that this goes back to Gutenberg and that there are whole 
generations for whom the printed word was a part of learning and 
of the way we acquired knowledge.
<P>
	Times have changed. We all know that as far as learning and the 
transfer of knowledge are concerned, the electronic media have 
become a major factor. We are sure that if we did a little survey of 
all the pages here in  the House, we would find that each and 
everyone of them has a computer and is familiar with the Internet. 
But they do not necessarily invest as much time in a more 
conventional activity: reading.
<P>
	We believe books should be exempted from the GST or its new 
form, the harmonized sales tax, because it would be a way to 
support book sellers and encourage the spread of knowledge by a 
medium that is somewhat more conventional but still has its place 
and which we all know is still a very important factor in 
establishing the identity of a community, and I am referring to 
literature, what people write about us, and what is written 
elsewhere.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	It is surprising to find such a provision in Bill C-70, because, on 
a number of occasions, here as elsewhere, the Liberal members, the 
members of the government, took a totally opposite stance. It is 
more than just a simple paradox.
<P>
	When analysts, observers, journalists and even historians write 
history and look at what the present legislature produced, one thing 
will stand out: the fact that the government opted on a number of 
occasions for a strategy of camouflage, half-truths and about-faces 
in matters of importance.
<P>
	We know how much the GST is a sore point with the 
government. First because of the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
There are a number of terms to describe the personality of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage. She is indeed a woman capable at 
times of kindness, but she is also capable of a ruse that was at the 
limit of honesty in connection with her government's promises.
<P>
	I see my colleague, the member for 
Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, nodding in agreement. There is a 
lack of insight on the government benches.
<P>
	It would have been interesting had the government used Bill 
C-70 to really dust off its honesty and ensure that its actions are 
more in line with the red book and its election promises.
<P>
	I am sure all the members of this House realize that words like 
literature, knowledge, heritage, the value of the printed word, 
though abstract, refer to basic values. How can government 
members go for this kind of a bill?
<P>
	If we were admitted into your private life, Mr. Speaker, I know 
we would find out that you have an impressive collection of books 
and that you have always been a man who believes in knowledge.
<P>
	Why not adopt measures that will act as incentives toward 
acquiring knowledge instead of restrictive measures? Could 
someone explain that to us before the end of the day? Government 
members are awfully quiet today. It would be interesting to hear 
what one of them has to say. Perhaps the Minister of Transport will 
do the honours.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7733"> 7733 </A></B>
<P>
	Perhaps the Minister of Transport will stand up and, on behalf 
of British Columbia as a whole, tell us why this government has 
chosen to slap down whole segments of the cultural industry? In 
the name of what rationale will educational institutions alone be 
exempt, I would like to know. I said educational institutions, but 
the bill actually talks about literacy.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport is a man in his early fifties. He 
probably studied the great classics of our time in school. Would he 
have read them if, in those days, the constraints that make our 
taxation system unfair today had existed? We should take 
advantage of the presence of the transport minister, who is said to 
be among the moderates in cabinet and a man of sound judgement.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	It would be interesting, and I will close on that, if the Minister of 
Transport stood up and, based on his experience as a man in his 
fifties, told us why it has been decided to use a bill like this one to 
deliberately limit exemptions applying to books to those bought by 
educational institutions and other organizations involved in literacy 
programs.
<P>
	Is this not something of an insult to the intelligence of 
consumers? Does the Minister of Transport not realize that I for 
one-and the hon. whip can bear witness to the fact that my 
workload is on the heavy side, but I am not complaining-read at 
least one book every week? This makes me a seasoned consumer. I 
buy many books. Granted, not all of them are new.
<P>
	Does the minister not recognize that this is a discriminatory 
factor, that it is a bias, that it goes against the principles governing 
the transmission of knowledge to not allow consumers to buy new 
and used books without having to pay the sales tax?
<P>
	Does the minister not recognize that the Bloc Quebecois' 
proposal is extremely reasonable? Sure, you will tell me: ``Yes, but 
we did not have enough time to discuss it''. You are right because, 
once again, government members opted for a process which I find 
barbaric, if I can use that term. Indeed, we learned from our finance 
critic that 113 amendments had been tabled and that the Standing 
Committee on Finance only had three days to look at them.
<P>
	This is a very harmful practice in a system where members are 
asked to do a good job and to make a thorough analysis of the 
wording of a bill.
<P>
	My rather hope that cabinet and the government will review the 
bill and agree with the very reasonable arguments put forward by 
the official opposition. I believe a great cultural complicity is 
possible between the opposition and the government, if only some 
common sense were displayed in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am here 
today to debate the Group No. 1 amendments to the GST-2 bill, the 
so-called harmonization bill.
<P>
	Really we should not be here today debating this piece of 
legislation. I remember so clearly during the election campaign one 
Liberal after another, including the Prime Minister, state they 
would get rid of the GST, they would abolish the GST, kill the GST.
<P>
	I remember listening and thinking it is going to be interesting to 
be there in the House of Commons to see how they will do that.
<P>
	They decided after they got into government that they could not 
do it. Therefore to try to deceive Canadians they presented this 
harmonization bill saying ``we have done what we have promised, 
we got rid of the GST as we promised''. Of course, it will not fool 
many Canadians.
<P>
	We have the GST. Now what we have is one GST for three 
provinces, the so-called harmonized GST-2. Then we have the old 
GST, the one brought in by the Conservatives, the one that was 
going to be killed by this government in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	This promise made during the election campaign no doubt won 
this Liberal government many seats. There is no doubt about that. 
In Ontario 10, 20, 30 seats, who knows, were won by Liberal 
candidates because of promises to get rid of the GST. It was a key 
election promise. It is a promise that has not been delivered on in 
any way, in any state, in any fashion. This government must be held 
accountable for that. What we have is GST-2, a so-called 
harmonized GST.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	We are here today to debate Group 1 of the amendments. It is 
hardly worth debating amendments to this piece of legislation. This 
legislation really does not warrant support in any way. By making 
these amendments it is not going to negate the fact that another 
promise made by candidates running in the last election, made by 
the Prime Minister before the last election, during the election 
campaign and even since the election promise to get rid of the GST, 
no number of amendments are going to overcome that fact, and that 
is a fact. This government does not seem to understand what 
integrity is. This is just another one of those issues that 
demonstrate that so clearly.
<P>
	The promise, of course, has come back to haunt this government. 
We have had the Deputy Prime Minister, after talking to a bank 
machine, decide that she was going to step down. She did it 
because she knew she would not have a hope in heck of winning 
again during a regular election campaign if she did not. It cost the 
taxpayers $500,000 because she could not look that bank machine 
in the eye.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7734"> 7734 </A></B>
<P>
	We have a finance minister that has asked for forgiveness for 
maybe not delivering on this key promise of the last election 
campaign. He said ``we made a mistake'' and he asked for 
forgiveness. But this is more than a mistake. A key election 
promise was broken. That is not a mistake. I do not think the 
taxpayers and the voters in this country should be forgiving. I do 
not think they should just let the finance minister get away with 
breaking a key promise.
<P>
	We have the member for York South-Weston who was banished 
from the Liberal caucus by the Prime Minister because he kept 
insisting-he was member of Parliament for this Liberal 
government-that his own political party and his own government 
would see the light, would show some kind of integrity, some 
degree of integrity and keep that election promise. He was so 
determined that he was not going to be a part of this broken 
promise that he pushed the point until he was thrown out of the 
party. He is now sitting as an independent. He at least of all the 
hundred some Liberal members of Parliament had enough integrity 
to stand up for this constituents on this issue.
<P>
	The member for Broadview-Greenwood temporarily went into 
self-imposed exile over this issue. He knew that it is wrong to break 
a promise and that Canadian voters no longer are going to just say 
``oh well, we didn't expect you to keep this promise anyway''. 
They expect political parties when they are out on the campaign 
trail to make promises that they are going to keep, in particular the 
key promises. I think they should expect that all promises will be 
honoured but in particular the key promises like this GST which 
should certainly be honoured by the people who make the 
promises.
<P>
	There is no doubt this issue is going to cost this Liberal 
government those seats that it won based on this promise and I 
think it is going to cost it a lot of seats besides. Canadians are 
absolutely sick and tired of politicians who say they are going to do 
something and they get down to Ottawa and they completely forget 
what they said they were going to do.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	Thinking of the events of yesterday and today, Canadians have 
decided they are fed up with other things that take place in this 
House as well. Yesterday we heard once again a member from 
across the floor use a word and call one of my colleagues a racist. 
That is unacceptable. But we have been putting up with this for 
three years in this House. Words like that-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I do not know if the hon. member was in 
his chair earlier when the Speaker ruled that matter was finished. It 
was raised this afternoon. I do not mean to interfere with the 
member's freedom of speech, but I would urge and invite him to 
please let us treat that as a closed book for the interests of all 
members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly meant no disrespect by 
raising an issue that had been dealt with by the House. I could refer 
just as easily to many times in the past when this word has been 
used as a means of closing down debate.
<P>
	Many times members of our party have been standing here, 
engaged in honest, open debate, trying to get our point of view 
across. We want to hear the opposition's point of view. We need 
that open debate, not just here in the House but across the country. 
So often debate has been closed down by members of the governing 
party hanging labels on us. That is unacceptable. It is a practice that 
hurts. It does not just hurt us, it hurts the people who are hanging 
these labels that end debate. It hurts democracy more than it hurts 
anything else.
<P>
	In this country we must be allowed to have open and honest 
debate. Canadians expect that.
<P>
	With regard to the harmonization bill, it is not going to get the 
government off the hook and the amendments are not going to fix 
the bill. No amendment could fix this bill. The promise must be 
kept.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to remind members that we are talking about 
a group of amendments presented by the Bloc Quebecois, the 
purpose of which is to obtain a complete exemption from the GST 
on the sale or purchase of books.
<P>
	It must be recalled that, even before the 1993 election, the 
delegation of Bloc Quebecois members here in the House had 
asked that books be exempted from the GST, in order to make 
culture as accessible as possible.
<P>
	We can point to their partial victory in the fact that the GST will 
no longer apply to books purchased by institutions concerned with 
literacy. But there is still a vast array of books citizens can buy to 
which it continues to apply.
<P>
	A government is entitled on occasion to make choices, to decide 
that it will pay particular attention to culture, that it will give a 
particular opportunity to those who write books, which are what 
make up a country's cultural life, which develop knowledge in our 
population. This is a wonderful opportunity, in the context of this 
debate on the GST, for the government to make this kind of 
decision, to give a boost to culture, to give an opportunity to those 
who, through reading, broaden their culture.
<P>
	We are not just talking about people who are members of the 
establishment, but about all citizens, those who go to the bookstore 
on Saturday mornings with their children, and who could buy one 
or two more books, if there was no GST on them. This could be a 
way of broadening the culture of young people, while getting  them 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7735"> 7735 </A></B>
<P>
interested in reading in a much more acceptable and meaningful 
way.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	The government would make a great contribution if it were to 
listen to an amendment such as this. Tenacity is perhaps one of the 
things which characterizes Bloc members. When something strikes 
us as appropriate, we stick to our guns until we get the government 
to listen to our arguments.
<P>
	In the case at hand, I would not hesitate for a moment before 
choosing between giving $2 billion in geographical compensation 
to the maritimes and evaluating the costs of eliminating the GST on 
books for all Quebecers and all Canadians. I would offer Quebec 
culture and Canadian culture the opportunity for further 
development by making books more accessible.
<P>
	It was natural for this message to come from the Bloc Quebecois. 
You know we represent the only francophone people in North 
America and we have always had a particular interest in defending 
our culture with a view to our development. Canadian society as a 
whole can benefit from this notion, moreover. We trust that the 
government will develop an interest in it and will evaluate whether 
it is worthwhile following up on.
<P>
	Today, when we look at what will be important to our society in 
future, we realize that this is no longer a generation where brawn 
counts most. Employability no longer depends on muscular 
strength. What is important now is to make our younger generation 
well-informed, to awaken its interest in finding out things, to make 
it capable of mastering knowledge. Reading is one of the routes 
toward this.
<P>
	It might be considered that GST exemption for books would be 
more of an investment than a cost for our society. I think it would 
be in the government's interest to consider the amendment 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois when examining this bill at the 
report stage. This amendment ought to be the government's choice.
<P>
	You will certainly counter by saying that if the decision is made 
to exempt books, we will come up with some other thing that will 
have to be exempted as well. Essentially, it is a question of political 
courage. It is a question of making the choice to provide a 
competitive edge to a sector that is of vital importance to Quebec 
culture, and to Canadian culture.
<P>
	Will the government have the courage to make that choice? Will 
it in its wisdom conclude that exempting books from the GST is a 
significant and important decision that will have an impact on the 
development of our culture? I think there is a direct connection 
with the amount of tax we pay.
<P>
	As you know, a 15 per cent tax may often be a factor in deciding 
whether or not to buy a product. People say this book would cost 
$40, but if you add the taxes, it is  $45 or $46. If we are talking 
about a children's book worth $10, this means an additional $2. The 
parent or person who buys the book may decide not to or may not 
be able to afford it.
<P>
	The House would do well to act on the proposal by the official 
opposition that would exempt all citizens from paying GST on the 
books they buy. This would certainly be an incentive to buy books 
and increase the sales of books by Quebec and Canadian authors. 
The direct impact of such a decision would be, in the case of 
authors who, often for many years, write more for the sake of 
writing than with any guarantee of making a living, an opportunity 
for the Canadian government to show that it recognizes the 
importance of these authors and the work they do, the importance 
of this literary production for the future of our society.
<P>
	This change in the tax exemption for books is in the GST 
legislation. This is a typical example of the double standard that 
exists in this country.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	The government decides to compensate the maritime provinces 
to a very significant extent for harmonization, while Quebec, where 
harmonization took place a few years ago, gets no compensation at 
all.
<P>
	In a way this is an incentive for inefficiency, but above all, it 
creates a double standard regarding the development of the regions 
concerned. In fact, those two billion dollars will be distributed 
throughout the maritimes, for instance in the Madawaska ridings in 
New Brunswick, near the Quebec border. I think this may lead to 
unfair competition.
<P>
	The federal government has decided to make changes in the 
GST. Let us take the opportunity at least, even if we may not 
entirely agree on the issue of compensating the maritimes, to make 
some significant changes. The Bloc Quebecois has contributed 
significantly in the consideration of the bill. It is proposing a 
number of amendments to improve the bill. The one exempting 
books from tax seems to me to appeal especially to the nobility of 
this House and to the respect for Quebec's and Canada's culture of 
each member of this House.
<P>
	I hope the Liberal majority has the courage to listen to us and 
acknowledge the relevance of this idea. Everyone buying books in 
Quebec and Canada and everyone in the book industry, particularly 
authors, will take this to be positive recognition of their work. I 
hope, when the bill is passed, that people will remember the 
contribution made by the Bloc Quebecois over a number of years, 
from the time we sought a tax exemption for books. There will now 
be one for books sold to institutions.
<P>
	We hope to continue this work until it is universal, until all books 
are exempt. Our culture certainly deserves to be exempt from this 
tax.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-70 which would 
harmonize and streamline the GST.
<P>
	I am not going to deal with the obvious lack of credibility the 
government has on this issue. That has already been spoken about 
eloquently by my colleagues. However, I am going to demonstrate 
that the harmonization of the tax will have an enormous negative 
impact on the business community in Canada, as well as all 
Canadians, in particular those who strive to develop business and 
commerce within Canada.
<P>
	It is obvious that the harmonization of the tax will have a huge 
negative impact on Canadians. It is estimated that harmonization 
will cost Ontarians $3 billion. It will cost three major retailers in 
the Atlantic provinces over $27 million. The Retail Council of 
Canada estimates that harmonization and streamlining the GST 
will cost retailers over $100 million a year.
<P>
	That will not put Canadians back to work. It will not improve 
commerce in the country. It will not elevate people out of the 
egregious taxation system that we have in this country. It will do 
the exact opposite.
<P>
	There are solutions, but the government seeks not to employ 
them for reasons that only it knows.
<P>
	I cannot think of a tax which is more hated than the GST. There 
is no tax which compromises the ability of Canadians to use their 
entrepreneurial spirit, to be the best they can become and to 
provide for their families, their children and society than this tax. 
In fact, one-third of the GST is spent merely on its management.
<P>
	The GST, to the small business people of our communities, is 
invasive and enormous. It has a strangulation effect on their ability 
to do business.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	If the government would look back in history, it would see that 
when taxation levels were decreased and simplified it did not 
decrease the revenues that went into the public coffers, rather they 
increased. Furthermore, it gave a huge impetus to small and 
medium size businesses, those business which truly create long 
term employment in this country. It provided employment and 
stimulated the economy. If ever there was a time when we needed 
to decrease unemployment levels and give Canadians some 
element of security, it is now.
<P>
	Again the government has chosen to ignore the good solutions 
out there to simplify and decrease the tax and the GST. For 
heaven's sake, decrease the GST and enable our businesses to 
employ their entrepreneurial spirit to become the best that they can 
become.
<P>
	I encourage every member in this House, especially those in 
cabinet and those members on the finance committee, to go out into 
the trenches and speak to Canadians who are trying to struggle to 
become the best  that they can be in the business community. So 
many businesses are closing and so many people are losing their 
jobs.
<P>
	Many individuals cannot get work and many businesses cannot 
get on their feet because in part of the taxation system, its levels 
and complexities. That must change. It is strangling the life out of 
the Canadian economy. Let us look south of the border at the 
infusion and stimulation the U.S. has given to its economy by 
lowering taxation levels, keeping interest rates low and decreasing 
the morass of entangled, bureaucratic overregulation under which 
Canadian companies have to suffer.
<P>
	This is no small point. Canadian companies from coast to coast 
have to struggle through three levels of bureaucratic entanglements 
to do business. I sympathize with them. If I were trying to start a 
business, quite simply I would not. I cannot imagine the courage it 
takes for them to attempt to get through and overcome the morass 
of bureaucratic entanglements merely to try to start up a business, 
hire people and provide for themselves and their families.
<P>
	Our finance critic from Medicine Hat has put forth many 
intelligent, eloquent and substantive solutions so that this 
government can simplify the taxation system, decrease the taxation 
levels and provide an impetus to our Canadian economy. However, 
it has gone absolutely nowhere.
<P>
	One particular short point I would like to make is with respect to 
how GST affects physicians in this country. People are supposed to 
be treated equally yet physicians are treated differently. They 
should be tax exempt under the Excise Tax Act because medical 
services, equipment and supplies which are necessary to deliver 
quality care are supposed to be GST exempt. However, of all the 
medical professions, only one is singled out to not benefit from this 
and that is the physician population.
<P>
	The government should immediately enable physicians to be 
treated equally, not preferentially, but equally with all other 
medical professions. country. This government has failed to do that 
and continues to ignore their pleas for fairness and equity.
<P>
	I must say I am getting absolutely disgusted with this House. 
This House is supposed to be an area of higher debate. This House 
is supposed to be a place where we are sent when elected to present 
the greatest and best solutions to the problems that affect 
Canadians across the country.
<P>
	Canadians are crying out for answers yet what we see in this 
House at best is bad theatre. At worst, it is a shame on all of us to be 
engaging in the behaviours we see not only in this House but also in 
committee. We need a radically different view on how we conduct 
government in this country. We need to remove the control of the 
executive from the members in this House. Members from across 
party lines should be getting  together, along the lines of what they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7737"> 7737 </A></B>
<P>
do south of the border in the United States, to bring forth the best 
possible solutions, solutions they could apply to the problems this 
country has.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	There are good solutions across party lines, but we do not see the 
development of the best solutions applied to the problems of this 
nation; we hear petty pathetic insults going back and forth. That 
does not serve this House in any way, shape or form. Most 
important, it does not serve the Canadian people. There is a 
complete and utter disarticulation of the problems of people in this 
country and the high jinks that go on this House.
<P>
	I hope every Canadian will find out about what is going on in this 
House. I hope they will make it their business to find out what is 
happening. I hope Canadians will put pressure on their elected 
officials to smarten up, get with the program and apply the best 
solutions to the problems that affect them. This includes not small 
changes but large changes.
<P>
	We cannot continue with the form and structure of governance 
this nation has today and expect things to change. Nothing will 
change unless we have a radically different way of dealing with 
issues in this House. We must enable committees to be effective, 
enable public input at committees and allow them truly to be heard 
in the legislative process of this House. We must enable the good 
solutions that exist in the public to be applied to the debates and 
ultimately become the solutions that are desperately needed for the 
problems that affect us. Unless we do these things, we will not see 
the change this country needs and as a result, we will not become 
the truly great nation we have the capability of being.
<P>
	I hope the government will listen to this, although I do not think 
it will. Most important, I hope members of the Canadian public 
make it their business in the coming election to get involved, to get 
interested, to get active regardless of their party affiliations. I hope 
they force their people to do what it is they want them to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the Bloc Quebecois amendment to Bill C-70. I 
find it sad to have to propose an amendment to Bill C-70 to have 
books exempted. Taxing books is like taxing knowledge, taxing 
education, taxing skills.
<P>
	Why is the Liberal government still taxing culture? Culture is 
the foundation of what we are, it is our identity, it is our roots. 
Culture is the Quebec culture, and it is also the Canadian culture.
<P>
	In Quebec, since the introduction of the QST, all books have 
been exempted from the provincial sales tax, not just books 
acquired by literacy institutions or public libraries, but all books.
<P>
	We also know the reason for maintaining the tax on books. For 
the information of our viewers, it is that the tax on books accounts 
for the greatest part of revenues generated by the GST. The 
government does not give a hoot about preserving our fundamental 
rights. The government thumbs its nose at both the Quebec culture 
and the Canadian culture. Its favours a system made for the rich. 
We, in the Bloc Quebecois, feel that it is unfair and unjust.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Our authors, the advocates of our languages and our cultures, 
have been critical of the fact that all cultural products are taxable. 
The government must promote cultural products and encourage our 
authors by abolishing GST on books.
<P>
	I also want to speak of a political handout. In my view, Bill C-70 
is a political handout. It is not a gift to Quebecers. It is something 
the Prime Minister and his Minister of Finance gave to the 
maritimes. It is something worth $1 billion.
<P>
	As we know, this government never gives handouts without a 
reason. One can rightly conclude that there is a reason behind the 
handout, in fact I think there are two reasons. The first one is that 
the Prime Minister is trying to be forgiven for having broken his 
famous promise to abolish the GST. Whatever the cost, the Liberals 
wanted an agreement with the maritimes on GST harmonization, 
but whatever they may say to justify their actions, we are not 
fooled. They say they never promised to abolish GST, but 
everybody heard what they said. We will not be fooled.
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign, the main thing Liberal 
candidates said when presenting their platform, the first thing they 
said, was that the GST had to go. Everybody, across Quebec and 
Canada, heard what they said. Now, they boldly claim they never 
said that; Quebecers and Canadians were mistaken, they cannot 
have heard such a thing since it was not written in the red book. 
There is something wrong here. It is an abomination. We look like 
ignoramuses. We have been tricked, and it is our own fault because 
we did not hear right. We are not that stupid. I wonder how they 
dare justify breaking their promise by saying that we are the ones 
who misunderstood.
<P>
	They made a big fuss about an agreement with three maritime 
provinces, saying: ``Look, this shows we are keeping our 
promises''. In fact, they did nothing of the sort, the GST is still 
here, even though it was supposed to be killed, scrapped, abolished.
<P>
	The other reason why they are giving the maritimes such a 
handout is the unemployment insurance reform. As we know, it has 
not been well received in that area. To shore up its image, the 
government has decided to give them a $1 billion present by 
harmonizing the GST. This will placate critics of the new 
unemployment insurance  program. The Prime Minister is handing 
out goodies to repair his government's tarnished record, just before 
calling an election, as we have witnessed lately. We know elections 
are not far away. The government is clearly on the campaign trail: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7738"> 7738 </A></B>
<P>
across Quebec, even in my own riding, it is handing out presents. 
Before, it had no money, but suddenly there is money. ``So, if you 
need any for your programs, let us know, we can help''.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	At the Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec they 
have money. They visit the ridings and give little goodies to the 
agencies. Since there is an election coming, the goodie is 
harmonization of the GST so that people will forget about the 
unemployment insurance reform.
<P>
	However there is something special about that gift from the 
federal government. Unlike what normally happens, this time the 
federal government will not bear the cost of this pre-election 
handout. It will palm it off to Quebec and the other provinces.
<P>
	In Quebec alone, the people will have to spend about $250 
million to cover the cost of the federal handout to the maritimes. 
On the whole, that gift will cost Quebec and the other provinces 
one billion dollars. Needless to say, given the restructuring process 
going on, this sum could easily have served a better purpose.
<P>
	Everybody knows that the Prime Minister had promised to slash 
the GST. We can even say the Liberals criticized that tax long 
before the last election campaign.
<P>
	Let me quote the minority report on the GST presented by the 
Liberals in November 1989, when they were still in opposition: 
``The Liberal members of the finance committee maintain that the 
goods and services tax proposed by the Tory government is bad and 
that no ``repair job'' of any kind will make it fair for taxpayers''. 
You can find that quote on page 283 of the report.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that Bill C-70 itself is some sort of 
``repair job''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak to Bill C-70 this afternoon. I am all the more pleased, and I 
am not doing this out of spite, to say a word about the experience I 
had when the federal tax was changed.
<P>
	When the federal tax was changed, we had an all-out war from 
the Liberal Party, which was then in opposition. Liberal members 
were adamantly opposed to the tax they were calling the new 
federal tax, although this was completely untrue. It was not a new 
tax, it was a tax reform.
<P>
	We must remember that there was a federal tax before. Having 
been in business for 20 years, I know how much federal tax I used 
to pay during those years. We were paying a 13 per cent tax on 
goods. The manufacturer  billed the retailer for the tax. It was a 
hidden tax for the consumer. The consumer did not see this tax.
<P>
	The Liberals, then in opposition, started saying that this new tax 
should not be hidden. They tried to convince people that the 
Conservatives, at the time, were creating a new tax. They made 
such fiery and intelligent speeches-I think what they did was 
smart, but dishonest-they managed to convince people that the 
Conservatives were creating a new tax, while the 13 per cent 
manufacturing tax went down to 7 per cent at the retailing level.
<P>
	The end result was about the same. In 1989, for example, total 
federal tax revenues were about $18 or $19 billion, while the 
reformed tax, which we now call the GST, brings in about the same 
amount. The difference is that, at the time, the Liberals were still 
saying that this was a totally dishonest tax because it applied to 
books, food and drugs. They made a big fuss, saying it was an 
immoral tax, an absurd, unacceptable, outrageous tax.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	In my opinion, the bill before the House is even more 
outrageous. We had time to think things over. We heard witnesses, 
made speeches, informed the people, evaluated all the possible 
effects of these amendments. We realize, in Quebec particularly, 
that this tax will, in fact, affect the development of Quebec culture, 
of Quebec's very sizeable book market.
<P>
	Quebec is a French speaking country. We have many writers, 
authors, and creators, whose books are read by a great number of 
French speaking Quebecers. That is why we, in Quebec, feel that 
our rights and privileges are being denied.
<P>
	In Quebec, our approach has always been to use the tax to 
promote made in Quebec products. Once again, we must observe 
federal standards. The federal government is dictating which 
products are to be taxed. Cultural products will be taxed, and this 
will affect the development of our economy, of our writers and 
authors. This goes directly and totally against Quebec's wishes.
<P>
	In Quebec, when we say we want to be our own masters, to 
decide our own fate, it is because we believe that we will do better 
if we are allowed to solve our own problems and to promote what 
we feel is right, if we want to grow, to create jobs, to increase our 
intellectual and economic potential, and if we can better share our 
resources. In Quebec, we want to build a better future.
<P>
	Once again, today, we realize that the federal government just 
decided unilaterally to tax books, a move that will hurt our 
creators, our writers, our authors. As we know, there is a 
tremendous potential in that area in Quebec. A large majority of 
books are written in our province. A lot of research goes into that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7739"> 7739 </A></B>
<P>
	Whether it is in the areas of new technologies, education or 
health, Quebecers read mostly books in French that are often 
written by French speaking authors from Quebec. Our experts will 
be hurt, and that will thwart the development of Quebec. That is 
why we oppose this legislation and this change that will be 
prejudicial to the development of our book industry.
<P>
	We realize also that we are hurt by the fact that the government 
gave compensation to the maritimes to get them to agree to 
harmonize the provincial and the federal sales taxes. Elections are 
drawing near. Elections were held just recently in Prince Edward 
Island, and the Liberals were defeated. The current trend does not 
seem to be favourable to the Liberals. They do not enjoy great 
popularity. However, this is a great gift the government has given 
the maritimes. Some say it is as much as $1 billion.
<P>
	Quebecers will have to pay between 25 and 30 per cent of that 
billion dollars. That could represent a cost of some $300 million a 
year Quebecers would have to pay because they have to pay their 
share of the bill. That is a tremendous amount.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	That is why the finance minister requested a few months ago a 
$1.9 billion compensation for previous years, as well as all the 
costs incurred by the federal government to generously compensate 
the maritime provinces who agreed to harmonize.
<P>
	And not only do we have to pay the bill for harmonization with 
the maritime provinces, but Mr. McKenna, the New Brunswick 
premier, is using that money to set up shop in Montreal in order to 
lure Quebec companies into his own province. He is using the 
money we gave the federal government to lure our companies 
away. This is not fair-play.
<P>
	This is one more proof that Quebec has been striving for years to 
get more autonomy, but will never get anywhere if it does not have 
full sovereignty. Quebecers will never be able to develop normally 
if they do not collect all their tax revenues, pass their own laws and 
sign their own treaties.
<P>
	Quebec has great intellectual resources as well as tremendous 
natural resources. It has more markets than it needs. The only 
missing thing is that we have not yet taken full responsibility for 
our economic and social endeavours. The reason we sit here is to 
protect our interests before we reach full sovereignty. When we 
cross that threshold, Quebecers will prosper and Quebec will be 
one of the wealthiest countries in North America.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we now have 
proof of what we have known since the very beginning and what we 
have so vehemently condemned: this bill on GST harmonization 
serves only one purpose, one political objective, to show the people 
that the  Liberal government is keeping its 1993 campaign promise 
to scrap or change the GST.
<P>
	They are fulfilling their commitment in three provinces, and as 
we also know, this gift to the maritimes will cost Quebec and 
Canadian taxpayers $1 billion. Moreover they are not considering 
the other impacts of this tax, which is not a new tax, mind you, only 
a hidden one. It is so well hidden that we will not be able to see it 
any more, since it will be included in the sales price. This will be 
seen as a despicable hidden tax because of its effects on some 
aspects of the lives of the taxpayers.
<P>
	I want to dwell on the issue of education. Having been a teacher 
and a school board administrator, I know how vitally important 
books are for the development and education of children.
<P>
	What better way to build a nation, to develop children, and to 
nurture our youth than to teach them how to read and then to 
encourage them to buy books to increase their knowledge, expand 
their horizons and learn how to see beyond their town, their city, 
their province, their country, and to communicate with the rest of 
the world?
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	The government wants to tax books as if they were luxury items. 
It wanted to look good by tax-exempting certain educational 
institutions such as universities, colleges and primary and 
secondary schools, but it is the institutions and not the books that 
are exempted.
<P>
	If my child needs a book, I cannot buy the book from the school 
board. I have to buy it from a bookstore and pay the tax, since I am 
not an institution. The school board would not pay this tax.
<P>
	A child needs books long before he or she enrols in school. 
Given the financial problems that school boards, universities and 
cegeps have today, they are less and less able to provide books for 
free.
<P>
	They may be able to provide some books, but certainly not all of 
them. For example, is there a more important tool to learn our own 
language than a French or an English dictionary?
<P>
	There are dictionaries in school libraries, but it is not practical to 
ask the teacher during class: ``May I take a couple of minutes to go 
to the library and check if such or such word is correct in French or 
in English?''
<P>
	A school board cannot afford to provide dictionaries for each and 
every student because students use these books throughout their 
school years. Who will buy it? The parent will have to buy it at the 
bookstore. Even though the parent is a member of a family, this 
institution would not exempted from this tax on books.
<P>
	The parent will have to pay, and just think of how much a 
dictionary costs. It is quite expensive. One can pay $30, $40, or $50 
for a dictionary. If you add the federal sales tax on a $40 dictionary, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7740"> 7740 </A></B>
<P>
you will have to pay  $2.30 to $3 more. If the parent has four 
children in school, he will have to shell out another $12. This is not 
an incentive. Parents may be tempted to give their children 
something else.
<P>
	In the case of younger children, such as a two-year old or a 
three-year old, what could we give them, for example, to get them 
interested? What book could we give a two-year old who cannot 
read yet, but whom we would like to get interested in reading?
<P>
	We start by getting him colouring books. Will this colouring 
book be taxed? And what if it is a picture book? If we want to get 
kids who cannot read interested in books, we start by showing them 
picture books to slowly introduce them to the world of books, to all 
the new things in books. It is a new world for this very young kid.
<P>
	If parents have to pay tax on these books, it will not encourage 
them to choose a book rather than a toy for their children.
<P>
	The purpose, and that is what Quebec did when it exempted all 
books from the PST, was to bring people to buy books instead of 
something else when they gave a gift to their children, or to make 
the necessary school books more affordable. With the tax, the 
incentive is not there. People will be penalized.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	I mentioned colouring books and picture books, but when the 
child reaches three or four years, he likes to be told tales and 
stories. Some parents have enough imagination to invent these 
stories, but others need books. So, they buy children's story books. 
They read it with their children. They start teaching their kids to 
read. They get them interested in reading. They show them that 
literature is interesting. In elementary school, and especially in 
high school, when children are still searching for their own 
identity, books would be an excellent means to help them. But that 
is out of reach because we tell them: ``If you want to buy books, 
you have to pay more because the federal government decided to 
tax culture, to tax reading. You must pay more to get that access to 
culture''.
<P>
	Those are the effects of the tax. Some will say: ``The impact will 
be marginal. Why would they refuse to pay 7 or 7.5 per cent more 
to buy books, since they pay it when they buy other items?''
<P>
	When the government wants to make a difference, guide 
consumers' choices, help some businesses, it offers well targeted 
subsidies. For example, a business that wants to get into the 
environmental sector will get a grant that it would not get in other 
sectors.
<P>
	The same goes for education and culture. If we want to promote 
that product, if we want children, teenagers and adults to buy more 
books, we must help them and not grant this privilege only to 
educational institutions.
<P>
	By granting this privilege only to educational institutions, 
elementary schools, secondary schools, colleges, universities and 
other non profit organizations, the government just wants to be able 
to say: ``Here is what we have done with the GST; we have changed 
it. We even abolished the GST on books''. Again, this bill does not 
abolish the GST on books. It is false to say that. It is not books that 
are exempted from the GST, but certain institutions.
<P>
	Even the exemption of certain institutions from the tax can raise 
some questions. Is the government not opening the door to a 
situation where some people could put pressure on institutions to 
avoid paying the tax? I imagine myself as a teacher telling a class 
of 30 students to buy a certain book for a literature paper. Since the 
book is not available at the school, they have to buy it. If I ask them 
to buy the book, I am penalizing them. If I do not ask them to buy 
the book, I cannot ask them to do that particular paper. I am forced 
to restrict my teaching because books are too expensive.
<P>

opportunity to rise again on the other groups of motions and 
continue this speech.

	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, again I do apologize and I do feel 
rather sorry for your plight but, as I said, we would be glad to give 
unanimous consent to the government in order for you to be saved 
from having to read these into the record. However, we do ask in 
return that the government assures us that time allocation will not 
be-

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance.

	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the hon. member 
opposite that we did suggest that we might dispense with the need 
to have the Speaker read all the amendments that he is now having 
to read as a result of their declining the opportunity for unanimous 
consent. The hon. whip for the official opposition did agree in 
discussions earlier but we did not have House agreement. 
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, you will have to read. I apologize as well.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have a 
suggestion that might speed things up, although the hon. member 
opposite for the third party did not seem to be interested in 
speeding things up.
<P>
	However, perhaps he might consider this, as my colleagues in 
the official opposition would. It appears these amendments from 
Motion No. 6 to Motion No. 117, which you are reading to us so 
well, all delete references in particular clauses to harmonization, so 
that  the bill is restricted to simply making technical changes. The 
amendments proposed by the opposition in this block all relate to 
deleting references to harmonization. I may incorrect in that so you 
would want clarification from the opposition.
<P>
	But if that is correct, one way might be to group them all by 
removing references in all those clauses to harmonization and 
maybe that would speed it up. Then we could get on to debating 
these motions.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, nothing would be nearer and dearer 
to my heart than to make this place work better. I note the words by 
my hon. colleague that he wants to speed the process up.
<P>
	My point concerns why we denied unanimous consent to your 
not reading the motions. It is not speed that is important but that 
Canadians be heard in this Parliament. We would gladly grant 
unanimous consent provided we could have an assurance from this 
government that it will allow a reasonable debate until the people 
have been heard. When we have that assurance we will gladly give 
you the authority to table the motions all in one. But at the moment 
it is withheld.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree completely with my Reform 
colleague. This debate on the GST is very important. Quebecers 
and Canadians are entitled to obtain all the information 
surrounding this botched agreement, this political agreement 
involving the payment of a $1 billion subsidy to the maritimes.
<P>
	Since you have started out so well, I would suggest, on behalf of 
the official opposition, that you continue. It is very interesting.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is obviously no agreement on that 
issue.
