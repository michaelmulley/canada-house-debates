<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CRIMINAL CODE 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK10">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 17 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-334, an act to amend the criminal code (wearing of war 
decorations), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, after a wonderful summer it is an honour to be 
back to represent my wonderful constituents.  I believe, Madam 
Speaker, that you and all other members of the House also had an 
excellent summer.  I look forward to a good session of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the first day of the session and as the first speaker, I rise 
on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to support Bill C-334, 
an act to amend section 419 of the criminal code which will 
permit the wearing of war decorations by relatives of a deceased 
veteran on the right side of the survivor's chest.  As we know, 
our military veterans always wear their medals and stripes on the 
left side of their chests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Surrey Central would have me begin my comments 
today by congratulating my colleague, the hon. member for West 
Vancouver—Sunshine Coast.  Not only is he the sponsor of this 
bill and today's debate, he has also been appointed to the 
position of chief whip of Her Majesty's Loyal Official 
Opposition, the Canadian Alliance.  We are all very proud of our 
seasoned parliamentary colleague and are confident that he will 
do a fine job of whipping us up to the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative by the hon. member is not meant to diminish or 
dishonour the service, sacrifice and valour of our veterans and 
those who have been awarded decorations.  On the contrary, it is 
meant to celebrate and recognize the sacrifice in this 
achievement.  It is also meant to recognize and acknowledge 
bravery, gallantry, patriotism and commitment to our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those decorations must not be forgotten, put away in dusty boxes 
or drawers or end up in flea markets just because of a 1920 law 
that established as a criminal offence to wear war decorations 
unless the wearer earned them.  In those days parliament 
recognized the need for such legislation.  The problem was that 
these war decorations were being sold and it was not uncommon for 
someone to purchase them, wear them and thereby falsely give the 
impression of having earned the decorations they had actually 
purchased.  Legitimate recipients of these medals were concerned 
about protecting the integrity of these military decorations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making it a criminal offence for someone other than the 
original recipient of the award to wear the decoration, Canadian 
veterans were sustaining the valour, honour and privileges that 
accompany these military distinctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was then, but this is now.  Today fewer and fewer Canadians 
are able to wear Canada's war decorations.  Our veterans are 
aging and, sadly, are passing on.  The declining membership of 
the Royal Canadian Legion should give us the common sense to help 
reconsider the archaic law.  It is even more startling since 44% 
of the members are over the age of 65 and, out of those, over a 
quarter are over the age of 75. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to enhance Remembrance Day services by allowing family 
members to bring out medals on this day and thereby perpetuate 
the act of remembrance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My grandfather fought in the world war and was awarded bravery 
medals.  My brothers, sisters and cousins have perhaps forgotten 
the stories of bravery of our grandfather.  The medals he won 
ought to be the symbol of refreshing the memory of his bravery 
today, are locked in boxes somewhere or perhaps even lost.  It is 
because no one after him could ever wear them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 11 at 11.00 a.m. Remembrance Day is celebrated in 
three legions in my constituency.  As an MP, I would like to 
attend the ceremonies at all three places but I cannot.  Last 
year I sent my younger son Livjot to one of the events to 
represent me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that Remembrance Day should not only be limited to the 
older people but rather we should encourage our youth to get 
involved so that they can get motivation from our veterans to 
become good citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Livjot also gave a very emotional speech on my behalf, which was 
highly appreciated.  My son said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 20th century was a violent century.  World peace was won but 
the human cost defies our imagination.  The fear, the sorrow and 
the horror of war was unimaginable.  The price tag of peace was 
war and 110,000 Canadians dead.  Those who came back, no matter 
how wounded in body and spirit, were determined to build on what 
they left behind.  Together they fought a war and forged a 
nation, a nation we proudly call Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must learn from the harsh truths of wars past so that we 
never repeat humanity's mistakes.  Let us remember to pass on 
their legacy to our children and our children's children, as my 
dad did today.  Love and remembrance last forever.  There is a 
link death cannot sever. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That link is by those medals and war decorations that this bill, 
if passed, will allow the relatives to wear on Remembrance Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come to follow the lead of Great Britain, Australia 
and New Zealand, our Commonwealth partners, which have already 
amended their laws to reflect the need to unveil these 
decorations and re-commemorate the valour of those who were 
awarded these distinctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a relatively peaceful era.  Today's generation is 
very lucky in that regard.  Canadian youth need to learn the 
value of these medals, how they were earned, why they are so 
important and the great costs at which they were won.  By 
allowing the wearing of Canada's war decorations by close 
relatives and descendants of our war veterans, and the wearing of 
these decorations in a manner different than that of the original 
recipient, we would be protecting the honour, valour and 
privileges that these medals command.  This is important because 
these decorations and the stories behind them represent our 
heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the previous hour of debate the only problem cited by the 
government and the Tory Party was the definition of a relative. 
Who would be entitled to wear the decoration won by a deceased 
Canadian war veteran?  I agree that this is an important 
definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast was generous 
and showed foresight in leaving the definition of relative open 
to debate and input from the members and the witnesses appearing 
before the committee.  He did not insist on limiting nor overly 
extending the category of people who would be entitled to 
privileges should the House pass the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government would allow a free vote in the House, it would 
be possible to modernize an antiquated law.  If the House 
supports the bill then it will be sent to the committee and the 
matter of the definition of relative can be decided 
democratically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the committee consider requiring a red, 
green or blue piece of material to be worn on the right side of 
the chest as a background for the decoration thus denoting that 
the person wearing the decoration is the first, second or third 
descendent generation of the person originally awarded them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could also suggest that the committee consider establishing a 
system whereby the person intending to wear the medal must 
satisfy a requirement that would show they understand the 
significance of wearing the medal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-334 is striving to make arrangements to address these 
concerns.  It is worthy of serious consideration by the House. It 
is worthy of proceeding to the committee stage so that the 
outstanding issues can be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to support the initiative we have with the 
bill.  Let us do the work necessary to examine this matter 
totally.  Let us prepare for the dwindling number of Canadian war 
veterans who will be among us in the future.  Let us prepare to 
provide the necessary arrangements to allow the direct 
descendants and survivors of our military heroes to proudly wear 
the decorations they have inherited.  Let us reflect the need of 
the times in our laws and let common sense actually work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I also rise to debate 
Bill C-334. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wars indeed are a dreadful indictment of humanity's failure to 
resolve disputes with civility and reason. Wars mean death and 
destruction and the slaughter of innocents. Unfortunately, our 
grandparents and great grandparents were to learn of this reality 
all too well; on the killing fields of Europe and Asia, in the 
skies above and the seas below, so many Canadian lives lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many acts of courage, many known, countless others 
unknown and untold. I wonder how many Canadians are aware that 
more Victoria Crosses have been won by Canadians per capita than 
by citizens of any other Commonwealth nation.  In fact, 94 
Victoria Crosses have been awarded to Canadians since the Crimean 
war, medals for valour for individual acts of courage.  How can 
we know how many other actions were never recorded for posterity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were reminded recently of the courage of our young men in 
battle with the return to Ottawa of Canada's Unknown Soldier in 
late May of this year.  He was disinterred from a burial place 
not far from Vimy Ridge and formally transferred to Canadian 
officials at the Vimy Memorial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw how, with all the dignity appropriate to the occasion, he 
was brought back to the nation's capital to lie in state in the 
Hall of Honour for Canadian citizens to pay their respects. On 
May 28, 2000 in a dignified and fitting ceremony televised for 
all Canadians from coast to coast, the body of this young soldier 
was finally given his rightful burial spot at the War Memorial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now nearly four months later, if we visit the young soldier's 
sarcophagus, we will find Ottawans and visitors from everywhere 
still paying their respects, still talking about the event and 
still putting fresh flowers on the memorial.  That is the true 
meaning of remembrance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address two issues about the bill that came out 
in the debates last spring.  First, it was said that by wearing a 
veteran's medals on the right side of the chest automatically 
indicates to an observer that they are being worn on behalf of 
the memory of someone else, namely the deceased veteran. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm in support of the bill 
said “We all know that an individual wears the medal that he won 
on a battlefield on the left side of his chest. Therefore, we 
would immediately realize if a person wears such decorations on 
the right side of the chest, that person is not the one who was 
awarded the decorations, but a relative”. This is an 
inappropriate assumption; in fact, it is an error on two counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, except for those who have served in the military, most 
Canadians would not make such a distinction.  How would they know 
on which side of the chest veterans should wear their medals?  It 
is not a matter of common knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, and perhaps more pertinent, it presupposes that veterans 
themselves wear medals on the left side of the chest and never on 
the right.  This is also incorrect. The matter is more 
complicated than that.  Wearing medals on the right does not say 
anything about the wearer and whether he or she personally earned 
the medals.  Many veterans wear medals that they themselves have 
earned on the right.  These are what could be called unofficial 
medals.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rule is this:  Official medals are worn on the left; 
unofficial medals are worn on the right.  An official medal is 
one awarded to a person by the state, while an unofficial medal 
is one awarded to a person by some other entity.  For example, 
many of the veterans in the parade to install the Tomb of the 
Unknown Soldier legitimately and correctly wore medals on both 
sides of the chest.  Service medals were worn on the left, and 
the legion or other veteran association medals and other medals 
were worn on the right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key points are plain.  Wearing medals on the right is in no 
way a valid indicator that the medals are being worn in honour of 
a deceased veteran.  If this bill is passed, wearing medals on 
the right will then be taken as indicating that the wearer is a 
relative of a deceased person who earned the medal.  These 
conclusions could be false and would be in many circumstances. 
Imagine the confusion on Remembrance Day if this bill were to 
pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other topic that was discussed at some length during the 
first debate was the issue of what constituted a relative of a 
veteran since the bill is silent on the matter except for the 
inclusion of an adopted person.  Even those supporting the bill 
admitted this was somewhat problematic.  The hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm said this on that item: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term relative can be confusing, but it could be clarified. Do 
first cousins qualify, for instance?  Is it only direct lineage 
or indirect as well?  The bill could very easily identify what is 
meant by relative. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is so easy, that task has eluded the draftsman. I am not 
at all sure it is that easy.  Does it stop at grandchildren or 
great grandchildren? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the member for Edmonton East, who is from the same party as 
the member who is sponsoring Bill C-334, admits that defining the 
term relative is more than a little problematic.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the bill could be improved is with respect to defining the 
term relative.  Relative should be defined to mean the widow or 
widower of a deceased veteran, or a parent, child, brother, 
sister, grandparent or grandchild, whether by blood, marriage or 
adoption.  Such definition would appear to provide constructive 
limitation as to which family members could wear the medals. 
Nephews and nieces and others not as closely connected to the 
deceased veteran would not be able to honour him or her through 
wearing the medals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not nephews and nieces.  That begs the question, what if they 
are the only surviving relatives?  Could they not rightly claim 
the same honour to pay their respects to a deceased aunt or 
uncle? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote the hon. member again where he said “The definition of 
relative could be expanded as times change and circumstances 
warrant”. Expanding the term relative over time might create 
ludicrous circumstances.  The minute we open a door to allowing 
those who did not earn the medals to wear them, no matter how 
well defined, that door will remain wide open forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member then proposed that we define what sort of honour 
relatives could wear, suggesting limitation to Canadian or 
Commonwealth general service issue medals as opposed to ribbons, 
badges, chevrons, other decorations and orders.  This is just 
another slippery slope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a similar vein, the hon. member for Saint John expressed 
like-minded concerns.  She said during the last debate: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who qualifies as a veteran?  Other than specifying that adopted 
relatives are also eligible to wear the medals, there are no 
specifications on who is wearing and parading around in those 
hallowed decorations of honour.  There are no checks to be 
maintained or record of who is wearing the decoration.  Will a 
veteran's third cousin by marriage be wearing medals or 
decorations, or the veteran's eldest child?  Understandably this 
is a decision to be made by each family if this were to pass, but 
where is the honour that goes with wearing the medals?  Where is 
maintaining and restraining enforcement? Certainly there must be 
a status of decorum that must be upheld and I do not see that in 
this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She hit the nail on the head when she said later in her 
submission: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that once a medal recipient has passed on, the 
decoration should be treated as a representation of the service 
and sacrifice of the veteran who earned it and displayed as such. 
I fear that it will be perceived through the passage of time to 
be a less substantial piece of jewellery just to be passed 
around. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exactly.  I am delighted she states our position on this side of 
the House so eloquently.  I commend the hon. member for Saint 
John, who holds the memory of the sacrifice and heroism of our 
war veterans near and dear to her heart, for taking the time and 
effort to call the Dominion Command of the Royal Canadian Legion 
and the provincial command in New Brunswick, both of which 
indicated their opposition to the bill.  She also noted that her 
family members who had relatives who served felt exactly the same 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I end with a quote from my hon. friend opposite, the hon. member 
for Saint John, who said during the last debate: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe it is up to the House of Commons to determine 
for veterans who should be allowed to wear these decorations of 
honour.  I believe we should listen to our veterans as to who 
they feel it should be.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, on behalf of the New Democratic 
caucus I would like to extend our warm greetings to all members 
of parliament, their families and the new pages who are with us 
for this session.  We wish them the best of luck.  I send my 
personal congratulations to all and hope that everyone had a 
great and relaxing summer with their families and are ready to 
get down to the nation's business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure to speak on this very important 
matter.  I thank the member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast 
for raising it.  I am speaking in favour of this bill not 
necessarily to contradict my good friend from the riding of Sault 
Ste. Marie, but to understand why we are doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a historical note, this is the 60th anniversary of the Battle 
of Britain.  It is the 50th anniversary of the Korean conflict. 
It is the 90th anniversary of our navy.  It is the 75th 
anniversary of the legion.  It is the 55th anniversary of the 
liberation of my country of origin, Holland.  Those anniversaries 
and special dates could not have been accomplished without the 
assistance of the Canadian people and their military forces at 
those various stages of our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One certain fact is that Canadian children and students know 
very little about military history.  In fact, when veterans go 
before school kids, usually during the week prior to Remembrance 
Day, they are astonished at the lack of knowledge Canadians have 
about their own military history and the individuals who fought 
so bravely and gallantly in those battles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approximately 120,000 Canadians, mostly the same ages as the 
pages who are here with us, are buried in over 72 countries 
around the world.  There is a historical cenotaph in Lower 
Sackville, Nova Scotia built from 72 stones.  Those stones 
represent every country in which we have a military person 
buried, having died as a result of peacekeeping missions or 
conflicts.  Those individuals died so that we could live in 
freedom, so that individuals such as ourselves could stand in the 
House of Commons to voice our opinions and battle with words 
instead of with fisticuffs.  That is what democracy is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended the 38th annual dominion convention in Halifax.  A 
lot of the veterans said that the greatest homage is, “We shall 
not forget them; they shall be remembered”.  The truth is that a 
lot of Canadians do not remember because they do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill could enable young people and future generations to 
understand what Canada and its people went through in those 
battles of yesteryear.  We hope and pray that we never have to go 
through those types of conflicts ever again as a nation, but I do 
know that our military would be ready at a moment's notice if 
there were conflicts around the world that needed to be settled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate part is that most Canadians are forgetting. The 
gatherings for Remembrance Day ceremonies are becoming larger and 
larger, but that is due to veterans, their families and the 
legion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is quite clear.  If we do not allow family members or 
relatives to carry on proudly with the wearing of their uncles', 
their fathers' or their brothers' medals, that history may be 
lost.  Those medals could eventually end up in a nice cedar box 
somewhere in someone's attic and left alone and forgotten.  The 
history will be gone forever.  That would be a tragic loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the nation's most important battles were Vimy, Dieppe 
and other areas throughout the world.  How many people really 
know the part that Newfoundlanders played in the war effort? They 
know in Newfoundland, but not many people around the country know 
that Newfoundlanders fought before it became a province of 
Canada.  When we mention this to young people they say “Oh, 
really”.  They did not know this and it is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I went to Holland for the 50th anniversary of its 
liberation the Dutch children knew more about Canadian history 
than Canadians do.  That is a disgrace.  That is very shameful. 
When this is mentioned to veterans, for example at the Camp Hill 
hospital in Halifax where many of our aging veterans are living 
out the last days of their lives, they are very sad and 
remorseful with the fact that Canadians forget them.  Even though 
we stand up every Remembrance Day and say we will not forget, the 
reality is that time passes and memory lapses.  This bill will 
bring the memory forward and continue to keep it alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My mother, father and oldest brother were liberated by 
Canadians.  My father has now passed away, but on behalf of my 
family and all Dutch citizens around the world I would like to 
say thanks once again to the Canadian military and the government 
at that time for intervening in order to rescue us and allow us 
to come to this country and live in peace and freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I promised my father and all military people that I would never 
forget.  I have passed it on to my children so they will never 
forget, but there is no guarantee that they will pass it on to 
their children.  There is no guarantee that other children will 
remember the sacrifices made by our military personnel.  This 
bill is one way of encouraging the memory of the very brave and 
valiant soldiers, the men and women throughout our country, who 
have passed on to their glory with God. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of the House to carefully consider this 
bill and understand that there are differences of opinion.  There 
is no question there were differences of opinion when World War 
II veterans wanted to get into the legion and World War I vets 
were hesitant about that.  There were differences when the Korean 
vets came back to Canada as to whether or not it was actually a 
war and whether they could get into the legion.  There is debate 
as to whether or not current serving military personnel, RCMP 
officers or firefighters, for that matter, can enter the legion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legions know it is a sin that they are unfortunately slowly 
closing down in smaller communities.  They are changing their 
requirements for entry on a regular basis strictly for survival. 
Some of the larger legions in the larger centres are doing quite 
well, but they are struggling as well in some cases.  Entry was 
changed for me to become a legion member.  My father served in 
the Dutch resistance but does not have any medals to show for it. 
If he did, I would be very proud and honoured to wear those 
medals on Remembrance Day or at other special ceremonies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government looks at the bill carefully and understands 
the historical aspect of what it is trying to do, I am sure it 
would reconsider and show support for this very important 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my family and the New Democratic caucus we will 
support this initiative and will continue to debate it as it goes 
along.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
once again let me echo my colleague's comments from 
Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore.  In coming back to 
the House after our summer recess I know that you are happy, 
Madam Speaker, to see all of us here.  I am very happy to see you 
in the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to speak on behalf the Progressive 
Conservative Party to Bill C-334 which has been placed before the 
House.  The Progressive Conservative Party supports the rights of 
families of veterans to honour the memories of their ancestors 
and their accomplishments.  We support Canadian pride in our 
country's military history, heritage and the sacrifice that has 
been made on behalf of all Canadians and Canadian society.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues have said, the PC Party is not in favour of 
this piece of legislation.  I do not believe that it is up to the 
House of Commons to determine for veterans who should be allowed 
to wear their decorations of honour.  I believe that we should 
listen to our veterans on this very important matter.  They made 
the sacrifices; they earned the medals; and they have the right 
to make those decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offices of the Royal Canadian Legion have expressed their 
opposition to this bill.  My party supports their position.  They 
understand the intent of families who believe they can promote 
Remembrance Day by wearing the medals but the veterans 
associations do not agree with this action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Dominion Command Office believes and states that medals are 
not symbols of remembrance.  Rather they are symbols of service 
and commitments made by those men and women who were overseas. 
Medals are very personal, awarded to specific people for specific 
details and specific sacrifice.  They are intended to be worn by 
the person who earned them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the bill is clearly to honour our valiant soldiers 
and their services.  However, if the wearing of another medal is 
permitted, the possibility that medals will start to lose their 
significance is strong.  We have to be aware that those who are 
wearing medals earned by others for their special acts of valour 
could offend some living veterans who proudly wear their medals 
on Remembrance Day.  Is that fair to our proud living veterans of 
today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member from the NDP Party for 
Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore.  One of the most 
important functions on a yearly basis that I have to attend is 
that of Remembrance Day celebrations on November 11.  I attend 
because I have personally suffered a loss in the great war.  I 
lost an uncle in that war, an uncle whom I never knew.  When I go 
to Remembrance Day celebrations it is the memory of that man 
which makes me stronger as a Canadian, knowing full well that I 
did not have to fight in my lifetime for Canada.  My uncle 
fought.  He gave the ultimate sacrifice.  He lost his life on my 
behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go to Remembrance Day celebrations I make sure that I 
take my children to those services.  They must remember too. They 
never had to fight for the country.  They have simply been given 
a gift by the men and women who have gone before us and who made 
those sacrifices.  That is the remembrance we must have for the 
people who went before us, not to wear their medals on our chest 
to show people that we remember.  We can remember them in many 
other fashions or in many other ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that many of the people here today have family 
members who served with distinction and honour.  The family 
members of deceased veterans certainly have the right to remember 
the deeds and the valour of loved ones.  However I suggest that 
there are many other ways to honour those veterans than wearing 
their medals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A specific problem with the bill is that it does not stipulate 
who qualifies as a relative.  Other than specifying that adopted 
relatives are also eligible to wear the medals, there are no 
specifications on who is allowed to wear these sacred decorations 
of honour.  Will a veteran's third cousin by marriage be wearing 
the decorations of the veteran, or the veteran's eldest child? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Understandably this is a decision that each family would have to 
make if the bill were to pass.  This vagueness brings into 
question what honour would go with wearing the medals.  Where is 
the maintaining and restraining enforcement?  A status of decorum 
must be upheld, and I do not see it in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every November 11 we see veterans marching with their hard 
earned medal decorations pinned proudly to their chests.  On this 
day of remembrance we acknowledge veterans for the sacrifices 
they made.  If Bill C-334 were to pass, it is entirely possible 
that we would be acknowledging persons wearing medals they did 
not earn them and for achievements they did not accomplish. We 
could not even be certain that these people were the relatives of 
a veteran.  I suggest to the House that this would be demeaning 
to the veterans who risked and perhaps even sacrificed their 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>War decorations say something about the wearer.  They say “I am 
proud to have served my country with distinction and with 
honour”.  Were Bill C-334 to pass, this message would be 
muddled. 
One could not be certain that someone wearing a medal had served 
in the military or whether the wearer had a parent who had 
served, or a brother, or an aunt, or a third cousin by marriage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the law currently stands the wearing of war decorations is 
very meaningful.  I fear that allowing anyone other than the 
person to whom the medals were awarded would depreciate the value 
of the medals and diminish the privilege of wearing them.  We 
need to encourage remembrance of our war veterans.  There are 
many ways to do it.  Let us leave the wearing of war decorations 
as the exclusive right of those who earned them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I maintain that we let the veterans themselves tell us what they 
would like to do.  It is their honour and it should be up to them 
to decide if, when and with whom they would like to share it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As said earlier the party I represent, the Progressive 
Conservative Party, certainly extends its gratification and 
gratitude to all veterans for services rendered to our country. 
It is they who should wear those medals with pride, not I or any 
other member of the House, unless in fact we earned them on the 
field of battle or in the service of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for bringing forward the legislation. However 
the Progressive Conservative Party will not be supporting the 
proposed legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I too wish to welcome the Speaker and my colleagues back 
to the House after hopefully a summer of relaxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-334.  This 
initiative by my colleague from West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast 
would amend the criminal code to permit the relatives of a 
deceased veteran to wear any decoration awarded to that veteran. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment stipulates that the relative can wear such 
decorations only on the right side of the chest and would only be 
permitted to do so on one day of the year, that being Remembrance 
Day.  To do so at the present time would be in contravention of 
the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current law was written in the 1920s.  I can certainly 
understand why it made sense then.  Legitimate veterans of World 
War I did not want those who did not serve to be able to buy 
decorations and wear them for personal gain, status or to 
perpetrate fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of today is that the vast majority of these veterans 
have passed on.  The coming decades will see the passing of the 
majority of those who served in World War II and Korea.   Their 
decorations for the most part will be relegated to basements and 
attics, if not lost altogether.  They will turn up in flea 
markets and junk shops where they will be seen as nothing more 
than just another bauble, their true meaning lost forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this is the way we want to honour the memory of 
those who are responsible for the freedoms we enjoy today.  I 
will go so far as to say it is offensive, undignified and a 
dishonour to their memory.  They are priceless and should be 
viewed that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative is not intended to diminish the service, the 
sacrifice or the valour of the recipients of these decorations. 
It is meant to recognize and perpetuate the memory of their 
achievements.  My hon. colleague has taken this initiative at the 
request of the relatives of veterans.  They fear that the 
decorations awarded to their family members are being forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand have recognized the 
need to amend their laws pertaining to this matter and have acted 
accordingly.  I find it somewhat perplexing that Canada has not 
followed suit.  Are we so arrogant as to imply that Great Britain 
with its long military heritage and tradition is by simply 
allowing relatives of deceased veterans to proudly parade their 
decorations on Remembrance Day somehow degrading the memory of 
those who were all that stood between freedom and tyranny?  Are 
we telling Australians and New Zealanders that we harbour more 
respect for our veterans than they do for theirs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I might be permitted to speak in some very personal terms, my 
father was a veteran of World War II.  He did not serve in what 
some might mistakenly describe as one of the more glamorous 
capacities of military service.  I use the word “mistakenly” 
because I have yet to meet any veteran who sees anything 
glamorous about war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I mean to say is that my father was not a fighter pilot or 
a gunner.  He was not a paratrooper or a tank driver.  He was not 
a frogman or a commando.  No.  My dad drove a truck.  He was a 
convoy driver.  He signed up in 1939 when the war broke out and 
mercifully returned home to Canada when it ended six years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He met my mother in Holland when Canadians liberated that 
country.  The site of last spring's ceremonies, the town of 
Apeldoorn, is my mother's home town.  It is where they met. She 
followed him to Canada in 1947.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father's brother, my uncle, also served in Europe for the 
entire war and married a Flemish girl. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early 1950s my father did a short hitch with the Royal 
Canadian Air Force and my family spent two years in northern 
France.  As a child, I played in the forests and fields that had 
been battlegrounds less than a decade earlier.  I visited the 
still fresh cemeteries in France and Holland.  To this day I 
remember standing before the imposing monument of Vimy Ridge.  I 
vividly remember the bayonetted rifle barrels protruding skyward 
from the dirt of a backfilled trench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father's explanations as to what this was all about had a 
profound impact on me.  Neither of my parents spoke much about 
the war.  They did not have to.  My mother's traumatic experience 
of years under the Nazi occupation was evident in her reaction 
whenever she heard someone speak with a German accent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember once as a teenager bringing a schoolmate home.  He 
was the son of recent German immigrants.  He was tall and lean 
with sharp square features, blonde hair and spoke with a heavy 
accent. My mother was very gracious to him but after he had gone 
she asked me not to bring him around anymore if she was at home. 
She had no problem and no objection to me associating with him 
but to be in the same room with him was just too much for her.  I 
learned something that day about the impact of war on people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for my father, his demeanour every November 11 was silent 
testimony to his innermost thoughts and feelings.  My dad did not 
receive any special decorations for distinguished service or 
valour above and beyond the call of duty.  He just got the same 
service medals given to thousands of other Canadian soldiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he passed away in 1996 my only request of my siblings was 
to take those medals home with me.  They are a constant reminder 
to me of who my dad was and the debt of gratitude I owe to him 
and to the tens of thousands of others like him.  They also serve 
as a tangible reminder to me of the oppression and terror 
suffered by my mother and millions of others under Nazi tyranny. 
I am sure that many other children and other relatives of 
veterans could tell very similar stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do recognize that opinion is divided within our veterans' 
organizations on this issue and I certainly respect the views of 
those who oppose the wearing of war decorations by any other than 
those to whom they were awarded.  Perhaps that issue could be 
addressed at the local level through regulation or by some other 
means.  These things could be discussed at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, why anybody would want to deny a spouse, a child or 
grandchild the opportunity and privilege of publicly 
acknowledging their deceased relatives' contributions by parading 
his or her military service decorations on the one day set aside 
for their remembrance is beyond me in the first place.  However, 
to label that spouse, child or grandchild as a criminal, thereby 
lumping them with killers, rapists and thieves, is beyond reason. 
It is ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard it said here this morning that it is not up to the 
House of Commons to decide who should and should not wear war 
decorations.  It is in the criminal code and it is only this 
place that can deal with the criminal code.  What Bill C-334 does 
is it removes the aspect of relatives of deceased veterans 
wearing war decorations on Remembrance Day from the Criminal Code 
of Canada.  Persons other than relatives would still be covered 
under the statute, as would anyone wearing the decorations on any 
day other than November 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my colleagues in this place to support sending this 
initiative to the standing committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I echo the comments made earlier in terms of welcoming yourself, 
my colleagues and the House of Commons staff back from a long 
summer vacation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to join my colleagues to discuss the pros and cons 
of Bill C-334.  I will concede that there are responsible, 
reasonable and well-intentioned arguments on both sides of the 
ledger.  That is why it is difficult to definitively come down on 
one side or another.  However, making decisions is part of our 
job and in this case the appropriate decision is in my view to 
deny passage to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly can see the point made during the last debate on the 
bill.  Our war veterans are a dwindling national resource.  As we 
start this new century we are losing many of them very quickly. 
Such are the ravages of time and old age.  Slightly more than 
400,000 of our war veterans are still with us and of those who 
are their average age is now approaching 80.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fact of time and history imposes on us a duty to honour 
our commitment to remember their sacrifice for now and for future 
generations.  The question that arises is how best to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-334 takes the position that allowing relatives of 
deceased war veterans to wear their medals is one way to keep 
that memory alive.  I disagree.  My colleagues on this side of 
the House have already made the case of the legion's opposition 
to the bill and I believe this to be the strongest argument 
against the passage of the proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, I would like to point to some of the remarks made by 
the hon. member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast during the 
debate in May.  Let me just pick out a few of the comments and 
questions he raised.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My initiative comes from the relatives of veterans who fear that 
decorations awarded to their family members are being forgotten 
and put away in dusty boxes and drawers.  They, like me, believe 
the time has come to move with the times and not let these 
precious decorations collect dust somewhere. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He later said in his speech: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should it be a crime for a relative to want to display the 
decoration and thus honour their deceased relative? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later still he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be a positive gesture to remember them by allowing 
their families to proudly display their decorations as their 
veteran family members pass on? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the hon. member stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe these decorations are a birthright for the family 
members of those who were awarded them and sadly can no longer 
display them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely nothing in the current criminal code 
legislation that prohibits the displaying of medals.  There is 
nothing that suggests that medals have to be put away in dusty 
drawers nor does the current legislation say that it would be a 
crime for relatives to want to display the decorations.  The 
prohibition simply applies to the wearing of medals by anyone 
other than the veteran himself or herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all encourage family members to proudly and publicly display 
the medals of their parents and grandparents either at home or on 
loan in more public facilities, such as local libraries and 
museums.  They could even consider making a donation of these 
medals to their local institutions for public display. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make the case that taking the time and effort to 
display medals in this way will be considerably more meaningful 
than the option being considered by the bill:  wearing the medals 
one day of the year and then, by implication, putting them back 
in a box to be worn the next Remembrance Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should consider this proposition very carefully.  One way is 
to try to picture what it must have been like for those who 
actually served in war and so reflect on why they might take some 
umbrage at someone else wearing their medals.  For those of us 
who have not experienced warfare, it is almost impossible for us 
to imagine what it was like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many theatres of operations the weather was often very cold 
and frequently wet.  The battlefields, especially in the first 
world war, were seas of mud, at times waist deep or deeper. 
Soldiers carried 40 pound sacks of equipment and provisions on 
their backs.  They ate, slept and fought in trenches or 
makeshift barricades.  They did not see their homeland or loved 
ones for years and those who were the lucky ones 
survived.  Medical conditions often defied description. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first world war there were no antiseptic surgical 
techniques.  Antibiotics were non-existent.  Many men who escaped 
death at the hands of human enemies died from diseases such as 
influenza, pneumonia or infections.  In such conditions the 
nursing sisters, brave women who often lost their own lives in 
such hellish conflict, struggled to comfort soldiers' broken 
spirits as they tended their broken bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our veterans faced implacable enemies, fiercely determined to 
fight to the bitter end.  It was kill or be killed.  It is a 
wonder that these men and women, considering the things they were 
called upon to do and what they were forced to witness, kept 
their humanity at all, and yet they did.  When they returned home 
they picked up their lives and started work on building their 
country and raising their families.  For their service, sacrifice 
and courage under fire they were awarded medals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the most famous medal of all in the Commonwealth, 
the Victoria Cross.  On it are inscribed two simple words:  For 
Valour.  In my view it would be a sacrilege and an outrage for 
anyone to wear such a medal, relative or not, other than the 
person who won such a high honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony of this is that many VCs were awarded posthumously 
because the recipient died in service to his country and to his 
comrades in arms.  If we could agree that the VC should not be 
worn by anyone but the recipient, then it would be hard not to 
see the same principle apply to all medals for service and 
courage.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Far better and more honourable than appropriating the medals is 
to honour the memory of our veterans through the retelling of 
their exploits.  We can do that.  We can write their histories in 
places like parks and street names.  We can write them in places 
of dignity and circumstance, like the National War Memorial, and 
in the glorious landscape we have been blessed with where the 
names of many of our mountains, rivers and lakes now proudly bear 
the names of our beloved veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can write the memories of these brave men and women and the 
principles they fought and died for in our hearts.  We will carry 
these memories with us from the past into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go to any gathering, meeting or convention of veterans 
anywhere in the country we will see, in their binding friendships 
forged in the crucible of war, our history laid out plain and 
clear, living and breathing.  We must all reclaim that history. 
We cannot allow it to perish, not even when the last of our 
surviving war veterans passes on, especially not then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reclamation is not to be found in the wearing of medals not 
earned through one's own actions.  We know what to do.  We give 
our past a future by putting it in the hands of the next 
generation.  It is our duty to tell our children and our 
children's children the story of courage and sacrifice, the story 
of Canada's veterans.  It is only fitting and proper that we do 
so.  It is their heritage too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-334 does nothing to that end.  Its passage will cause 
grief and anger among those who served.  I cannot and will not 
support the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on the wall of my bedroom there is a picture frame.  In 
that frame there are six war medals.  They are the medals of my 
grandfathers and my father, awarded to them when they served in 
the first and second world wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My grandfathers came home from those wars.  Both of them had 
suffered severe injuries.  One of them limped all the rest of his 
life.  The other had considerable pain in his shoulder.  One 
received the wound at Vimy Ridge and the other at Hill 70.  My 
father was in the medical corps of the Royal Canadian Air Force. 
In his duties he probably saved the lives of many flyers who had 
crashed during the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to have those medals on the wall of my bedroom.  I 
would be even prouder to be able to wear them on the right side 
of my jacket on Remembrance Day.  Those three men, my 
grandfathers and my father, are no longer with us.  The sad fact 
of the matter is that within the next 10 years there will be 
hardly any of our war veterans alive at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will we remember them?  Will we be able to remember them 
adequately? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this bill simply does is it says that those of us who knew 
these people, who knew of these people and of their sacrifices 
for Canada, would be able to put those medals on our chests on 
Remembrance Day and that at the services around the cenotaph be 
able to say clearly, articulately and proudly to those who ask 
“These are the medals that were given to those who fought for, 
served and gave up their lives for this country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When little boys of five, six or seven would come to me and ask 
about those medals, I would be able to say “Those are the medals 
of my grandfathers and my father”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask all members of the House to give their consideration 
to this bill, indeed their approval of it, send it to committee, 
get it talked about and to finally put it into the law of the 
land so that we might have the right to continue to remember 
these veterans because soon they will not be with us at all.  We 
should never forget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-334. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get to the specifics of the proposed legislation, I 
would like to preface my remarks by reflecting on the nature and 
scope of the sacrifice of Canada's veterans, especially during 
the last century. It sounds a little bit odd that we can refer to 
the wars we have participated in as wars of the last century.  It 
is a testament to the sacrifice of our grandparents and 
great-grandparents that we can now say we have been involved in 
another world war since the first half of the 20th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad fact of 20th century life that if we want to trace 
the history of our nation, we merely need to visit cemeteries and 
memorials here in Canada and in the Commonwealth war cemeteries 
the world over. During the two world wars, the Korean war and in 
peacekeeping missions, over 116,000 of our young citizens were 
slain for the cause of peace and freedom.  Of their courage there 
has never been any doubt; courage in action, in conditions that 
go almost beyond description. Consider for example the killing 
fields of the first world war, the so-called war to end all wars. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the turn of the 20th century, Canada was a small nation in 
terms of population: fewer than eight million, yet it was a 
nation full of promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this war, more than 66,000 young Canadians were to shed 
their life's blood on the battlefields of France and Belgium. At 
its end, names such as Arras, Amiens, the Somme, Vimy Ridge and 
Beaumont-Hamel were graven forever in our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The death statistics for World War I are beyond belief.  In 
fact, the actual figures will never be known, but this was truly 
a world war. Of the sixty-five million enlisted, ten million lost 
their lives.  Another twenty-nine million were wounded, taken 
prisoner or reported missing in action.  The beloved sons of so 
many nations were lost, and along with them the enormous 
potential of a missing generation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second world war would again plunge the world in darkness 
and cost the lives of over 45,000 of our young soldiers, sailors 
and air crew.  Korea a few years later would take another 516. It 
is in this context of such carnage that we can begin to discuss 
the notion of courage and the medals that come to symbolize 
courage under fire.  For indeed by some definitions, courage 
means medals and citations for bravery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Victoria Cross is the Commonwealth's highest designation of 
valour.  When we read the exploits of those who have won it, 
their acts of bravery are almost impossible to imagine.  The 
irony is that when we talk to veterans about courage, they almost 
never see themselves as heroes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, one of our VC winners, Fred Tilston, who passed on just 
a few years ago, used to joke about it.  When asked what it took 
to win the Victoria Cross, he summed it up in one word: 
inexperience.  I guess he was poking a bit of fun at himself. 
Fred, like most veterans, was very modest about his courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps English writer G. K. Chesterton had it right when he 
said that courage is almost a contradiction in terms.  It means a 
strong desire to live taking the form of readiness to die.  I 
guess in many ways that is how courage showed itself for the 
Canadians who went to war.  Ordinary men and women were called 
upon to do extraordinary things in the most frightening of times. 
By that measure, all those who served were very, very 
courageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in these multiple meanings of courage, service and 
sacrifice that I want to turn to the specifics of Bill C-334.

<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, after our summer recess it is important for Canadians to 
know what business the government has on the agenda, given the 
events of the summer, the problems at Burnt Church, the organized 
crime problems in Quebec and across the country, even some of the 
gasoline and heating oil tax issues, all those things.  My 
question for the government House leader is, what is the business 
of the House for today and the rest of the week? 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today it is the intention of the 
government to commence the debate on Bill C-38, the financial 
institutions bill, which we would propose to do immediately after 
this statement.  If there is time permitting later today, we 
would then proceed to Bill C-41, the veterans benefits bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow it is my intention to call Bill C-33, the species at 
risk legislation, followed by, if time permits, report stage of 
Bill C-14, the Manitoba claims bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Wednesday, I would like to call the Manitoba claims 
legislation if we have not terminated it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Thursday, I would like to designate the day as a supply day 
in the name of the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday, we would like to proceed with Bill C-41, the veterans 
benefits legislation, if we do not succeed in doing the bill 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to inform the House that it is the intention of the 
government, and indeed of House leaders of all parties, to ask 
that the Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Government 
Operations hold an informal hearing this Thursday for the purpose 
of consulting with the interim privacy commissioner.  Following 
that particular meeting, it would then be the intention of the 
government to bring forward a motion for the appointment of the 
privacy commissioner at another sitting of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been consultations, and so far they are incomplete, 
in regard to the status of Bill C-3, the youth justice bill, 
which, shall I be generous, is somewhat stuck in a particular 
committee of the House.  I intend to come back to the House later 
today once these consultations are complete. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since we are 
discussing the business of the House, I intend, as I announced 
earlier, to ask for the unanimous consent of the House to amend 
the order of business as follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preliminary discussions I had with my colleagues lead me to 
believe that the vast majority of opposition members in the 
House would agree to support the request for the unanimous 
consent of the House that I am going to submit to the government. 
That request has to do with the very serious events that have 
recently taken place in Quebec and that now make the fight 
against organized crime the top priority. It is extremely urgent 
that this parliament, which is aware of its responsibilities, 
look at this issue and make a number of decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking for unanimous consent for the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, notwithstanding any standing order, Motion No. M-428, 
listed under the Private Members' Notices of Motions, be debated 
immediately; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the debate take place during the time normally allotted for 
government orders; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That any member taking part in this debate not speak for more 
than 20 minutes; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That it be possible for a member to split his or her time with 
another member; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a period of not more than 10 minutes be provided for 
questions and comments following the speeches; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That 15 minutes before the end of the debate, the Speaker shall 
interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question 
relating to the motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It concerns Motion No. M-428, which I made a point of including 
on the Order Paper so it would be available for all 
parliamentarians and which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the freedom of the press and the public's right to know be 
recognized as fundamental to democracy, this House will not yield 
to attempts by criminal groups to intimidate democratic 
institutions, and this House request that the government prepare 
and bring in, by October 6, 2000— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we could agree on a different date. Depending on the 
outcome of our consultations, the date could be changed. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a bill making it a crime to belong to a criminal organization, 
if necessary invoking the notwithstanding clause of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the members have known about this motion for some time 
already and the problem is extremely grave not only in Quebec, 
but in the rest of Canada, although more so in Quebec, I 
therefore seek the unanimous consent of the House to change the 
order of proceedings for today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, there were preliminary 
consultations this morning.  I have not finished consulting 
members on this side of the House.  I am therefore unable at this 
time to give unanimous consent to this proposal, or to any 
amendment since the House leader of the Bloc Quebecois himself 
has said that there may be an amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, at 3 p.m., immediately after or perhaps just before 
oral question period, if the member wishes to put his question 
again, if there is some sort of consent for a debate later today, 
we could agree on a formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way or another, I would like to raise this matter in the 
House at 3. p.m.  I will therefore have to withhold unanimous 
consent until such time as a proposal is made, i.e. immediately 
after oral question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Perhaps after routine proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent for the request made by the hon. 
member for Roberval? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Roberval will be able 
to make the request again later this afternoon, after routine 
proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, so I understood from the 
comments made by the hon. government leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the opposition is unanimous, the government is giving the 
matter some thought and we will perhaps have a positive 
response—hopefully, anyway—if I move my motion again a bit later 
today.  That is what I understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I cannot speak for the government House 
leader, but his statement is available for all members.  What is 
clear is that he has asked the hon. member to put his request to 
the House again later today.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the seventh major initiative of the government dealing 
with our financial institutions in the last four and a half 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early in 1996 we brought in Bill C-15 which enhanced the powers 
of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions to undertake 
early intervention with respect to troubled institutions, thereby 
enhancing the safety and soundness of our entire system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 we entered into the WTO agreement on financial services, 
enhancing the access of Canadian financial institutions to 
foreign markets throughout the world.  Again in 1997 the 
government brought in Bill C-82 to strengthen consumer protection 
by prohibiting coercive tied selling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 probably one of the most important measures was passage 
of the bill which allowed the mutualization of some of our major 
insurance companies and put over $10 billion in the hands of 
policyholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 we passed the bill dealing with foreign banks being 
allowed to operate as branches in Canada, utilizing the capital 
of their global entities in order to enhance their capacity to 
lend to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 2000 the money laundering bill was passed, which is a 
direct blow to organized crime by clamping down on money 
laundering through our institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our seventh initiative is Bill C-38.  As we all know this is a 
tremendously important bill in size and in consequences.  It 
amends 22 acts and establishes one entirely new act that covers 
almost 900 pages.  It is so important because as we know our 
financial services sector is truly a driver of our economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more than 500,000 Canadians employed in this sector. 
Its payroll is in excess of $22 billion annually.  It accounts 
for approximately 5% of our gross domestic product, and close to 
$50 billion annually in exports from this country.  It also pays 
over $9 billion in taxes yearly to all levels of government. This 
is the most heavily taxed industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the direct and indirect importance of the financial 
sector, one of which I am extremely proud, the strategic 
framework within which it operates must foster opportunities for 
growth, for export and for job creation, to the benefit of our 
economy as a whole. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-38 implements a policy framework which ensures that the 
sector continues to make its crucial contribution to our economic 
well-being by enhancing its ability to compete in the new world 
of globalization and rapid advance in technologies, by making it 
easier for these institutions to seize opportunities both in 
Canada and abroad, and by following a balanced approach that is 
in the interest of consumers and the sector itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know Bill C-38 is the culmination of a process of very 
extensive consultations.  This process began in June 1996 when we 
announced the creation of an advisory committee to review the 
payment system.  This was followed in late 1996 by the 
establishment of the task force on the future of Canada's 
financial services sector, a task force which was known as the 
MacKay task force and which reported to us in September 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that report the House and the Senate finance 
committees held extensive consultations throughout Canada and 
reported back to us by the end of the year.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this advice was considered very carefully in the preparation 
of the June 1999 policy paper which gave the government response 
to all consultations and input from colleagues in the House. Over 
the past year, following tabling of this white paper, more 
extensive consultations were undertaken so that we could enact in 
legislation the results of all the undertakings and 
considerations.  I tabled that bill in the House last June 13. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More precisely, Bill C-38 encourages the efficiency and the 
growth of Canadian financial institutions in international 
markets, fosters competition within the country, enhances the 
protection of consumers of financial services, and improves the 
regulatory framework. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of promoting efficiency and growth we have a holding 
company structure which will give greater flexibility for these 
institutions to compete with monoline institutions doing a single 
type of business.  They will enjoy a lighter regulatory regime 
through that holding company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of ownership we are permitting up to 20% of the shares 
of larger institutions to be used for strategic alliances to 
allow our banks to enter into joint ventures with other 
institutions both domestically and abroad.  We have enhanced the 
range of permitted investments for our financial institutions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through guidelines, we have stressed the possibility of mergers, 
thus recognizing that such mergers can be a viable strategy. A 
new transparent review process will be put in place to evaluate 
mergers and to protect public interest. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of fostering domestic competition we will be allowing 
new entities to establish with lower capital requirements.  We 
will have three levels of institutions: those with equity 
exceeding $5 billion, those with equity under $1 billion and 
those medium size ones in between.  Finally large banks with 
equity over $5 billion will be required to be widely held under 
the new 20% ownership regime.  This new ownership regime will 
encourage the establishment of community banks. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also included provisions whereby co-operatives, credit 
firms and credit unions could get involved in the establishment 
of a national service entity. Such an entity would allow 
co-operatives to adopt a national structure, while fostering 
competition with large Canadian and foreign institutions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By accommodating new entries into our payment system for life 
insurance companies, for securities dealers and for money market 
mutual funds we will see enhanced competition domestically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at what the bill does in terms of empowering and 
protecting consumers, it will ensure access to basic financial 
services regardless of income or place of residence, including 
access to low cost accounts and a process that will govern the 
closure of any branches. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It establishes the financial consumer agency of Canada to 
strengthen the monitoring of protection measures for consumers 
and to extend the scope of consumer awareness activities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It establishes the independent Canadian financial services 
ombudsman to deal with disputes with institutions.

the governance and oversight of the Canadian Payments 
Association, and we have new powers for the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions to deal with potential risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an era of extremely rapid change and global competition. 
We recognize that our financial institutions must have 
flexibility and freedom to adapt to changing times.  The world 
will not stand still.  Nor will the sector.  Nor will we.  This 
is why constant attention to fostering competitiveness and to 
ensuring safety and soundness are so important and are for the 
benefit of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In keeping up to date we have ensured that this legislation has 
a five year sunset clause, unique among institutions in the

to ensure that our institutions can adapt.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the government is prepared, if it deems appropriate to 
do so, to reassess the legislation before the scheduled five year 
period between reviews, to ensure that the framework remains 
adapted to a rapidly changing market. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the bill allows for many key elements to be dealt with by 
regulation so that we will not have to come back to the House

Canadians, continue to contribute to job creation and economic 
growth, and maintain the safety and soundness of our financial

</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank colleagues for their very valuable contributions to the 
bill.  They will see many of their ideas and suggestions 
reflected in it.  It is because of the extensive consultation and 
co-operation of all members that the early passage of the bill is 
supported by consumer and industry groups alike.  We in the House 
look forward to early passage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I too am pleased to rise 
today to speak to Bill C-38.  In listening to the secretary of 
state's words one would think that the Liberal government had run 
quite a race since 1993 to get all these things done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reference to our banking industry and to choices for Canadian 
consumers of financial services, while the secretary of state 
talks of seven positive initiatives taken by the government in 
fact only two will have a direct result by way of possible 
increased competition and allowing our domestic banks to move 
into the 21st century and to catch up to what has already 
happened in many foreign countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably a majority of the House, and maybe even the secretary 
of state himself, does not know that Canada has lagged behind 
other countries including some of our major trading partners in 
modernizing our banking and financial structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state may be quite proud of the legislation. 
There are some good things in it.  For the most part we will 
support it, but I advise him to be cautious when talking about 
the speed of the race the Liberals have run since 1993 in getting 
our banking institutions up to par with the countries with which 
we do business.  I am sure the secretary of state is having some 
second thoughts now that he reflects on that speed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some parts of Bill C-38 that we certainly agree with 
and parts that we do not.  There are even some parts missing 
which we will likely address with some amendments as the process 
moves along.  With the secretary of state's encouraging words 
that we help him get speedy passage of the bill, I am sure the 
government will view the amendments that come from the Alliance 
Party in particular with an encouraging welcome attitude and will 
want to see those amendments become part of this great financial 
services bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us deal with some of the good things in the bill, which 
incidentally in many respects were spelled out for the government 
in the November 1998 banking report by the member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley acting as the official opposition critic 
for banks and financial institutions.  In the 100 page report 
entitled “Competition: Choice You Can Bank On”, we clearly 
called for more competition and better service in banking.  We 
also recommended that merger proposals be evaluated under 
individual merit and that mitigating factors be built into the 
proposals so that when the Minister of Finance and all those 
concerned looked at these proposals they would be able to say 
“Yes, this is a good proposal; it has merit.  Let us approve 
it”, or “No, this one is not.  Let us not approve it”.  It 
would do away with the blanket approach to the determination of 
mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the official opposition outlined a plan in 1998.  The plan 
offered choice and competition in the financial sector.  It 
provided an action plan for change that the government is just 
now beginning to follow to allow our domestic banks to compete 
more effectively in the global marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time.  The secretary of state knows, as does his 
government, that the ratings of our big five domestic banks have 
increasingly shrunk in the global scale.  Major banks all around 
the world, with much more ease than we can imagine, have begun to 
amalgamate and merge and build their positions to even greater 
strength, therefore capitalizing on the opportunities in the 
global marketplace.  Our banks, unable to merge, unable to build 
through acquisitions and other arrangements because of 
regulations, have had to sit by and watch these wonderful 
opportunities pass them by and be scooped up by the big world 
banks that have had the ability to strengthen to a size where 
they can take advantage of these opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only now are our Canadian banks, our big five, going to be able 
to really look ahead.  Madam Speaker, you have to understand, and 
I am sure you do, that banking institutions simply cannot work on 
short term planning.  They need long terms, longer terms than can 
be imagined, longer term vision and longer term business plans. 
That is the nature of their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been basically sitting on its hands since 
1993.  Our domestic banks were placed in the position that they 
simply did not know what lay ahead from the government in the 
regulatory field.  They did not know what path the government was 
going to follow which would allow them to make plans 10, 15 and 
20 years down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not been a speedy process.  We are now just getting to 
the point where Canadian banks can heave a sigh of relief and 
start to concentrate on some long term plans, to look at some 
opportunities in the global market.  Our Canadian banks will now 
be able to compete as a result of many of the features of the 
bill.  Let us not allow the secretary of state or the Liberal 
government to take any credit for the so-called haste with which 
they have dealt with this issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other points we want to talk about.  The banks 
have been calling for a provision that would allow them to break 
up some of their structure into holding companies so they could 
operate under a more flexible regulatory system.  Finally the 
government will make those allowances.  The banks can now start 
to make some progress on some of the plans they had put on hold 
because there was no direction from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also happy to see the increased access to the Canadian 
payment system.  It will allow life insurance companies and money 
market mutual fund security dealers to have increased access, to 
clear funds themselves without having to go through the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something missing in the bill with respect to credit 
unions becoming more like national banks.  I am surprised it is 
missing because the MacKay task force report recommended that the 
government consider allowing what it called co-operatively held 
banks in reference to credit unions. A co-operatively held bank 
that would evolve out of a credit union simply means that every 
member of that co-op, which would now be engaged in bank-like 
activities, would be a voting member of that banking structure. 
The government has not allowed that and we wonder why it has not. 
If the government were committed to offering more choices in 
banking services to Canadian consumers and small business 
enterprises, why would it not have made this provision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We intend to introduce amendments during report stage that will 
give the government a chance to rectify that omission which it 
allowed to happen in preparing the bill.  One thing we are not 
happy about is the omission of the provision for credit unions to 
become co-operatively held banking institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also happy that the government in its wisdom has 
maintained a restriction on banks entering into the auto leasing 
and insurance business.  We commend the government for that. At 
the same time we remind the government that in our 1998 report, 
of which I have a copy for the secretary of state but I am sure 
he must have read it in the preparation of Bill C-38, we too 
called for the government to hold the line on this.  Auto leasing 
and insurance is a very competitive and vibrant business sector 
in Canada and we felt the choices offered to consumers were very 
wide and that it was operating very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a little trouble with the FCAC, the ombudsman office, 
the financial consumer agency of Canada.  Trust the government to 
come up with a bureaucratic sounding title for what will be, from 
all looks at this thing, another bureaucracy within the 
government that will die a slow death because of the 
inefficiencies that generally evolve out of government 
bureaucracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could have been quite simple.  The government could have 
made a provision for the setting up of a very independent 
ombudsman's office for banking, one that would oversee the 
financial services sector. This office would report directly to 
parliament, to the elected representatives of the country. 
But no, the government chose to create the office with a 
commissioner who will be appointed by the Minister of Finance.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that the Liberals would have run out of Liberal 
friends by now, but one more is coming down the tube and will be 
the FCAC commissioner.  That office will report directly to the 
Minister of Finance.  Anything that we get from that office will 
have first been vetted through the Minister of Finance.  In other 
words, we will only hear what the Minister of Finance wants us to 
hear.  We will not be permitted to question the commissioner 
ourselves. This is significant. It is so like the government to 
restrict access of the opposition parties to the agencies it 
creates because it does not fit in its agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are happy of the government's lowering of the capital 
requirement to establish small banks.  We commend the government 
on that.  We think we will see some movement in the setting up of 
regional and community banking services.  We would like to think 
that the government will be encouraging more competition from 
these types of businesses.  We support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem with the demands on the government that it 
must begin to or continue to operate money losing accounts for 
Canadians as individuals or small businesses. While the 
government may think that this is a good thing for political 
reasons, the fact is this is an intrusion on private business. 
The government is taking this a little bit too far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government say to a business that it must operate a 
segment of its business but it is not allowed to make money? In 
fact it will probably have to lose money, but the government has 
decided that the business must operate a section of the business 
on a money losing basis.  This is what the government has done in 
the bill.  It has said to the banks that no matter who comes in 
and asks for an account at the bank, the bank has to pretty much 
open an account for them. Whether that account is operated in a 
responsible fashion or not, the bank still has to provide access 
for that person to have an account at one of that bank's 
branches. The banks themselves will say that the government is 
telling them how to run their own businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bank closures have become a reality in this country. It is 
common knowledge that the banks for the most part are 
over infrastructured as far as branches go.  In many cases banks 
are looking to close down this infrastructure because they are 
money losing branches and banks are simply not in the business of 
operating at a loss on behalf of their shareholders. As little 
red tape as possible is necessary to allow banks to make prudent 
business decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks have recognized they have a corporate community role 
in many small towns across the country.  They will not 
arbitrarily close branches.  They will make provisions such as 
did the Bank of Montreal with the sale of some of its branches to 
the credit union people.  This was a prudent business move. 
People did not lose their banking services.  The name changed but 
the services are still there.  This is just good business. I 
trust the government will allow the banks to make those decisions 
themselves as to how they want to structure their operations so 
that they can assure their shareholders that they will be able to 
do it by making money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state will get a chuckle out of this one.  He 
may think that I have more guts than brains talking about this, 
but there is nothing in Bill C-38 that addresses the very real 
problem of the taxation regime in which the banks are forced to 
operate.  The secretary of state knows that the banks, among all 
the corporations in Canada, are charged at more levels of tax 
than any other type of business in Canada.  Even companies like 
Bombardier, SNC Lavalin and Magna International have less 
structures of tax than banks do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the Canadian banks have been telling the 
government is that if it expects them, as domestic banks, to be 
able to compete in the global economy and take advantage of the 
opportunities, they need to be on a level playing field with 
other banks around the world.  The government has yet to address 
the very real problem Canadian banks have in their global 
competition goals, which is the taxation regime that they must 
operate under in this country.  We are surprised that the 
government has not addressed this in the same way that it has not 
addressed tax relief in so many other areas, whether it is 
personal income tax, corporate tax, fees, services or EI 
premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a government that is friendly to people who work 
hard to be successful and try to earn money.  It is the first one 
in line to penalize success.  It has been doing this to our 
banking institutions for years.  It has acted as a disincentive 
for our Canadian banks which have to compete on an uneven tax 
playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying that we will be supporting the bill.  We 
hope it passes in a timely fashion, as the Minister of Justice 
would like to pass some of her legislation in a timely fashion. 
We ask that the government look seriously at the amendments we 
will be putting forward.  We hope that a spirit of co-operation 
will prevail as we discuss our needs and the government discusses 
its bill passing needs as far as its timelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party will be actively involved in the process of Bill C-38 
as it moves along.

<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, 
I heard some applause.  It is a very odd way to start a 
pre-election period to have one of my Liberal colleagues applaud 
my rising to speak.  Should I assume that he will agree with 
everything I say about his government in the next few minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise and speak to this important bill.  It is an 
important bill because we have been waiting for it for over seven 
years, and that things kept being postponed in recent years.  I 
see the Secretary of State for International Financial 
Institutions, who was acting as chair of the Standing Committee 
on Finance at that point.  He knows what I am talking about on 
the subject of delays. There was a delay of at least two years in 
the government's introduction of a bill on financial 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone here can testify to the Bloc Quebecois' interest in 
this amendment to the laws on financial institutions.  Two and a 
half years ago, when Mr. McKay introduced his proposals, the Bloc 
Quebecois presented a submission to the Standing Committee on 
Finance.  Rather than question witnesses, that time we had 
decided to contribute to the debate on the amendments to 
legislation on banks and financial institutions in general by 
presenting a submission in more or less the following vein. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the way things are changing on the international 
scene, the first thing we notice is that they are moving very 
quickly with what they call the globalization of markets, 
especially with the increased opening up of a number of western 
countries in the financial sector, and the fact that, in the 
electronic commerce sector, the establishment of virtual banks is 
allowed.  Banks without a national base in certain countries 
serving a certain clientele are being allowed to open what are 
called virtual banks.  They offer consumers financial products 
without an actual physical location for the delivery of such 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International competition is heating up.  Even the six largest 
banks in Canada are small compared to American or certain Asian, 
particularly Japanese, banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed is a legislative environment conducive to 
increasing the ability of our financial institutions to hold 
their own against international competition as well as the 
competition that will inevitably begin to appear—and of which 
there are already signs—within the markets of Quebec and of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports the spirit of the legislation and 
several of its provisions.  The competitive environment calls out 
for a bill such as this, which amends the Bank Act and 
legislation governing financial institutions in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, there are a number of problems with this 
bill and we intend to move amendments at report stage.  I hope 
that members on the other side will give these amendments their 
attention, will note that we are open to 90% of what is in the 
bill; there is perhaps 10% of it that falls short and could be 
improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, and not least, it is clear from a reading of the many 
pages of this bill and its schedules, a weighty 900 pages or so, 
that far too much discretionary power rests in the hands of one 
man, the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the bill, whenever there are provisions concerning 
banks, insurance companies, trusts, anything to do with the 
financial sector, the minister always reserves the right to 
determine, based on criteria known to him alone, whether or not 
an operation is acceptable.  He alone defines certain concepts 
such as low-fee retail deposit accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Minister of Finance claims to be concerned 
about improving the access of the most disadvantaged in society 
to banking and other services, but he is still leaving himself 
room to define in future what would be best for the least well 
off, such as those living in certain poorer neighbourhoods in 
Montreal or other large cities, or certain remote, rural areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are way too many areas where the Minister of Finance, 
alone, has a decision making power and a power of life or death 
over certain transactions for us to be pleased with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, we would have liked more clarity regarding 
the decision making process and also more specifics regarding 
certain concepts, such as the minimum fee deposits for the poor. 
This is our first general comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second one concerns consumer protection. It goes without 
saying that we cannot be opposed to any measure seeking to 
increase consumer protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are opposed to provisions that duplicate and overlap 
those that are already included in the Quebec consumer protection 
act. Incidentally, consumer protection is an exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction. While there may be cases of specific protection 
with regard to banks, which fall under federal jurisdiction, 
consumer protection or the protection of privacy is, generally 
speaking, a provincial jurisdiction. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the bill constantly refers to new federal government 
initiatives in an area which, in the case of Quebec, is well 
covered by very comprehensive provincial legislation. We can 
think, among others, of the consumer protection act, the privacy 
act, the insurance act, the trust companies act, the Quebec 
savings banks act and the credit and securities act, all of which 
include provisions to ensure consumer protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There comes a time when a consumer no longer knows which 
legislation to turn to. 
Does the matter come under the jurisdiction of the federal 
government?  Does it involve the new consumer protection 
legislation contained in Bill C-38?  Or is it the Quebec consumer 
protection legislation which applies in this particular case? 
In short, in some respects, instead of improving consumer 
protection, I would say that certain clauses of Bill C-38 only 
add confusion.  A lesser understanding means, of necessity, 
lesser protection for the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another case concerns the protection of another category of 
consumers to which I have already referred, namely the most 
disadvantaged consumers.  The minister has taken the trouble to 
include in Bill C-38 the concept of the low-fee retail deposit 
account.  He says that it has long been argued that there are 
certain areas of major cities such as Montreal, Quebec City, 
Vancouver and Toronto that are greatly disadvantaged. 
So much so that when people in financial difficulty, people with 
less money than the Minister of Finance, the banks, and their 
branches in particular, show discrimination toward them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we undertook the process of reviewing the financial 
institutions legislation, we often ran into cases of people who 
had been totally denied permission to open an account because 
they did not have a fixed income, had not worked for some time, 
or could not produce any identification, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the minister is introducing his concept of the low-fee retail 
deposit account, but does not tell us what this will mean. 
This is a lovely concept that may appeal to certain consumer 
associations, but where is the minister headed with this 
“low-fee retail deposit account?”  Who will this “low-fee 
retail deposit account” be aimed at?  What sort of fee will it 
entail?  Will it really be available to those who, in the past, 
have had trouble getting quality services without being 
discriminated against? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that a bank operates in a competitive 
environment and that a bank is there to make profits.  We are 
not, nor have we ever been, against profits.  It must be borne in 
mind, however, that banks, like most financial institutions in 
Canada, are active in a very regulated, and therefore protected, 
environment.  They are protected by a decision of parliament: the 
public decided that the regulatory framework for Canadian banks 
would be a protective one. We would not want to let our banks go 
like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In return, banks have a responsibility to the public, as do 
those holding voting shares.  This concern with the 
responsibility of banks is absent from the bill.  We are not 
looking for measures that would make it impossible for banks to 
make profits.  But some effort is required, particularly 
since—as I mentioned—the banks are working within a regulatory 
framework decided by parliament.  Within parliament, people 
elected by the public decided to protect the banking sector.  I 
would say that the banks therefore have a certain duty to the 
community that is absent from the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to a real social and community role for banks, or 
to put it another way, if the banks are going to remember what 
they owe us for bringing in tight regulations to protect them, we 
would have liked the Minister of Finance to pay attention to our 
proposals, including the one from the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who introduced a bill on community 
reinvestment by banks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has been fighting this battle for a long time.  He brought us 
in the Bloc Quebecois into the fray.  We fight almost daily for 
community reinvestment in the most disadvantaged regions, the 
most remote regions in Quebec and in the rest of Canada, as well 
as in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Quebec and 
Canadian cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does community reinvestment mean?  It means—and it relates 
to a practice that has been in existence in the United States 
since the start of the 1970s—ensuring that certain banks are 
accountable to the community in specific regions or disadvantaged 
neighbourhoods in big Canadian cities.  It involves, for example, 
evaluating in a given year all of the deposits taken in by these 
banks in neighbourhoods where in recent years a rate of 
unemployment higher than the national average has been observed. 
It involves noting the deposits made in these banks by both 
individuals and businesses and the loans and advances given out 
by the branch to the community, in a disadvantaged community in 
Montreal for example, just to see whether a discrepancy does not 
exist between what it takes out and what it injects back into the 
community through loans and advances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a discrepancy, that is, if the branch in one of 
Montreal's poorest neighbourhoods, for example, took in more in 
deposits than it gave out in loans to individuals and advances 
and loans to SMBs in the neighbourhood, it would be considered to 
be a problem and the banks could be asked to make an extra effort 
to contribute to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks in this community reinvestment environment would be 
accountable to the local residents and to parliament.  At some 
point, an accumulation of bad reports on the banks or financial 
institutions in certain poor neighbourhoods in the major cities 
or in certain remote regions would provide sufficient authority, 
I would say, to influence in general terms community reinvestment 
by the banks right across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a local point of view, provisions for reinvestment in the 
community such as those in the bill introduced by my colleague, 
which we intend to introduce again through amendments to the 
banking bill, would also mean that representatives of the 
community could meet annually with managers of the bank branch in 
their neighbourhood or region to discuss the contribution it was 
making to the community, look for ways of improving things and 
identify mutually interesting projects that the community's 
deposits could be used to fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been a number of good results in the United States. 
It seems funny to be citing the United States as an example of 
progressive measures but, in the United States, making 
communities and banks accountable has meant that, at a certain 
point, the banks—and this is unusual, it is not often seen in 
Canada—became known for contributing to the advancement of 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, at one point, in certain of the poorest regions of the 
United States, some of the most down and out were allowed to cash 
government cheques for free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They went to those branches and there was no longer any charge 
for government cheques.  For the most disadvantaged, the fees 
charged for banking services were very low or not levied at all 
for the most common services. The banks had been offering this 
since the early 1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also agreed, after various discussions with the 
community, with representatives of bank branches in the United 
States, to freeze funds for a number of days or weeks.  When we 
met with consumer protection representatives, they told us that 
funds had been frozen for more than a week.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, based on a concept called community 
reinvestment requiring the banks to be accountable to the 
community, this led to certain provisions, among them ones 
including those forbidding branches from freezing funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on this development of community reinvestment, some U.S. 
banks even decided to reduce to a minimum the mortgage charges to 
first-time property owners. This they did as a result of 
discussions with the community on the possibility of a two-way 
relationship between the least well-off in the area served by the 
bank and the bank, since it stood to gain in the long term from 
the improved financial position of the members of its community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked to see the Minister of Finance take this 
type of novelty a little more seriously, not that it is really a 
novelty because it dates back to the 1970s in the United States. 
We would like him to lend an attentive ear to the arguments 
raised by my colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve and all the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois relating to the possibility of 
reinvesting in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking the banks to take over from the government. 
After the carnage wrought on social programs by this Liberal 
government, I believe we might even have been entitled to call 
upon the banks to compensate for it, but we are not, despite the 
billions of dollars in profit the banks are raking in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not against the banks making profits, as the banks' 
profits are also, to a certain extent, our profits. The trust 
funds, the pension funds of the people of Quebec and of Canada 
also make profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying instead is that the banks have the means of 
balancing out the deposits they receive with the reinvestment 
they can make in certain communities that are worse off than 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was another problem relating to the people who were the 
most disadvantaged and were living in the least advantaged areas 
of major cities, or in remote areas. 
The closure of branches of banks and financial institutions in 
general was, is and always will be the problem with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some regions do not or no longer have access to quality banking 
services, because branches were closed. It was no longer 
profitable for major Canadian banks to provide remote communities 
with complete services, as can be found in major centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are poor neighbourhoods in Montreal—earlier we mentioned 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve—where one must look hard to find a bank 
branch that provides full services. There are no longer such 
branches. Why? Precisely because it was not profitable for the 
banks to provide these services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the community groups that appeared before the committee 
raised this issue time and again, we expected the bill to include 
provisions to prevent, in certain communities, people from being 
treated like second class citizens, like nobodies, because they 
have less money than those living in neighbouring communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in this bill to prevent branch closures in 
those areas where poverty is a more serious issue than in other 
neighbourhoods or other regions of Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only measure included in this bill—and I doubt any consumer 
association will applaud this initiative—is a requirement to 
give a six month notice before closing a branch. But whether a 
branch closes immediately, or in two, three, four or six months, 
it will close at some point. Entire communities will get fewer 
and fewer services from Canadian financial institutions, 
particularly banks, because this bill includes no provision to 
protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointment of an ombudsman is a step in the right direction, but 
it is clearly not enough. The bill should show that the Minister of 
Finance wants to prevent people from not having access to banking 
services and to the so-called new economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no political will in this bill, not even the desire to 
find ways to prevent the most disadvantaged in our society from 
being totally excluded from the financial sector and the banking 
services available elsewhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the issues for consumers, the bill contains an 
enormous problem.  It concerns the ownership of Canada's major 
banks and major financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the Secretary of State for Financial Institutions 
discussing the importance of the flexibility given the financial 
institutions to enable them to continue their activities, to 
meet their competition and to respond to the development of new 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, however, a difference between the flexibility found in 
certain aspects of the bill and the fact that some of our 
financial institutions and banks could literally be given to 
foreigners, for example, or to a single investor, who could 
wield either total or partial powers of life and death over 
these institutions or their administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We supported flexibility from the start. Indeed, when we tabled 
our brief with the Standing Committee on Finance over two years 
ago, we proposed a more flexible regulatory framework in fact, 
so that the small and medium banks could join with other 
financial institutions, something the existing legislative 
framework does not currently permit, but the bill would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, a bank could join with a trust company, with an 
insurance company or with other stakeholders in the financial 
sector to create a sort of consortium, a firm that could meet 
the challenge of the major international institutions either in 
the Canadian market, because they will no doubt penetrate it, 
some of them already have—there is the MBNA, for example, and its 
virtual banks—or in international markets by ensuring that 
strategic alliances will give us significant blocks to meet the 
international competition there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to hand it to the Secretary of State for Financial 
Institutions, he did a good job.  I want to salute him in 
passing, because he chaired the Standing Committee on Finance 
for several years. 
He worked very hard on this bill and he delivered the goods when 
it comes to flexibility for financial institutions, strategic 
alliances and the right way of making them more competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I part company with him and with the Minister of Finance, 
however, is when it comes to bank ownership.  An individual's 
right to hold a certain percentage of shares varies with the size 
of these banks in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still have a lot of trouble with this and I have had no 
answers to the many questions I asked the Minister of Finance in 
meetings of the Standing Committee on Finance or here, during 
oral question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had no answers as to the reason for such amendments. Why, 
for instance, when it comes to the largest bank in Canada, the 
Royal Bank, will an individual now be able to hold 20% of shares? 
It has gone from 10% to 20% of voting shares.  Why is it that 
when it comes to the largest bank in Canada, it can now be 20%, 
but no more? The limit is set at 20%.  Does anyone know why? 
The reason is that it is dangerous, according to the Minister of 
Finance and the secretary of state, his spokesperson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is dangerous because an individual holding too many shares in 
a bank could have unprecedented power over the policies of that 
bank.  He could also create problems for market competitiveness. 
I will come back to this shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the percentage for the largest bank in Canada—a maximum 
of 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when it comes to the largest bank in Quebec, the National 
Bank, whose capitalization is in the middle range, an individual 
may hold 65% of voting shares. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1315

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this distinction?  I have asked this of the Minister of 
Finance.  Why different treatment?  When it is a matter of 
protecting a major Canadian bank, then the maximum is 20%, but 
when it is a matter of protecting the biggest Quebec bank, it can 
be up to 65% of voting shares.  It was enough to have 50% plus 1; 
with 65%, I do not know if the constitutional debate has so 
obscured people's vision that it is no longer seen that a 
majority for a single share holder is over 50%, that is 50% plus 
1.  Now it has gone up to 65%.  Even 50% plus 1 would have been 
too high anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of what is called diffuse bank ownership, i.e. 
allowing capital to be broadly distributed in the hands of a 
number of individuals, relates to several fundamental elements in 
the banking sector.  First of all, its stability, and second the 
fact that it might be unwise for a single individual to have 
considerable power over the savings of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental aspect underlying this division of ownership is 
to avoid cases of unfair competition, which I shall explain.  A 
rich industrialist in the manufacturing sector could buy up 65% 
of voting shares in a bank like the National Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are not familiar with it, the National Bank is the 
bank of small and medium sized businesses in Quebec.  It is the 
one that makes the most loans to these businesses.  The 
industrialist purchases 50% plus 1—no need of 65%—of the voting 
shares of the National Bank. 
That business person, who is involved in a given economic sector, 
could decide to refuse to lend money to someone who wants to 
borrow from the National Bank to invest in the same manufacturing 
sector in which the bank owner is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain things were possible in the past, are possible today and 
will be possible in the future. In fact, this is why, in the 
past, a single individual could not hold more than 10% of the 
shares of a bank. Currently, we can see at shareholders' meetings 
that a person who holds 10% of the shares of a bank has a great 
influence on the direction in which it is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we have a situation where a business person involved in a 
given sector could refuse to grant a loan to someone who wants to 
borrow from his bank, because that person is in the same 
industrial sector. The business person would in effect get rid of 
a competitor because he controls the capital and has the power to 
decide whether the other business person who wants a loan will 
survive or not. Such situations could occur in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the possibility of takeovers by foreign interests. 
Under the provisions of this bill, what would prevent the Royal 
Bank from being the target of a takeover bid? Why should we, in 
Quebec, put up with the risk that a foreign investor could get 
50% plus one of the shares of the National Bank, thus taking 
control of that institution, moving its head office and its 
decision making centre elsewhere, eliminating specialized jobs 
and adversely affecting Quebec's economy? We are not prepared to 
take such a risk and rather resent the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are asking that there be no difference between 
the treatment given to major Canadian banks and to our largest 
bank in Quebec. If the percentage of voting shares that can be 
held by a single individual is increased from 10% to 20% in the 
case of major Canadian banks, the same change must be made for 
Quebec's largest bank.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does it require an increase from 10% to 20%, as in the 
case of large banks, but if an individual had 10% of the voting 
shares and wanted to increase his share to 20%, he would be 
subject to what the minister calls at page 56 of the bill, in 
clauses 395 and 396, an “approval process”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A set of criteria would determine whether the fact of increasing 
one's holdings by ten percentage points met the following 
criteria.  I would add others, but I will begin by identifying 
those that are there.  I would also have some questions for the 
Minister of Finance and his secretary of state on a provision 
that strikes me as a bit odd.  There are no doubt answers, as 
the minister always has answers. 
They are not always the right ones, but we will not go into 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides that any particular transaction aimed at, for 
example, increasing by 10% the shares held by an individual 
would be subject to a set of criteria.  The minister identifies 
eight of them.  The first involves the minister considering: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) the nature and sufficiency of the financial resources of the 
applicant or applicants as a source of continuing financial 
support for the bank; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is right.  That is reasonable.  They cannot have anyone 
holding shares do just anything and interrupt the continuing 
business of the bank.  They will also consider: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) the soundness and feasibility of the plans of the applicant 
or applicants for the future conduct and development of the 
business of the bank; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This applies to amalgamations, combinations and the like.  Under 
the third criterion, the minister would consider: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>c</I>) the business record and experience of the applicant or 
applicants; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other criteria are: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>d</I>) the character and integrity of the applicant or applicants 
or, if the applicant or any of the applicants is a body 
corporate, its reputation for being operated in a manner that is 
consistent with the standards of good character and integrity; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>e</I>) whether the bank will be operated responsibly by persons 
with the competence and experience suitable for involvement in 
the operation of a financial institution; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is quite right. 
One must be very responsible, particularly with other people's 
money.  Let us not forget that these are our deposits in all the 
major Canadian banks. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>f</I>) the impact of any integration of the businesses and 
operations of the applicant or applicants with those of the bank 
on the conduct of those businesses and operations; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the clause that covers the particular case I mentioned 
earlier.  A business person buys the majority of shares in a 
bank and refuses to make a loan to a competitor in his 
industrial sector.  The minister will take this into account. 
There is nothing wrong with that. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>g</I>) the opinion of the Superintendent regarding the extent to 
which the proposed corporate structure of the applicant or 
applicants and their affiliates may affect the supervision and 
regulation of the bank, having regard to 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) the nature and extent of the proposed financial services 
activities to be carried out by the bank and its affiliates, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) the nature and degree of supervision and regulation 
applying to the proposed financial services activities to be 
carried out by the affiliates of the bank; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is normal.  They have to comply with certain rules.  Rules 
are made to be complied with.  So even without this criterion, 
should the superintendent decide that the applicant or 
applicants are not complying with the rules, the Minister of 
Finance will take this into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the same clause also includes the following provision: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>h</I>) the best interests of the financial system in Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see the Minister of Finance add other criteria 
to the bill.  We are going to move certain amendments to round 
them out. As members know, Quebec is now a distinct society. We 
are familiar with the historic words.  The Prime Minister has 
already admitted that Quebec is a distinct society.  The fact of 
the matter is that Quebec is indeed a distinct society 
financially.  It has jurisdictions and institutions to which it 
is attached.  The National Bank is an institution we wish to 
keep, particularly for its contribution to the economic and 
financial development of Quebec as a whole and of Montreal in 
particular as an international financial centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, Quebec's minister of finance, Mr. Landry, wrote a 
letter to his federal counterpart on June 7 to express his 
concerns about the new legislation and to ask for safeguards 
regarding the public interest of Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four criteria should be added. That is not asking too much. We 
know that with the very specialized and competent human resources 
that are available in the House of Commons we can draft 
provisions covering these four additional criteria, which would 
apply strictly to Quebec, given the special nature of the 
National Bank.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Quebec's minister of finance is asking that we take into 
account the changes that affect the banks' current operations, 
including the services available in Quebec and in Canada, because 
the minister does not mention the services available in his 
criteria. Service to consumers does not seem to be his main 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In proposing an increase in the percentage of the voting shares 
of a Quebec or Canadian financial institution held by an 
individual, the government should take into account the impact of 
that change on the level of the portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first additional criterion when the Minister of Finance 
decides whether or not he will accept that a shareholder can 
increase his share in a bank should be the impact of the change 
on the bank's current operations, including available services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second criterion that the Minister of Finance should add to 
the list that I mentioned earlier is the effect of the change on 
employment. 
That is important.  Why is employment not considered in the 
criteria proposed to us by the Minister of Finance in clause 396? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean that employment is not important for the 
Liberals, for the Minister of Finance and for the Prime Minister? 
Not important to them?  Minister Landry and the Bloc Quebecois 
are calling for an examination of the effects on employment of 
this additional participation relating to voting shares, both at 
headquarters and in the branches, including professional 
positions and those requiring specialized expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to maintain these specialized resources if we 
want to have financial strength for Quebec.  These are not to be 
found on every street corner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third criterion is the effect of change on the economy and 
the technological development of Quebec.  This too is important. 
On the Canadian level, this does not even appear to be the object 
of any specific criteria for the federal Minister of Finance. 
This is scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the effect of change in the financial sector of Quebec 
and the role of Montreal as a financial centre, particularly as 
far as keeping final decision-making centred in Montreal is 
concerned.  These criteria must be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to inform hon. members that the Bloc Quebecois will be 
presenting amendments for this purpose at the report stage, in 
order to ensure that this important bill is complete.  With a bit 
of good will from the other side, that could be accomplished.  We 
support this bill overall, but the three points to which I have 
referred are so problematical that they will force us to vote 
against it tomorrow morning.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I welcome you back for another continuation of this 
session of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are starting this leg of this session of parliament with a 
very interesting bill before the House, Bill C-38.  It is a bill 
to make a number of changes to the financial institutions in our 
country.  It is a rather historic bill with some 900 pages.  I 
understand it is the most voluminous bill we have ever dealt with 
in the history of this country, some 900 pages and the 
consequential changes which affect about 4,000 pages of existing 
legislation.  In addition, there are many things in the bill that 
are left as orders in council and guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is anyone in the House who can pretend that 
we have a good grasp of the overall impact of the bill.  The 
minister, if he says he does, is very unique because the 
bureaucrats tell me that there is no one who has a total grasp of 
all aspects of the bill, including all the experts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many experts of course who have expertise in various 
parts of the bill but no one can really tie it together in terms 
of all the consequences.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very comprehensive bill.  Where did it come from?  In 
1996 the government established a task force headed by Mr. 
Baillie, replaced later on by Mr. MacKay of Regina, to look at 
financial institutions and make recommendations to parliament and 
to the Minister of Finance to reform and change our financial 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That task force went on from 1996 to 1998 at a cost of $3.5 
million.  It made a comprehensive and sweeping set of 
recommendations to the Parliament of Canada.  The finance 
committee undertook hearings on the MacKay task force 
recommendations in October, November and December 1998, if I 
recall correctly.  We also made our recommendations to parliament 
and to the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance issued a paper in June 1999 in which 
it made some comments and 57 recommendations arising out of the 
report.  In the year 2000 we finally have before the House this 
very voluminous bill that makes all kinds of changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a bill of this sort there are many positives and negatives. 
Our party will be voting against it on second reading and will 
continue to take that position unless a number of fairly sweeping 
changes are made to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into some of the negatives, I want to say that 
there are also a number of positives.  The bill expands access to 
the payment system in the country.  The payment system is there 
for the chartered banks.  Bill C-38 will expand access to that 
system, in particular to the insurance companies, some of the 
brokerage houses and other financial institutions.  We see this 
as a positive step in terms of competition in the financial 
industry.  It is something that is supported by the insurance 
industry and others as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another positive aspect of the bill is the expanded powers for 
our credit union movement.  The credit union movement comes under 
provincial jurisdiction today.  The legislation would allow them 
to have a national service entity where we could have easier 
transactions made from province to province.  A member of 
parliament for example from Nova Scotia could go out to B.C. and 
do his banking in a credit union more easily than now because 
credit unions are currently regulated on a provincial basis and 
not on a federal basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also some talk about the possible creation of a credit 
union bank.  This was a recommendation of the MacKay task force. 
It is not in this legislation, primarily because there is no 
consensus, as I understand it, in the credit union or 
co-operative movement on whether or not it is the right way to 
go.  I think there is an openness in the House and in the 
government to the idea of a national credit union bank if indeed 
there is consensus evolving in the credit union movement and if 
the minister nods his approval to that.  That would come some 
time in the weeks, months or years ahead.  That is certainly a 
good possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current legislation a credit union could own a bank. 
For example, the Van City Credit Union could buy or operate a 
bank but the bank would have to be a subsidiary of the credit 
union and not owned directly by individual members of the credit 
union.  This gets us into some of the detailed debating we will 
be having in the committee if the bill goes there in the next few 
days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the idea of a financial services ombudsman.  When it 
comes to the ombudsman it is a step in the right direction.  We 
now have an ombudsman funded by individual banks and therefore 
there is a built-in conflict of interest in a real sense and in a 
perceived sense.  The new financial ombudsman would not be a 
creation of the banks.  It would have an independent board that 
is not drawn from the federal government or the banks.  It would 
operate independently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A concern I have about the ombudsman—and we will get to it in 
committee as well—is that I do not think it has enough power to 
enforce some of the findings that occur in terms of a levelling 
of fines and sanctions on banking institutions that may violate 
the rules and regulations pertaining to those institutions.  We 
will be looking at more details from the minister at committee 
stage, but at least we have the establishment of a financial 
service institution which is a positive step in the right 
direction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me reminisce.  In 1989 an old friend of mine, the then 
member for Nickel Belt, John Rodriguez, introduced in the House a 
private member's bill to establish an office of the financial 
ombudsman or banking ombudsman that had sweeping powers to look 
out for consumers and to impose fines and sanctions on financial 
institutions that violated the rules and regulations.  Some 
progress has been made, but hopefully we can strengthen it at 
committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the bill that is going in a positive direction is some 
of the consumer protection agencies.  They are very timid in my 
opinion.  We now have the possibility of a lifeline account where 
some four to twelve transactions in a bank account are free of 
charge.  If I understand correctly, it also says that no one can 
be denied a bank account as long as he or she has two pieces of 
identification and as long as there is no fraud.  One cannot be 
denied a bank account whether the person is poor, unemployed or 
whatever.  A lot of people now have difficulty establishing a 
bank account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very vague in terms of what is actually in the 
legislation and of the details for individual banks.  My 
understanding is that there will be negotiations between the new 
consumer agency and individual banks.  There will be a memorandum 
of standing, an MOU, signed with each individual bank which might 
differ from bank to bank or financial institution to financial 
institution in terms of their obligations.  The minister 
confirmed that as well.  We want to scrutinize that carefully to 
make sure we can maybe strengthen it on behalf of consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another positive aspect in the legislation is something for 
which we have lobbied for a long time.  It does not expand the 
power of banks to get into auto leasing or the sale of insurance. 
Members will recall a lobby a couple of years ago when this idea 
was floated, particularly by the MacKay report when it 
recommended that banks be allowed to sell insurance and get into 
the auto leasing business.  There was quite a lobby in the 
country and we were all contacted.  The influence of that lobby 
has paid off and that provision is not in the legislation today. 
That is a very positive step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the positive aspects of the bill.  Some are 
not as strong as we had hoped, but at least they are steps in the 
right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to some of the concerns.  My major concern is the 
changing of the wide ownership rule.  I am afraid this opens the 
door to more concentration of who owns the banking institutions 
and to foreign control and influence in our banking institutions. 
This has been a debate in cabinet.  I would like to make sure 
that Canadians know this fairly radical change is being 
suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current legislation nobody can own more than 10% of 
the banking shares in any bank.  All a wealthy individual can buy 
is 10% of the Royal Bank or 10% of the Bank of Montreal.  This 
rule was brought in to parliament in the mid-1960s by the Pearson 
government when the Chase Manhattan Bank was in the process of 
trying to buy the Toronto-Dominion Bank.  There was great concern 
about losing our financial institutions so the House of Commons 
brought in the 10% and 25% rule.  No individual could have more 
than 10% of the shares in any bank and foreigners, put together, 
could not have more than 25% of the shares of a bank.  The 25% 
rule went by the way with the signing of the free trade agreement 
with the United States.  That has been gone now for a few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the 10% rule still applies.  The government will raise the 
10% to 20% for voting shares and the 10% to 30% for non-voting 
shares, opening the door for more concentration in the banking 
industry and for more billionaires or wealthy banks in the United 
States to buy huge chunks of Canadian banks and therefore have 
control over the Canadian banking industry.  I do not think that 
is the way the Canadian people want to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are already concerned that we have given away too much 
of our national sovereignty.  We have sold out too much of our 
country.  We have erased too much of the border.  I think 
Canadians are saying that we should not get rid of the 10% rule 
and should make sure Canadian banking institutions remain in the 
hands of Canadians and regulated by the Parliament of Canada on 
behalf of the Canadian people.  I think that is the way we ought 
to go.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are saying maybe we need this kind of change to compete 
in the world.  Our banks are actually pretty large on the world 
scale.  We have some of the largest banks in the world today, 
ranking 15th, 16th or 20th in terms of size.  If our banks need 
to be bigger to compete in the world, for economy of scale, they 
could form a consortium.  They would still have the same effect 
and efficiencies as if we were to change the rule in terms of 
amalgamating with other banks and ownership changes.  We could 
do the same by consortium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I am concerned about is the ownership rule.  The 
government has decided to categorize banks into three different 
categories:  large, medium and small. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  It may be a good idea, but I have 
some questions about the rules pertaining to each of these three. 
A large bank is any bank with equity over $5 billion.  That 
includes the big five Bank of Montreal, Royal Bank, TD Bank, 
Scotiabank and CIBC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is a mid-size bank with equity between $1 billion and 
$5 billion.  My friend from the Bloc Quebecois was referring to 
this.  That includes la Banque Nationale which is a fairly large 
bank based in the province of Quebec, the Banque Laurentienne and 
the Bank of Western Canada.  The wide ownership rule does not 
apply to them.  For them, only 35% of the equity or voting shares 
have to be widely held.  In other words, an individual could 
purchase 65% of the shares of la Banque Nationale, the Banque 
Laurentienne or the Bank of Western Canada.  That is a real 
concern in the province of Quebec and elsewhere.  Why would we 
have different rules apply to these banks which are a bit smaller 
than those which apply to the Royal Bank, CIBC and Bank of 
Montreal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chase Manhattan Bank or Citibank of New York could buy la 
Banque Nationale just like that.  The headquarters would go out 
of Quebec and Canada and we would lose an important part of our 
banking industry.  Why has the minister decided to have different 
rules and regulations for mid-size banks compared with big banks? 
Why can the minister himself change the rules?  Why is 
parliament not supreme in changing those kinds of rules? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a third category of bank called the small banks. 
They are banks with equity of under $1 billion.  There are no 
restrictions at all on the ownership of small banks.  The hon. 
member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys could start a 
bank.  It could go up to $1 billion with no restriction on 
ownership.  He could give it away as a gift to one of his friends 
in Finland or wherever he wants.  There are no rules or 
restrictions at all.  We could have the bank of Tim Hortons 
across the country.  There could be the bank of Safeway or Loblaws. The 
bank of Tim Hortons could be the biggest bank if it keeps on 
going the way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no rules or regulations.  It is totally unrestricted 
with regard to ownership.  We are asking why there is this great 
change and this great difference between small, medium and large 
banks.  This is of particular interest in the province of Quebec 
with la Banque Nationale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outside the wide ownership rule a second concern I have with the 
legislation as written is that far too much power is being given 
to the Minister of Finance.  I see the parliamentary secretary 
across the way shaking his head.  We have seen a disturbing trend 
for the last 20 or 30 years.  More and more power is taken from 
the Parliament of Canada which represents the people of the 
country and put in the hands of the Minister of Finance, other 
ministers and in effect in many cases in the hands of senior 
bureaucrats.  The parliamentary secretary can confirm that the 
Minister of Finance can change some of these ownership rules with 
the stroke of a pen without going back to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect the minister has become a banking czar who can 
determine many things such as whether or not, for example, a 
merger will go ahead.  In the legislation there is now a process 
for mergers, but it is only a process for mergers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1345

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the minister himself or herself, whoever that minister may 
be, who will make a decision about mergers in the future, whether 
it is a good merger or a bad merger, according to the process 
that is set in place.  Why should that not be parliament?  Why 
should it not be the finance committee that recommends to 
parliament whether or not a merger is good or bad for the people 
of this country?  Why not democratize this institution and make 
meaningful the role of a member of parliament elected by the 
people?  Yet, this power is concentrated in the hands of the 
Minister of Finance concerning mergers, acquisitions, ownership 
rules and many other things.  In this bill of 900 pages, the 
power is with the new banking czar, the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some Liberals across the way say that we have a very competent 
Minister of Finance.  Even if we concede that, and that is very 
questionable because no human being should have that power, he 
will not be the Minister of Finance for much longer.  There will 
soon be somebody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we want to give this kind of power to the member for Wild 
Rose, for example, if he becomes Minister of Finance, or to the 
member for Brandon—Souris if he becomes the Minister of Finance? 
That is what is written in the legislation.  This bill is saying 
to hand power over to the Minister of Finance to make important 
decisions over mergers, acquisitions, ownership rules, 
regulations and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when it comes to the banking ombudsman, the guidelines are 
not written.  There have been memoranda of understanding.  There 
will be all kinds of rules and regulations that are still being 
debated and decided by the Minister of Finance and sometimes not 
even recommended by the cabinet of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going in the wrong direction in terms of the lack of 
power in the House of Commons and about authority being taken out 
of the House of Commons and transferred to the Minister of 
Finance and transferred to bureaucrats, however competent they 
may be.  That power should be here in the House because we are 
responsible to the people and we are accountable every three, 
four or five years to the people in our ridings. That is where 
the power should reside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the consumer agencies.  I think that in principle 
many of these agencies are going in the right direction. I do not 
think they have enough power or legislative clout to adequately 
protect consumers.  Many of the rules and regulations are still 
being decided in terms of guidelines and the memorandum of 
understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred already to mergers to a certain extent.  We have in 
the bill the guidelines and the process as to what must happen 
when a merger occurs.  These guidelines are common sense 
guidelines in terms of a public debate.  We need a process where 
the details are revealed as to why the parties want to merge and 
the like.  It is the Minister of Finance who has the power.  It 
would be similar to what happened in 1998-99 when the TD and the 
CIBC wanted to merge and when the Royal Bank and the Bank of 
Montreal wanted to merge.  It was the Minister of Finance after 
pressure from the public, instigated primarily by our party and 
our friends on the progressive side of the Canadian population, 
who started to make this an issue across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my last minute, there is nothing here to establish a 
community reinvestment act.  There is nothing here that will 
prevent bank branch closures except the notice in the cities of 
four months or a notice in the rural areas of six months, but 
there is no empowerment of the community that would prevent a 
closure if that bank branch were profitable, so again it is a 
Mickey Mouse approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point is that there is nothing here in terms of taxes 
on banks.  We all heard the news a while back where the Minister 
of Finance, because of current changes in the tax system based on 
1999 profit levels, was giving the banks an extra tax cut of $500 
million a year.  These are the most profitable companies in the 
country and yet they are getting big tax cuts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have a comment concerning Bill C-38.  First, let me congratulate 
the minister as well as his department on introducing legislation 
which will ensure competition as well as choice for consumers of 
financial services in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point focuses on some of the comments made by the minister 
which now exist in the proposal dealing with MacKay task force 
recommendation 22. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MacKay task force stated that further legislation should 
permit co-operative banks and other financial institutions to be 
chartered as new institutions with ownership and governance to be 
based on co-operative principles, subject to compliance with 
applicable provincial legislation.  Provincial credit union and 
credit union centrals should be able to continue as co-operative 
banks under the Bank Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House committee on finance as well as the Senate banking 
committee have both agreed with the task force recommendations. I 
understand that the bill already provides some additional 
flexibility as well as scope for the credit unions.  I was quite 
encouraged to hear the minister stating that the Department of 
Finance is committed to continuing to work with the credit unions 
and co-operatives, so they can pursue more the co-operative bank 
model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to working with the minister and the finance 
committee to see that the co-operative movement gets involved 
with this legislation as it passes through the legislative 
process.  It is my hope that they will take into consideration 
their comments and their input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am sorry, I missed 
the last comment of the member for Ottawa Centre. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to my hon. 
colleague who as usual gave a very profound address in terms of 
the nature of this omnibus legislation.  He pointed out the 
reasons why we are concerned about a number of features, one 
which makes the Minister of Finance virtually a banking and 
financial czar of the country.  As capable as he may be, this 
obviously causes Canadians some concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member.  A number of American states 
have legislation that would require a bank that takes in deposits 
from a particular region to reinvest in that particular zone.  In 
other words, if we take money from a particular region or 
community, we are obligated to write loans to benefit the 
businesses or people of the particular area.  It is called the 
community reinvestment act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my friend across the way is aware of the act.  It is 
something we have been pushing for.  The member mentioned in his 
presentation that it is absent from this legislation.  Can he see 
any reason why it is absent?  If not, is it something that the 
government ought to consider amending or perhaps we can assist by 
presenting an amendment later in the process ourselves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, rest assured there will 
be an amendment for a community reinvestment act.  There is no 
reason why we could not do what a number of American states are 
doing and require a bank to invest a certain amount of their 
portfolio in the region or the state or the area from where they 
get their funds from the ordinary people, which would lead to 
economic development in the particular area.  It is called the 
community reinvestment act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why it has not been done before.  Maybe it is 
because the banks are big contributors to the Liberal Party. They 
are putting a lot of money into its campaign fund.  I also notice 
that it is not just the Liberal Party any more.  I noticed that 
the new leader of the Alliance, that Fred Flintstone on 
rollerblades, is having a fundraiser in Toronto very soon.  They 
are charging $25,000 a table.  Those tables will be bought by 
wealthy bankers, wealthy business executives and CEOs.  That 
shows that the Reform Party, now the Alliance, has lost touch 
with its grassroots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for those reasons that we do not have a community 
reinvestment act.  The bankers contribute to the funds of the 
Liberal Party, and now the Alliance Party.  They try to govern in 
the interests of the big bankers and the wealthy in this country. 
Imagine that, $25,000 a table.  I can hardly believe what I read 
this morning in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I know you were paying attention to my colleague's remarks, but I 
think he erred when he said that the Canadian Alliance was 
actually having a fundraiser where people were paying $2,500 for 
a table.  Surely he must be wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian

passed Bill C-34, the new grain transportation legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it came into effect on August 1 our grain transportation 
system has begun to crumble.  Rail cars are not being delivered 
promptly because the Canadian Wheat Board continues to control 
and dictate to farmers and companies where the rail cars will be 
delivered.  This is costing farmers money as they incur increased 
storage costs and are trucking their grain further distances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the new legislation, the Canadian Wheat Board is to 
tender 25% of its annual capacity.  The wheat board put out its 
initial tender asking for 250,000 tonnes of grain.  It received 
contracts for only 7% of their proposal.  This tendering system 
is not working because the wheat board has too much control over 
grain transportation.  Tendering agreements will only work if 
there is a completely commercial and contract based system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is completely responsible for the loss of $300 
million to farmers because of this flawed transportation system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the story of Eric Lamaze is a story of success and 
accomplishment rather than failure.  His first exposure to 
cocaine was as a fetus.  His mother was a cocaine addict and he 
was effectively a street kid from the beginning of his life.  He 
has no father; his mother does not even know who his father is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there have been a few bumps in the road, through 
determination and hard work Eric Lamaze has overcome his 
disability. All the medical experts agree that his success is a 
miracle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were catastrophic circumstances surrounding his latest 
infraction which was put before an independent adjudicator, 
Professor Ratushny.  No party at the hearing disputed the 
catastrophic circumstances surrounding the infraction.  No party 
disputed the overwhelming medical evidence. The legal process ran 
its course and Professor Ratushny has agreed on the basis of all 
the evidence that Mr. Lamaze was not responsible for the 
catastrophic circumstances that led to his latest infraction.  It 
is therefore no surprise that Professor Ratushny has reinstated 
Mr. Lamaze effective immediately without conditions.

1.5 kilometres, biked 40 kilometres and ran 10 kilometres to win 
Olympic gold.  He was in 28th place after the swim, 27th after 
biking and 1st at the finish line. I was awestruck as I watched 
him turn the final corner and unleash incredible energy to sprint 
past his opponent as the finish line came into sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing greater than the energy he found to sprint into 
first place was his love for Canada.  Simon was overcome with 
emotion as our national anthem was played and our flag was raised

</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the mine is watertight, which it is not, this is no 
solution for urban garbage.  The only way to deal with garbage is 
to reduce, reuse and recycle it.  Dumping garbage is like 
scratching a festering sore; it makes the problem worse.  Putting 
garbage out of sight and out of mind makes the real problem, the 
production of garbage, even more difficult to deal with.  In this 
case the extraordinary cost of shipping garbage to northern 
Ontario makes things worse.

decision at least until metro becomes a national and

recognized Dufresne's talent and sought him out as his private

Canada CEO Robert Milton made a 180 day commitment to improve 
customer satisfaction as a result of his chaotic merger with 
Canadian Airlines.  He certainly has his work cut out for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For air travellers this has been a summer of discontent plagued 
by repeated cancellations, numerous delays, lost luggage, a 
reduction in service and a threatened pilots strike.  Even the 
transport minister and his luggage arrived at different

</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes more than a glossy public relations campaign to fix 
what is wrong with Canada's airline industry.  While the Canadian 
Alliance encourages Mr. Milton's initiatives, we are steadfast in 
our commitment to competition and fair business practices.  On 
that note, I encourage the Competition Bureau to resolve the 
allegations of predatory pricing and unfair competition against 
Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the transport committee to invite Mr. Milton to appear 
at the end of his 180 day campaign to present his progress to 
Canadians through their elective representatives. Then Canadians

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, winter is 
coming and soaring fuel costs mean that Canadians spend more 
money on energy and transportation than on food and clothing 
combined.  In northern Canada one community has been forced to 
lay off staff in order to pay for heating fuel.  Transportation 
has always been expensive in the north but with rising fuel costs 
it will become impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government no longer regulates energy prices or even 
monitors gasoline prices.  This allows unaccountable oil 
companies to set prices with no concern for the hardship they

called on the Government of Canada to ensure that the cost of 
home heating, transportation and electricity remain affordable 
for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Already our fears have come true.  Since the federal government 
transferred responsibility of the wharf to the Maritime Harbours 
Society, docking fees have increased significantly and services

Speaker, first I would like to thank the member from Pickering 
who raised this subject a lot sooner than any member of the 
Alliance or Reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made it very clear that if there is going to be a cut in 
gas taxes it must go into the pockets of Canadians, not into the 
pockets of oil companies. That means the size of that cut must be 
substantial which will require federal-provincial co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said that we are quite prepared to sit down with the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

not like that in his pocket.  In the finance minister's 1995 
budget he upped the gas tax by a cent and a half every litre.  He 
said he did that to help reduce the deficit. The deficit has been 
gone for two years now but the tax is not.

of the particular debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out for the hon. member that we have 
cut taxes substantially.  If you take a look, Mr. Speaker, we as

day motion which will call for lower gas taxes.  The government 
charges GST on its own tax on gas.  We want that to stop. The

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be very clear.  There is a lot of pain out there for 
people who are paying for home heating fuel, for people who are 
paying for gas at the pump.  The real problem is that oil prices 
are too high and it is going to take international concentration 
to make sure that we get those taxes down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the things we will be discussing at the G-7

Mr. Speaker, the finance minister said that he has dealt with the

has done it by soaking gas consumers with the GST tax on tax.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me simply say that the issue of GST on gasoline taxes, an

Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. member for Medicine Hat is 
pleased with that and the fact that his appointment as critic has 
scared off the foreign affairs minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this minister to raise the GST is really something special. 
This is from the government that was going to scrap, kill and 
abolish the GST.  This is the same government that told us in a 
report that it would “consider removing the GST from other taxes 
and apply it only to the wholesale price for gasoline in the 
retailer margin”.  That is what the liberal caucus report said 
two years ago.  There has been no action on that to this date.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

dismissed and no action was taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet just last week the HRDC minister said that new rules under

well as plans for renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some progress has been made.  We acknowledge that in terms of 
past transfers.  However we also know that the future of

expressly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our question today is simply to try to find out when the

to national home care and pharmacare.  When will the minister 
live up to the words he said in March 1998, that home care is the 
next frontier for medicare?

to this agreement, which means a 35% increase in federal cash

for information technology to integrate the system and make it

agreement.  The last people, of course, ought to be Alliance 
Party members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives and the Alliance in their election platforms 
in 1997 said that if they were ever elected they would change the 
system so that all the money through tax points would go to the 
provinces and Ottawa would have no role and no means of ensuring 
the principles of the Canada Health Act are respected.  That 
would be the end of medicare in the country.  That would be the 
end of access across Canada to health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member, his party and the Alliance should be ashamed of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr.

he be proud of that record?

good news for Canadian health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,

and participant in renewing medicare.

government is prepared to accept.  The member opposite is free 
to put it in his name, because the initiative was his.  I would 
be in full agreement with that.  A motion acceptable to the 
government would read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That at 6:30 p.m. this evening, or at the end of consideration 
of Bill C-38 now before the House, the House will not proceed to 
adjournment proceedings pursuant to Standing Order 38, but will 
continue to sit for the purpose of considering Motion No. M-428; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion was moved by the hon. member for Roberval, the Bloc 
Quebecois House leader.  The motion continues as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, during the said debate, no member may speak for more than 
20 minutes, followed by a 10-minute question-and-comment period, 
provided that the Standing Orders respecting the division of 
speaking times shall apply; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, during the said debate, the Chair shall receive no call 
for quorum, dilatory motion or request for unanimous consent, 
and that when no member rises to speak, the House shall adjourn 
until the next sitting day. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Agreements are being worked out on the floor of the 
House of Commons. I will hear from the member for Roberval for a 
few seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know you like it when we get 
along well here in the House.  I know that you will not prevent 
me from getting along well with my hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, the government is refusing to give its 
consent for a vote.  It is agreeing to a debate this evening, 
but does not want a vote.  Is that what I am to understand? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> So let it refuse.  We asked— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please.  Members can see what happens when

relating to organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to be prudent, since this is of such importance to us, 
I sent you a letter earlier today indicating that, if unanimous 
consent were refused by the government, I would appeal to the

that we be allowed an emergency debate this evening on this

(<I>a</I>) has the government taken action to investigate reports 
that these foods may cause medical problems such as autoimmune 
thyrodoiditis, birth defects, malignancies, and other types of 
diseases because of the hormone-like effects of some soy

</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> (a) and (b) The 
government has investigated the reports on medical problems 
allegedly caused by soy based infant formula and it has reviewed 
the scientific literature related to this issue. With the 
exception of infants with rare medical conditions, such as soy 
allergy and congenital hypothyroidism, it was concluded that 
these foods do not pose a risk to those infants that consume 
them. The government is continuing to monitor the scientific 
literature for evidence of any health related concerns associated 
with soy based formula and its constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently published preliminary results from a large 
retrospective study that has followed up adults who were fed soy 
based formula as infants indicates no significant differences 
between individuals fed soy formula compared to those fed cow 
milk based formula in the following variables: weight and height, 
measurements of precocity and a large number of reproductive and 
non-reproductive outcomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) We are not aware of a requirement from the World Health 
Organization for a health warning on the labels of baby foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to soy based infant formulas, Health Canada does not 
recommend their use for the routine feeding of babies. The 
statement of the joint working group of the Canadian Paediatric 
Society, Dietitians of Canada and Health Canada, Nutrition for 
Healthy Term Infants, published in 1998, emphasizes that 
breastfeeding is the optimal method of feeding infants and 
encourages exclusive breastfeeding for at least the first four 
months of life. Cow's milk based infant formulas are recommended 
as the standard product for healthy term infants who are not 
breastfed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nutrition for Healthy Term Infants states that soy based 
formulas should be used only for those infants who cannot take 
dairy based products for health, cultural or religious reasons, 
such as a vegan lifestyle, or galactosemia, a metabolic disorder 
where infants are unable to metabolize galectose, a sugar in 
milk. This reiterates the recommendation that was made in 
“Feeding Babies” published by Health and Welfare Canada in 
1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nutrition for Healthy Term Infants also states that soy protein 
based formulas are inappropriate for infants who are not 
breastfed and who are at high risk of atopic disease or for those 
infants with a documented allergy to cow's milk protein. The 
formulas that should be used in these instances are formulas 
based on hydrolyzed milk protein; for infants with documented 
milk allergies, the protein should be extensively hydrolyzed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B> With respect to the proposed regulations to change the 
employment insurance boundaries based on statistical data on 
unemployment rates in New Brunswick, the response is as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) The statistical data was provided by a public source; (b) 
The name of the public source is Statistics Canada. 
(c) The data was evaluated using regression analysis and mapping 
of aggregated and disaggregated indicators. 
(d) The data came from the 1996 census, from neighbourhood 
income and demographics data for 1997 and from labour force 
survey data up to April 2000; 
(e) No analysis was made of which federal ridings will be 
affected by these changes; 
(f) Basic census data are collected for all households in Canada 
and from one out of every five households on topics such as 
education, ethnicity, mobility, income and employment; 
neighbourhood income and demographics data are produced by 
Statistics Canada on an aggregated basis from all income tax 
returns filed; the Labour Force Survey is a monthly survey which 
is based on over 50,000 households in Canada; (g) All areas of 
New Brunswick were covered by the data. (h) All workers in Canada 
were covered by the data, numbering 15,047,895 workers; (i) There 
was no analysis done on full time workers compared to other 
workers; (j) There was no analysis done on part time workers 
compared to other workers; (k) Seasonal employment was 
approximated on the basis of whether workers were employed for 26 
weeks or less in the year, producing an estimate of 3,016,430 
seasonal workers in Canada and 114,075 in New Brunswick. 
(l) There was no special data collection or cnsultation aimed at 
major employers in New Brunswick or elsewhere, aside from the 
overall opportunity for public comments.

<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORGANIZED CRIME 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have received two applications for 
emergency debates. I received two letters today.  The first one I 
received was from the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough 
and the second one was from the member for Roberval.  I will hear 
the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough first because it 
deals basically with the same subject.  I will then hear the hon. 
member for Roberval. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this Progressive Conservative request is to augment 
and buttress the arguments that were made earlier by my friend 
from Roberval.  This is completely associated with the same 
issue, the growing crisis of organized crime in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is probably not a single member of the House or very few 
Canadians who are not aware of what is taking place throughout 
the country.  This is not in any way meant to torque up the 
debate but to bring it into a tangible form in the House where we 
can discuss these issues as we should in the Parliament of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an emerging crisis with respect to Asian triads, east 
bloc Mafia, traditional crime families and biker gangs who are 
infiltrating our communities throughout the country.  I say for 
my friends in Quebec that this is not just a Quebec issue.  This 
is something we are seeing in an acute way in the province of 
Quebec around Montreal in particular but there have recently been 
reports of biker turf wars happening in Kingston, Ontario.  It is 
happening on the west coast to a large degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kingston, Ontario is the area with the highest concentration of 
federal prisons in Canada yet there are no deterrents for what is 
taking place.  Potential criminals are being released from these 
prisons right into the waiting arms of organized crime families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP commissioner raised this issue in his earliest remarks 
when he was appointed to that position.  Two weeks ago new RCMP 
Commissioner Zaccardelli stated that organized crime 
organizations have drafted plans to use bribes to destabilize the 
country's parliament.  This is happening to a significant effect 
and is something we have to address in this place.  It is 
something the Government of Canada has an innate responsibility 
to deal with by bringing it to the forefront through a debate 
where we can discuss methods to approach organized crime in a 
significant way, the resources required and the strategy in terms 
of legislation. The provincial attorneys general are similarly 
calling for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We urge the government to act and to act swiftly.  I urge the 
Chair to deem this emergency debate necessary.  I would be 
prepared to move the motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Usually when we make interventions they are 
quite concise.  I have read the letters from both members. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the hon. member for Roberval to make his request. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the murder 
attempt on journalist Michel Auger in Quebec last week was the 
latest in a series of unfortunate events, to say the least, that 
have led us to make the following statement: some 150 persons 
have been assassinated in the course of the biker war in Quebec 
in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attempt on Mr. Auger was the limit and makes it clear just 
how much organized crime and criminal organizations have become 
an unacceptable presence in our society—a presence that of 
itself is unacceptable—but of a significance today that makes 
all the more unacceptable the action they have taken, what they 
are doing and what they will do in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot was 
threatened because he reported the cultivation of marijuana on 
farms in his region. Last week a journalist was attacked because 
he wrote about organized crime.  Sometimes—according to a 
federal report—judges are threatened.  This points to the 
extreme importance of the matter.  There is no place better than 
the House of Commons to consider this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code must be amended and put at the disposal of the 
forces of order and justice whatever means they need to get these 
criminals, these people belonging to criminal gangs, sentenced. 
Let us not forget—and it is regrettable to say—that most of the 
proceedings initiated against these people have met with failure 
because it was too hard to come up with the evidence.  There is 
vast evidence, and reference to the charter of rights and the use 
of arguments of all sorts mean that the legal system can no 
longer produce the evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, we sincerely believe that the federal parliament 
must not only debate this matter.  We would have liked to have 
the House of Commons vote on this so as to be perfectly clear, to 
have each member asked to rise and say what he or she thinks of 
this matter: should the federal parliament and the Government of 
Canada amend the criminal code?  That is what we thought, but we 
would agree to there at least being a debate of this issue, to 
our sharing viewpoints and to this helping the government decide 
and respond to this urgent request from the people of Quebec.

pleasure to be in the chair while I give my dissertation on Bill 
C-38. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I thank the hon. member for bringing to the attention of 
the House that it is the birthday of the late Right Hon. Mr. John 
Diefenbaker.  It is not just useful information for members of 
the House, but for Canadians in general.  We recognize the 
importance of Mr. Diefenbaker and the Conservative Party back 
when Mr. Diefenbaker was the leader, and certainly the history 
that the Conservative Party brought to this country all the way 
back to Confederation.  I thank the hon. member for drawing that 
point to the attention of the House and to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the pleasure of standing before the House today to speak 
to Bill C-38.  I should also indicate that this is a 
responsibility that was given to me just recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, the previous member for Kings—Hants, Mr. Scott 
Brison, was the one who had carriage of this particular portfolio 
in this piece of legislation to this point.  I can mention his 
name in the House now as he is not a member.  I would like to 
thank him on behalf of our party for all that he has done for us 
as well as for Canadians in putting forward what I consider to be 
the best of the critics' responses to the Minister of Finance.  I 
would almost suggest that the Minister of Finance would agree 
with me on that comment.  Mr. Brison is no longer a sitting 
member of the House because he gave his seat to an individual who 
is of the same stature as the Right Hon. John Diefenbaker, the 
Right Hon. Joe Clark who will be sworn in tomorrow.  We thank him 
for his sacrifices and his diligent work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my duty today to speak to Bill C-38 on behalf of the 
Progressive Conservative Party.  I am sorry I was not able to 
speak after the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle because it was very 
important that there be some sort of segue from the NDP ideology 
and the Progressive Conservative ideology with respect to the 
banking industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of respect for the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, 
make no mistake about that.  He is an individual who has been in 
the House for a number of years and is certainly very familiar 
with the issue of finance as he sat on the finance committee for 
some time.  I look forward to working with him as well as with 
the other members of the finance committee and the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle certainly espoused his party's 
ideology with respect to the banking industry and this particular 
piece of legislation to the point that I almost thought that he 
would suggest that the nationalization of the banking industry 
would probably be better for Canadians than having it on an open 
market basis in the free market system that we now have.  That 
may be a bit insensitive, but I suspect it is probably closer to 
the truth.

economy.  I am sure Canadians recognize that the banking industry 
itself employs approximately 222,000 Canadians.  It is a huge 
industry that is regulated by legislation.  It comes on a regular 
basis every five years to get legislation changed so that it can 
operate within those regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banking industry also has an estimated annual payroll of 
some $12.6 billion.  This is very important for the people who 
are employed in the industry as well as to governments which 
obviously tax the people who are employed in that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banking industry we have today has more than $1.4 trillion 
in assets.  It has over 8,423 branches across the country.  It is 
a huge industry.  The banks are not the bogeymen. They are simply 
an industry trying to do business in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks today generate more 
than 49% of their earnings outside Canada. Fifty per cent of 
what the banks earn come from outside the borders of the country. 
That speaks to the globalization of the financial industry as 
well as the banking industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The really interesting point is 
that one out of every two working Canadians in some way, shape or 
form has an interest in a bank. Either directly or indirectly, 
he is stockholders and shareholders in the industry.  Whether 
it is through a pension plan, through individual stock trades, 
through mutual funds, or through other types of financial 
vehicles, one out of every two Canadians has a direct or indirect 
connection with the stock of a bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation which has come forward is very comprehensive. It 
has 900 pages and takes into consideration 22 separate statutes 
in the federal government.  It deals with approximately 4,000 
pages of those 22 statutes with amendments to those pieces of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have with me the bill of 900 pages.  I anticipate the clause 
by clause study of the 900 pages of Bill C-38, but in the 
meantime, I am very pleased to speak to the bill and will try to 
speak to some of the issues reflected in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle spoke articulately of what was 
good and what was bad within the bill.  I could accept a lot of 
what he said with respect to good and bad, although I could not 
accept a lot of the other areas he went to with respect to 
ownership being raised from 10% to 20%.  He was totally opposed 
to that and I will get into that later.  We are not opposed to 
that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said he would not support nor vote for this piece of 
legislation to go to committee.  I find that very strange because 
there are a number of good issues dealt with in the legislation. 
We should be supporting it and taking it to the committee level 
so that we can make the necessary changes, as long as the 
government and the people on the committee are prepared to listen 
to good, constructive amendments and changes being proposed.  We 
will get into those certainly at a much later date when we deal 
with them in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the PC Party have been waiting for this piece of 
legislation for a long time.  It is long overdue.  We have been 
waiting for several years to have the legislation on the table. 
In saying that, I will also state the intention of the 
Progressive Conservative Party to support the legislation at 
second reading to get it to the committee stage so we can try to 
make those necessary changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has taken an awfully long time for the legislation to come 
forward.  It has been almost seven years that the government has 
been in power. 
It has been almost seven years since the government has gone 
through the delaying tactics of task forces, of consultations, of 
special reports, of any other type of delaying tactic before it 
could come to the table.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard already that this process started back in 1996 
with the MacKay task force.  That report was presented to the 
Minister of Finance on September 14, 1998.  It has been over a 
year since the task force reported to the finance minister and 
the white paper was dealt with and we are at second reading on 
September 18, 2000.  It has been two years since the MacKay 
report was presented to the Minister of Finance and we finally 
have the bill on our desks, a fairly long delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime the Minister of Finance also said to the banks 
that they would not be allowed to merge.  Even though the MacKay 
report spoke specifically to that issue, I guess the Minister of 
Finance was caught off guard when some of the banks brought 
forward their proposals for mergers with other banking 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over 100 years Canada has enjoyed a competitive advantage 
over the U.S. in terms of a much more enlightened system of 
banking regulations.  In a previous life when I actually had a 
real job as opposed to simply standing in the House and speaking 
to you, Mr. Speaker, and enlightening you and obviously making 
your day much brighter because of that, I did have the 
opportunity of working with a corporation that needed the banking 
institutions that this country has.  We were very competitive not 
only in Canada but also in the United States because we had the 
ability of dealing with a national bank within this country.  We 
had the ability of generating capital that would not necessarily 
have been generated within the banking system of the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Canada have been very fortunate to have the banking 
industry we have.  For example, in 1987 the Conservative 
government allowed banks to acquire security firms and five years 
later, cross ownership was permitted across all four pillars of 
the financial system: banks, security firms, insurance companies 
and trust companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opening up of Canada's securities industry in 1987 allowed 
banks to strengthen the sector thereby maintaining a viable 
domestic industry.  At that point we were the strongest of the 
banking industries anywhere on the globe. That has changed.  We 
now have some difficulty maintaining the global competition and 
we will speak to that. In fact this legislation starts to speak 
to that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then over the course of the 1990s Canada lost its competitive 
advantage as U.S. regulators moved to an unrestricted Canadian 
style system of national banking.  As it stands now, the 
regulatory environment south of the border is far superior to 
that of Canada's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall a major new financial bill was passed in the United 
States which allowed for cross ownership of banks, security firms 
and insurance companies plus cross selling of services.  This 
means that the bank merger process in the United States does not 
have to include any public hearings and little political input. 
In fact a recent wave of mega mergers has reshaped the U.S. 
banking sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, we of the elder generation, and I put myself in 
that category as well, perhaps have not kept up with the changes 
in the banking system, but banking has changed.  Today we do not 
have to walk into a bank in order to access all of the services 
we require.  We can do all of our banking at a computer terminal. 
We can do most of our banking by telephone. We can do most of 
our banking without even having to talk to a banker with respect 
to loan guarantees, with respect to accessing the loans that are 
required to maintain business and personal services. That is what 
we are speaking of and it is not really reflected in this 
legislation just yet, but we are getting there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canadian banks, any interbank merger is subject to high 
level political open-ended scrutiny.  It would be like trying to 
get through a minefield with no map.  That speaks to the merger 
requirements that are necessary within the Canadian banking 
system.  This legislation still has put in too many of those 
minefields to allow Canadian institutions to compete on a global 
basis with the competition from other countries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian financial services sector throughout the past 10 
years has undergone more change than in the previous 150 years. 
At the same time Canadians have advanced legitimate concerns 
about their banking system, ranging from access to capital for 
small businesses in rural communities to creating a climate for 
increased competition in the provision of banking services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1998 the MacKay task force report provided a 
comprehensive set of recommendations which successfully balanced 
consumer interests with the global competitiveness of our 
financial services sector.  In his response the Minister of 
Finance has focused only on short term consumer interests and has 
ignored the long term interests of all Canadian consumers.  In 
fact, given the timidity with which the minister has handled his 
response to the MacKay report, there is no reason that Bill C-38 
could not have been introduced in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In framing public policy, it is very important that it reflects 
realities as opposed to perceptions.  There are many widely held 
misconceptions about the Canadian banking industry.  The reality 
is that Canadian banks are delivering good value to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We enjoy one of the most stable and efficient banking systems in 
the world.  Canadian banks are widely owned by Canadians.  Some 
7.5 million Canadians have invested in banks.  These 7.5 million 
working Canadians are relying on their bank shares to provide for 
retirement savings, or for that matter, investment income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore the financial services sector employs over half a 
million Canadians.  Its payroll, as I mentioned earlier, is $22 
billion.  It represents 5% of the total GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Components of this important piece of legislation include 
allowing single shareholders to own 20% of voting shares of the 
big five banks, up from the current level of 10%.  These banks, 
however, have to keep Canadian headquarters and their boards have 
to be three-quarters Canadian.  That is a good component of this 
legislation, an increase from 10% to 20% ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It allows banks to set up a holding structure which could then 
have separately regulated subsidiaries, including retail banks, 
credit card companies and insurance firms.  That is a wise move 
on the part of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Banks with between $1 billion and $5 billion in assets would be 
allowed to have controlling shareholders with stakes of up to 
65%.  The current rule is a single shareholder can own no more 
than 10%.  Banks that fall into this category include the 
Laurentian Bank, the National Bank and Canadian Western Bank. 
Ministerial approval would still be needed to approve any 
takeover, which would effectively shield these banks from hostile 
takeovers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard earlier about some concerns with respect to the power 
of the ministerial rights and we agree with that.  We believe 
that the minister has substantive powers built into this 
legislation.  It is one of the areas we would like to see changed 
quite dramatically going into the committee and going into the 
hearings.  We would like to hear from the stakeholders as to how 
they feel that after all the processes have been followed it will 
be the minister who will make the final decision.  It was said 
earlier that it should be parliament that has the say in those 
decisions, not just the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a new federal ombudsman established to handle 
complaints who will be independent of the existing banks.  His or 
her ruling would not be binding on the banks, but the ombudsman 
would have the authority to make the complaints public.  That is 
very positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a new consumer finance agency.  The agency will be 
established to strengthen the overseeing of banks.  This new 
agency would be an advocate for consumer issues in the financial 
services industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All consumers will have the right to basic banking accounts and 
standard services at a low cost.  This is in response to past 
complaints that the poor have had difficulty in gaining bank 
accounts.  This is a positive change and one which the PC Party 
wholly supports.  It was also one of the changes which the hon. 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle indicated was a very positive step 
forward in this legislation.  That is why I find it very 
difficult that the member would not see fit to support this 
legislation to go forward to committee so that this one area of 
the legislation could continue forward and be a very important 
part of the new regulatory system for the banking industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation, however, fails to put into place a less 
arbitrary and political process for bank mergers.  We have 
already heard from the Liberal government experts and the people 
who sit on the committee, those beacons of knowledge across the 
floor who have uttered such phrases as “I don't imagine we are 
going to look at a bank merger proposal anytime soon”.  I find 
it difficult to recognize that these people, who are the experts 
in the financial industry, are now suggesting that bank mergers 
are not a part of the future.  Mergers are a part of the future, 
have been a part of the future and are certainly going on as we 
speak today internationally as well as in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to putting mergers on hold indefinitely and 
loosening share ownership restrictions, which could result in 
foreign control of the Canadian banking sectors, Bill C-38 does 
not adequately address the competition issue. If the government 
was serious about increasing competition it would have adopted 
the MacKay recommendations that the interact network become fully 
accessible and fully functional.  Full functionality of the 
interact network would effectively provide any new bank with 
14,000 access locations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the government the aim of the bill is to allow 
banks to evolve to meet competition and at the same time protect 
consumers.  I would argue, however, that due to the government's 
slow reaction to the changes in the financial services sector 
Canada has already fallen far behind.  The one thing that is 
clear is that after years of uncertainty from the current 
government it has finally added some clarification and stability 
to the banking industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party of Canada will be supporting this bill.  We feel 
that this is the first tiny step in the right direction. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-38, the Financial 
Consumer Agency of Canada Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now at an extremely important stage in terms of the 
future of the Canadian banking system. On June 13, the finance 
minister entered the final stage of his reflection on this 
problem by introducing Bill C-38. I want to indicate at the 
outset that, like my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, I will 
oppose this bill. I will take this opportunity to thank and to 
congratulate my colleague, the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, 
who was very effective in leading the debate on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will be proposing amendments to the bill at 
report stage in order to correct the inequity that exists in this 
bill with regard to large Quebec banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we oppose this bill? Several aspects of the bill 
concern me, particularly the fact that, under this bill, the 
Minister of Finance will have the power to decide the future of 
Quebec banks. I find it unacceptable that this discretionary 
power is as strong as if not stronger than the act itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is concerned about the fact that a single 
shareholder could, with the approval of the Minister of 
Finance—and this is very serious—with the approval of one man, 
hold a 65% interest in the National Bank, the largest 
Quebec-based bank. There is no need for the Minister of Finance 
to allow this kind of excessive control to give the National Bank 
the flexibility it needs to continue to prosper.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can a shareholder holding 65% of the shares of a bank give 
more flexibility than 65 shareholders holding 1% each? The 
answer is obvious. The risk could be enormous if this bill were 
to be adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will no doubt remember the whole matter of the 
restructuring of the airline industry that received a lot of 
coverage last summer. Under the former act, which was amended by 
Bill C-26, a shareholder could not hold more than 10% of the 
shares of an airline company, and that is an important element to 
prevent excessive control by a single shareholder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois fought a good fight on that front, and at the 
end of an opposition day on the issue, three Liberal MPs 
supported our position. I hope that some of them will have enough 
courage and democratic conviction to oppose the provisions of 
Bill C-38. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to realize that there is no need, and I repeat no need, 
for the Minister of Finance to authorize this excessive control 
to ensure the flexibility of the National Bank. Let us be serious 
for a moment. We are not talking about 10%, as in the case of 
Canadian Airlines International, but about 65%. The legislation 
should be there to ensure that the banks cannot be controlled by 
a single shareholder, as could be the case under Bill C-38. This 
is a very serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need legislative guarantees against any negative impact these 
new ownership rules might have on employment of professionals, 
consumer services and small businesses. More important is the 
fact that these negative impacts will hit Quebec the hardest. I 
wonder if this bill was not introduced to pick on Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me repeat this for a third time. We have to remember that 
the provisions allowing single shareholders to have 65% of the 
shares will mainly affect the National Bank, which is the largest 
bank in Quebec. The stakes are just too high to rely on only one 
man, the Minister of Finance, especially since there are no 
legislative guarantees in the bill. Bill C-38 does nothing more 
than list some elements to consider that are under the sole 
control of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what legislative power is all about if everything is 
under the minister's control. Can anyone tell me? If some workers 
lose their jobs, who will they turn to, given the harsh 
constraints of the employment insurance system? Only 40% of these 
workers will be eligible for EI benefits. And let us not forget 
that almost 100% of all bank employees are female. Under this 
legislation, it is once again women who stand to lose their jobs 
at a time when 77% of them are not eligible for EI benefits. It 
is bad, it is cruel, and it is tragic.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another reason why this bill should be revised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen to the others? I doubt the finance minister 
will show much compassion, given his neoLiberal policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse, Bill C-38 is full of phrases like “The minister may deem 
necessary” or “such and such a section of the act will cease to 
apply if the minister so decides”. Everything seems to depend on 
the minister's decisions. How could we trust the minister's 
decision, when he still has not decided or seen fit to tell 
whether or not he will be running in the next election, whether 
he will become the Prime Minister some day, or whether he will 
pay his taxes in Canada, like everybody else does? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all those ifs, and a minister who keeps shifting positions, 
I really have to wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this bill, which reminds me of Bill C-33, there will be no 
duplication with the provinces, “if the minister deems 
necessary”. How could I trust such empty promises? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be fooled by the advantages of Bill C-38. In 
Quebec, small businesses will be affected the most by this bill. 
It is not obvious that the finance minister's bill will bring 
about more healthy competition on the national market. But 
competition is more important for our future economic 
development than the creation of big banks to compete on the 
world market. Nonetheless, the Minister of Finance has decided 
to make a law for big banks, even if that means sacrificing 
Quebec banks like the National Bank, which is the institution 
for small businesses in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, the term Liberal government bill is nearly always 
synonymous with interference in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction.  We are used to that, because that approach has 
become this government's stock in trade.  The finance minister's 
bill established the financial consumer agency, which is 
intended to protect the consumer.  It is no secret that the Bloc 
Quebecois is a staunch defender of consumer rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind hon. members that there are laws for that purpose 
already in place in Quebec.  There is, for instance, the 
Consumer Protection Bureau Act, as well as the Consumer 
Protection Act, the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal 
Information, the legislation on insurance, trust companies, 
savings, credit and securities unions and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members can see just how well protected the consumer is in 
Quebec.  Why then, once again, does this government want to 
trample over provincial areas of jurisdiction?  The provinces 
have, like Quebec, done their duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of the agency as set out in Bill C-38 is therefore 
liable to create still more regulatory overlap with measures 
already put in place by Quebec, and naturally so, since this is 
a provincial power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never tire of repeating that this government needs to 
listen to reason.  If it wants to pass legislation, it ought to 
do so in its own areas of jurisdiction and leave areas of 
provincial jurisdiction alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but be incensed with the Liberals' duplicity in 
this matter, because after the 1995 referendum they passed a 
totally senseless motion recognizing Quebec as a distinct 
society. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that Liberals ought to take this motion into 
account and curb their uncontrolled urges to encroach upon 
Quebec's areas of jurisdiction, if they were consistent. Now 
there is another risk of duplication, such as in the case of Bill 
C-33 about wildlife species at risk which I mentioned previously in my 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding, I would like to refer to another provision in 
this bill, about the low-fee retail deposit account which, 
according to the finance minister, should make financial services 
accessible for low income people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a nice vague provision. Nobody knows what that account 
really is, except perhaps for the minister. Nobody but the 
finance minister knows who will be able to take advantage of that 
account. Why? Because the minister will determine these matters 
by regulation.  An order in council, what a nice form of 
democracy enhancing the value of the role of parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pardon my irony, but I have a hard time believing the nice words 
of the finance minister, and these nice words hold no comfort for 
me at all with regard to enhanced consumer protection, especially 
with regard to branch closures and service reduction in bank 
branches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is Bill C-38? An advance notice, nothing more. How can the 
minister say that financial services will be more accessible? I 
would also have liked to talk about the community role of the 
banks, about community reinvestment at the local level, where 
they have to be accountable to the population. My colleague from 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve has been lobbying for a community 
reinvestment scheme since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill may have positive aspects, but it also has black holes, 
like the springtime black hole that the Minister of Human 
Resources Development intends to maintain with the changes she 
has made to EI. Seasonal workers will now have more and more 
difficulty getting benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to listen to ordinary citizens. I think 
that the Liberal members drifted away from ordinary citizens and 
I ask them to come back to reality and to meet the real 
expectations of people, taxpayers and ordinary citizens. Bill 
C-38 is a vague legislative measure which is more wishful 
thinking than real political action. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to begin by saying that it is good to have you in the 
Chair to continue where we left off.  Before putting a question 
to my delightful and charming colleague from Jonquière, I also 
want to welcome the pages, who come from all over, and tell them 
that they are assured of the co-operation of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, as always, has made an eloquent speech, because 
her roots run deep in the community of Jonquière.  With 
considerable interest, I would say, she got the members of this 
House to understand that Bill C-38 should, to all intents and 
purposes, be withdrawn.  It is too unfair that the people 
involved in the MacKay working group were mobilized.  This group 
made very specific proposals for consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they really think the MacKay task force got a positive 
response from the government side?  Absolutely not.  Could my 
colleague tell us just how justified we are in feeling 
disappointed on this side of the House and how all those who 
believe in the higher interest of consumers are justified in 
feeling disappointed because there are no specific measures for 
consumers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my colleague is someone who is very much in touch 
with the Mouvement Desjardins in her region, who attends cocktail

long supported the values of the co-operative movement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague truly believes that it is important, in a region, 
to have the Mouvement Desjardins. What is the basic rule of the 
Mouvement Desjardins? One vote per person and everyone has equal 
status as a member. Is this logic not interesting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, we referred to the specificity of Quebec's financial 
system. What is the first distinctive feature of that 
specificity? It is indeed the Mouvement Desjardins. 
My colleague, the hon. member for Chambly, will correct me if I 
am wrong, but I believe the Mouvement Desjardins is celebrating 
its 100th anniversary this year. I am sure that between now and 
the month of December we will have the opportunity to remind 
everyone that it all began very modestly in the basement of a 
church. There was this notion that it was important to save 
money. Why? Not to squirrel money away, not to become rich, but 
to truly control our destiny and have greater control over our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague not believe that the Minister of Finance could 
have taken a cue from modern Quebec's views in this regard and 
shown greater co-operative or community vision in this bill? Does 
the hon. member share my outrage at the fact that the minister 
is, to all intents and purposes, a heartless individual who did 
not listen to the MacKay commission, and does she agree that 
there is nothing concrete for consumers, who have an urgent need 
for additional protection? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude here because my time is running out, but in a 
few moments I will have the opportunity to talk about what is 
going on in the riding of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, about 
pawnbrokers, shylocks and other bad things that happen in a 
community when we do not assume our responsibilities regarding 
financial institutions. I would appreciate hearing my 
colleague's point of view on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. I could not have said it 
any better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the Mouvement Desjardins is celebrating its 
100th anniversary this year. I want to take this opportunity to 
congratulate it and to thank it for its involvement and for the 
help it has provided ordinary people over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this Liberal finance minister is hurting ordinary people 
with this bill. I will listen carefully to the speech by my 
colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. In a few minutes, he will 
tell us that the government has not paid any attention to the 
impact that regulations and legislation on the restructuring of 
the banking system will have on ordinary people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague was saying, this government is heartless, and we 
can see that every day. We have just come back to the House 
today and the government is already showing that it is 
heartless. We have asked for an emergency debate on the issue of 
organized crime. We were told that closure would be invoked with 
regard to Bill C-3, which deals with young offenders—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to participate in the debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today our finance critic very eloquently outlined the 
NDP's work and position on this massive bill before us.  Our 
finance critic has certainly done an incredible job over the 
years of bringing forward in the House how unaccountable and 
undemocratic the banking sector is and the concerns of consumers 
and Canadians.  I applaud him for his very thoughtful analysis 
and comments earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in Ottawa I was sitting at a kitchen table talking 
about political life with a young working couple with a newborn 
baby.  The new mother said “Let us talk about our banking horror 
stories”.  For two hours this young family and their friends 
swapped horror stories about their encounters when dealing with a 
big bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot think of any issue that would unite Canadians, whether 
nationalists in Quebec, people in Vancouver, people in the 
maritimes or wherever, in terms of the suspicion and contempt 
that people have and, dare I say, even a sense of outrage at what 
happens in the banking sector.  We can all think of our own 
personal experiences of what it is like to deal with these 
massive institutions that bleed the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young student I talked to a few weeks ago was outraged when 
she went to her bank, the Royal Bank, and found out that there 
was now a $1.50 service charge for using the Royal Bank ATM 
machine.  We all know that if we go to another bank we have to 
pay a fee but now even the bank we deal with is charging a fee. 
This is a young student with a huge debt who is getting dinged 
again.  The stories go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation, the 900 or so pages, is a very 
important piece of legislation but it demands that we, as members 
of parliament, examine whether the bill sets out what it claims 
to do, which is to reform the financial sector and truly protect 
Canadians from some of the appalling practices and gouging that 
takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest complaints I hear from the constituents in my 
riding of Vancouver East, which probably has the highest 
incidence of poverty and more low income families in the country 
in an urban setting, is that people who are poor cannot access 
financial institutions.  The discrimination that exists is awful. 
It is hard to believe that it could exist in today's society.  It 
is so subtle and people are treated with such disrespect and 
contempt that it makes people on welfare or social assistance 
feel like nothing.  They feel devalued as human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new member of parliament, over the last couple of years I 
introduced motions in the House of Commons to deal with this 
issue and to draw attention to the discrimination that poor 
people and low income Canadians are faced with in the financial 
sector and which absolutely has to change.  The bill takes some 
steps to do that but there is no guarantee that it will actually 
happen.  No basic package has been set out to ensure there will 
be a no frills bank account.  A lot of research has been done 
which shows that this is entirely possible and administratively 
easy for the banks to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, one of my motions called on the government to work 
with community groups to not just change the legislation but to 
change the culture and attitudes of the big banks toward poor 
people and to make it unlawful for someone to be denied access to 
banking services as a result of his or her income.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who does not believe this is happening should go into any 
of the big banks on an assistance cheque day to see the kind of 
mayhem that takes place and the kind of anxiety and anguish that 
people go through trying to get their cheques cashed.  People end 
up going into the marketplace, into the money marts and so on, 
and paying huge amounts of money from their meagre low incomes to 
get cheques cashed that may be from a provincial government or 
the Government of Canada.  It could be pensioners with pension 
cheques and so on.  It is a very fundamental issue of equality 
and ending discrimination in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation became so alarming in Vancouver East that our 
provincial government, in co-operation with the local community, 
established a very successful community savings financial 
institution called the Four Corners Community Savings at Main and 
Hastings.  In actual fact it is situated in an old Bank of 
Montreal building that was closed down like many other branches 
that moved out and closed down.  We now have a very successful 
community model of accessibility and non-discrimination.  Poor 
people can now say they have a few bucks they want to put in the 
bank without being penalized and looked down on.  They do not 
want to go into special line-ups.  The big banks force them to go 
into special line-ups because they are poor.  I am disappointed 
because the bill does not adequately address this fundamental 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP have some other concerns with the bill.  One of 
them is the fact that it does not deal with the issue of 
corporate concentration.  We have six major banks with assets and 
profits worth multibillion dollars, and the bill would encourage 
and allow greater corporate concentration and ownership by 
changing the rule from 10% to 20% in terms of the number of 
voting shares that one can own and from 10% to 30% for the number 
of non-voting shares.  That seems to me to be a non-reform item. 
This is not about reform.  This is about giving the banks a 
massive hand up, something that they do not need, and allowing 
for corporate concentration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is positive after many years of work that credit unions will 
be recognized by being allowed to have a single service entity to 
support credit union membership.  We have in Vancouver a highly 
successful model, probably the most successful and largest credit 
union in Canada Van City, which is providing a real alternative to big 
banks for these people.  To give credit to the government, there 
is that positive aspect of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that is quite amazing is that the bill is silent 
on taxation.  The combined after tax profits of the six big banks 
amount to $9.1 billion.  What does the Government of Canada do? 
What does the finance minister do?  Does he deal with that issue? 
Does he bring fairness and equity to the taxation system to give 
modest income Canadians and low income Canadians a break?  No, 
the opposite is true.  We actually see a corporate tax cut by the 
finance minister from 28% to 21%.  This means that these banks 
are getting more powerful.  They are getting more influence. They 
are getting more money.  This is completely contrary to 
democratic reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It poses a question.  Who will stand up to these banks? I do not 
think it will be the Liberal government.  It is quite cozy in its 
relationship with the banks.  It sure as heck is not the Canadian 
Alliance.  We have to shake our heads and wonder what the heck is 
going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Globe and Mail</I> today quotes that wallets are being 
opened at events that include a $25,000 table dinner with Mr. Day 
in Toronto, expected to draw 2,000 executives.  It indicates that 
executives are genuinely attracted to the Alliance's position on 
flattened taxes, deregulation and a diminished role for the 
federal government within Confederation.  Here we see the hand in 
glove, the nice cozy alliance between these fancy executives and 
this political party which purports to speak up for the little 
guy. 
There we see it.  The evidence is there in terms of where they do 
their fundraising and who they seek to attract.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of who stands up for the banks is something that 
should be addressed by parliament. In our party we have taken on 
this issue.  We have consistently called for democratic reform. 
We have consistently called for an ombudsperson who has real 
clout and teeth and is not just a paper entity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the real concerns with the bill is that more power is 
given to the Minister of Finance, not parliament.  Power is being 
taken away from parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point we are clearly not in support of the bill unless 
there are major changes.  What we need to do in debating this 
legislation is truly examine whether or not it is protecting the 
consumer. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleagues for their kind solidarity, which makes 
itself known every time we are called on to evolve together, 
whether in caucus, general council or here in parliament.  We 
form a solid and unshakeable block. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I also wish to thank my colleague for her 
speech.  We are familiar with the social concerns she has 
defended since first entering parliament in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether I could count on her lively, committed and 
outspoken support for an upcoming amendment. 
I think that I can speak on behalf of the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, who is also very strong on social 
commitment. We have been fighting since 1996 to have banks 
reinvest in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that in 1996 I went to the United States to meet 
Joe Kennedy Jr., who was behind the second generation of 
community reinvestment by the banks because, incredible though 
it may seem, in 1977 the United States passed legislation known 
as the community reinvestment act, which I will speak about 
shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States cannot be called a country where freedom of 
entreprise is in any danger. 
It cannot be said that the American banking system is not 
subject to cutthroat competition because, unlike the Canadian 
banking system, the American one is much more fragmented.  There 
are regional and even local banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I ask my colleague whether she thinks that the superintendent 
of financial institutions should assess the effort made by the 
banks to meet the credit needs of all consumers, including those 
in less well off communities? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could not have come up 
with a better question myself.  I thank the hon. member for the 
excellent question because I actually did not have time to cover 
that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say most strongly and categorically that our party 
absolutely and very clearly supports the community reinvestment 
act.  What they have been able to accomplish in the United States 
is a clear demonstration that when we lay down clear legislation 
and make it clear which side we are on, that is to protect 
Canadians and consumers, we can force these banks to be socially 
responsible through legislation.  It can work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know communities where local businesses cannot get a bank loan 
because they are considered to be in a blighted or devastated 
area.  That is the situation in my own community.  There are 
whole blocks which are boarded up and empty, partly because they 
cannot get access to financial institutions.  This is what 
happened in Chicago and in other cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A community reinvestment act which says that some of these 
massive profits have to go back to the community good, to 
community benefit, is a sound, democratic and rational principle 
that is not in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to hear that my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois are 
speaking out on this matter too.  We should be pressing the 
government and asking why there is no community reinvestment 
legislation contained within this 900 pages, why it is so 
glaringly absent, and why the Liberals are again bailing out 
these banks.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I draw the attention of the House 
to the member of the Alliance Party, the hon. member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain, who on August 18 with his wife celebrated 
their 50th wedding anniversary.  I congratulate him on behalf of 
all of us in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my hon. colleague from Vancouver East. 
Years ago the Government of Canada made a fishing czar out of the 
DFO minister by allowing him more unprecedented powers ever than 
any other minister in the House.  Now it appears that this 
legislation will make a banking czar out of the Minister of 
Finance.  I would like comments from my colleague for Vancouver 
East on what she thinks of the new banking czar this bill may 
create if it is passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question.  In fact, earlier today our very excellent finance 
critic, the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, made the point 
precisely that one of the real problems with the bill is that it 
gives unprecedented powers to one minister, rather than 
conferring powers on parliament as a whole where democratic and 
open debate takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the real nasty bits in legislation that gets 
sneaked through.  Canadians do not understand that this is being 
paraded as consumer protection but is really vesting control in 
the banks and in one minister.  That cannot be healthy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise.  Like others who have risen in the 
House today I want to say how good it is to be back.  It is 
almost like we never left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating today the government's Bill C-38, the financial 
sector reform bill.  One would think there is probably no greater 
institutions in need of reform than those in the financial 
sector.  This is in some part a response to the great outcry of 
the Canadian people a couple of years ago when there was some 
discussion of bank mergers.  We know where the Canadian people 
stood on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a few points.  Many of the points with regard to 
my party's position on this issue have been made by our excellent 
finance critic, the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle.  We bring a 
balanced review to this piece of legislation.  He indicated, and 
we support him in that, that we will be opposing it at this point 
because while there are some good things in the legislation, 
there are many other areas that need reform and changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is appropriate and I am glad to rise to speak to this 
piece of legislation.  This summer, when I was home meeting with 
constituents and dealing with matters in the constituency, I 
received a phone call late one night from a local manager of the 
Bank of Nova Scotia, calling to give me a heads up to advise me 
that the next day they would be announcing closure of one of the 
small local branches that services a number of people.  Luckily, 
he indicated to me, there would be no job losses.  Some of those 
jobs would be moved to another branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes to the heart of some of the things we are talking about 
and some of our concerns.  We have a huge monopoly in the banking 
sector of this country.  Many of the rural and smaller 
communities are suffering when banks withdraw.  I will touch on 
that briefly in a few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that we have some differences of opinion. 
Clearly the spokesman for the Conservative Party could not 
understand why the NDP might oppose some aspects of the 
legislation.  It says something that both the spokesperson for 
the Conservative Party and I think the Canadian Alliance were in 
tandem on a couple of aspects of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start by saying we will bring a balanced approach to this 
piece of legislation.  I do not think it behoves anybody to 
simply be critical of the government for the sake of being 
critical.  We in this party like to give constructive criticism 
and bring the concerns of the Canadian people to the fore.  There 
are some good things in this piece of legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as has been mentioned, there is some help for credit 
unions.  That help will come by allowing the creation of the 
single national service entity to support credit union 
membership.  We of course would agree with this and I personally 
would agree with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The credit union movement in the country has always been strong. 
It is one that I would argue found its birth in Cape Breton. 
Reverend Moses Coady and Father Jimmy Tompkins began working with 
local fishermen in my part of the country a long time ago, 
helping farmers and fishermen organize so that they would have 
control of their own assets.  They began building the local 
credit union and co-op movement out of Cape Breton. Out of that 
and out of the province of Quebec came the two strong legs of the 
credit union movement. We would support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase in power and organizational flexibility of credit 
unions in the long run will help them be more significant players 
in the banking industry.  That is vitally important. For a long 
time credit unions have not been on equal footing with the banks 
nor have the same ability to compete with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a young lawyer and first engaging in the practice of 
law, I wanted to set up my trust account at the credit union and 
found out that under provincial legislation in Nova Scotia it 
could not be done.  I had to go to one of the chartered banks. 
That is being rectified. This bill goes some way toward 
recognizing the importance of credit unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Likewise, one of the positive aspects of the bill is the 
creation of the financial services ombudsman.  This is not a new 
idea.  As has been pointed out by the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle, this was an NDP initiative 10 years ago. A 
private member's bill introduced by a member of this party sought 
to establish that very thing only with real teeth so that 
consumers who felt that they were in some way being 
disenfranchised or unfairly treated by the banks had somewhere to 
go.  We would support that.  It is something that this party 
proposed more than 10 years ago. I am glad to see the government 
is finally catching up with some of the innovative ideas from 
this party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives wonder why we do not support the bill. There 
are some areas that require closer scrutiny.  One of those, and 
it was mentioned by the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, has to do 
with bank taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Canadian Alliance was sympathetic to the 
banks.  He said that they do not get the same breaks that many of 
the other corporations get.  I think he mentioned Shell Canada 
and some other great big oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks, because of the historical position they hold, have a 
privileged position in this society.  They have been protected. 
They have been nurtured and supported for over 130 years as major 
institutions.  To suggest that when they report such record 
profits we should be sympathetic and they should not pay more 
taxes is not on the radar screen with most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, I think the banks provide the bulk of credit to 
Canadians.  They manufacture the money in our economy and they 
reap huge profits. It only seems sensible to me that when we 
assess how we tax those profits, the taxes should be levied on 
their profits before dividend distribution because those are huge 
profits made by the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one area where we have concerns and we do not think the 
legislation goes far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area that causes me some concern is in terms of bank 
closures.  I will refer to the local bank in my community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the current time for the rural banks where there are no other 
deposit taking institutions within a 10 kilometre radius of the 
bank being closed, six months notice will be required. The 
legislation sets down requirements for when the banks have to 
give notice that they are closing their local branch.

gas.  This is a bit of a side note.  I went to the local corner 
store that for 80 years has provided petrol to the residents of 
Margaree Harbour.  When I went to get gas I was told that the big 
companies would not sell gas to the corner store any more because 
it did not have enough volume.  This is happening in rural 
communities all across the country.  Now people have to drive 
five, six or ten miles to the nearest large conglomerate because 
those companies have a monopoly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing is happening with banks in many of the rural 
communities.  I am thinking of Ingonish in my riding.  I am 
thinking of the town of Baddeck.  I am thinking of other smaller 
communities with one branch where people do their banking face to 
face.  There ought to be some requirement that the banks maintain 
those outlets unless they can show for some reason that it is not 
profitable, that they are losing business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes this works to the advantage of the local credit union. 
What has happened in some of the communities in my riding is 
that when the bank withdraws, the credit union goes in and sets 
up and people then have access to community capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other aspects I would like to talk about.  My 
colleague from Vancouver East talked a little bit about the 
community investment and reinvestment fund.  That is the kind of 
direction in which we should be going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we can bring a balanced discussion to this legislation. I 
hope that some of the important recommendations the NDP has 
brought forward will be considered in committee and we can 
improve the bill.  There are some aspects that are good, and I 
commend the government for that, but as is our job in the 
opposition, we like to provide what I think are important, 
critical, constructive suggestions on how to make the bill 
better.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member from my 
beautiful home province of Nova Scotia and beautiful Cape Breton 
Island on his well thought out remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government holds a majority position and in many aspects it 
is blatantly arrogant toward the people of Canada, especially in 
rural and small communities.  In order that small and rural 
communities can have adequate banking services, what does the 
member suggest that Canadians who are watching us today do to 
point out the deficiencies of the bill to the Liberal Party and 
to other parties who would support the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, because I get 
correspondence from people who watch CPAC and people who read 
<I>Hansard</I>, I know there will be people who will hear some of 
those suggestions.  There are a number of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask those watching the debate or reading <I>Hansard</I> 
to recognize some of the comments and other objections we made, 
such as the wide ownership rule. I did not get an opportunity to 
address it in my speech, but perhaps the single most important 
thing that this bill will allow is a concentration of ownership 
in the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an initiative from Lester Pearson's government to 
prohibit any one particular group from owning, operating and 
directing banks because, as has been said by a Liberal leader, 
once we lose control of our economic house, we lose control of 
our sovereignty.  It speaks to how far that party has moved to 
the right, away from what were once core Liberal values, that the 
initiatives of Lester Pearson ensuring that only 10% of a bank 
could be owned by any one individual are being expanded.  It 
talks about how far to the right the Liberal Party has moved in 
its efforts, I suppose, to compete with the Canadian Alliance and 
the Conservative Party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people who are concerned about rural banking in their 
communities, who are concerned about foreign ownership of 
Canadian banks, I would urge that they write to their members of 
parliament.  That is a legitimate course. Every so often I send 
out correspondence with cards that people can check and send back 
to me.  People should organize petitions.  They should telephone 
the office of their local member of parliament. That is the way 
direct democracy can happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once people understand that we are moving in a direction where 
the wide ownership rule is being narrowed, for example, as has 
been said by the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, one, two or three 
wealthy individuals or organizations might be able to take 
control of what are now Canadian institutions and control the 
banking, I think people will respond by writing to and phoning 
their members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the member for Vancouver East identified 
the dinner that the Canadian Alliance leader is hosting where 
people are paying $25,000 a plate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B> I am being corrected on that.  It is 
$25,000 a table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those Canadians who think there are vested interests who 
would like to have control of the banks, we understand that there 
are and they can afford to pay to influence government direction. 
Therefore I would urge people to contact their members of 
parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think I will be going to that dinner. I wonder 
whether you will be going but I understand you cannot answer a 
question in the House so I will put one to my friend from Cape 
Breton instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes me as very strange that the new Alliance Party, which 
is the old Reform Party, which was the old Social Credit Party at 
one time was very much in opposition to what the banks did to 
ordinary citizens. I remember the member for Souris—Moose 
Mountain for example railing against the banks and their 
insensitivity to rural communities in small-town Saskatchewan and 
the like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the hon. member would conclude with me that 
perhaps with this big dinner in Toronto that is coming up for 
$25,000 a plate, and some of those folks would probably be 
bankers from the different banks, that it has probably caused the 
Reform Party, now the Alliance Party, to be a bit muted in its 
once traditional criticism of the banks.  I can remember that 
used to be one of its favourite themes over the years.  When my 
friend from Souris—Moose Mountain was a Social Creditor many 
years ago, he used to campaign among his neighbours about the 
powers of the banks being too big and too massive. That of course 
is the case for many of those people who all of a sudden have had 
a change of heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now a $25,000 a plate dinner which of course is not for 
ordinary people, which means the party has lost touch with the 
grassroots ordinary people. Does the hon. member think that might 
be the reason for the change of heart? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the Canadian 
Alliance purports to be a grassroots party, but I can tell you 
they are pretty rich roots.  I cannot think of anyone in my own 
community who would buy tickets to a $25,000 a table dinner.  It 
is a Bay Street dinner.  It tells us something about who is 
controlling the priorities of that party. It tells us something 
about who is setting those priorities and who is in control of 
this new supposedly grassroots party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, earlier 
today when I was preparing for my duties as I have the 
responsibility for House duty for our party, I was not informed 
that I would have to speak to this bill but I believe it is 
imperative that I do so. The bill before us contains over 900 
pages.  It is of critical importance in terms of updating the 
banking industry within the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you have been watching the debate. I find it hard 
to believe that over the course of the day the government has put 
forward only one speaker for one of its bills, a bill that has in 
excess of 900 pages. 
When I think that through, it is another signal of the arrogance 
that the government has for this place and for the democratic 
process.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of these 900 pages is technical in nature.  Very 
little vision is included within the bill.  The bill is not a 
signal of a fundamental direction that the government wants to 
take the country in with respect to financial institutions.  It 
is a housekeeping bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from my critic position on the environment that the 
government has been in place for over seven years and has yet to 
pass an environmental initiative of its own.  We should not be 
surprised that the government really has a very empty legislative 
agenda before Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard that the Prime Minister would like to go to the polls 
sooner than later, but he cannot find a reason to do it because 
he does not have anything that would strike the interests of 
Canadians in order for the Liberals to be returned to another 
majority government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when leadership was commonplace by the Government of 
Canada.  My first thoughts are the issue of free trade.  Many 
members across the way actually opposed that initiative in 1988. 
That bold initiative transformed the country.  Our trade with the 
Americans at that time was at about $90 billion.  Today, 
compliments of free trade and its successor, NAFTA, trade with 
our American cousins is $320 billion a year.  That was the kind 
of initiative and vision that was taken by a government that knew 
Canada needed to maintain its competitiveness in this 
increasingly global world.  In contrast, when I look at this 
particular act it is merely housekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are five basic principles that are going to be covered in 
this bill: the promotion of efficiency and growth within the 
financial institution sector; measures to empower and protect 
consumers; initiatives to encourage further domestic competition; 
the regulatory environment within the financial institution 
sector; and finally, the bill provides for a five year review of 
the legislation, as has been the case in the past. Those are the 
five points we are going to review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the very contentious issues that was brought forth about 
financial institutions is that it would be permissible for a 
single shareholder to own as much as 20% of a financial 
institution as opposed to only 10%.  To some individuals that is 
a major problem but to me it is a reflection of what is required 
to spur more competition and to bring more individuals within the 
financial sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everyone knows that bashing banks is a very popular 
function.  We also know that they have achieved their solid 
performance and their strength within our society because of a 
protected environment which we fostered and nurtured over a 
number of years.  At the time that was probably the best 
financial policy for us to have to ensure that we had a solid 
sovereign banking system.  We only have to look at the commodity 
crash and the financial institution crash that took place along 
the Pacific Rim three years ago and what happened to its 
financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have more deregulation.  Foreign competitors can come 
in and offer products to Canadians.  The more competition there 
is, clearly the better. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we need to afford the banks an effective way to be able 
to defend their position within our economy.  When people see the 
record profits in terms of what the banks actually bring in, it 
is healthy to keep this in perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My learned colleague, the hon. member for Brandon—Souris, who 
is our party's new finance critic and temporarily replacing 
another very learned finance critic, Scott Brison, the former 
hon. member for Kings—Hants, pointed out a very unknown fact. 
One in two Canadians own a bank share or bank stock. It may be 
through owning the exact share on a direct basis.  It may be 
through participation in a mutual fund.  There is a virtual array 
of stocks in numerous funds of that nature.  It could be due to 
the fact that they are a contributor to a pension plan.  Pension 
plans invest heavily in our banking institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The return on investment is not exorbitant for banks when we 
look at the size of the financial institutions themselves.  The 
ROI for banks may not be much greater than a lot of other 
successful companies on a percentile basis, but the record 
profits that show up are related to their actual size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one comment that was brought forth by our cousins in 
the NDP.  Usually when it comes to money issues, financial 
initiatives and issues related to taxation or the like, I 
disagree with the socialist wing of the House on almost every 
single occasion, with the exception of what was brought forth in 
the comments made by the hon. member for Vancouver East.  She 
touched on something very appropriate, that we need to ensure 
that banks must open accounts for any individual to cash federal 
cheques for non-customers, provided that identification is 
provided.  A minimum deposit and employment cannot be a condition 
of opening an account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see discrimination of Canadian citizens who are indeed at 
lower income levels.  The more we can do to ensure that the banks 
do their part and that they are much more welcoming for 
individuals of lower income, the better.  Banking institutions 
have to be open to all individuals.  The comments made by the 
hon. member for Vancouver East were dead-on on that aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an initiative to ensure that the banking institutions 
modernize and recognize the very fact that how we bank today is 
drastically different from what we did only five or ten years 
ago, even only two years ago.  I suspect many members of the 
House now bank via the Internet.  I started to do that about six 
months ago.  We pay our banks en masse through telebanking.  We 
use ATMs to do the majority of our banking functions.  How we 
deal and interact with our banks has changed.  That is why it is 
imperative we have legislation which reflects that reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to understand that the government has missed out on 
one aspect in particular.  That is with respect to how it would 
potentially deal with the issues of mergers.  There was the 
fracas when the finance minister claimed that he learned the 
Royal Bank of Canada wanted to merge with the Bank of Montreal 
over the news while he was brushing his teeth or while he was 
drinking his morning coffee and reading the newspaper that day. 
This finance minister has probably been the most connected to Bay 
Street in the history of Canada, yet he was not plugged in 
enough to be able to know what was going on in the financial 
sector.  To be quite honest, I find that very hard to believe or 
an incredible event.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister missed an enormous chance to upgrade the 
financial institution sector within Canada during the merger 
debate.  I remember the CEOs of the Royal Bank, the Bank of 
Montreal, the TD and the CIBC were willing to make blood promises 
in terms of how this would benefit Canadians to permit the merger 
process to proceed.  I am not advocating a position by any means 
on whether to permit the mergers at that time was right or wrong. 
However, it was definitely wrong to cut off discussions at that 
point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, they were willing to make a blood promise on 
maintaining the number of rural banking institutions. They were 
willing to make a blood promise in terms of increasing and 
augmenting the risks of lending funds to the small business 
sector.  I remember reading that they were willing to make 
another blood promise in terms of holding the line, if not 
rolling back, en masse, service charges to customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether those blood promises would have been in the best 
interests of Canadians or whether to permit the mergers are 
questions that Canadians and legislators never had a chance to 
publicly debate because the finance minister chose to be a 
populist.  He said that banks were unpopular.  He was not going 
to proceed to give them anything because it may jeopardize his 
leadership aspirations down the road.  I suspect that was likely 
the greatest issue during the debate at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to talk about improving and modernizing the banking 
sector, the financial institution sector.  I hope we see 
legislation in the near future that will augment and increase the 
fundamentals of the economy.  If we look at our rates of 
taxation, Canada has the second highest corporate tax rate as a 
per cent of our economy of all G-7 nations.  We know that as a 
per cent of our economy our personal income taxes are the highest 
of the G-7 nations.  We also know that as a per cent of our 
economy, the dollars we spend paying down the interest and not 
really addressing the national debt is an immense drain on our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of a 900-page bill, which the government does not care 
to have its members defend or even talk about its attributes, I 
would like to see some vision to get our economic fundamentals in 
order.  Let us do what the Progressive Conservative Party has 
advocated and pay down our national debt in a legislative way. 
We need to lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Where did you get that idea? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  The hon. member from the Alliance has 
just asked where I would get the idea that the Progressive 
Conservative Party wants to pay down debt and lower taxes.  I 
will read from a note of earlier today which in fact says that in 
many instances the policies of the Progressive Conservative Party 
and the reform alliance are almost identical.  This is definitely 
the case when it comes to one of the most important issues for 
Ontarians which is fiscal policy, including taxation, debt 
reduction and the overall management of Canada's pocketbook.  I 
ask the member for Brandon—Souris if he knows who actually wrote 
those words.  It was the Canadian Alliance MP from the riding of 
Markham who endorsed the Progressive Conservative economic plan. 
That is where I get those particular ideas that he referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to be able to ensure that we pay down debt in a 
legislative way to ensure that those individuals who want to 
invest in the Canadian economy will do so because they are not 
doing that today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Canadian dollar is at a mere 66 cents.  That is 
why it is perhaps at its lowest levels in a modern era compared 
to our principle trading partner, this time being the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that it is a very clear signal that foreign 
investors are challenging whether investing in this country is 
the right thing to do in the future.  We need to send out some 
signals that we will not threaten any provincial profits by 
excessive rates of taxation, both from a personal income tax 
perspective and from a corporate tax perspective, and that we 
will get our economic fundamentals in order by paying down debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The high dollar helps our trade ratio to some degree, but in the 
long term it is a signal that Canadians as global competitors are 
becoming poor.  Our capacity to buy goods in the global market 
has indeed been weakened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the government has very little vision or interest in 
the legislative agenda of the great nation of Canada.  There are 
900 pages and so far we have heard from one government speaker. I 
do not know whether this has ever been done to this degree in the 
history of the parliamentary process.  It has been amazing to 
watch it unfold.  There have been 900 pages and one government 
speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is lacking vision let individuals speak who 
are ahead of their time.  Some people call the Right Hon. Joe 
Clark yesterday's man.  He will be in the House to actually 
augment the parliamentary system in the next number of months. He 
is an individual who wanted to pay down debt and balance budgets 
in 1979 when everybody thought it was a kooky idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may have been yesterday's man because he was ahead of his 
time yesterday.  We need to be able to show the kind of fortitude 
and leadership that Mr. Clark demonstrated with his budget in 
1979.  We need to see the same kind of vision and fortitude that 
we saw with the free trade agreement in 1988.  In both instances 
it was done by Progressive Conservative prime ministers.  That is 
what we need to be able to see to augment and maintain our 
position in the global community, not just technical bills on 
banking institutions.  We need to get our fiscal house in order 
by paying down debt, lowering taxes and investing in our priority 
areas of health care and post-secondary education. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate hearing the comments of the hon. member, and 
particularly his concern that it is very curious members of the 
Liberal Party are not speaking to this bill.  Neither is the 
Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strikes me as bizarre on such a major piece of legislation, 
900 pages that will affect every Canadian who has a bank account. 
As I mentioned in my remarks people are outraged about the way 
the banks operate.  There is a huge amount of interest in 
ensuring that consumers get a fair shake or deal.  It is quite 
alarming to note that government members are not even willing to 
debate the issue.  What are they afraid of? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has expressed his concerns and those of his 
constituents.  However I know one concern of the NDP is that 
there is an absence of a community reinvestment provision within 
Bill C-38, particularly for regions of Canada such as the hon. 
member represents where there is economic disparity, where local 
communities are hurting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have reinvestment by these vastly profitable banks is 
something that would be very healthy for local economies.  It 
would help small businesses, individual entrepreneurs, the local 
economy and would have a spin-off effect.  Should we not be 
legislating that kind of community reinvestment in the banking 
industry?  I would appreciate hearing whether the member and his 
party supports that and whether or not they will put pressure on 
the government to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member for Vancouver 
East brings forth a very interesting issue but something that 
would have perhaps been even more difficult to do in a modern 
context even a few years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Banks sometimes may be the only visible financial institution 
within a small town.  They obviously would benefit from revenues 
from profits from Visa cards, small business loans, mortgages and 
all the financial products they sell.  It is very difficult in 
this modern context to look at companies such as Citicorp, ING 
Direct or many other companies that are basically virtual banks 
which provide their products by electronic media.  Obviously 
their direct investment within those communities or even in the 
country would be essentially nil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has provided Canadians with more competition and more 
choice.  I support categorically being able to put a ratio in 
terms of what their investments would actually be.  This is why I 
am a little reticent from my perspective to merely bank bash. The 
issue is far more complex than it use to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we deregulated financial sector institutions on February 
14, 1997, we said it was okay for Citicorp, MNBA and ING to have 
access to some small business loans, profitable mortgages, 
personal loans or even credit card business.  Yet the banks were 
losing some of their most profitable dollars.  Now they are in a 
situation where they are hard pressed to find new products to 
deliver to maintain their position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, bank bashing is not in anybody's interest. One 
out of every two Canadians owns a bank stock in some way, shape 
or form.  The role of parliament and the role of legislation is 
to keep financial institutions in check and to define roles and 
regulations that are responsive to consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the member for Vancouver East on her commitment to 
having a regime that would ensure that low income Canadians are 
not discriminated against at our banks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, would my friend in the Conservative Party agree with me 
that there should not be a change in the wide ownership rule? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years we had regulations brought in by the Pearson 
Liberals which stated that a person could own no more than 10% of 
the shares of any bank.  That was done to protect the Canadian 
banking industry, to keep it Canadian.  At one time there was a 
rule that said no more than 25% of the shares could be owned by 
foreigners.  That rule went by the wayside during free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will be changed.  It will be moved from 10% to 20% of 
voting shares and 10% to 30% of non-voting shares for big banks 
with equity of more than $5 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medium size banks are defined as banks with between $1 billion 
and $5 billion in equities per year.  There is concern in the 
province of Quebec that the National Bank will come under 
different rules.  In terms of medium size banks the rules 
indicate that only 35% is to be widely held.  In other words, 
somebody could buy 65% of the Banque Nationale.  The member 
mentioned ING Direct, Citibank or Chase Manhattan which could go 
in there and buy the Banque Nationale, the Laurentian Bank or the 
Bank of Western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree that the same rules should apply to medium size 
banks in terms of being widely held as applied to the large

more foreign control influence in our banking system, something 
that now is truly Canadian?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think the hon. member 
asked me two questions.  I have a problem with moving it from 10% 
to 20%.  I am not as concerned by that aspect given the fact that 
the Canadian banking sector has indeed far more foreign 
investment, far more foreign competition, far more foreign 
involvement than it had before.  If that is a result of the 
situation then in order to maintain our sovereignty we need 
strong Canadian banks.  My initial reaction to 20% is that I am 
not overly concerned about it.  That is something that we can 
flesh out during the clause by clause process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address the hon. member's second question, I think the 65% 
issue is a very real concern.  Perhaps it is potentially 
something that should be discussed and addressed at the committee 
level, particularly relative to the National Bank or the 
Laurentian Bank.  It is something that warrants further debate. I 
am not at all close to investigating the 20% ratio to the same 
degree, but I can see where 65% is an area of concern as a start. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am glad the member of the Conservative Party is 
willing to take a look it.  The concern in that regard would be a 
takeover of the National Bank or the Laurentian Bank.  Then we 
would have the headquarters moving out of Montreal, out of the 
province of Quebec and indeed out of Canada, if it were bought by 
a foreign entity.  It seems to me the same rules should apply to 
mid-size banks as apply to larger banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member be in agreement that it is kind of puzzling the 
National Bank, which is quite large and not that much smaller 
than the smallest of the big five or six, should come under 
different rules, particularly when we look at the politics of the 
national union, and be treated differently because of where its 
headquarters are located than those in the rest of the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, as I said to the hon. 
member before, that is something we can flesh out during the 
clause by clause process as the bill goes to committee.  That is 
why we are supporting actually sending the bill to committee so 
that we can start analysing these 900 pages since the government 
is not interested in debating them in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately I think a higher ratio is probably a natural 
progression as smaller banks move into becoming medium banks.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to take part in this important debate on a bill that, 
disappointing as it may be, still merits consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those just joining us, this is a bill concerning bank 
reform.  Bank reform is connected with democracy and with our 
conception of equal opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have anything for which to fault the government, it is 
that it has been, and continues to be, extremely timid about 
something that would have enabled us to set down a resolutely 
social-democratic foundation, one that was strongly in favour of 
equal opportunity and would have enabled us as 
parliamentarians—I take advantage of the presence here with us 
of the hon. member for Quebec to say this—to finally fight 
poverty effectively.  I will have an opportunity to come back to 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has been keeping abreast of the way the banks have 
been changing, as well as their strategic positioning, can see 
that there are whole areas, whole communities, in which there is 
no bank or branch.  A few years ago, Option Consommateurs, a body 
which obviously, as its name implies, is concerned with defending 
the consumer in the area of finance, did a survey on where banks 
located their branches. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was found that the map showing where there were no bank 
branches corresponded rather perfectly with the map of poverty. 
As I clearly recall from having seen the map, whether in Cape 
Breton, Newfoundland, eastern Montreal or southern Ontario, whole 
communities are being deprived of financial services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by reminding hon. members that the 
government mandated a task force some months ago. 
This task force went down in history under the name of its 
chairman, Mr. MacKay. He and twenty or so commissioners looked at 
the Bank Act and at all the vehicles available in relation to the 
existing credit needs across Canada and made extremely specific 
recommendations to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MacKay commission was concerned about banks closing branches 
in certain Canadian communities without giving any advance notice 
or giving a second thought to the impact the loss of access to 
credit can have on a community. With this in mind, I have to say 
it will be difficult for the Bloc Quebecois to support Bill C-38 
if the government decides to maintain the status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Bloc Quebecois know full well that, since 1993, 
our colleague, the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, has been 
extremely preoccupied with all social justice and consumer 
protection issues. I understand that, through him and through me, 
our party will be bringing forward amendments in committee as 
well as at report stage. I hope such an important debate will not 
suffer from partisan politics. I hope that, when they vote on the 
amendments that will be put forward, all members will have only 
one consideration in mind, which boils down to the following 
question: will the proposed amendment improve the bill and 
enhance consumer protection? That consideration must override any 
partisan objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going into the substance of the amendments I wish to 
propose with the help of my colleague, I must say that we will 
not support Bill C-38 because it seems to suffer from a serious 
imbalance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider the Bank Act, we realize that there is a 
balance to be achieved in the ownership of the banks.  There was 
consensus, a rule within the world of Canadian banking to the 
effect that no one could hold more than 10% of the shares of the 
banks.  This formula meant relative success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say “relative” because we must not think that the banking 
sector is not a concentrated sector.  There are six or seven 
chartered banks, defined under the first schedule of the Bank 
Act, controlling a significant portion of the capital held by the 
banks and holding much of the power relating to the banks. 
Nevertheless, it appeared that the rule of 10% was a sort of 
guideline, a safeguard, a rule of caution that permitted too high 
a concentration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the member for Quebec, who is following this 
matter, like many others, knows as I do that there is a provision 
in the bill allowing the mid-size banks to hold 20%.  A single 
shareholder could hold 20%.  We do not fully understand the 
rationality of all that.  As my colleague for Quebec has pointed 
out, there are even banks in another category that could be held 
by a single owner.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not quite understand the rationale of changing this 
balance, which was considered healthy in the world of banks. We 
can count on the fire, the determination, even the tempered 
aggression of the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot to wage a 
proper battle.  We hope the members on the government side will 
understand common sense at least once in their life and will 
comprehend the need to vote in favour of the Bloc's amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the time being, I would like to discuss a matter I have been 
familiar with since 1996.  I know that when I rise in this House 
that I still look like I am in my thirties and that the years 
have stood still. 
However, the fact is that this is already my second term and I 
am pleased to announce that I will seek a third one. I am taking 
this opportunity to mention that, as we know, the Bloc Quebecois 
is first in the polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I believe that the hon. member who left the 
Conservatives to join the Liberals must have some regrets about 
such an ill-advised move, because in Quebec the party that is 
most popular among Quebecers, that is number one in the polls, 
is definitely the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues on this side of the House will agree that we are 
very confident that we will win the riding of Compton—Stanstead, 
where we have a very good candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I would like to continue on the issue of 
community reinvestment by banks. In 1996, I travelled to 
Washington to meet Joe Kennedy Jr., who quit politics in a 
context that there is no need to mention here in this House—things 
happened with the maid and he had to resign—but this 
does not fundamentally belong to the public domain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, they have a second generation of 
legislation on community reinvestment by banks. I took a very 
close look at the purpose of what is called the community 
reinvestment act, the CRA, to make it clear for all 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think members will agree with me that it would be perfectly 
possible to have a provision in the Bank Act that would be very 
closely patterned on that legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A regulated financial institution is required to show that its 
deposit facilities, the branches, are serving the deposit and 
credit needs of the community for which it has been given a 
charter—and this is very important and I emphasize this—it has 
an obligation to help meet the credit needs of the local 
communities associated with that charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very interesting point is that the United States has someone 
similar to the superintendent of financial institutions, someone 
who takes an annual look at what the various banks are doing to 
meet the credit needs of the community as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, when one owns three SMEs, is independently wealthy, 
and is a prosperous businessperson, one has no trouble obtaining 
credit. But when one is in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve or 
Saint-Sauveur or certain areas of Rosemont, my colleague must 
realize, or certain parts of Trois-Rivières—I would qualify this 
somewhat for Chambly, but I think there are areas of poverty in 
Chambly—when one is in certain communities where poverty is 
widespread, the fact is that the banks are no longer there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  Twenty years ago, in 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, there were 20 banks.  How many are left 
today?  Four.  To all intents and purposes, there are no banks in 
my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had legislation allowing the superintendent of financial 
institutions to assess how the chartered banks are meeting the 
credit needs of all communities, we, as legislators, would have a 
mechanism for putting pressure on the banks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banking system in the United States is far more fragmented. 
There are local banks, regional ones and ones that are more 
nation-wide.  However, if a bank wants to expand and do business 
in more than one state—such is the control the American 
legislator has over the banks—if a New York bank wants to expand 
to Illinois for instance, it must respond to the credit needs of 
the entire community.  A rating of A, B, C or D is given, and 
made known to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American system is not, first and foremost a coercive one; 
it is a system focused on consumer protection.  It is 
understandable, however, that when the First Bank of America has 
a poor rating on its dealings with disadvantaged communities and 
that rating is released to the public and the consumer 
associations become aware of it, it is pretty hard for that bank 
to justify that it is a good corporate citizen.  The entire 
American system, while not coercive, is based on pressure from 
the public and from consumer groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved in a few battles in my life, but this one 
is an important one.  I would like to think that all hon. members 
of the House are going to support the amendment the Bloc 
Quebecois is going to introduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sensed a certain openness in the minister. Examination of 
the white paper the government has made public, and of this bill, 
does lead one to feel that any openness is rather cautious and 
has not reached maturity. The government could have gone a lot 
further than it has, but there is a desire to have low-fee retail 
deposit accounts.  There would, of course, have to be a 
definition of everything that this would mean, but it seems to me 
that the community reinvestment act would be part of the 
philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American legislation exists within a framework of four 
monitoring bodies.  I would like to give hon. members a few 
examples of the form community reinvestment by the banks may 
take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be low cost operations.  As we well know, for every 
banking transaction there is a charge, whether for a debit, a 
credit, cashing a cheque or paying a bill.  It could be $1.75, 
$2, or $2.75. 
Certain American states permit exemptions in banking business 
for the most needy.  This is an example of the very specific 
form bank community reinvestment may take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could also be in the form of accounts set aside for consumers 
writing a limited number of cheques.  It could also be the banks 
in certain parts of the northeastern states that have agreed to 
provide mortgages for home improvements in low income sectors. 
It could also be an economical chequing account including a 
minimum account.  It could be the processing of five cheques at 
no charge every month or the cashing of government cheques for 
free.  I think generally this is already the case in Quebec and 
Canada. 
I do not think that a person receiving income security or who 
has an old age security cheque has to pay charges.  This should 
be checked, but I do not think there is a charge on these 
cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Armed with this information, I did my duty as a parliamentarian 
and introduced, as I mentioned earlier, a bill in 1996, which I 
have to say got a lot of support from my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois.  It was in such a moment that I really felt we formed 
a strong parliamentary team.  I criss-crossed all of Quebec to 
get bank books signed.  I do not know if the members recall 
that.  It was a sort of petition in the form of a bank book.  I 
was in the riding of Frontenac—Mégantic and I went to Quebec 
City, and I have warm memories of that visit.  My colleague, the 
member for Québec, met me. 
We visited the Saint-Roch mall, which had been renovated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec City truly made a considerable investment. I was there 
not too long ago. I sensed that throughout Quebec people were 
strongly in favour of having legislation similar to the United 
States legislation on community reinvestment by banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill had five major objectives. To achieve fairness in 
community reinvestment, which was the object of my bill, the 
banks located in poor communities would have had to review their 
operations, systems, rules and practices and then measure the 
gap between the deposits and the loans granted to designated 
people in a given community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once that review had been completed, the banks would have had to 
table a report indicating which measures they intended to adopt 
if a gap was found between the deposits received by the banks 
and the loans granted by them in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, and this was perhaps the most important aspect of the 
bill, the superintendent of financial institutions would have 
had an obligation to propose evaluation criteria that were 
likely to promote the implementation of the notion of community 
reinvestment. A report was to be tabled in the House by the 
Minister of Finance to allow us to understand, to have a global 
idea of the effort made by banks in poor communities. I believe 
that was an excellent bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-38 allows us to take another look at this provision and it 
is our hope, as parliamentarians, to encourage banks to be 
present in every community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I remind the House that when banks are not 
present in communities, other groups take over. I recently spoke 
about pawnbrokers. Pawnbrokers exploit poor people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, we must realize that when banks are not 
present in poor communities, they are replaced by others, but 
this is not always to the benefit and well-being of consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all members to reflect on these issues, to show 
openness and to support the amendment that the Bloc Quebecois 
will move in favour of community reinvestment by banks.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the brilliant speech by my colleague, the member 
for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just learned something and I thank the member for it. 
With regard to community reinvestment—I am sorry but that is 
what I had in mind—I thought the obligation to give money to a 
particular sector or a particular activity was automatic. I see 
this is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague seems to have a good knowledge of all the aspects 
of the American banking system. In the United States, where they 
have community reinvestment legislation, have banks or bankers 
been exempted from paying taxes elsewhere in compensation for 
these investments in the community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if such compensation exists. 
Has the member studied this side of the issue? I agree with the 
kind of reinvestment he is proposing, namely a reduction of 
service fees for low income users. 
In the United States, has the government found a way to 
compensate the banks by taking less money from them?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will understand why I am asking this question. When the current 
Minister of Finance brought down his 1999 budget, the Bloc 
Quebecois spoke out against the fact that the minister was being 
very generous to the richest, namely the banks, and that they 
should be paying a lot more taxes than they had been up to that 
point. Despite a slight tax increase in that sector, it clearly 
was not enough to create social justice as well as tax fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve if the 
Americans do the same kinds of favours as our good finance 
minister does to his banker friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the hon. 
member for Chambly and notary in a former life, for his question. 
His question falls, it seems to me, half-way between wholly 
financial concerns and his endless thirst, which I acknowledge, 
for social justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the hon. member for Chambly is right.  I could never 
produce for the hon. members any examples of hypocrisy off the 
top of my head that would equal the actions of the Minister of 
Finance, because I do not know of any.  The fact is that our 
colleague from Hyacinthe—Bagot could be more accurate than I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that in the last budget we raised the matter of $180 
million in taxes the banks had to pay from 1994 on.  We were not 
all that comfortable with the idea that it was necessary to 
lighten the fiscal burden of the banks because we acknowledge 
their right to make money. They operate within a highly protected 
environment under the Bank Act and schedule 1.  Thus there is no 
true competition in the banking sector.  There will perhaps be 
more in future but that has certainly not been the case in the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, in order to provide my colleague with an accurate 
answer, I do not believe there is any interconnection.  From my 
examination and understanding of the community reinvestment act, 
it is my belief that its objective is definitively to provide 
better access to credit to all communities in the United States 
and that we must not look for connections with income tax and 
other tax matters.  They are, in my understanding, totally 
independent of each other. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask 
my colleague to be a little more specific about how Bill C-38 
will upset the financial system in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, he mentioned percentages, the percentages of shares 
that could be held and how Bill C-38 would be at odds with 
practice in Quebec.  What the Bloc Quebecois says in its 
dissenting report is that Bill C-38 on bank mergers would pose a 
threat to the National Bank, for instance, which is the bank for 
SMBs in Quebec.  What specifically would happen—that is what I am 
asking my colleague for the benefit of those watching—and could 
he expand a bit on the difficult balance faced by our banking 
industry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Québec.  As 
members know, I respect her and what she stands for and, of 
course, continues to stand for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the most eloquent answer came from Quebec's 
minister of finance, one of the best as we know to have sat on 
the government benches.  With the House's permission, I will 
quote what he said to the federal Minister of Finance last 
December at the meeting of finance ministers: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made known to you our concerns with respect to your planned 
amendments to the rules governing banks in Canada. 
Your proposal would provide different treatment for banks with 
large, medium or small capital. In the case of large banks, that 
is those with over $5 billion in capital, it would be possible 
for an individual to hold not 10% but 20% of the voting shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The status of banks with $5 billion or less in capital is 
different. They can opt for a limited ownership regime. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT84"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT84"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1755

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing to understand is this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A given individual could have in excess of 20% of the voting 
shares, up to 65% for banks that have between $1 billion and $5 
billion in capital, and up to 100% for those that have less than 
$1 billion in capital. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, there is a risk that banks with less than $5 billion in 
equity could be owned by a single individual holding all the 
voting shares. But the banks that provide the greatest support 
to small and medium size businesses in Quebec are banks like the 
National Bank and the Laurentian Bank, which would be 
reclassified in the small bank category or in those with capital 
of less than $5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a legitimate concern because we believe that having a 
number of voting shareholders is a safeguard for democracy, 
since it goes against a concentration of ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I answered the question of the hon. member for Québec, 
whose intellectual curiosity is almost insatiable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it was a very interesting summer for the Canadian 
Alliance.  We chose a new leader.  Canadians across the country 
are excited.  As the NDP members were complaining this afternoon 
about the cost of my leader's fundraising dinner, I will tell 
them that Canadians are willing to pay to listen to the new 
leader.  I am sure that if NDP members wanted to do fundraising 
they probably would not be able to attract too many people.  I 
presume that is why they were complaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It my pleasure to speak to Bill C-38, an act to establish the 
financial consumer agency of Canada and to amend certain acts in 
relation to financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about financial institutions, Canadians in general 
have some concerns.  They are concerned about the way in which 
banks have been operating, about the monopoly they have had over 
the years and about how their profits have been increasing. These 
concerns arise from the fact that there is not much competition 
in the financial sector and that historically the banks have been 
protected.  There were reasons in the past for doing that, most 
importantly to ensure the viability of the banking system in 
Canada, which at that time worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the business environment in Canada and around the 
world has changed.  Today the environment calls for choices for 
the consumers.  Canadian consumers have seen how much they 
benefit from deregulation and what happens when a government lets 
businesses loose.  Lower costs for long distance telephone calls 
shows how a competitive environment can help Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The demand by Canadian consumers, and rightly so, is for choices 
in the banking sector.  The Canadian consumer is looking for 
lower service costs and better services.  To some degree the 
negative image that the Canadian consumer has was brought on by 
the banks themselves.  I am sure the banks can do a better job in 
letting the Canadian consumer know of the services they can 
provide.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the recent example of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines 
and the disaster it turned out to be during the early stages of 
the merger.  Canadians are strongly concerned about the lack of 
competition in the airline industry.  The government is dragging 
its feet as it does most of the time in coming up with solutions 
Canadians are looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's go slow approach can be seen in this bill 
itself.  It took seven years of foot dragging on the part of the 
government before it was able to bring forward some kind of 
legislation that has opened up the banking industry to higher 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Canadian Alliance will live with this bill because we 
see it is opening up the financial sector as demanded by 
Canadians.  We have a lot of concerns on many issues.  We feel 
the financial sector is not completely open. There are other 
levels of bureaucracy being installed in here.  Nevertheless 
there has been enough in this bill to allow competition to take 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will remember the bank merger fiasco that took place and 
the hue and cry made by Canadians, and rightly so.  Canadians 
felt there would be too much concentration of banks and less 
competition. Therefore there was a need for this kind of bill to 
come forward allowing the consumer to make choices and opening up 
the sector.  Once the sectors are opened up, banks can merge and 
become global players in today's market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the critic for international trade I see the opportunity for 
banks as markets are being opened up all over the world. 
Definitely Canadian banks have a role and they can play a leading 
role in that they need to have bigger capital, bigger markets and 
a bigger pool of expertise as well. That is fine, but Canadians 
are concerned about what happens to the domestic market.  Is it 
going to suffer at the expense of banks going into the 
international arena with mergers and consolidations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a concern to our party as well.  It is important that 
the Canadian banking sector be opened up to other players who can 
get in and pick up the niche if Canadian banks feel that they 
want to be out of the domestic market.  Personally, I think it 
would be foolish for them to do so. Nevertheless, we need to 
allow competition to take place. Canadians need to know that they 
have choices and this bill to some degree will do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from our Bloc colleague as well as our colleague 
from the NDP.  A very vague answer was given by my colleague from 
the PC Party in reference to medium size banks. Clearly, if we 
open up financial markets there are players who would be willing 
to pick up the niche.  Medium size Canadian banks can become big 
banks, but we have to let the market forces play to some degree. 
Let them consolidate.  Let them ensure they can seize the 
opportunities that are presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that will always remain is, what will happen to the 
Canadian consumer?  We feel that with competition opening up, 
Canadian consumers will be very well protected.  They will 
benefit from the opportunity of financial services that will open 
up in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  As the critic for international trade 
and with my work on the foreign affairs committee, I see the role 
of the Export Development Corporation.  The committee heard from 
numerous witnesses involved with international trade who 
recognized the need for greater availability of capital for them 
to do business overseas. Close to 43% of the GDP is tied to 
exports and Canadian companies are always looking for capital. 
This is one area where the banks can now take advantage and 
should be able to offer to Canadian companies this 
opportunity by giving this service.  In the past and until now 
they have been curtailed by EDC.  EDC is kind of a crown 
corporation.  It does not pay taxes.  It has been politicized for 
so long that even many Canadians do not know what EDC is and what 
its role is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that the government competes directly with the banks 
through the Export Development Corporation.  The Canadian 
Alliance feels that this competition should be abolished and that 
EDC should get out of the business of short and medium term 
export financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the interest of all Canadians that banks are able to 
play a vital role in our economy.  As it expands and we go into 
global markets, it is the banks that will be in the forefront to 
seize this opportunity in partnership with Canadian companies to 
create an economic environment that will benefit all Canadians. 
That is a key element in why the Canadian Alliance is in 
agreement to some degree with this bill which will allow the 
banks some flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course as usual the government has ensured that there are 
some tighter controls as well.  It has introduced the financial 
consumer agency and the ombudsman.  To some degree it looks very 
good.  It looks like the government is trying to ensure that 
Canadian consumer interests are protected.  However we have our 
past experience with the government. Who is going to be there? 
Will all the appointments be at arm's length or will they be more 
patronage positions for the Liberals to fill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time the government introduces some kind of control or 
bodies where it has the absolute authority, perhaps a 
parliamentary committee could look at the appointments instead of 
the finance minister looking after those appointments. That would 
give tremendous confidence to everybody over appointments to 
these boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We notice that the government did not go very far in expanding 
the credit unions' role.  That is one sector where it could 
expand and provide Canadian consumers with choices.  We sincerely 
believe that choices for Canadian consumers will in the long run 
work to bring lower service costs, lower fees and better services 
to consumers.  That does not mean to say that at this time the 
banks are not trying to provide service to consumers, they are. 
However with greater competition, innovative ideas will come 
forward. In order for the banks to retain their business they 
would definitely listen to the consumers. 
At the end of the day that is where the Canadian consumer is on 
all this opening up of the market.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Canadian Alliance will be supporting this 
bill based on the fact that it provides more and better choices 
for the Canadian consumer.  We would like to see more competition 
in the market and I am sure our critic will bring in some 
amendments to ensure that that happens. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again it amazes me that the 
Alliance Party, the former Reform Party, thinks that competition 
always has to be in terms of foreign competition.  On the airline 
policy, it would like to have more American carriers up here 
which eventually would destroy our Canadian airline industry.  It 
also wishes to have more foreign control of our financial 
institutions which would probably mean the end of Canadian 
control of our banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When talking about the banks, as they do about the post office, 
most Canadians do not say very many positive things about the 
banks but they do speak about the poor service or bank closures 
in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will give a tremendous amount of power to an 
individual finance minister.  He or she will have tremendous 
powers and will become a banking czar, taking away parliamentary 
responsibilities or even the ability of members of parliament, 
duly elected by the people of Canada, to have any input.  This is 
similar to the minister of fisheries whom we now call the fishing 
czar who has tremendous powers within his ministry which override 
the will of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member comment on the fact that the bill would 
make the finance minister a banking czar who would sometimes 
override the will of parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond 
to my colleague from the NDP.  We definitely have a philosophical 
difference in how we would like to approach this for the benefit 
of the Canadian consumer.  I am sure at the end of the day the 
member is thinking of the same thing, how the consumer can be 
protected, I will give him that but we have different ideas of 
how to do that.  He wants government regulation.  I tell him to 
look back in history and he will find that is not what has worked 
for Canadians.  There are examples that at the end of the day 
competition, deregulation and less government control have 
benefited the Canadian consumer and the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning his question about the finance minister becoming a 
powerful banking czar, I share the same concern with him. We do 
not want the finance minister to become a powerful czar. 
Nevertheless we feel that the parliamentary committee could have 
a role, at arm's length, as I said.  It would ensure the finance 
minister would not have that much of a powerful role. Parliament 
has to play a role, MPs have to play a role and the committee 
could play a definite role in ensuring that one person does not 
have that much control.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will only speak for about five 
minutes in order to allow my colleague from the Bloc to speak on 
this issue as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to say to the hon. member that it is quite ironic 
that those members wish to have this bill passed, and fairly 
quickly I would assume.  It is no coincidence that RBC Dominion 
Securities—and correct me if I am wrong but they are the same 
ones who had trouble with some sort of fraud situation that 
happened a while ago—will be one of the customers buying a 
$25,000 table at the Alliance dinner to meet with Mr. Day.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it quite ironic that the CBA, the Canadian Bankers 
Association, on which the Royal Bank is a member, wants very 
quick passage of this bill.  One just has to tie the links 
together; $25,000 for a table indicates quick passage of a bill. 
It is quite obvious from where the Alliance is speaking, and it 
is not in terms of the grassroots community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two letters in front of me.  One letter is from a person 
in Fredericton, New Brunswick and the other is from a person in 
River John, Nova Scotia.  Both of these individuals are small 
business people who are very concerned about the closure of their 
banks in their communities.  This is what happens when one has a 
central based government that thinks from Windsor to Quebec City 
and ignores the rural parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout, people have been very concerned and very passionate 
about their banks and, in most cases, myself included, have been 
very proud of our banking history, but lately the banks have 
forgotten what their purpose is in terms of service to the 
community and service to rural parts of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one will ever deny that banks are very generous when it comes 
to donations to various arts, sports and culture, and they should 
be congratulated for that, but what small communities require is 
a banking presence in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many seniors and people with disabilities are finding it very 
difficult to access banking services.  Some people do not have 
the technology or the finances to afford computer services in 
their homes.  The majority of Canadians still do not have 
computers in their homes.  Many people are very distrustful of 
the ATM services.  In some cases the ATM services are restricted 
in their ability to provide services to the majority of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a party we are also very concerned about the powers this bill 
would give one individual in parliament or, as in this particular 
case, in cabinet.  As I mentioned before in questions and 
comments, what happens is that the DFO minister, who I call the 
fishing czar, has incredible powers throughout his ministry to 
make changes.  A recent example of that is the arbitrary decision 
to move 1,500 metric tonnes of northern shrimp away from the 
Newfoundland and Labrador people and into the hands of the people 
of Prince Edward Island, completely forgetting the adjacency 
principle of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the finance minister can now make similar decisions, 
overriding the will of parliament or, for that matter, even 
overriding the will of the people of Canada through their elected 
officials by doing basically whatever he would like to do.  He 
would have the power to do that through the bill.  I find that 
very disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing that a document, which is 900 pages long, has to 
be rushed through the House so quickly.  If anything, a bill that 
has 900 pages should be extremely and carefully scrutinized. 
There should be no time limit on that.  It should be available so 
that every Canadian understands thoroughly, in very simple and 
plain language, exactly what this means in their daily lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle has gone through the 
bill very carefully and has mentioned some very serious concerns. 
He has mentioned the lack of community investment and the fact 
that a particular bank, like the Banque Nationale, could actually 
be absorbed and moved to the United States.  Those are very deep 
concerns not only for the province of Quebec but I am sure for 
other areas as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the bill will eventually do is lead to the slippery slope 
of American or foreign control of our financial institutions.  I 
believe most Canadians would fear that indeed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, one of my real concerns about the bill before the House 
today is the change in the wide ownership rule.  The government 
is now proposing we go from 10% of the shares being held by any 
one individual to 20% for voting shares and 30% for non-voting 
shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already sold out or given up so much of our country, it 
seems to me that if we change the wide ownership rule we will be 
inviting more concentration on the banking industry and more 
foreign ownership of the banking industry.  In essence, a couple 
of billionaires could control a big national bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to some people in my home city of Regina over the last 
couple of days who were also concerned about losing one of these 
last industries that really control the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much has changed with the free trade agreement.  This is one 
of the few that is still left. 
The other concern I have is that the government is now proposing 
to treat medium sized banks and large banks differently.  For 
large banks a foreigner, a wealthy individual or an institution 
could buy up to 20% of the shares.  For a medium sized bank, a 
bank with between $1 billion and $5 billion in equity, a single 
person could purchase 65% of the shares.  In other words, the 
Banque Nationale in Quebec could be purchased by the Chase 
Manhattan or by anybody else and suddenly that bank would be out 
of the province of Quebec and out of the country. With its 
headquarters gone jobs would be gone.  We would lose a very 
important part of our country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my friend from Nova Scotia whether he shares these 
points of view.  They are really two different questions in terms 
of the threshold rising and in terms of treating the three medium 
sized banks differently.  It is not just the Banque Nationale, it 
is also the Laurentian Bank and the Bank of Western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For smaller banks, banks with an equity of less than $1 billion, 
there are no rules or restrictions at all.  They can be owned by 
anyone, a foreigner or a Canadian.  There is a difference there 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the concerns I have in terms of the wide ownership 
rule and losing something that we have as Canadians, something 
that we have regulated and made work to a pretty decent degree 
over the years.  I am concerned that with the lack of debate 
going on in the House it will be be hard to mobilize public 
opinion to put pressure on the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal members are not even participating in this debate.  The 
minister spoke for about 12 minutes and that was it.  The 
official opposition spoke for a few minutes by putting up one 
speaker and that was it.  They are not even rising on questions 
and comments when we are debating a very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill that is over 900 pages in length, a bill that 
affects many other pieces of legislation.  This is not just 900 
pages, but the consequential changes in other legislation amounts 
to another 4,000 pages of legislation as well.  Much of this will 
be done by order in council, by memorandums of understanding and 
by guidelines.  The minister will have tremendous power in terms 
of being a banking czar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the concerns that a lot of us have.  I hope we can 
engage some of the members across the way in this debate.  It is 
a very important issue.  They talked a lot during the bank merger 
campaign in 1998-99 about changing the rules and putting more 
power back into parliament and giving less power to the 
bureaucrats and the minister and here is their chance to do that. 
Let us have some real engagement in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, I 
believe this is the very quick, slippery slope to foreign control 
of our banking institutions as well as the re-engineered talks of 
the bank mergers themselves.  Even the banks have said that if 
they were allowed to merge thousands upon thousands of Canadians 
would lose their jobs and thousands of branches would be closed 
throughout Canada.  I believe, as is the case with most other 
institutions in this country, that we will eventually lose control 
of these institutions and they will be moved over to American or 
foreign control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it astonishing that the Canadian Alliance and the Liberal 
Party have refused to debate this issue.  Usually when they 
refuse to debate that means they are trying to hide something or 
trying to slip something through on the Canadian people. I find 
it disgusting that they will not even engage Canadians on this 
very important topic. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to know how the hon. member feels about 
deep tax cuts, the type of tax cuts that would mean that every 
single family across the country would pay less tax? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for 
Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore.  I am sure that he 
is talking about tax cuts under Bill C-38. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know we are switching 
the topic here but I do not think there is one Canadian who does 
not think that he or she is paying too much taxes.  However, what 
they also want is accountability for the public dollars that they 
send to Ottawa, and that, unfortunately, is not helping right 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is okay to think about tax cuts but if they turn into user 
fees we have a bigger problem.  As I have said many times in the 
House, we need a full and open debate on taxation from the 
municipal, provincial, territorial and federal levels. We also 
need a full debate on what programs Canadians want, how much they 
are willing to spend and on the accountability of 
parliamentarians in order to spend their hard earned tax dollars.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is rather puzzling to 
see no one from the official opposition getting involved in this 
debate except for that last very short question, which was really 
a question on a different topic.  I wonder if this has something 
to do with the big dinner coming up in Toronto where the Canadian 
Alliance is selling tables for $25,000 to very wealthy people. 
This shows that it is a party that has moved a long way from 
ordinary citizens and a long way from the grassroots.  I wonder 
if this has had some impact on members of parliament as to 
whether or not they were willing to get up and debate the issues 
respecting banks because some of the people buying these tables 
will surely be bankers.  They will not be ordinary people living 
on the east side of Calgary or at the north end of Regina.  It 
will be wealthy people on Bay Street and a lot of banking people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also noticed that the profits of some of our big banks have 
been escalating in the last few years.  If we go back to 1992, 
for example, the profit of the big six banks was $1.8 billion, in 
1994 it was $4.3 billion, in 1997 it was $7.6 billion and in 1999 
it was $9.2 billion.  With that kind of money I am sure some of 
these people will be buying tables at $25,000 a pop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have questions about big tax cuts for wealthy people and 
millionaires.  Today somebody in the House said that the 17% flat 
tax promised by the Alliance Party would give someone making a 
million dollars a year a tax cut of $130,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite a metamorphosis for a party that started off as a 
grassroots party.  It is now a party of Bay Street, a party of 
big business and a party of the wealthy and the privileged.  I 
wonder if that is why its members are not participating in this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will quickly answer 
that question with another question.  How many individual members 
of the Alliance Party will actually be able to afford the dinner? 
I doubt that very many of them will be there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I sat today listening to the various 
speeches on Bill C-38.  I would like to throw out some questions 
as this hour concludes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has the healthiest banking system.  No, I do not own any 
shares in a bank, but Canada does have a banking system that is 
the envy of the world.  I wonder what Canadians would think today 
looking in on this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard members say that banks should be required to stay in 
business.  Would the government require Dairy Queen to stay in 
business if a town was folding up?  I heard people say that the 
banking industry is an evil institution because it charges for 
its services.  I heard people say in the House that there is no 
competition. 
There is more competition in the banking industry today than 
ever in the history of Canada.  Everywhere we go there is more 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we should be doing, instead of trying to drivel out some 
1955 or earlier speeches about how to nationalize the banking 
industry in Canada, is talking about the fact that the 
institutions that are providing competition to the banks are 
valuable institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would members want to paint a picture, not only for the 
investment community but for all Canadians, that our banking 
institution is something of a very evil nature?  That is the 
message they are putting out.  I am ashamed as a Canadian to have 
to listen to this drivel about the banking institution, which is 
world famous, being an evil institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think anyone on 
this side of the House said we should nationalize banks.  I also 
do not think anybody on this side of the House said that they 
were evil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is right, our banking institutions are the envy of 
the world.  They are extremely profitable and communities in 
River John, Nova Scotia and Fredericton, New Brunswick are very 
concerned about the closure of their banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not demand that they provide this service.  They are 
making billions and billions of dollars.  One would think that 
they would have some community spirit left in their banking souls 
in order to provide service to Canadians.

</H3><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It being 6.30 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 52 and to order made earlier this day, the House 
will now proceed to the consideration of a motion to adjourn the 
House for the purpose of discussing a specific and important 
matter requiring urgent consideration, namely organized crime. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC)</B> 
moved: 
<A NAME="LINK252">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House do now adjourn. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Mr. Speaker, this is clearly a very important issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you have outlined, Mr. Speaker, this emergency debate is as a 
result of a situation that has evolved in recent months and years 
but which is escalating.  It is a situation that has become very 
critical in the country.  Organized crime is becoming more rooted 
daily in various communities across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly something that is not limited to any province. 
It may be argued that in the province of Quebec there is an acute 
presence of organized crime activity and established gangs which 
could be due in part to the headquarters located there and the 
length of time they have been involved in their various heinous 
activities in that province.  However, they are branching out. 
They are spreading out like a plague across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime is something that is not new to Canada, but it 
is becoming increasingly sophisticated in its nature.  It is 
becoming increasingly diverse, like an industry that has 
diversified.  Organized crime is a problem in rural Canada as 
much as it is in the cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin my remarks by indicating that this is truly a 
non-partisan issue.  This is not an issue with which anyone wants 
to play politics.  This is an issue on which we should be united. 
Of all things in this place, it is an issue on which we should 
be working together to try to eradicate and address and at least 
discuss matters in which we can do so in a civil fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the old Neil Young song <I>Rust Never Sleeps</I>, crime 
never sleeps.  This is something which is taking place day and 
night across the country.  It is happening at all times.  It is 
not prejudicial.  It takes place in communities where there is 
perhaps less money and wealth.  It preys on the weak.  It uses 
intimidation.  It is insidious in its approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representing the district of Kingston, I know this will be of 
interest to you, Mr. Speaker.  Being an area where there have 
been reports of increasing biker turf wars taking place and where 
there is a concentration of Canada's federal penal institutions, 
it is a prime area for organized crime.  Individuals are often 
released from prisons right into the waiting arms of organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Saturday more than 70 motorcycle gangs, including dozens 
from the Rock Machine, were in the city of London, Ontario for an 
annual social event with outlaw biker gangs. They were trying to 
forge relationships.  Just like corporations, they are forming 
mergers and working together to gain allies in their continuing 
war with the Hell's Angels in this instance, for strength and a 
lion's share of the organized crime activity which is going on. 
As part of that continuing war, the Hell's Angels, in this 
escalating war between them and the Rock Machine, are talking 
about control of the illegal drug trade, adult entertainment, 
extortion and racketeering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is apparent.  People no longer feel safe in their 
communities.  They feel that much of what the police do now is 
simply monitoring instead of having the ability to intervene and 
strike at the heart of the issue.  Much of that I suggest is due 
to the lack of resources.  Where the police fall down in this 
regard is that they do not have the ability, the financial 
resources, to compete with organized crime in the fashion in 
which they should.  Nor do they have the legislative teeth, which 
is what they have been calling for.  They want the ability to 
gain access to warrants so they can move quickly.  In most 
instances, the police are facing a critical situation where they 
have to quickly act with great force in a very prudent fashion. 
They are dealing with limited resources.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, organized crime does not have to stay within the 
bounds of the law.  Those people do not have to follow certain 
established procedures.  They do not have to wait for a warrant 
to arrive or ensure that certain legal remedies are adhered to. 
That is fine.  We all accept the fact that the police have to 
adhere to the rule of law but they are being curtailed.  They 
have one hand behind their backs when compared with the organized 
crime they are seeking to eradicate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Quebec there have been a number of instances 
in recent days and months.  Journalists who have exposed and 
written about this problem have become the direct targets and 
have been attacked.  There have been attempted assassinations. 
This is escalating and reaching new and dangerous levels. We in 
this place certainly should be discussing ways to address and 
remedy the situation, if at all possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago the minister from the province of Quebec, Serge 
Ménard, urged the federal government to consider the use of the 
notwithstanding clause when dealing with membership in gangs like 
the Hell's Angels and the Rock Machine.  During the same period 
when the issue was being discussed, Michel Auger was shot five 
times in the back for writing about this exact scenario.  We do 
not know the perpetrators of that offence but the timing 
certainly leads one to believe that it was related to those 
articles and that subject matter which he had chosen to write 
about in the public forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal gangs are present in virtually every province. 
Organized crime has infiltrated almost every element of society. 
Most recently, smuggling rings have been appearing with alarming 
frequency on the west coast. The Chinese snake head gangs or 
triads are becoming increasingly present.  They are becoming most 
blatant and almost unrepentant in trying to bring people into 
this country illegally, the human trade, as it has been called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is dehumanizing and a threat to the very underpinnings of 
democracy that this is taking place.  Yet the police, our 
internal security service, feel curtailed in their efforts to 
deal with this threat.  Obviously it is not limited to any one 
element of organized crime.  There are the traditional mafia type 
syndicates in place.  There are increasing reports that eastern 
bloc countries, in particular the Soviet Union, have staked out a 
market here in North America.  They are perceived by the police 
as being a real threat because of their ruthless nature.  There 
are the Chinese triads which I have referred to.  Right across 
the board in every corner of the country we are seeing elements 
of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own constituency, in Antigonish, we have seen a biker gang 
crop up. They are becoming blatantly apparent to all in the 
community of Antigonish.  In Saskatchewan there have been new 
openings of chapters of the Hell's Angels.  It is right across 
the board.  We are seeing it in Manitoba and Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The drug war often plays itself out on the streets and roads of 
every community. Innocent bystanders are very often caught in the 
crossfire of these exchanges.  The bombs that are planted by 
criminals are intended to intimidate, shut down or infiltrate one 
another but very often innocent people become the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when organized criminals and those who engage in this 
activity are caught and arrested and due process takes place, 
they wind up in jail but they continue to recruit.  They continue 
to actively organize and to communicate with one another.  As an 
example, last Wednesday, September 13, a Millhaven penitentiary 
inmate serving a 17 year sentence was charged again with drug 
related and weapons offences and conspiracy to commit escape 
after using a cellphone to import Colombian drugs into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appalling to think of the blatant and outright flaunting 
of the law that takes place when criminal gangs are involved. The 
recruiting that is going on has to be addressed as well. 
There is a great deal of outsourcing of criminal activity. Want 
to be criminals are brought into the fold and told they will be 
rewarded if they will do this bidding, if they will involve 
themselves in drug trafficking, prostitution and violence, to 
ingratiate themselves to their organized crime masters.  This is 
happening with increasing frequency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminals are recruiting young people to do their crimes.  This 
is happening.  It is something we cannot ignore and is something 
the government itself has to address in a more active way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we will hear from both the solicitor general and the 
Minister of Justice about this issue.  The Minister of Justice 
will rightly point out that the government has brought forward 
legislative initiatives. That is welcome.  It is welcome in the 
community. However in most cases the government refers repeatedly 
to the money that has been put into the CPIC system and the 
recent cheques that have been sent to the RCMP, but they are 
postdated.  The money will not be there for years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money has to come now.  The legislative initiatives have to 
occur immediately because it is creeping into society at every 
element.  Making announcements, either in the House or in the 
press gallery, as the government is prone to do, does not do 
anything but encourage organized crime when they find out that 
the money is not actually there.  The resources are shadow 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear time and time again about the priorities of the 
government.  Its number one priority was health care.  Then the 
defence minister said the number one priority was dealing with 
the lack of helicopters.  We heard today the number one priority 
is organized crime.  These priorities are shifting like the sands 
of the Sahara.  They are shifting perhaps like the sands in the 
sand traps where the Prime Minister plays golf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not going to help the problem.  It is not going to 
address the lack of resources the police have and the lack of 
legislative initiatives that are needed to allow the police to 
attack the problem, to engage in the warfare against criminal 
activity and gangs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We presently have a committee in place of which I am proud to 
say I am a member.  The justice committee has been tasked, at the 
initiative of the Bloc and with the endorsement of the entire 
House, to look at this issue in detail, and we will. There is a 
great deal to examine.  This is a very complex and involved 
matter.  There is no way to dumb down this issue as some in this 
place would like to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to attack organized crime at its root.  We have to cut 
off the flow of resources that they are using.  That may involve 
bringing in tougher legislation with respect to the proceeds of 
crime.  I know there are initiatives currently in place.  We can 
do more.  We can always do more when the problem is as acute and 
apparent as it is today.  Part of that certainly involves 
discussion here, but hopefully we will see concrete examples of 
the government reacting and acting in a responsible way, bringing 
forward concrete legislation, not talking about it here and in 
the press. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us actually do something.  Let us show Canadians that this 
place can work forcefully and in a timely fashion. Let us bring 
it about for all Canadians to see that the government is behind 
our policing agents and is behind the courts in their efforts to 
address and eradicate organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner of the RCMP is an individual with a long 
history of dealing with organized crime in a very practical way, 
on the front lines.  Perhaps the commissioner will, more than 
anyone else in the organization, have firsthand knowledge and an 
understanding of just how bad it is.  To demonstrate that, we 
heard a warning from the commissioner in his very first week in 
office.  He addressed this issue and specifically pointed out how 
bad it had become.  He talked about this in a serious fashion.  A 
warning was issued that should give us pause for reflection.  He 
is telling us that organized crime is ready to purchase 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening with interest to the discussion about 
fundraising and how political parties are often trying to raise 
money. That is accepted; that practice has always been there. But 
when parties put themselves on the auction block and they have 
high priced fundraising efforts, dinners set up for $25,000 a 
table, they are naively putting themselves forward and are 
vulnerable to exactly the type of purchase that Commissioner 
Zaccardelli has referred to and which he has warned us about.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of potential influence can be bought with $25,000.  Why 
would the players in organized crime not want to get in line? 
They certainly have the money.  They certainly have the resources 
and they are prepared to do it.  They have tried to do it in 
other fashions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime is out there.  It is actively undermining the 
moral fabric of communities.  It is out there every day working 
to do so.  It is coming out of the shadows.  It is not in the 
alleys.  It is not in the old flophouses the way it used to be. 
It is out there.  It is on the Internet.  It is in the homes of 
people we may know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heaven forbid that it ever makes it into the very home of 
democracy, but this is what the commissioner is talking about. He 
is indicating that parliamentarians, like other Canadians, are 
just as vulnerable.  It is sometimes that intangible element of 
intimidation that the organized crime players like to trade in. 
This is very much on their agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to act swiftly.  Most important, we cannot back away 
from this issue, try to bury it, try to ignore it or to pretend 
that it is not as acute as it is.  Organized crime is beginning 
to run rampant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have indicated that all sorts of different elements are 
competing for their market share.  We do not need to torque up 
the rhetoric.  We have to torque up solutions.  We have to torque 
up tangible and very real ways to address what is going on. 
Jumped up promises or post-dated cheques for any element of this 
just will not do it.  We do not need to talk about the 
priorities.  We have to realize that it is a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mean to diminish or make this a joking matter, but the 
time is certainly here.  I hope this debate will be the beginning 
of a real focus, not only by members of the opposition but more 
important by the government.  The RCMP recognizes it.  Municipal 
police forces, which are certainly doing the lion's share of 
policing in rural Canada, realize it.  They continually make this 
an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister herself will know, having attended a recent 
conference, that provincial ministers are looking to the 
government for co-operative efforts.  They are looking to the 
government for leadership and initiatives that would help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over the 
criminal code, and that is part of the solution.  That is part of 
where the change has to begin, whether it is through changes to 
organized crime elements of proceeds of crime or whether it 
involves giving the police greater latitude to seek warrants, to 
enter premises and to work in some effective way that they can 
move toward attacking crime where it begins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recruiting is becoming a bigger problem.  We may have to draft 
entirely new legislation that will deal specifically with the 
element of recruitment.  The suggestion that has been put forward 
and discussed already to some degree is the element of outlawing 
membership in these criminal organizations.  I know that those 
with tendencies toward protection of civil liberties are correct 
to have legitimate trepidation about how we do this in an 
effective way.  Part of it comes from a very specific definition 
of what encompasses organized crime.  What will that definition 
be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wearing of colours that signify membership in a criminal 
organization is simply wrong.  It is flaunting it in the faces of 
the authorities to go around flying the colours of an organized 
crime band.  We have to take decisive action here that 
demonstrates we are not only not intimidated but will push back 
and act in a more proactive rather than reactive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen it in the United States.  I do not always want to 
hold up the United States as a shining example, but it has given 
sufficient resources to help deal with the problem at its root. 
The disbanding of the coast guard and the ports police by the 
government has opened the ports for business.  It has signalled 
to organized crime that we can no longer control entry into the 
country of contraband materials.  That has led to all sorts of 
problems for local police and RCMP because they simply do not 
have the capacity to police those ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other glaring examples where the resources have been 
cut and the police have been left feeling like they are spinning 
their wheels.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an opportunity to step forward, to step up 
and show some leadership, to show some initiative and to give the 
police the help and the support through resources and legislative 
initiatives for which they are crying out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today can be evidence of that.  I am hoping that we will hear 
from the minister more than just the usual rhetoric and more than 
just the talk about what has been done already.  Let us talk 
about it in a proactive way in terms of what we can do to help 
our law enforcement community and what we can do to help shore up 
the doubt out there that we are losing ground, that we are 
falling behind and that organized crime is becoming an increasing 
threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do that in a non-partisan way.  I think we will find 
that all members of the Chamber are looking to the government to 
agree to making that a commitment, to making that a priority.  If 
the Liberals are headed for an election, perhaps this will be an 
election issue.  Let us do something now while we have an 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a life and death scenario.  I know we hear that all the 
time, whether it is health, whether it is environment or whether 
it is justice.  This is something that is affecting lives in this 
country as we speak.  We not only have a responsibility and a 
mandate to do something about it.  We have an absolutely 
undeniable obligation to Canadians to do something about it now, 
quickly, in a timely fashion to use the minister's words, and to 
do so in a clear and decisive way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member opposite for 
his excellent remarks.  I would like, though, to observe that he 
concentrated mostly on trying to bring improvements to policing 
and he directed his remarks fairly to the justice minister and 
the solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to observe that the problem with organized crime 
and the way to really get at it I would have thought, and he only 
alluded to it, would be to attack the profits of organized crime. 
I would like to draw to the attention of the member that for 
years now in the House I have been campaigning to get the 
government to write legislation that would make non-profit 
organizations and charities publicly accountable for the way they 
raise money and spend money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general has had representations from international 
police organizations complaining that Canada has become the 
centre in the world for laundering money, for laundering the 
profits of organized crime, not to mention the money that is 
raised on behalf of ethnic conflicts and terrorists abroad.  I 
would suggest to the hon. member: Would he not support pressuring 
the government to take positive steps toward making charities and 
non-profit organizations financially accountable, transparent? 
Does the member realize, for example, that non-profit 
organizations do not have to disclose anything?  Even their 
financial information returns to the government are not available 
to the public, much less to journalists and MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would also like to draw to the attention of the member 
opposite—and I take advantage of the fact that the justice 
minister and the solicitor general are in the House and of course 
are very interested in this debate—that just a few days ago I 
had a person in my constituency office who was engaged in 
import-export.  He told me he is aware that 16 shipping 
containers left Canada for Jamaica without inspection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite alluded to the difficulty the police 
authorities have to inspect shipments coming into Canada for 
contraband, but does he realize that there is almost no 
inspection of shipments going out of the country and that in fact 
Canada has become one of the grand opportunities for shipping 
anything one wants to anywhere in the world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go to Nigeria today we will see stolen vehicles still with 
the auto dealership on the their licence plates.  They do not 
even change the licence plates in Nigeria after a car is stolen 
in Canada and is shipped over to African countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member opposite would comment.  Are we not 
really in a situation where it is not a matter of limiting the 
right of association and it is not just a matter of increasing 
the police, which is of course the favourite answer for the 
Canadian Alliance?  Increasing the police is always the answer to 
everything.  Is it not really something we as parliamentarians 
should insist upon, that all organizations out there that are 
engaged in moving money around should be transparent and 
accountable to the public at large?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
across the way for his question and his commentary.  I know that 
this is an issue very near and dear to his heart.  I do agree 
that this is certainly not a simple issue.  There are many facets 
and many levels to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is correct to point out in the latter part of 
his discourse that there is a lot of export from this country.  I 
was very aware as a crown prosecutor of a number of auto thefts 
where great numbers of vehicles were being stolen and sent 
abroad, sent to Europe, very expensive vehicles that were getting 
on to the ports, getting on to ships and away they went. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This again highlights the need for international co-operation of 
which I know the hon. member is very aware.  The element of 
transparency and the element of cutting off the flow of money and 
the flow of resources to those who engage in this activity are 
what is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take very much to heart and am very encouraged by his own 
critique of the failings of his own government members in this 
regard.  They have every opportunity to do that.  This is the 
government's sole responsibility.  They have to be the 
legislative initiators in this instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example there is legislation in the United States, the RICO 
act which talks about racketeering, influence and corrupt 
organizations.  This type of legislation is exactly what is 
needed in this country.  I know this is something of which the 
minister is aware, has heard much and probably read much about. I 
am encouraged to see that both the solicitor general and the 
Minister of Justice are here ready to take part in this debate. 
We look forward to hearing from them about what initiatives we 
are going to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this international co-operation that we must 
have, surely we will not hear that it involves having a computer 
system that can be accessed the way the situation arose over the 
summer where there was a trap door left open and even our allies 
could get in to see the way that we were approaching organized 
crime.  I hope we will not hear that as the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information sharing is one thing but leaving the door open so 
that everyone knows what we are doing, including organized crime, 
including those who engage in that type of activity, is another. 
Because it is very sophisticated and very high tech they have the 
ability to find out what the government may be planning to do 
before it does it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope there will be safeguards in place to deal with the 
computer system that was extremely vulnerable and left us, I 
would suggest, with our pants down looking very embarrassed 
before our allies in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to hearing further from members opposite, from 
the government and from all other members of the House about this 
very serious and very compelling issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member can comment on this statement if he cares to. 
While the Liberals point out that the Alliance is looking for 
more policing, the Liberals are looking at spending millions and 
millions and perhaps even billions of dollars going after duck 
hunters, deer hunters and gopher shooters.  They are spending 
money like crazy.  That is what they have been spending.  That is 
their answer to fighting crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having travelled around with the police and seeing the 
difficulties they face throughout many of our cities, I agree 
with the hon. member when I saw so many young people wearing 
identifiable jackets indicating that they belonged to an 
organization.  I see this as being a problem that is affecting 
the most vulnerable of our society, and that is the children of 
this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see legislation coming out of some provinces that want to do 
something about it.  For example, in Alberta the police were 
authorized by legislation to take young teenage prostitutes off 
the streets, not arrest them, not charge them, but detain them to 
try to help them.  I am talking about taking 12 and 13 year olds 
off the street.  Some judge has declared that to be 
unconstitutional.  Along comes other legislation that allowed the 
police to stop identifiable gangs at roadside checks and along 
comes a judge who rules it unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the member sees the picture of what is going 
on.  What is wrong with giving our officers the authority to put 
a stop to a lot of the actions that are happening?  Their hands 
are tied constantly by silly legislation and the spending of 
money in areas that is not addressing the problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, while I take the comments 
of the hon. member for Wild Rose very much to heart and I know he 
has a great interest in this subject matter, I do not think we 
can simplify this issue by saying it is only the courts that are 
causing or exaggerating the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certainly occasions where we need a more streamlined 
system.  We need the ability to sometimes cut to the chase and 
get to the very heart of what is taking place when organized 
crime is active in a community and manipulating the system. There 
will always have to be checks and balances.  That is why I would 
be very reticent to jump quickly to the use of the legislative 
atomic bomb, the use of the notwithstanding clause.  However, it 
is there and it is written into our law for a purpose. It is 
there like the sword of Damocles.  It should be hanging over the 
courts, and sometimes lawyers and judges, to be used to remind 
Canadians that parliament is the supreme creator and supreme 
enactor of legislative initiatives.  This is where the House of 
Commons comes into play, as well as the Senate, in proving that 
we are the ones who make the laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree about the use of scarce resources at a time when 
officers are crying out for more overtime, more technical 
advances in terms of the use of computers and sharing of 
information.  We are continually pouring money into this 
cumbersome bureaucratic nightmare that we call the gun registry, 
knowing it will not impact on organized crime, knowing first and 
foremost that criminals will not participate and knowing that the 
police will not be able to rely on it as accurate.  Not only is 
it being set up and the infrastructure being put in place at a 
cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, it has now undertaken an 
aggressive advertising scheme to sell it to people who do not 
want it.  All this is a big ruse and sale of misinformation, 
pretending that this will make our streets more safe.  It simply 
will not work and will not change of course until the government 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as in health care, throwing money at the problem is not the 
only answer.  It is part of the answer to get the scarce 
resources into the hands that need them.  Legislative initiatives 
and co-operative efforts will help to turn the corner at least in 
addressing organized crime head-on in a forceful and effective 
way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the 
Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to join with others who have in the past 
days expressed deep concern with respect to the shooting in 
Montreal.  The case is under investigation by local police in 
Montreal and will follow due course.  I know that is what 
parliamentarians want to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the use of violence and intimidation by criminals 
has the potential to undermine the criminal justice system and 
other democratic institutions.  It is an issue that many 
countries around the world are wrestling with and is something 
that Canada will not tolerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a recent meeting in Iqaluit, the Minister of Justice and I 
and our provincial and territorial colleagues confirmed that 
combatting organized crime is a national priority.  Ministers 
recognize that the use of intimidation by organized crime is a 
serious and pressing concern for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the new commissioner of the RCMP indicated, nobody is immune 
to organized crime.  What he wanted to indicate quite clearly is 
that it is everybody's concern and we all must be cautious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime is the number one law enforcement priority of my 
ministry.  It is a national and international problem and it is 
growing in complexity.  More important, it is a social problem 
and a community issue in Canada and for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its effects are broad and serious across the country.  It 
affects our youth, our families, the economy and our quality of 
life in general.  This government has a solid record in dealing 
with organized crime from coast to coast.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there is no single easy answer to the problem.  It is 
not only a question of legislation or resources or co-ordination. 
In fact, it is all three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has made investments in law enforcement. 
In 1997 we established 13 integrated proceeds of crime units in 
the RCMP.  These units include provincial and local police.  This 
adds up to more than $180 million in new investments in proceeds 
of crime enforcement over the past number of years.  The IPOC has 
seized more than $140 million in criminal assets to date, taking 
the proceeds out of crime.  Of these seizures $70 million in 
forfeitures have been ordered by the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1999 we provided $115 million to modernize the Canadian 
Police Information Centre which supports police in all areas 
including the fight against organized crime.  In June 1999 we 
announced new funding of $15 million for the RCMP to provide for 
its presence in the three largest airports in the country; 
Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.  That way we can prevent 
organized criminals from seeking to enter Canada to do business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, in June 1999 we injected an additional $78 million over 
the next four years to the anti-smuggling initiative launched in 
1994 with resources for the RCMP, Justice Canada and Customs 
Canada to target cross-border crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last but not least, in this year's budget the RCMP received a 
substantial funding increase totalling $584 million over the next 
three years.  A portion of that of course will be used to fight 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has worked to give the police the tools they 
need to do the job of fighting organized crime.  New anti-gang 
legislation was put in place in 1997 and is being used now by 
police and prosecutors across the country to target gangs.  We 
know that many of the provisions that were introduced are being 
used widely and effectively.  We also know that some see certain 
elements as complex and we are consulting with police and 
prosecutors to monitor how the legislation is being used and 
whether and how it can be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put new anti-money laundering legislation in place this past 
June when Bill C-22 was passed.  It helped police target the 
profits of crime.  We have also worked with the public to develop 
community based strategies and responses to criminal gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there more to do to fight organized crime?  Yes, there is 
more to do.  Organized crime is a complex problem with many 
manifestations.  Violence and intimidation are two aspects.  They 
are two of the most troubling aspects, to be sure.  There are the 
effects of the illegal drug trade on our youth.  There is the 
fear and anxiety among the public and in our communities that can 
be created because of gang violence.  There are the effects on 
our economy and our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings are also a 
growing international concern and certainly have an effect on our 
country.  Telemarketing fraud artists victimize elderly persons. 
Credit card frauds are increasing dramatically according to the 
industry and police.  Organized crime is involved in 
interprovincial and international auto theft and our insurance 
premiums reflect this.  It is honest citizens who pay for the 
lifestyle of organized crime in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The diverse nature of the problem requires that we deal with 
this on a number of fronts.  We have done so.  This has been our 
strategy.  We will continue to do so by investing in legislation, 
in enforcement resources and by working with communities 
across the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are continuing to develop new initiatives now by 
collaborating with provincial governments, the police and 
communities across the country.  We are also working closely with 
the United States and our other international partners to 
co-ordinate law enforcement and to set shared standards in a 
global effort to combat organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize the need for governments in Canada to work 
together.  We are faced with a national problem and we need to 
deal with it in a co-ordinated way.  This is my top priority as 
solicitor general and I am personally committed to ensuring that 
what needs to be done will be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public is the biggest factor in the fight against 
organized crime.  The public knows that biker gangs and other 
organized criminals are not romantic figures or rebels.  Those 
who think otherwise are quite simply sadly mistaken.  Outlaw 
gangs and other organized criminals are a cancer to our society. 
They exploit the freedoms that we cherish so much in this great 
country.  They exploit our honest young people and the quality of 
life that honest hard-working Canadians work to achieve and 
maintain.  The public must recognize that gangs and organized 
criminals victimize us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must collectively and individually refuse to provide any 
support to criminal gangs.  Zero tolerance must be our policy. 
This means refusing to buy contraband goods.  It means working 
with local police when problems arise in our communities.  It 
means not allowing gangs a place in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice and I met with our provincial and 
territorial counterparts in Iqaluit.  They believe as we do that 
it has to be a co-ordinated effort on all fronts, with the RCMP, 
provincial police departments and municipal police departments. 
They certainly appreciate some of the moves that we have made 
such as the DNA databank which is so important in helping to put 
criminals where they should be, and that is behind bars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the Minister of Justice, has issued a white paper 
on the judgment of the supreme court in Campbell and Shirose.  We 
are waiting for submissions from our colleagues from across the 
way and across the country to make sure that we give the RCMP and 
other police forces across the country the tools to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remain firmly committed to doing all I can, working with 
provincial governments and Canadians to deal with the serious 
organized crime problem we face in Quebec and across the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will make this very quick and very short.  I have two 
questions.  They are not difficult to answer and I am going to 
listen carefully to the answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general stated a solid record in dealing with 
organized crime.  Regarding the anti-gang legislation enacted in 
1997, over three years ago, I ask the solicitor general how many 
convictions have taken place under that legislation?  If the 
answer is more than zero, I want to have the information 
regarding those convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, could he explain to me the heading in the press release 
from the police which states “Police Plead for Tougher Measures 
to Fight Organized Crime: Less Talk, More Action, Says Canadian 
Police Association”.  We have not had any at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he explain his comments at his press conference and tell 
me how many convictions have there been? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not have the 
number of convictions, but the law in place is certainly a 
detriment to the organized criminal and to people who belong to 
gangs.  They are well aware that if they break the law and they 
are associated with a gang they can receive consecutive 
sentences.  They do not even have to be associated with a crime 
that takes place down the road. 
That is important as a deterrent to gangs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question my hon. colleague asked concerned what tools 
we have given the police.  There is something very important 
taking place right now and that is the white paper my hon. 
colleague has put out.  I wonder if my hon. colleague for Wild 
Rose, who seems to be very concerned, has made any submissions or 
any suggestions as to how things should be done on a very public 
front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice and I and our counterparts across the 
country want to take action.  We want a co-ordinated approach. 
Grandstanding in the House of Commons does not help anybody who 
is suffering from the effects of organized crime.  We need to 
make sure that we do not just put on a big show.  We must put the 
laws in place that are needed to fight organized crime, and that 
is what we will do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, that was a wonderful response from the solicitor 
general, but I cannot reconcile from those remarks and from his 
previous remarks that if the government has done so much and 
brought in so much legislation and given the police so much by 
assisting them why organized crime is still escalating.  Why is 
it still getting worse, which he has acknowledged in his own 
remarks?  That does not jibe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus my question on a very specific aspect of his 
responsibilities as solicitor general.  We know that there have 
been a number of serious instances within the present confines. 
In 1997 prison guards Diane Lavigne and Pierre Rondeau were 
gunned down in separate attacks and ambushes attributed to the 
Hell's Angels.  Last week, after the August shooting, a Quebec 
prison guard was shot while driving to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear from the solicitor general.  What is he 
doing specifically to protect his guards?  I hearken back to the 
issue of the 50:50 release program.  What is he doing to help his 
own prison guards? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  The government is not 
taking $83 million away from the RCMP as was proposed by the hon. 
member's party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the government had to adjust the financial mess that was 
left by the Conservative government.  There were no resources for 
anybody.  That is why, after very careful progress by the 
government, we are now able to supply the RCMP and other law 
enforcement agencies with the tools they need to do their job. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know that all members share 
a concern about the serious problem of organized crime.  It is a 
problem that affects all provinces and communities in Canada, be 
they urban or rural. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Events in Quebec and in other provinces in recent years have 
shown us that organized crime has many faces.  It involves drug 
trafficking, prostitution, gun running, money laundering and 
migrant smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High profile crimes, trials and investigations in Quebec, 
Manitoba, Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and other provinces 
have engaged the attention and concern of all Canadians.  The 
recent events in Quebec, in particular those involving the murder 
attempt on a respected and courageous Montreal journalist, have 
brought the problem of organized crime front and centre in the 
national consciousness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wake of these disturbing events my colleague, the 
solicitor general, and I have affirmed that the criminal 
legislation of Canada will be re-examined to see if the tools 
available to police and to prosecutors are being used to their 
fullest effect and whether they can be improved. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1920"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We and our officials at all levels will be working with the 
authorities at the provincial and local levels, especially the 
police who are in the frontlines of this battle, to ensure that 
adequate and focused resources are available and are applied in a 
co-ordinated way. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  As I mentioned earlier today, we will be 
working with our provincial and territorial counterparts to make 
sure that, if we need new laws, we will get them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we talk about new tools or resources I would like to 
focus on some of the actions that have been taken in the last few 
years to address the challenges of organized crime.  For example, 
the anti-smuggling initiative targeting in particular the 
smuggling of drugs, guns and other contraband by organized crime 
gangs was introduced in 1994 and I am pleased to say was most 
recently refunded in June 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Witness Protection Program Act came into force in 1996.  We 
should ensure and we must ensure that this program is being 
applied effectively and is adequately resourced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Controlled Drug and Substances Act was enacted in 1997. 
Together with the police enforcement regulations adopted under 
the act it provides for exemptions for police officers involved 
in important undercover work in drug cases and for the ability to 
seize property that is used to commit those crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 was enacted earlier this year and introduced new tools 
to improve the detection, prevention and deterrence of money 
laundering in Canada, which is key to attacking the complex web 
of organized crime.  As we all know money is the lifeblood of 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, in regard to the threat posed by biker gangs and 
other criminal organizations we put in place measures in Bill 
C-95.  The cornerstone of Bill C-95 was a new offence that made 
participation in the illegal activities of a criminal 
organization an indictable offence punishable by up to 14 years 
in prison to be served consecutively.  This provision establishes 
an offence covering anyone who participates in or substantially 
contributes to the activities of a criminal organization and who 
is a party to the commission of an indictable offence for the 
benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with that 
criminal organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been proposed, however, that it should be enough to prove 
that someone is a member of an identified criminal organization 
without being able to or being required to prove that he or she 
has been guilty of any criminal activity.  If necessary, it has 
been suggested that we invoke the notwithstanding clause to 
support such a proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an approach has the advantage of simplicity, but while I am 
prepared to entertain all proposals to strengthen our existing 
laws and while I do not outright reject any suggestions, a simple 
membership offence will have to be carefully and rigorously 
scrutinized from all perspectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that action against organized crime continues to be 
a top national priority and that progress has been made on the 
agenda established in 1999 for this effort.  This national effort 
will employ existing legislative, regulatory and administrative 
tools as well as new and innovative approaches to do the 
following:  first, to target criminal assets and proceeds; 
second, to enhance the investigation of organized crime by such 
means as a better sharing of information; third, to enhance the 
prosecution of organized crime; and fourth, to safeguard the 
integrity of the criminal justice system from threats by 
organized crime in particular by preventing the intimidation of 
police, prosecutors, judges, jurors, witnesses and other persons 
who play a critical role in our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example of a new and innovative approach is the concept of 
civil forfeiture.  This technique attacks the assets and proceeds 
of organized crime in a way that is different from traditional 
criminal law.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach is being considered at the provincial level and by 
officials within the Department of Justice.  The constitutional 
division of powers in Canada poses challenges to this particular 
approach, but there is a strong will among all governments in 
Canada to work together to find new ways of dealing with 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senior officials from my department and of my colleague, the 
solicitor general, will be meeting tomorrow morning with their 
counterparts in Quebec.  They are examining together the 
investigative, evidentiary and other problems being experienced 
in that province with regard to using the existing legislative 
provisions that target organized crime.  No doubt there will be 
meetings at all levels with other provincial officials. Organized 
crime is a pervasive problem that exists throughout Canada, and 
so we need to work in concert with all our provincial and 
territorial colleagues to find the solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that improved legislative tools are possible and that 
their use must be made as effective as possible.  Co-ordinated, 
effective and adequately resourced enforcement efforts by police 
and prosecutorial authorities at all levels in Canada will be the 
key to the effective use of new legislative tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice committee is already examining the problem of 
organized crime through a subcommittee that began its work 
recently.  The issue of intimidation in the criminal justice 
system is one issue that I know the committee will no doubt be 
examining closely along with the many other facets of the problem 
of organized crime.  I encourage the committee to move forward 
with its work quickly.  It is important work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem posed by organized crime is serious.  We must be 
willing to review our laws to see if we can improve them to make 
them more effective.  We need also to look at the efforts we must 
make to aggressively investigate and prosecute those involved in 
criminal activity of this kind, but we must also think very 
carefully before we concede that we cannot in a free and 
democratic society fight organized crime with effective tools 
that also respect civil liberties and fundamental justice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the government talk about the 
legislation it has brought in.  I have the same concern as my 
colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough that while 
legislation has been brought in to fix the system, we still have 
a system that is worse than it was before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the section of the criminal code which was brought in 
in 1997.  It is the aspect about participation in criminal 
organization, which I believe is actually reasonably well 
written.  I studied whether or not people have been convicted 
under this aspect of the criminal code.  I understand one person 
has been since 1997.  I also understand that a number of cases 
have been plea bargained.  The plea bargaining that took place 
eliminated that aspect of the law which in effect gives 
consecutive or additional sentencing to anything that happens.  I 
agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the problem in my mind is not just necessarily that 
there is no law.  The problem is the legal industry and the 
courtroom.  Many a victim in the country will say that therein 
lies the difficulties they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it possible to have a comment from the justice minister on 
whether or not she thinks it would be possible to get around the 
plea bargaining aspect and where an individual is proven to be a 
member of organized crime a penalty between two and fourteen 
years exists and is not plea bargainable within the court? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  It is an important one. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1930"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has stated that if one looks at the existing 
organized crime provisions in fact in 1997 amendments to the 
provisions introduced much tougher sentences.  In fact we have 
the prospect of imposing up to 14 years in the form of 
consecutive sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot comment upon provincial prosecutorial decisions in 
relation to plea bargaining.  There is a former prosecutor here 
this evening in the form of the justice critic for the 
Progressive Conservative Party.  He probably would be much better 
placed to talk about what goes into a decision being made by a 
provincial prosecutor and the provincial attorney general in 
terms of pleading out or agreeing to a plea bargain in a given 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to do is acknowledge the fact, as the hon. member 
has, that the sections are there.  We need to think about why 
plea bargaining takes place in the justice system.  We all know 
why, but it is frustrating for all of us on occasion to see that 
these sections are not tested, that the consecutive sentencing 
provisions are not used or the courts are not given the 
opportunity to use them because a plea bargain arrangement has 
been entered into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has raised a serious matter.  It is one which I 
think I should take up with my provincial and territorial 
colleagues because they are responsible for the prosecution of 
these sections.  We are not.  Provincial attorneys general guard 
that jurisdiction jealously, as the hon. member knows.  Therefore 
I will take the hon. member's legitimate and sincere concern and 
find out from some of my provincial colleagues why they made the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will try to be brief, although this is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I missed the beginning of the minister's speech because I was 
doing telephone interviews on the radio on this very issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are very concerned.  They do not understand why we will 
not be voting this evening on something to give some teeth to 
effective legislation on crime and criminal groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995, we have tried to amend all sorts of laws to provide 
the police with tools, including the criminal code, the Food and 
Drugs Act, the Narcotic Control Act and the Parole Act.  The 
minister can make a fine speech, but it does not work. Something 
else is needed.  We have to try other things to put a stop to a 
very complex situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is quite simple: Is the minister prepared to 
seriously consider the use, if necessary, of the notwithstanding 
clause to really give teeth to anti-gang legislation? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier today, 
and I will reiterate, the solicitor general and I will be sending 
our officials to Quebec tomorrow to meet with their counterparts. 
They will meet with other provincial counterparts.  You may 
shake your head, but let me say that officials in Quebec have 
done some very good work in relation to how we can amend the 
provisions in the criminal code without using the notwithstanding 
clause to make them more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike you, I would actually like to know about that work.  I 
would like that work shared with provincial and territorial 
colleagues to see if we are able to put in place— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would remind you, hon. colleagues, to 
include me, rather than speaking to each other.  I am feeling a 
little lonely up here.  I know you are just coming back after the 
summer.  The time for questions and comments is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford begins his 
debate, I would ask if he is going to take 20 minutes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will be taking 20 minutes and you know I will 
address my comments through you.  I would not be like the justice 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to talk about this issue tonight.  It is 
interesting the comments we get from the government side. 
Let me quote the justice minister today and the solicitor general 
tonight.  The justice minister said that organized crime is the 
number one priority of the government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1935"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT104"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT104"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1935
<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that it is the number one priority today, when we 
heard very little about it last week, last year and on and on. 
Why is it that with this government it seems that the number one 
priority begins when something moves it to move in that 
direction?  It is really sad indeed that all of a sudden we are 
here in the House in a special debate when something that set it 
off was a reporter who was shot in the back five times in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the government that there have been things going on for 
years in this country that have been involved with organized 
crime.  I remind the government that last year alone 400 people 
died in two cities, Vancouver and Toronto, from drug overdoses. 
Those drugs came from organized crime up at the top. The year 
before that there was well over 300 in Vancouver alone, and there 
is the year before that and the year before that.  So why is it 
we are here today, the first day of the sitting of the House of 
Commons, in an emergency debate, when this has been an emergency 
for years?  Yes, the government has developed laws, but they have not 
worked.  That is the main message we are trying to get across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government is saying it will examine it and that it 
is studying it, but the time for study has past.  This has 
been a problem for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the responsibility for this has to lay at the feet of 
the government because whatever action is going to come out of 
this exercise could have and should have been done some time ago 
in my opinion.  The comments from the solicitor general tonight 
were “We will not tolerate this”.  “This is my highest 
priority,” he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been telling the solicitor general for years there is a 
serious problem in the prisons.  There is a serious problem with 
parole.  But on Monday, September 18, 2000, the highest priority 
is organized crime because something happened to move the 
government in that direction.  That is not the way to run a 
country or a government, in a reactionary mode. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much talk about the Hell's Angels and the Rock Machine 
in Quebec.  I remind the government and others listening that one 
only has to live around the triads in British Columbia to know 
how deadly a group those people are, how ruthless they are.  We 
only have to go to Manitoba to understand what the Warriors are 
like.  There is the Satan's Choice in Ontario, the Para-Dice 
Riders, the Vietnamese gangs, the Big Circle Boys and on and on 
they go.  It is not about two groups.  It would be a mistake to 
identify two groups in particular in the criminal code because 
that excludes a lot more than it includes. That is important to 
remember. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know why two or three years ago the government 
eliminated the ports police.  We were told at the time it was a 
cost cutting measure.  I spent a good deal of time with the ports 
police.  I know the role they played on both coasts, in Halifax 
harbour port in particular and in Vancouver. 
It is interesting.  Almost immediately after the ports police 
left Vancouver, one of the organized crime groups immediately 
moved into the Vancouver port and set up operations.

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does organized crime benefit?  How does it expand?  It 
expands by eliminating organizations like the ports police, or 
cost cutting in the RCMP. I wish I could have a debate here with 
the solicitor general on what the government did with the RCMP 
budget.  It was only a year or two ago in the House when we were 
practically begging the government to give the RCMP money. In 
fact, after all that duress the solicitor general was under, he 
finally gave in and gave it money, which he is bragging about 
here tonight. That is reactionary mode.  It is not good for the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some examples of what organized crime really is.  I want 
to read them into the record for the House.  People across the 
country will understand just how serious organized crime is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Big Circle Boys is another group.  Triad member Wing Fu Ha 
was arrested in Vancouver for the murder of an infant in what 
police suspect was a gang rivalry incident.  Wing remained in 
Vancouver despite an earlier deportation order against him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will have some recommendations a little later on what to do, 
but I can tell the House I have dealt with this personally as 
well.  One of the problems with organized crime is the lack of 
strength and conviction of the Liberal government to deport 
people who break our laws.  That is a fact.  I just read of one 
of them here, a triad member.  He should have been out a long 
time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to the unanimous advice of law enforcement, the ports 
police were disbanded and immediately thereafter an organized 
crime linked company was granted docking container facilities in 
the port of Vancouver.  The amount and quality of heroin now 
available in Vancouver is such that in August of 2000, heroin 
addicts, that is, those who have not died, marched to protest 
government inaction.  Heroin addicts are saying there is too much 
heroin on the streets.  That is a fact.  I have been there. I 
have seen it.  I have talked to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1999, more than a year ago, Vancouver police cracked a 
heroin importation ring run by Simon Kwok, whom they identify as 
a member of the 14K triad group, responsible for drug 
importation, prostitution, credit card fraud, home invasion, and 
extortion of members of Vancouver's large Chinese community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what an individual like that does.  That is organized 
crime.  That is reality.  That hits the streets of my community 
every day, and everyone else's community, including Halifax, 
right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know about the ongoing violent warfare between the Rock 
Machine and the Hell's Angels in Quebec resulting in shootings, 
bombings and more deaths, but here is what is not said about 
that.  A fellow, Michel Auger, a decent individual, a 
professional in his own rank, gets five bullets in the back. I 
read that a couple of days ago in Halifax a fellow was shot 
twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shootings like that are an everyday occurrence in the country 
now.  What happened to the government's gun legislation?  The 
major comment we had in the House of Commons when that 
legislation came in was that it would help to curb crime, but 
that is not the case.  It has become a revenue generator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Rubbish. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1945"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the Liberals is 
saying “rubbish”.   The fact is that Bill C-68, which brought 
in the gun law, did not help Michel Auger did it?  It did not 
help five people in one night in my riding two years ago.  Who is 
it helping? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, 80% of deaths are from 
hunting rifles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  They do not like to hear this across on 
the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violent episodes of shootings and bombings between Vietnamese 
and various triad gangs occur on an ongoing basis in Vancouver, 
Edmonton and Toronto.  The 1998 solicitor general's report 
confirmed that organized crime was responsible for the illegal 
entry into Canada of approximately 16,000 people annually; money 
laundering in excess of $10 billion a year, which costs 
Canadians in excess of $10 billion a year; attempts to influence 
or corrupt public officials which is expected to occur in Canada 
and in fact even commented on by the new commissioner of the 
RCMP; and the illegal entry into Canada of persons claiming 
refugee status who subsequently become involved in organized 
crime activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Toronto police busted a prostitution ring run by the Big 
Circle Boys triad involving young Chinese and Asian women brought 
illegally into the country and forced into prostitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I gave those examples is to ask a question of the 
other side.  The Liberals said that they brought in this law and 
that law, but what have those laws done to stop this?  This is 
occurring every single day in our country and all we have heard 
thus far from the solicitor general and the justice minister is 
“We will not tolerate it.  It is our highest priority.  We will 
re-examine it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard that improved legislative tools are necessary.  We 
may agree with that but thus far we have seen an escalation of 
organized crime in just about every area that it can get into. 
What has legislation really done in the past? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay:</B>  Why does the member not bring up 
the drug busts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  The solicitor general wants me to bring 
up the drug busts.  If I brought up the drug busts I could assure 
him they are minor compared to the amounts of drugs that are sold 
to our children.  They are very minor indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Vancouver, the <I>Province</I> newspaper has confirmed that 
the RCMP has listed Stanley Ho as the lead member of the triad 
organized crime group since 1991.  Despite this, Ho has received 
multiple visitor visas, has extensive holdings in Canada, is a 
donor, personally and corporately, to the Liberal Party, and has 
actually hosted a cocktail reception for the Prime Minister 
during the Vancouver APEC conference.  That information was in 
the paper and I trust it to be accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in no way suggesting that there is an attachment. What I am 
suggesting is that known organized crime agents are entering and 
leaving this country on a regular basis. The government knows 
that and I know the immigration department knows that.  The only 
thing that happens is that the criminals get caught in a legal 
wrangle, in appeal after appeal, if they even are asked to be 
deported. It is not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No legislation has been mentioned by the immigration minister. 
The justice minister and the solicitor general are here.  The 
immigration minister should also be standing up in the House to 
say that we have some problems and that we need some legislation 
but that has not been done. 
The finance minister or the revenue minister should be standing 
up in the House saying “Under the Income Tax Act we should make 
it easier to seize assets and sell them”.  It is just not two 
people in this.  The whole government has to sit down and look at 
this situation.  It is not sending two, three or four people to 
Quebec.  It is a lot bigger than that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize what the provincial and territorial justice 
ministers are saying, but that is not the point.  The point is 
that I do not think the government is co-ordinated in its effort. 
It is futile in my mind to take a section out of the criminal 
code, section 467.1, and make an adjustment to it in the hope 
that this will all go away.  It is a lot bigger than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Use the notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  If the member had been listening, I did 
not say use the notwithstanding clause.  One of the government's 
problems is that it does not listen too well.  That is why it is 
in the fix it is in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are quotes from an RCMP report detailing triad and Russian 
Mafia control of bringing young women from eastern Europe into 
Canada for prostitution and exotic dancing using illegal entry, 
visitor visas and refugee claims.  I again get back to the 
comment that this is just not a justice-solicitor general issue. 
Many of these issues come back to immigration into Canada, open 
borders and the refusal to refuse people coming in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a statement and pose a question at the same time. 
I heard the justice minister's answer a while ago when I asked 
the question about plea bargaining.  While I am not a lawyer and 
do not want to be, I can understand and appreciate that there are 
differences between federal and provincial legal systems, whereas 
the administration of the courts are within provincial 
jurisdiction.  However, there has to be some way the federal 
government can influence the courts in a province to prevent such 
plea bargaining from taking place.  The difficulty with plea 
bargaining in many cases is that the only person who gets hurt is 
the victim.  That is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that if we have laws that are going to be worth 
anything, to allow the legal industry in a courtroom to take away 
what just might be the answer, a consecutive sentence for being a 
member of organized crime, is a shame.  I think the concentration 
for the solicitor general and for the justice minister should be 
in that area; apply the laws.  That is all Canadians are asking 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a number of recommendations, and I suppose I have covered 
most of them, but I will give a couple more.  We have to create a 
mandatory minimum five year jail term for smuggling or criminally 
exploiting illegal immigrants into Canada.  We have to prohibit 
conditional release of any kind for an offender ordered deported. 
We have to amend the Immigration Act to require the deportation 
of a person found to be a member of an organized criminal group, 
among many other things that I have mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing the justice minister and the solicitor 
general take away tonight, I hope it is that we in Canada are 
looking for action and not more studies.  Once a law is a law it 
must be applied in our courts for a change.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the member who 
just spoke.  He is an excellent parliamentarian.  I would like to 
ask him a question that I wanted to ask either the solicitor 
general or the justice minister but I could not because of time 
constraints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is both at the same time the easiest and the 
hardest in this debate.  The question is quite simple.  The 
solicitor general is the chief policeman of the country. 
Canada's tradition is that our police are responsible for 
upholding the law.  That is the fundamental charge that we give 
our police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the ultimate law in Canada is the charter of rights and 
freedoms.  Does it not therefore follow that whatever we do and 
whatever steps we take that the justice minister, the solicitor 
general and this parliament must protect the principles of the 
charter of rights and freedoms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the difficulty we have with 
the charter is the many rulings within it in the courtrooms. We 
only have to look at child pornography to see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason it is necessary to have a notwithstanding clause in 
there is because what has been put into the generalized charter 
of rights and freedoms has been misinterpreted by the judiciary. 
Most court cases today are brought on by lawyers on behalf of 
clients who want to interpret this and are moving in that 
direction.  The notwithstanding clause is an absolute necessity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the charter of rights and freedoms is concerned, I do 
not have a problem with it other than the misinterpretation by 
the judiciary, which is where the major flaw has existed over the 
last 12 years.  It has become a fad in the courtroom to go after 
it and amend it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try to make my question as 
brief as possible, although I have some background information I 
would like to read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the House will recall that back in 1995 we passed a 
bill known as Bill C-68 which required the registration of all 
firearms in Canada.  What Bill C-68 essentially does is it lays a 
piece of paper beside every gun in the country.  That law is not 
yet fully implemented.  Less than 25% of the firearms in Canada 
have registration certificates beside them.  In fact, that 
percentage could even be below 10% if we could get the 
information from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1995 a man by the name of Bob Runciman, the Ontario 
solicitor general, made a statement before the committee.  I will 
read it to the House because I think it is very indicative of the 
missed priorities of the government.  Mr. Runciman said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is that the sections of Bill C-68 that provide for 
compulsory registration of all firearms will divert police 
resources from more important tasks.  Those sections (of Bill 
C-68) will reduce the number of officers and the amount of money 
available to deal with serious crime.  They will make the real 
task of gun control more difficult and more dangerous for the 
police officers who undertake it.  And those provisions will 
ultimately have no significant impact on violent crime, or the use 
of firearms by violent criminals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then went on to say that if we were to spend $500 million on 
this registry we could put 5,900 more police on the street. Those 
5,900 extra police on the street would make a significant impact 
on that.  What is happening today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know where my colleague 
is coming from and he makes a very good point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we are missing here already, and which has not 
come up in the discussion about organized crime, is that when a 
murder takes place in Canada it is usually done with a gun.

head of the Waterloo Regional Police Force with 700 police 
officers and knowing where the chiefs of police stand and where 
the rank and file for the most part stand, Mr. Runciman was wrong 
in 1995 and he is wrong now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have heard from the party opposite is nothing more than 
fearmongering and scare tactics.  We saw Mr. Day in the House 
today.  Imagine, there were spouts of water flowing and other 
things.  He wants to bring a new tone of civility into the House. 
What we see from the member opposite is nothing but.  What we see 
is the kind of code words for anti-immigration and code words 
that bring the race card into play.  We saw that happening.  Look 
at the last names of the people mentioned in the transcripts.  Is 
the new tone of civility where the Alliance Party is really 
going? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the members opposite, because they are always caterwauling 
away about gun control, to name me one victims group in Canada 
that supports their position when it comes to gun control.  The 
reason I ask the question is that they repeatedly go out of their 
way to say they are on the side of victims and they are on the 
side of victims' rights.  What I want to hear from them is the 
name of one group of victims that supports their position.  I 
know the answer to that.  There is not one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the 
hon. member said that.  I was the original writer of the national 
victims' bill of rights.  It is a sad commentary coming from the 
other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the problem when we try to debate issues like this. 
Accusations come across on a racial ground.  I certainly did not 
indicate anything like that.  It is sad when we try to get our 
points across to the solicitor general and the justice minister, 
who are obviously listening because I saw them writing notes, 
that some backbencher would stand up and tell us that we have an 
ulterior motive.  I have no ulterior motive here. The fact is 
that when these members on the other side do not have a 
legitimate argument within debate, we get these kinds of— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I ask hon. members to listen 
to one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  I am glad to 
continue with the civility in the House of Commons rather than 
listening to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that in all honesty I stood up here tonight to try 
to provide what I thought were at least motivating suggestions to 
the two people of the four or five who are responsible for this. 
That is what is necessary.  I am sad that it deteriorated into 
something less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bottom line and the message is that we have been waiting for 
change for years.  Drug addiction in this country and the tens of 
thousands of young people on drugs did not just happen.  It has 
been happening for years.  It is not time to start studying this. 
It is not time for the government to say that it is its number 
one priority today.  That was 10 years ago.  Now it is time to 
take some concrete action.  I sincerely hope that within this 
Chamber tonight the government listens to the suggestions we are 
making, rather than accepts our comments as some kind of terrible 
criticism that nobody should make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our job is to give suggestions in a concrete way and that is 
what we will do whether the Liberals like it or not.

the attack on reporter Michel Auger a few days ago was the straw 
that broke the camel's back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many reasons why Quebecers have had enough of the rule 
of terror that criminal organizations, biker gangs and other 
groups impose upon our society, in Quebec as well as in Canada. I 
am talking more specifically about the situation in Quebec since 
it affects us directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reading a report that was released yesterday by the 
federal Department of Justice. I assume our colleagues opposite 
would be interested in such a report. The report tells us that 
witnesses, jurors and lawyers have been threatened by these 
groups. I will add that parliamentarians have also been 
threatened by these groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been 150 victims in Quebec over the last five years, 
30 of whom were innocent victims, men, women and children who had 
the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, who 
just happened to be nearby when a bomb went off. Thirty innocent 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recently appointed RCMP commissioner, Mr. Zaccardelli, 
expressed some fears with regard to the corruption of 
politicians. This is not coming from me, but from the head of 
the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of such organizations has increased since 1995. Even 
after passage of Bill C-95 in 1997, we saw the number of biker 
gangs in Canada increase from 28 to 35. Is this not evidence that 
we do not have the necessary tools to address the problem? What 
should we do to deal with this situation? Remain passive? Talk? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think our duty as parliamentarians—because we do have duties 
to fulfill—is to stand up and respond to the call of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have said we are doing this to score political points. This 
is certainly not true in the case of the Bloc Quebecois. We have 
been raising this issue in the House for years, since 1993. 
Obviously we have made some gains: it is thanks to the Bloc 
Quebecois that $1,000 bills have been taken out of circulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you and I have never had pockets full of $1,000 
bills, but those people count their money by weighing hockey bags 
on a scale.  Thousand dollar bills take up less room.  That is 
exactly what has happened, and the hon. member across the way 
ought to realize that there is nothing funny about it.  He may 
think it funny, but the victims did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, we do not have any vote-seeking motives.  We are, moreover, 
not the only ones calling for this; the Bloc Quebecois motion is 
supported by the government of Quebec, Quebec Liberal Party 
leader Jean Charest, as well as the government of Ontario, the 
Sûreté du Québec, the Canadian Police Association, the Quebec 
Press Council—not a repressive body—the Fédération 
professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, the Montreal Urban 
Community Police Department, and the NDP governments of 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba. These are not all nasty sovereignists 
who are seeking to take advantage of a situation in order to gain 
votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious problem, and perhaps it is high time there was 
some realization of this over on the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does our motion say?  We will be coming back to it.  Today 
will not see an end to it.  This late night debate is not going 
to do away with it when there is no provision for a vote.  We 
are not afraid to vote, we are not afraid to stand up, we are not 
afraid to say what we think.  We will never be afraid, and we 
will be back with it.  There will be other opportunities, and it 
will be moved again here, in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the support of all of the opposition parties, I would 
remind hon. members, the motion refers to “making it a crime to 
belong to a criminal organization, if necessary—I emphasize that 
it is “if necessary”—invoking the notwithstanding clause of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That created quite a stir among the Liberals. This reminds me of 
a headline that I recently saw in an Ontario newspaper. I could 
not believe it. The constitutional rights of the Hell's Angels 
were violated by the Ontario police because these people have 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can just imagine the Prime Minister delivering a speech at the 
UN to tell them about the best country in the world and saying 
“In our country our democracy is so developed that even the 
Hell's Angels have constitutional rights, and so do the Rock 
Machines and the Outlaws”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not nice that, in Canada, these groups have constitutional 
rights? Our democracy is so advanced that these people have 
constitutional rights. But the government does not even want to 
think about using something legal. The notwithstanding clause is 
in the charter, but the government will not use it against 
criminal groups. That would lower the level of democracy in 
Canada, since the Hell's Angels are entitled to their 
constitutional rights, just like the Rock Machines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Go tell the mother of young Daniel Desrochers that you are 
not even considering using that clause because of the 
constitutional rights of the Hell's Angels. This is unbelievable. 
It is ridiculous, but the result is also dreadful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' attitude is deplorable. 
First of all, the Prime Minister, worse than ever—and this is 
saying something—says “They want me to meddle in provincial 
jurisdictions by intervening on the criminal code”.  But, good 
God, for someone who was the Minister of Justice and has been 
here for over 35 years and is the Prime Minister, not to know 
that the criminal code is under federal jurisdiction—I will 
believe anything, but not that.  Unless he does not know this. It 
is true he did not know that he does not pay employment 
insurance.  But he knows about the criminal code.  Meddling in 
the affairs of the provinces is his greatest joy.  For once this 
is his jurisdiction and he does not intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequently, the Liberals refused to debate the motion now 
before us because it was a votable item. In other words, it is 
fine to talk, debate, discourse but certainly not to take a 
stand, because the constitutional rights of the Hell's Angels are 
too important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, these people solidly support the young offenders.  When 
it comes to imprisoning children of 10 or 12 years of age, they 
are brave.  Come on kids, we are going to put you in the corner. 
Instead of a spanking, it is off to prison you go. However, on 
the subject of the Hell's Angels, the Rock Machine and so on, 
they are fearful, silent, they hide, they say “We must not touch 
the constitutional rights of the Hell's Angels and the Rock 
Machine.  Never mind what they do, they have rights.  That would 
be lowering the level of democracy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that a responsible attitude?  Is that the way a responsible 
parliamentarian should behave?  In the case of young offenders, 
Quebec asked that the legislation be left as it was because it 
was working.  The results prove it.  The government is doing the 
opposite.  Our request this time is based on our expertise.  If 
there is more pressure in Quebec—and the federal report says 
there is—it is because the police are taking tougher action 
against these groups.  It is not just a coincidence.  The 
Liberals are reacting because they know that we do not have all 
the resources we need, while they are sitting pretty.  In this 
case, they are imposing it on Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the motion say?  Does it say that the notwithstanding 
clause must be used?  Absolutely not. We are asking the 
government to consider acting on our proposal to make membership 
in such groups a criminal offence and, if legislation is not a 
possibility, to consider the notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notwithstanding clause is part of the charter.  It was not 
Quebec that imposed the notwithstanding clause.  We signed 
nothing.  It was the provinces of English Canada which would not 
have agreed to the charter without the notwithstanding clause. 
Now that it is available, they do not want to use it.  The 
constitutional rights of the Hell's Angels are more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot accept this state of affairs.  What am I going to tell 
the young men and women in my riding who are prostituting 
themselves because they are drug addicts, the victims of these 
groups? I am going to tell them that the Minister of Justice 
loves and understands them, but that she does not wish to use the 
notwithstanding clause.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the members opposite, the constitutional rights of 
the Hell's Angels are more important than the fate of these 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What am I going to tell restaurant owners in my riding who are 
paying protection money? What am I going to tell all the 
innocent victims? The Hell's Angels have constitutional rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is shaking her head. Well, for God's sake, if what 
I just said is not right, can you tell me what is? I am right. 
Because they refuse to consider the notwithstanding clause, they 
oppose our motion. It is sheer hypocrisy and nothing else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should we say to the families of the victims? “Our prayers 
are with you, Mrs. Desrochers. 
We may go sing a song for you, free of charge”. But there is no 
way we can infringe upon the constitutional rights of the Hell's 
Angels. They are too important. This is the standard by which 
our democracy will be judged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy is such a beautiful thing when the constitutional 
rights of these gangs supersede the fate of our young people who 
represent our future. The constitutional rights of the Hell's 
Angels, what more can we say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much more to be done, of course. We now have a 
subcommittee. After two years of hard work by the Bloc a 
subcommittee on organized crime was set up. Yet there are many other 
aspects to consider. I can think of international ramifications, 
money laundering, and interference in legal businesses, because 
these criminals create legal businesses with their dirty money. 
It is hard to believe what they have achieved, on which boards of 
directors they sit, which business circles and which political 
circles they have penetrated. That takes time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, in the meantime, what are we telling future victims? 
Some future victims are listening to us tonight. Some 
young people will use drugs tonight. Not a word. We do not think 
about that. Because, you see, the constitutional rights of Hell's 
Angels are at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to use a tool that we have at our disposal. We 
are refusing to use it. Is Canadian democracy not wonderful? We 
are going to deprive ourselves of this tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective is not to use this clause. We are not saying that 
this clause will necessarily be used. We are saying that it will 
be used if necessary. If there is no other way, what should we 
do? Should we just give in or should we tell people that there is 
no other way? Should we tell them that we have thought about it 
long and hard, but that we would have had to use the 
notwithstanding clause and that is against our principles? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some countries have done it. I am thinking of France in 
particular. France is not a dictatorship. It has a law against 
criminal gangs with penalties of up to ten years imprisonment, if 
I am not mistaken. Have any of the labour unions disappeared 
since then? Are there not protest groups on every issue in 
France? Were those who blocked the roads arrested because it 
could be criminal? Come on, it is ridiculous. We know full well 
who this law is for. 
Because such groups have rights, is their existence a measure of 
our democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the questions we must ask because our democracy is 
being attacked on all fronts, including on the political front. 
Threats have been made to some members of parliament.  The RCMP 
commissioner tells us that attempts have been made to corrupt 
some people and perhaps there is some corruption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power of the judiciary is being attacked through threats 
made against witnesses, lawyers and jurors.  Threatened is the 
word the report uses.  The attack on Michel Auger was an attack 
on the freedom of the press.  There has also been an attack on 
Jean-Pierre Charbonneau, now the speaker of the Quebec National 
Assembly.  Our economic institutions are also in danger because 
the clean money that is created by money laundering becomes dirty 
money as well.  That is a self-evident truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But these people have been creeping slowly ahead.  They have 
front men.  The small fry are arrested while others are 
strutting around openly in society.  Some of them have what they 
call “filthy few” tattoos on their shoulder.  If the minister 
is not aware of this, let her come to my riding. To earn that 
tattoo a person has to have killed someone.  These killers are 
grouped together as the “filthy few”.  If a Liberal over there 
wants to play at being one, let him just get such a tattoo and 
spend ten minutes on Sainte-Catherine in the east end.  Those 
would be his last ten minutes on earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know these people and we know what they do.  If anyone does 
not know what the Rock Machines, the Outlaws, the Devil's 
Disciples, the Hell's Angels are, they must be from another 
planet.  These are not clubs where people get together to play 
cards or go bowling.  We know what they are involved in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the former minister—I do not believe the present one 
would serve up this pontification totally devoid of logic—said 
that people are not being attacked for who they are, but what 
they do. 
I am telling you that these people act the way they do because 
of who they are. That is as simple as that, and those who do not 
understand this are off track.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am a former journalist.  As a journalist, I know that 
the most famous journalist in Canada and Quebec was René 
Lévesque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a journalist who defended human rights here in Canada and 
abroad.  I admired René Lévesque.  He was the veritable image of 
a journalist, with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and a 
good sense of humour.  He was a very honest man who understood 
well what it was to be a journalist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is proposing that the right to freedom of association be 
limited.  I wonder what René Lévesque would have thought of this 
proposal to limit the rights included in the charter of rights 
and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the hon. member think René Lévesque, who defended all 
these rights, would have reacted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have often noticed that 
admiration for René Lévesque has unfortunately been much greater 
here since his death than when he was alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, these are the same Liberals who did not 
hesitate to steal membership lists for the party led by René 
Lévesque at the time— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> They set fires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> —who did not hesitate to set fire to barns,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Yes, members of the RCMP did set fire to 
barns.  This was proven by the McDonald Commission. And what is 
more, they were rewarded with promotions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hypocritical to delude oneself about what went on, what 
was done. 
What I have just mentioned really happened and can be verified. 
As to limits being imposed on the rights to organize and 
associate, I would point out that there are limits to freedom of 
expression and that hate propaganda is prohibited.  No one with 
any sensitivity in Canada protested because people were 
sentenced for disseminating hate propaganda, and quite rightly 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in agreement with that.  Hate propaganda should not be part 
of the right to freedom of expression, and neither should giving 
constitutional rights to the Hell's Angels.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when I heard the hon. member 
speak, I asked myself what annoys and upsets him the most.  Is it 
that Canada is in fact the best country in the world, the Canada 
he wants to break up, or is it the fact that, as he said, 
ordinary Canadians, people across the country, should have 
rights?  He seemed to allude that they should not and I find that 
most surprising coming from that party opposite.  It is a party 
which one tends to think would have a little bit of common sense 
in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, our charter and constitution are fundamental to the 
very grounding of the country.  It is fundamental to who we are 
and the values we represent.  To listen to that leader opposite 
and that party go on about how they would reduce a very complex 
issue down to whether or not it is a choice between Hell's Angels 
and the youth of the country, which is exactly what he said, is 
ludicrous in the extreme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite a theatrical performance, do hon. members not 
agree?  Great sarcasm, great theatre, great mocking, mocking the 
justice minister and the solicitor general.  It was great theatre 
on behalf of a so-called libertarian party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, it was a little bit too thick.  At the end of the day, the 
leader opposite and his party should hang their heads in shame 
for saying that the very constitution on which we base this 
country and the very charter by which the rights of all Canadians 
are guaranteed are at the whim of something as easy as a 
notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want from the hon. member another example of when he would use 
the notwithstanding clause.  I want to see another example of 
when he would invoke that if he were in a position to do so.  I 
want to see precisely the rights he is prepared to strip not only 
from Quebecers but from Canadians as a whole.  I would like him 
to answer that precisely and to the point. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, when my colleague said that 
he had thought during my remarks I said to myself “This is an 
improvement over the past”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listened to his remarks I could see that it was not 
particularly elevated thought.  I did not say that the 
notwithstanding clause absolutely had to be used.  I said 
consideration had to be given to using the notwithstanding 
clause, which is part of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member listen to what I have to say?  I listened to 
his insipid remarks.  He should give me time to talk, perhaps it 
will help him think better.  Mr. Speaker, I am speaking to you. 
It is true, it is more interesting than what this firebrand has 
to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear this member say “You will be depriving ordinary 
citizens of their rights”.  The Hell's Angels and the Rock 
Machines are not ordinary citizens.  For a former policeman to 
not know this, I have to say he must have been just as effective 
as he has been as a member of parliament, and that is not saying 
much.  That sort of remark is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone has been fastidious about respecting individual and 
collective human rights in the past, we have.  We do not intend 
to use it for pleasure.  We say “Should we use that, an existing 
clause”.  We say that because it exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is the Liberals thinking it is like that of their 
leader, who does not know that the criminal code is under federal 
jurisdiction.  However, the member will never repeat these things 
as the Prime Minister does, because it is clear from listening to 
him that he will never be a minister.

the wearing of colours and the act of participation in a criminal 
organization indeed what the hon. member is suggesting is needed 
quickly and decisively to address this problem before it expands 
further outside the province of Quebec and throughout the country 
the way we have been seeing it in recent days and months? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is exactly that.  My

that is stopping the Liberals from supporting the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be using the entire time.  I will pick up this debate where 
it began with the comments of the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  He said in his opening remarks 
that this was a most serious issue. It is.  We are here in an 
emergency debate.  It does not happen often in the House of 
Commons that the Speaker rules that there is sufficient gravity 
to a motion to warrant an emergency debate.  We are here on a 
matter of sufficient gravity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough began by saying 
we should have a non-partisan debate because it is too important 
to deteriorate into the usual kind of blaming that sometimes goes 
on.  I hope we can revive that spirit because this debate is not 
about gun control.  The debate is not necessarily about the 
notwithstanding clause.  The debate is about organized crime and 
how as a parliament we are to respond to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker has ruled that there is an emergency.  Is there a 
crisis in the country?  I do not know if crisis is perhaps too 
strong a word but there is an emergency.  That emergency was 
brought to a head, galvanized by the recent shooting on September 
3 of Quebec journalist Michel Auger.  On behalf of my party and 
all parliamentarians I want to extend our sympathies and our 
concern to both him and his family.  He gives real truth to the 
words spoken by Robert Kennedy that moral courage is a far rarer 
commodity in this society than strength in battle or great 
intelligence.  The moral courage demonstrated by this journalist 
ought to be commended and respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shooting has galvanized the debate around organized crime. I 
suppose it has also galvanized the debate around freedom of the 
press.  I say in passing that it is of great importance that 
freedom of the press is a cornerstone to democracy.  No 
journalist should have to fear for his or her safety if they want 
to delve into a story.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when I was questioning the Minister of Transport 
three years ago about the ports police, that a young journalist 
who was covering that story for CBC Radio, whom I came to know, 
was under police protection because she was exposing at that time 
in 1997 some of the serious effects of gangs in the Halifax area. 
No journalist should have to fear that.  No member of parliament 
should have to fear addressing those issues.  No judge or no 
jurist should have to fear any kind of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the question of how we came to this point 
today.  How is it that we are having an emergency debate in the 
House of Commons on the issue of organized crime?  It is no 
mystery.  As I said, in 1997 I urged the Minister of Transport at 
that time to reinstate the ports police.  That has already been 
brought up time after time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not happy to say that my party or I was right at that point 
in time because of the effects that have developed from the 
dismantling of the ports police.  I met with the police on the 
docks in Halifax, people in the ports police who showed me 
clearly what the effects would be as a result of the dismantling 
of that police force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It meant that in effect the ports in Canada, whether in 
Montreal, Halifax or Vancouver, became open territory for 
organized crime.  Repeatedly I pushed the Minister of Transport 
on that issue.  Repeatedly he came back to me and said he had 
every confidence that the provincial police forces and the RCMP 
would be able to deal with the issue of organized crime in the 
ports.  Today, three years later, we are having an emergency 
debate in the House of Commons on the issue of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We got here because of cost cutting measures put in place by a 
government that was adamant.  It was not alone.  It was prodded 
in many ways by others.  There was a debt and deficit hysteria 
and come hell or high water it was here to eliminate the debt. 
Today we have a $30 billion surplus and unfortunately hell and 
high water are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been cuts to the provinces over the last six or seven 
years.  The moneys in equalization payments have been cut to the 
provinces and the provinces are charged with the administration 
of justice, as we have learned in this debate.  When a province 
does not have the money to pay its prosecutors, to hire 
prosecutors and to provide the resources to its provincial police 
force, we find ourselves in an emergency debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces went on to cut municipal budgets and so police 
forces at the municipal level felt those cuts.  It is no mystery 
and no surprise that we find ourselves after all the slash, burn 
and cut in a situation where we do not have the resources to do 
the job.  The coast guard, the ports police, and the educational 
and training facilities of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have 
been cut.  Now the chickens have come home to roost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not mean that we cannot do something about it.  I do not 
want to dwell on the past because I said this should be a 
non-partisan debate.  My objective here is not to cast blame as 
much as it is to try to work with all members of the House to 
find a solution to what is a serious situation in the country 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is serious.  I commend the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois and others who have been pushing for some time to 
address the issue of organized crime.  It is a serious matter. 
There are many types of organized crime.  When many people think 
of organized crime they tend to think of the old Mafia movies. We 
have gone far beyond <I>Godfather</I> type movies. 
There are Asian based organized crime rings in the country that 
specialize in trafficking in human beings.  They specialize in 
heroin and cocaine importation.  There are east European gangs 
that are involved in extortion, murder, prostitution, and in 
drug, tobacco and weapon smuggling.  They are involved in 
immigration fraud and counterfeiting.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the traditional historical types of organized crimes, 
the mob that we know of.  There are the outlaw motorcycle gangs 
which have brought this debate to a head.  They are the Hell's 
Angels.  They are the Rock Machine.  We read about them in Quebec 
but we know that they are not exclusive to Quebec, that they 
exist across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province in Halifax a couple of years ago I remember when 
the Hell's Angels were present and the Rock Machine, their rival 
group, was trying to buy property in Dartmouth across the 
harbour.  We could see what was coming.  We could see where this 
would lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are serious issues of organized crime in the country 
today.  There are serious issues in Manitoba.  I have heard from 
my colleagues who represent the city of Winnipeg their concerns 
for safety in their communities.  We know that they had to build 
a special courthouse in that province to deal with the trial of 
members involved in organized crime who ultimately pleaded 
guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real problem.  There is a real emergency.  When 
journalists are shot, when people are concerned, when members of 
parliament are threatened, we have an emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no benefit to fearmongering.  There is no benefit in 
trying to play politics with that kind of an issue.  In the same 
way as we have a real problem, we have dedicated, determined 
police forces in the country who despite the lack of resources 
have worked very hard to do their jobs.  We see the results of 
that.  Too often those results do not get the kind of press they 
deserve, but this summer we saw drug busts that appeared to break 
all records.  We know that on both coasts the police did their 
jobs.  We know that the new commissioner of the RCMP is committed 
and is determined to take on organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens of the country who listen to this debate and who 
read <I>Hansard</I> should know that while we have a serious 
situation with organized crime we have a dedicated and determined 
police force to take on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However those police forces require resources.  In the same way 
I have indicated that resources have been cut over the years, it 
is time to reinvest in those police resources.  The Minister of 
Justice has commented that in 1997 provisions in the criminal 
code were brought in.  She is correct.  As has been said by the 
member of the Canadian Alliance, those sections are well worded. 
They should result in the criminal prosecution of members of 
gangs and organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rightly some members asked the Minister of Justice why there 
have not been any convictions.  There was some discussion about 
plea bargaining, judicial intervention and whatnot, which I think 
are side issues.  The reality is that all the laws in the world 
will do no good if the police do not have the resources with 
which to bring the case to court.  To do that properly without 
infringing upon the rights of the rest of us, which ought not to 
be sacrificed on the altar of hysteria, and to work within the 
charter of rights the police need to have the resources.  The 
police make mistakes and perhaps infringe on the charter when 
they do not have the adequate resources to do the job they need 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general has indicated there has been some 
additional funding for the RCMP but I think there needs to be 
more.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We can take a page from the Canadian Police Association who met 
in Halifax this summer and discussed this issue. I had the honour 
to speak to that organization.  My parting remarks to the people 
of that organization, and this was before we had an emergency 
debate and before the unfortunate incidents in Quebec, was to 
pledge to work with them in the fight against organized crime in 
Canada. I asked them to work with the subcommittee on organized 
crime of which I am proud to be a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also had an opportunity to look at some of the 
suggestions they offered in the fight against organized crime. 
Some of them make sense and I offer them to the Minister of 
Justice and the solicitor general for consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association has asked for the development and implementation 
of a strategic national response to organized crime providing 
greater priority, funding, support and co-ordination for local, 
provincial and federal policing jurisdictions in the battle 
against organized crime. I have said that we have to begin to 
reinvest in the police. I also asked that we work in a 
co-ordinated effort with the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration, customs and excise, national police services, the 
criminal intelligence service of Canada in partnership with the 
federal and provincial police forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad and I commend the Minister of Justice and the 
solicitor general for going to Quebec tomorrow to meet with their 
provincial and territorial partners.  I think we can listen to 
the Canadian Police Association and involve the other ministers, 
including the Minister of Transport, because the reinstatement of 
the ports police would go a long way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police association also asked for a national border 
protection service.  Call it what you will, Mr. Speaker.  Call it 
the ports police or a national border protection service, but the 
association has asked that it be established and that is 
something that we as a parliament should push for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also asked for an examination of election financing and 
candidate financing criteria to provide elected representatives 
with clear guidelines to prevent infiltration from organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are solutions to this problem.  They need to be 
implemented right away.  We cannot afford to spend a whole lot of 
time studying the issues.  We know the issues and we know some of 
the answers.  That should not prohibit further investigation. The 
subcommittee on organized crime can play a vital role here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original motion brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois asked 
for a law to be introduced in the House of Commons by October 6. 
There is no reason that any law could not be vetted through the 
subcommittee on organized crime that already exists.  I would 
pledge my time and I know the other members of the committee 
would to try to ensure that the law as crafted would be charter 
proof, would be efficient and would be effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are ample suggestions from the Canadian Police Association 
and ample suggestions from members of parliament on how to deal 
with this situation.  We need to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, the minister has pledged, and I think her words 
were, to re-examine the code to find if there are ways that she 
can with our help fight organized crime.  She certainly has my 
pledge and the pledge of my party to work with her in that 
regard.  I take her at her word on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been discussion of the notwithstanding clause and 
whether or not it ought to be invoked.  The original motion 
brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois read “That this House 
request that the government prepare and bring in by October 6 a 
bill making it a crime to belong to a criminal organization”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated, people should know there is such a law 
already on the books which makes it a crime to belong to a 
criminal organization.  In response to a question from the member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois clarified that and said they wanted to go further and 
make it a crime to wear the colours to be identified with a gang. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resolution goes on to say “if necessary, invoking the 
notwithstanding clause of the charter of rights and freedoms”. 
The leader of the Bloc went on to say that they were not 
necessarily calling for its invocation but only if necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons we fear and fight organized crime is to 
protect the liberties we have as citizens.  Surely within this 
House, surely within the resources that the Department of Justice 
has, surely within the resources that the solicitor general has, 
surely working with the Canadian Police Association and the 
chiefs of police across the country, surely working with the 
commissioner of the RCMP we can as a democratic institution draft 
the necessary laws to protect our citizens without taking away 
the guaranteed rights of those citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel compelled to say there are no rights for criminals in the 
charter of rights.  There is no section in the charter of rights 
that says “These are the rights of men.  These are the rights of 
women.  These are the rights of victims.  These are the rights of 
criminals”.  There are guaranteed rights to all citizens. When 
we suspend those rights to tackle one group, we have to bear in 
mind that we suspend the rights to all of our citizens. That does 
not happen often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It happened with the War Measures Act before we had the charter 
of rights and freedoms. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoked the 
War Measures Act suspending what were then the civil liberties of 
Canadians which were defined not just through the bill of rights, 
but through precedent and through a long constitutional history. 
We look back on that today and wonder if it was the right thing 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge us to act swiftly and decisively to find a way to protect 
this country from organized crime without doing it at the expense 
of the freedom we all enjoy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for lowering the tone of hysteria in the 
House and congratulate him on his thoughtful speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To state the problem in my respectful view is relatively easy. 
To come up with examples of organized crime is also relatively 
easy and to gauge the concern of Canadians about the issue is 
relatively easy.  But crafting a legislative response is 
something far more problematic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member two questions.  The first question is with 
respect to his views on section 467 of the code, formerly Bill 
C-95, a bill which I might suggest was crafted in haste for which 
we now repent in leisure.  The evidence that has come before the 
committee at this point is that this section which parliament 
passed three years ago is unworkable.  It is onerous. It is not 
likely charterproof.  The police will not use it.  The crown will 
not use it.  They are fearful of jeopardizing their 
investigations.  Would the hon. member consider the implication 
of the notwithstanding clause on what is arguably a problematic 
law with respect to section 467? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question is with respect to the resolution as to 
bringing before the House by October 6 a law wherein membership 
in an organization is illegal.  I would be interested in knowing 
his views on both section 467 and the proposed resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT119"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member is correct in some respects when he says 
that section 467.1 was passed in haste. It is not the first piece 
of legislation in the House and in the criminal code that we have 
seen passed in haste for which we repent at leisure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child pornography section of the code falls in the same 
category.  It was rushed through the House of Commons and today 
stands before the Supreme Court of Canada subject to all kinds of 
acrimonious debate. Had the job been done properly the first 
time, we might not be going through this agonizing debate.  He 
may well be right when he says that section 467.1 falls into the 
same category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to that is not necessarily to invoke the 
notwithstanding clause.  It is to replace the section.  If the 
section has been poorly drafted and passed in haste, the worst 
thing we could do is respond in haste again and make another 
mistake.  The answer is to properly draft the section.  That is 
the best reason that we should not make the same mistake again. 
Let us craft the law so that the police can work with it, give it 
the kind of teeth it needs, and make sure that it is workable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not panic and do it within two weeks and be back here, 
some us and some of us maybe not, in three years saying we have 
another bad piece of legislation and in the meantime organized 
crime in the country has increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have answered both of the questions in terms of what 
we should do with that section and should we bring it back by 
October 6.  Not necessarily unless we can put together a proper 
bill. That is where I think the subcommittee on organized crime 
can play a legitimate role in reviewing the legislation and 
making sure that it is adequate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for 
Sydney—Victoria for his speech.  There was one contradiction in 
his speech that was glaringly obvious to me but perhaps not to 
anyone else in the House.  He said that this debate is not about 
gun control but then he went on to make a big point about the 
fact that it was about resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was cut off earlier in my comments with regard to the Ontario 
solicitor general calling upon the government to scrap this and 
put 5,900 more police on the streets instead.  That is where this 
is relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest information we have through access to information is 
the government is spending over $300 million on something that 
has really no measurable impact on organized crime.  It does not 
affect the criminal element in this country in any way.  Up to 
this point the government has only collected $17 million in user 
fees and it will have spent up to $300 million this year alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we not examine our laws to see if they are cost 
effective? If they are not cost effective should we not be 
putting those resources into areas where they would be very cost 
effective in improving justice in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think we are mixing 
apples and oranges here and I say that in the most sincere way. 
I appreciate what the member is saying, that we should examine 
our laws to see if they are cost effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The platform of the New Democratic Party in 1997 was to do 
exactly that with Bill C-68, to have a federal audit done of the 
bill.  That of course becomes even more important as we see how 
much money is being dished out in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me that is a separate issue.  We do not have to choose 
between gun control or the fight against organized crime.  I do 
point out, as has been pointed out, neither the chiefs of police 
nor the Canadian Police Association have asked that we do that. 
They have asked for both.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my speech, I referred to the difficulties that police forces 
encounter when they use the anti-gang legislation. I think it is 
wrong to call it the anti-gang legislation, but this legislation 
has been in effect since 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member tell me if there is a police force in 
Canada, in any province, that said that it is an instrument that 
is easy to use, that it is what they need to be effective 
against criminal organizations? My question is simple. When we 
passed this act, which has been in effect since 1997, did it 
meet the expectations of police forces and since we have had 
this tool called the anti-gang legislation, have things really 
changed? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was indicated in an 
earlier question that this section of the criminal code has not 
met its objectives.  I do not think there is any debate about 
that.  The police are not happy with it and the courts and 
parliamentarians have concerns about it.  The answer is, no, this 
section of the code is not working.  As I reiterated earlier, the 
answer is to bring in a clear, sound piece of legislation that 
has real teeth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the intervention.  I want to commend my 
hon. friend for his learned, insightful and thoughtful remarks. 
He always contributes to the debate in that fashion. I was 
particularly pleased to hear him pay tribute to the need for more 
prosecutors and resources.  I know that he was sincere in those 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to turn my question to him specifically with respect 
to what we can do in a concrete fashion to deal with this issue 
in terms of a legislative initiative.  I am referencing comments 
made by the Ontario attorney general with respect to this need 
for legislation that calls for a broadening of the definition of 
criminal organizations, the criminalization of participation and 
recruitment of those who engage in this type of activity, the 
prohibiting of the wearing of identifications and clearly 
designed insignia that signify membership in a gang, and the 
establishment of mandatory sentences for certain types of 
activities that are associated with criminal organizations. Those 
seem to be the concrete steps that have to be taken and embodied 
in the legislation, which we are all here discussing today, and 
expanding police powers to search and attend to crime scenes 
where there is suspected criminal organization.  These seem to be 
the concrete steps that are being suggested by the Ontario 
attorney general and which are being discussed here in the 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member has significant criminal law experience, 
but I was wondering if those and others he may be aware of are 
the areas that we have to go into as a committee.  As the justice 
committee, of which he is a member, and the House deliberate over 
this issue, are these the areas that we have to touch on if we 
are going to bring forward legislation that will also stand the 
test of time?  It will not be done in haste but it will be done, 
to use the minister's words, in a timely fashion that will send a 
strong deterrent message.  I know this is something which the 
hon. member knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need now with organized crime is to send a deterrent message 
not just to those currently engaged but to those who might 
willfully engage in criminal activity.  I believe that has to be 
encompassed in the legislation.  I look forward to his response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do see the need for 
more prosecutors.  I also see the need for more resources to 
legal aid, as the Canadian Bar Association has called for.  I 
know my hon. friend agrees with me on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go directly to his question, I do think that we need to look 
at expanding police powers.  I do not often agree with the 
attorney general of Ontario but on some of these comments— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He is a Tory, isn't he? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  I think he is a Canadian Alliance 
member but I am not sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seriously think that on these issues we have to look at 
expanding police powers.

allow police to sometimes contravene the law in terms of 
infiltrating gangs.  We may have to look at that.  Expanding 
police powers to search, but with the necessary safeguards of 
judicial warrants, may be a way to go.  I am prepared to explore 
those options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Minister of Justice, when she says she is prepared to 
re-examine the legislation, is being sincere with us.  There is 
no reason to think that she is not and I expect I and my

issues.

of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will begin my remarks by 
saying that organized crime is a very serious situation.  I want 
to emphasize not only to the House but to all Canadians that the 
Government of Canada, the justice minister, the solicitor 
general, the Prime Minister and all members of our caucus take 
this, as I am sure all members of parliament do, in a very 
serious fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House that with my police background I have 
attended many conferences and was involved in many situations 
where this was discussed.  We looked at this in a very concerted 
way trying to determine what exactly should be done in this area. 
We wanted to bring together partners from across Canada and from 
all levels of government:  provincial, federal, territorial, 
municipal, regional and others, so we could operate effectively 
and ensure that the kind of policing, policies and laws that we 
put in place would work in concert to ensure that the scourge of 
organized crime would be diminished if not eradicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this very seriously.  I, along with the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, was in the Ukraine and Russia not so 
long ago where they have huge problems with respect to organized 
crime and the criminal element.  It is of grave concern, 
especially as it relates to Canada in terms of people trying to 
get into our country and trying to contaminate the very fine 
country we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to redouble our efforts in terms of making sure that our 
borders in that sense are safe and secure so that our Canadians, 
no matter where they live in this country, are safe and secure, 
not only themselves but their families as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a moment to recap some of things that have been said 
in the Chamber tonight.  We of course heard the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough lead off with respect to this 
motion.  He made some very interesting comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the one thing that I take a little exception to is the 
fact that he said we should look to the United States for a 
template in terms of how to manage this problem.  That really is 
outrageous when we think about it.  The Americans have high crime 
rates, high murder rates and whole inner cities that have given 
up as result of criminal activity.  People are now living in 
suburbs with walls around them.  The Americans, I say with all 
due respect to the member, are hardly an example for us to 
emulate.  In fact, they are the worst example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that during the 1997 election the 
Progressive Conservative Party actually campaigned, and members 
of his party were elected as a result of campaigning, on reducing 
the budget by $83 million in this all important area.  I think it 
is fair to say that it is a little disingenuous for him to get up 
tonight and say that we should be putting in more money when he 
campaigned on quite the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also treated to the justice critic for the Alliance 
getting up and talking about things like not having laws in place 
to keep criminals out of Canada.  I want to again make reference 
to the Ukraine and Russia where I was not so long ago with the 
minister.  I can tell the member that he, as are all those 
Alliance members, is point blank wrong.  There are in fact laws 
in place.  The minister has made it very clear that people who 
are undesirable coming to this country will not be admitted. 
Those directions and operations were given concertedly and with 
great and due diligence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the Alliance who keep perpetuating these myths 
should really take a look in the mirror and give their heads a 
shake and try to determine why they keep perpetuating this kind 
of nonsense.  What they should do is read the laws.  They should 
understand what the laws stand for and how best to implement them 
instead of the fearmongering that they are so good at doing. 
Those extremists opposite with their right wing agenda are always 
trying to stir up Canadians and pit people against— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  On a point of order, 
the hon. member for Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have sat here while the 
member has been speaking and our debate is not assisted at all by 
him name calling and saying things about us which, frankly, are 
not true.  I think that you should call him on a point of order. 
He should be relevant to what we are talking about today, and 
that is criminal gangs and how to deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As always in a 
debate there are two points of view, generally speaking, one from 
one side of the aisle and the other from the other side of the 
aisle.  I too was listening and in my opinion there was not a 
problem with relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure which part of 
my speech the member took umbrage with.  I assume it was when I 
called them extremist right wingers.  I suppose that is where he 
was most upset, but if the shoe fits I suppose he can wear it and 
I am sure he does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I wanted to make with respect to the justice 
critic from the Alliance— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  At least for the 
moment, we are not going to bring in through the back door that 
which we will not bring in through the front door.  I would ask 
the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington to withdraw the last 
comment, which had to do with shoes fitting and being worn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  I certainly withdraw the shoe from the 
member's foot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to say has to do with gun control.  We actually 
listened to the justice critic say—and my head was spinning at 
this point thinking he could actually believe this—that if the 
gun control legislation was as good as it was purported to 
be—and I am paraphrasing here—Mr. Auger might have been spared 
the danger and the five bullets. I had to think about that for a 
minute because that really is twisted logic.  If one really comes 
down to the brass tacks of it all, it is twisted logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would say instead is that what we have in place with 
respect to gun control is something that the vast majority of 
Canadians support.  The reason they support it is because they 
know it is an effective tool for the police, for CPIC and for 
Canadians wherever they live in the country in terms of the 
reduction of crime.  It is a Canadian value.  It defines us 
differently than our neighbours, for example, to the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with their NRA friends, Mr. Heston, the Michigan Militia 
Corps, the minutemen and those right wing nutbars that exist in 
the states, the Alliance members actually counsel people to break 
the law and not register. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had the reverse where people had registered their guns, if 
we had the Alliance members helping in this regard as opposed to 
hindering it and dragging their feet as they have been doing over 
the last number of years, we would have had in place a system 
that would have worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reverse that and say shame on them for not bringing safety and 
security to something that not only the police chiefs of the 
nation endorse but the association of police as well.  They 
should know and recognize that as being something fundamental to 
the country.  They should be proud to do that as opposed to the 
shameful way they have conducted themselves with respect to this 
whole gun control issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard the leader of the Bloc, with great sarcasm and 
great mockery, take on the whole business of the constitution and 
the charter of rights and freedoms that all Canadians enjoy.  I 
had to absolutely wonder where he was coming from.  Is that in 
keeping with the wishes of the people of Quebec?  Is that in 
keeping with the wishes of the people of Canada in terms of our 
great charter of rights and freedoms, that great document that 
helps define us as a people and unite us as a nation?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Hogwash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Listen to the member of the Alliance 
saying “Hogwash”.  Imagine.  He does not understand the 
charter.  He would not know diddly-squat about the charter and 
the rights and freedoms of individuals if he fell over them.  He 
does not understand any of that.  The Alliance people have no 
regard for the individual rights and freedoms of people.  They 
would have us all become monoliths just like they are.  We will 
have no part of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Bloc leader to go on at length and talk about destroying 
the rights of individuals was astounding to hear.  One would have 
thought that party would have had a better position when it comes 
to something as fundamental as our great charter of rights and 
freedoms, something that is envied around the world, something of 
which we should be proud, something we should stand up for and 
defend at every opportunity, and something we all can hold near 
and dear to our hearts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the justice minister today and repeat again tonight 
that she will do everything that is required to ensure that we do 
not succumb to the scourge of criminal activity and organized 
crime.  She said categorically that we on the government side 
will ensure that the kinds of measures will be in place that are 
required in this all important area.  The reason she did that is 
because that is what Canadians want.  They want a government to 
act when required.  They want rights protected.  They want 
criminals brought to justice and victims in that sense helped and 
assisted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the government side are prepared to do that unlike members 
opposite.  If we listen very carefully to their speeches they 
offered not one solution.  All they did was go on about problems, 
circumstances and situations.  They offered not one solution, 
unlike those of us on the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have added money to CPIC.  We have beefed up the airports in 
terms of security.  We have added a great deal of resources to 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  We have continued on our 
immigration track in terms of making sure that we have the money 
in place and the resources necessary to ensure that we keep 
criminals out of this great country of ours as best we can in a 
fashion that is in keeping with what the Canadian people want. We 
have produced the tangible evidence required by the government to 
ensure that safety and security are in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this perfect?  Absolutely not.  Is it all we can do? 
Absolutely not.  Is there more to do?  Absolutely yes.  We need 
to carry on doing the kinds of things required to ensure that 
organized crime as we know it is eradicated as best we can, given 
the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  That we will 
continue to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the Minister of Justice along with the Solicitor 
General of Canada say that those efforts will be taken in a 
meaningful and consistent way in recognition of the charter and 
the fundamental rights and freedoms all Canadians enjoy. That 
seems to escape some members opposite.  It seems to escape 
them that it is not always a world of black and white as they 
would like to portray.  Rather, there are nuances and things that 
have to be considered and weighed.  As a government that is 
precisely and exactly what we are doing.  I would argue, given my 
experience, my background and my knowledge in this area, that is 
the appropriate way to proceed.  I commend the government.  I am 
proud to be part of a government that does so in that kind of 
concerted and proper way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If through legislation we require additional tools to assist our 
police to stop money laundering or to bring into place agreements 
to pool enforcement agencies between local, regional, provincial 
and federal—in this case the Royal Canadian Mounted Police—then 
we should get on with it.  We know those are the kinds of things 
that may need to be done and we are prepared to do them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that there needs to be an effective sharing of 
information and intelligence among all levels of police across 
Canada.  We need to provide it in a seamless way where instead of 
jurisdictional tugs and pulls there would be a concerted effort 
to make sure that knowledge is shared and people act as one when 
it comes to this all important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a little time to briefly outline some of the 
arrangements that are in place right as we speak to ensure that 
there is enforcement, co-ordination and intelligence sharing and 
to make sure that takes place among all partners in the fight 
against organized crime. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT124"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intelligence and information on crime groups and their 
activities are the foundation of effective enforcement.  We know 
that and we know that exists.  We need that kind of intelligence 
and information sharing.  That is what is used by police to 
determine what groups or activities impose threats to Canadians 
and to the Canadian system, the Canadian economic way of life, 
and indeed the morality of the country for that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police use this information to set priorities and target their 
resources so that they have the greatest impact given the 
resources at hand.  Intelligence and this information are 
together the primary building block in anti-organized crime 
enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Intelligence Service of Canada was formed in 1966. 
It is a national organization that links the criminal 
intelligence units and the Canadian law enforcement agencies in 
fighting the spread of organized crime.  CISC is comprised of a 
central bureau located in Ottawa in the RCMP and a network of 
nine counterpart bureaux in the provinces, again in keeping with 
that kind of co-ordination fanning out into various regions and 
provinces across this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently more than 120 police forces contribute intelligence 
information to the CISC network.  The structure and the computer 
network help police and other enforcement agencies to share 
information and co-ordinate action on organized crime across the 
country.  This is important because it ensures that we work 
together and we work co-operatively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point I want to make and that is co-ordinated 
enforcement.  Individual agencies cannot expect to tackle 
organized groups by themselves.  That is impossible.  It is much 
better to bring in a number of jurisdictions at any point in 
time.  By bringing together agencies from a number of 
jurisdictions, police widen and strengthen the enforcement net. 
It also allows diverse skills, talents, expertise and knowledge 
to be brought to bear at once to mutual benefit for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good example of co-ordinated enforcement can be found in the 
13 integrated proceeds of crime units established in the RCMP in 
1997 as a result of legislation, I might point out, and the good 
judgment of this government.  These units combine the resources 
and expertise of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; local, 
regional and provincial police officers; Canada Customs and 
Revenue officers; crown counsel; and forensic accountants to 
target and seize the proceeds of crime of organized criminal 
groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The units have seized more than $140 million in criminal assets 
so far.  That is important because it underscores the commitment 
of the Government of Canada in this all important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the greater Toronto area the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 
the Ontario Provincial Police and the Toronto, Peel and York 
regional services work together in a number of joint force 
initiatives aimed at combating national and international 
organized crime groups.  These include a combined forces Asian 
investigative unit, a combined forces special enforcement unit 
and a combined forces Toronto integrated intelligence unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The units are co-ordinated by the RCMP and have had some very 
major successes against national and international crime groups. 
The bust of a multimillion dollar international debit and credit 
card fraud ring in Toronto last year is one example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of other important joint force initiatives have been 
developed and led by provincial governments and police as well. 
The Quebec government has created an anti-biker gang squad based 
in major cities throughout the province.  These squads are 
currently operating in Montreal, Quebec City and the Outaouais 
region.  They are comprised of provincial and municipal officers 
and the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario there is a special squad of the Ontario Provincial 
Police that cracks down on biker gangs.  This OPP squad works 
with the RCMP, the criminal intelligence service in Ontario and 
16 local police services.  It gathers intelligence and executes 
enforcement actions aimed at larger and growing outlaw biker 
gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on in this area in terms of what the government is 
doing and what our police services across this great country are 
doing.  Do we need to do more?  Absolutely.  Must we do more?  We 
absolutely must and we will.

<A HREF="#LINKT125"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day we will work co-operatively together.  We 
will ensure that we work in partnership in a seamless way to 
ensure the safety and security which Canadians repeatedly over 
the history of this great country have taken for granted.  We 
will do so in an effective way that underscores the commitment 
not only of the justice minister and the solicitor general but of 
all members of the government who ensure and want to ensure that 
Canadians feel safe and secure in their homes.  We will ensure 
that we do not take for granted the kind of law and order system 
that we have, but rather that we work concertively along with 
everyone in the House to ensure that Canadians have the best 
enforcement system possible, given the resources at hand and the 
priorities underlined, to ensure that we do the right thing and 
to ensure that we have safety and security not only for 
individual Canadians but for their families and for the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK276"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the member opposite on his remarks.  He 
outlined very clearly, in my estimation, that he has a grasp of 
the scope of the problem, as I think have most members who have 
risen in the House and participated in the debate.  What is 
prevalent throughout his remarks unfortunately when he talks of 
co-operative approach is a very partisan approach.  He never 
hesitates to point the finger and to point the blame elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence is clearly before us.  Although there have been 
initiatives taken by this government and previous governments to 
attack this problem, the problem persists.  The problem expands. 
It is a testament to the scope and the magnitude of the problem 
that we are here.  In spite of all of these initiatives and in 
light of scarce resources the problem is getting worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dialling up the rhetoric, pointing the finger or engaging in 
polluting the air during this debate with this poisoned partisan 
attitude does not further the debate at all.  In fact it 
exaggerates the problem.  If the hon. member is sincere about 
this co-operative approach perhaps he could address his remarks 
in a less partisan way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit it was very refreshing to hear the Minister of 
Justice acknowledge that there are times, certainly pivotal 
points in the country's history, when the legislative branch has 
to exercise its superiority with respect to its obligation to the 
citizenry in using the notwithstanding clause.  The one that 
immediately springs to mind would be an issue pertaining to child 
pornography.  That certainly would be something that would 
warrant that type of legislative response and the invoking of the 
notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime, I would suggest, is certainly in the same 
category of seriousness and of a problem that has such magnitude. 
Does the hon. member attach himself to the remarks of the 
Minister of Justice in saying that there are occasions when 
perhaps they will find the inner fortitude and the strength of 
conviction to actually use the notwithstanding clause in light of 
the situation before us?  Does the hon. member agree that there 
are such occasions?  I know as a former police officer that he 
sincerely believes in the rule of law and the need for a strong 
justice system, but does he believe that there are occasions when 
the notwithstanding clause is the last possible option?  I am not 
suggesting that it ever be used lightly or with unfettered and 
unchecked regard, but are there times when his government would 
be justified in using the notwithstanding clause in our 
constitution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take the justice system of 
the country very seriously.  I know that around the world it is 
regarded as second to none in terms of what it represents not 
only for jurisprudence in this country but on international 
levels as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also take the charter of rights and freedoms, what was signed 
into law in April 1982, very seriously.  I know that all 
Canadians do as well because it is a defining value which 
underscores the very essence of what it means to be a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also know that due process of law is fundamental.  For 
Canadians it is something that they not only want but something 
that Canadians from coast to coast to coast expect us as a 
parliament and as a government to ensure is in place in a manner 
consistent with the values and the foundations of the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What I do know is that last week the justice minister and the 
solicitor general were in Iqaluit.  They have met with provincial 
and territorial partners to ensure that we look at this very 
important program and this very important situation vis-à-vis 
organized crime.  They will be meeting in the next little while 
in Quebec to ensure that there are ongoing discussions because 
unlike the Bloc leader who tried to paint it simply as a federal 
jurisdiction, that is the criminal code, it really is a shared 
responsibility between the jurisdictions. I was quite astounded 
frankly at his naivety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That aside, it is important that we work together with our 
provincial and territorial counterparts and that we do so in a 
manner consistent with what Canadians expect from their 
government, in a manner consistent with the underlying values of 
freedom, the charter, due process of law and justice for all 
Canadians.

<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the hon. member who will be sitting on the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he was a member of the Standing Committee on Health. 
Perhaps he was used to hearing some things about health, but I 
would invite him to be more realistic, to wake up and to see 
that the problem is extremely serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, I would invite him to read the Canadian 
Constitution. The hon. member will realize that the criminal 
code is not a matter of shared jurisdiction. All the sections 
that are found in the criminal code were passed by the federal 
legislator, here in this House. 
This is not a matter of shared jurisdiction. However, the 
administration of justice is the jurisdiction of provincial 
legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the government to wake up, to look properly at the 
issue of organized crime and to amend the criminal code to 
provide real tools to the judiciary, the police and the 
prosecutors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an issue of shared jurisdiction. There is only one 
entity that can amend the criminal code, and it is the federal 
parliament, all of us here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would invite the hon. member to wake up and to take an 
upgrading course in constitution 101 to learn the difference 
between a matter of federal jurisdiction and a matter of 
provincial jurisdiction. 
Only then will we be able to talk and listen to the member. 
Right now, all he can do is smile and strut about the House, but 
his understanding of the issue of organized crime is nil. It is 
rather scary and frightening to see what kind of parliamentary 
secretary the solicitor general has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing much will happen at the justice committee if the member 
opposite keeps on talking through his hat, if he knows nothing 
about the foundation of the Canadian Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the constitution was signed—he might even have forgotten his 
history—who was the Minister of Justice? It was the current Prime 
Minister, who was then the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The then Minister of Justice included section 33 in the Canadian 
charter, which allows us as legislators in Ottawa to use the 
notwithstanding clause if we want to deprive a group or an 
individual of certain rights under the charter. If the 
legislator included this section in the charter, it was to use 
it at some point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all we want, and only if necessary. There might be other 
things to do before using it, but we should not be shutting our 
eyes and covering our ears like the member opposite is doing. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my, my, my, the Bloc members 
are touchy tonight. They are very sensitive.  They can dish it out 
but they cannot seem to take it.  I do not need to be lectured on 
constitutional law.  I know exactly what constitutional law is in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do know that if the Canadian government and the justice 
minister and the solicitor general proceeded without meeting in 
Quebec in the next couple of days, those people opposite would be 
screaming to high heaven.  They would be saying that once again 
they are victims, that once again they have been left out, that 
once again they have been cut off from the Canadian mainstream. 
They would be up on their high horse going into all kinds of 
pretzel-like gyrations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that in the next couple of days we are proceeding 
to go with the Quebec counterparts, ensuring that we work in a 
co-operative fashion.  The hon. member cannot seem to get that 
through his head.  He should rethink his position, tone it down 
and think through what he is saying, instead of getting all 
emotional and proceeding in a ludicrous way. But that is fine. 
Perhaps it is part and parcel of who he is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I am saying is that the government, the justice minister and 
the solicitor general have made it very clear.  We will be 
dealing with this issue with our provincial and territorial 
partners in an effective way.  We will make sure that we continue 
to work in a way which is consistent with Canadian values which 
are fundamental to the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Okanagan—Shuswap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate has had some low points but it has had some high 
points tonight.  As far as I am concerned, we are talking about 
putting personal freedoms up against our personal safety as it 
were.  The issue of the freedoms we have in Canada is sacrosanct. 
Those freedoms have been fought for in two wars and other 
skirmishes.  People have fought and died for the freedoms we have 
here. Before we talk about using the notwithstanding clause to do 
away with our own personal freedoms, we have to take a very long, 
hard, analytical look at the issue. We need to look at what has 
precipitated this focus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are talking about an allegation that a biker gang shot 
a reporter. That is what we are dealing with. We have to 
understand that there are totally different actions taken by 
different types of gangs.  The bikers are noted for taking a very 
blunt instrument approach to problems as they come across them. 
There are aboriginal gangs, the mafia, other ethnic 
organizations.  There are gangs of common interest, for example, 
the Colombian gangs around the importation and distribution of 
heroin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that bikers represent organized crime is both 
unfortunate and inaccurate. It has been helpful in this terrible 
situation. As has already been stated, our hearts go out to Mr. 
Auger and the people around him.  It is difficult to realize that 
that shooting, if indeed it is proven to be an action of a biker 
gang, is just one of probably thousands of potential 
manifestations of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to realize that trying to cure the plague of organized 
crime with a broad action such as using the notwithstanding 
clause would be like using a malaria treatment for a typhoid 
infection. When we break our leg, we do not put our arm in a 
cast.  We need to define the problem.  We have to understand that 
in the House we must always stand for personal freedom of 
association because it equates to the issue of our personal 
safety in a very real way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final analogy would be that we could cure the common cold or 
a more serious flu by taking a lethal dose of arsenic.  We would 
not have the cold or the flu anymore.  We would not have to worry 
about having the cold or the flu.  The cure may be successful, 
but the patient could die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does organized crime affect us and what do we have to do to 
get organized crime under control?  We are aware of different 
situations in our society.  For example, there are environmental 
dumps and organized crime involved in intentionally and 
aggressively polluting our society and our environment.  We are 
aware of the situation with the snake heads. We are also aware of 
the situation of the weakening and compromising of our police 
forces, not through anything that our police forces are doing, 
but by the actions of organized crime toward them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not be intimidated by the member for Waterloo—Wellington 
when he uses the club of political correctness so that supposedly 
we cannot talk about the fact that there are ethnic gangs.  There 
are. The people most disadvantaged by those ethnic gangs are of 
the same ethnic group.  They came to Canada to get away from 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best example I can think of off the top of my head is the 
Tamil tigers.  In Canada we have an excellent outstanding 
community of Tamil people who came to Canada to get away from the 
suppression, murder and mayhem, to build a better life for 
themselves and their families. Unfortunately they were followed 
by people of the Tamil tigers who represent a national security 
threat to Canada, an international security threat to people 
around the world and who also represent organized crime in its 
very worst form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, in terms of ethnicity or being able to identify people on 
the basis of a particular group, I think of the Russian gangs. We 
know, and this has been in the public domain, that there was an 
attempt to compromise politicians in this Chamber. Political 
contributions were made to high ranking politicians in this 
Chamber.  To the honour and credit of those politicians, the 
second they found out that political contributions had been made 
to them, they immediately transferred the funds out of their 
accounts and into trust accounts. The only way this became public 
knowledge was that the wife of the Russian mobster tried to get 
the money and so it became a story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would other people in public life, if not in this Chamber, have 
fallen to the threat?  Would they have fallen to the threat of 
compromise or embarrassment?  What about financial coercion that 
can happen to people like ourselves in this Chamber who are 
charged with the responsibility of making laws to protect all 
Canadians?  What about the threat of death to the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot and to his family, and the fact that 
within this parliament he has had to have a bodyguard for himself 
and his family?  This is a very serious threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have to realize that although the debate we are having 
tonight unfortunately has had some low points, it is nonetheless 
absolutely vital. All Canadians, and not just this Chamber, must 
collectively work to protect the liberties that we have as 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do the law enforcers have sufficient resources to get the job 
done?  Our answer is an unequivocal no.  As a result of dollar 
cuts we have seen the disbanding of the ports police.  A critical 
example in the issue of the ports police occurred at the time 
they were being wound down.  The ports police were asking the 
Vancouver port authority about an individual it had hired who was 
a Chinese national based in Beijing.  They wanted to know whether 
a security check had been done on the individual.  It had not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At about that time the Vancouver ports police were disbanded. 
That individual within the next couple of months brought three 
so-called students from the port of Dalian into the port of 
Vancouver.  Those three so-called students had access to the port 
of Vancouver, to all the security, all the intelligence within 
the Vancouver port.  And we wonder why the Vancouver port is a 
leaky sieve for every drug we could possibly imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At exactly the same time this was going on an agreement was made 
with an international shipping company that Vancouver would be 
the first port of call.  Containers would go from the port of 
Vancouver directly to Chicago.  Do not stop, do not collect $200, 
do not pass go.  The drugs all of a sudden went from the golden 
triangle to Chicago just like that as a result of the shutdown of 
the Vancouver ports police.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In CSIS and the RCMP, not only at the personnel level, there is 
a real competition as a result of the legislation that covers the 
evidence gathering of the police and the way in which CSIS ends 
up getting its information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest there are two things we need to look at long before we 
would ever look at the potential of shutting down our own 
personal rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, legislatively, we must examine and rationalize existing 
laws and change those laws where those laws conflict.  Second, 
under resources, we must co-ordinate law enforcement agencies and 
other enforcement agencies.  We must end the competition between 
the agencies.  We must expand training and sharing of 
information.  We must be in a position to be able to purchase 
contemporary equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that our response must be one of dealing with 
the larger issue, the broad picture.  We can craft a response to 
enhance our personal safety and national security, but we must 
craft that response in a way that will stand for individual 
personal freedoms.  We must not kill the patient with the cure. 
<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just want to congratulate the member 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rare in the Chamber that I rise and say that I agree with 
everything that was said by a member in the opposition party. The 
member is absolutely right.  We must not be stampeded into 
compromising our fundamental rights because of the activities of 
organized crime.  When we do that organized crime wins. We must 
never do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with him, as I mentioned earlier and I will be 
mentioning when I speak myself, that the way to get at organized 
crime is to get at the way they make their money.  The member 
opposite pointed out very correctly that our ports are leaky 
sieves in which all kinds of contraband is going out of the 
country.  I have had many reports and have made many 
representations to my ministers saying that we must do something 
to stop it.  It is not checking the contraband that is coming in, 
it is the contraband going out that is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is that the Americans send their contraband across 
the border because it is an open border.  It is then shipped out 
of Canada to Africa, to Jamaica and to countries that want the 
illegal goods.  We have a real problem there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member if he agrees that if we were to 
compromise freedom of association as a response to the motorcycle 
gangs in Quebec, would we not be jeopardizing the very freedoms 
that the Bloc Quebecois itself enjoys?  I recall a time when the 
RCMP attempted to read the mail of the Parti Quebecois because it 
was a separatist organization.  There was outrage in the entire 
country.  Everyone was angry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member's comment on this.  Surely the Bloc 
Quebecois, of all the parties in the House, should be saying that 
we should not use the notwithstanding clause, that we should 
protect freedom of association and find other means to combat the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a scary night 
because I agree with the member opposite.  This really is a very 
scary night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all seriousness, I agree with him totally.  The 
notwithstanding clause was put into the constitution for a 
specific purpose which was to cover an eventuality that could not 
be foreseen at the time.  If we are ever going to use it, it must 
be used as an absolute last resort.  I believe at some point it 
may be appropriate to use it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In examining the entire issue of organized crime, it forms part 
of a whole national security issue.  It is not just crime.  It is 
a whole national security issue as well as a personal security 
issue.  We must examine this in its totality to see what other 
solutions there are.  Indeed there are many solutions totally 
apart from anything legislatively.  I agree with the member 
completely. 
<P><A NAME="LINK280"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not agree entirely with either member but I 
certainly take delight in much of what they have said in their 
remarks, particularly my hon. friend from the Alliance Party who 
I believe has a real grasp of this problem. 
Coming from the part of the world that he does, I would like to 
draw him into the debate a little further on the issue of ports 
police.  Although we are certainly a massive country, we have two 
large virtually undefended coastlines where we are most 
vulnerable to organized crime and contraband materials that seem 
to slip in under the radar on both coasts.  Even in the Arctic we 
have a great number of coastlines that leave us vulnerable.  That 
is one area that has to be addressed in a comprehensive way 
through legislation, through resources and through a co-ordinated 
effort.

<A HREF="#LINKT130"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, I would elicit some response with respect to the 
problem within our prisons where all members know and anyone 
familiar with the situation realizes that the officials within 
the penal institutions are particularly vulnerable as well to 
intimidation and to forms of blackmail and bribery.  Again, I 
think this is something that has to be addressed, not necessarily 
just through the resource and legislative branch, but through 
internal changes that can be made to assess and buttress their 
efforts to deal with those in the organized crime community that 
they now have within their mix and who continue to operate from 
the inside of prisons across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more that can be done.  It is certainly discouraging to 
those members of the penal community who see individuals being 
ushered out the door after a very short period of time in custody 
by virtue of for example our statutory release in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get the hon. member's comments in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, for sake of time I would 
like to deal with just one aspect of my colleague's comments and 
that is to do with the ports police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shutting down of the ports police was against every possible 
piece of advice that the government received.  Absolutely 
everything went against it because we had a gathering of 
information and a gathering of intelligence.  In particular, we 
had a gathering of experienced officers.  There was a wealth of 
information.  On the day the ports police were disbanded around 
Canada was the day that information fundamentally evaporated. 
Many of the files physically evaporated when that took place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is part of the co-ordination that we have been talking 
about.  My colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, myself 
and others have been talking about having a co-ordinated effort. 
This information must go into a pool.  We must develop a way to 
enhance the pool of intelligence and the pool of experience of 
our police and enforcement forces.  In that regard I absolutely 
agree with my colleague from Pictou as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK281"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for 
Kootenay—Columbia for sharing his time on this very important 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to stand here and presume that Canadians who are 
listening and that members in the House do not know there is 
organized crime in this country, not like some government members 
who seem to think that this is just not the case and that this 
does not happen in Canada.  We know full well that it happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government says that it transbounds borders and 
boundaries with regard to provincial jurisdiction, in some cases 
it does and in some cases it does not.  We know for a fact that 
we have organized criminals who have been linked to criminal 
organizations that have been charged.  They are not Canadian 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do?  We do not deport them.  No, they go up before 
different boards.  They have different appeal systems which cost 
the Canadian taxpayer bundles of money.  That is federal.  They 
know that.  Yet we keep on doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know it in our federal penitentiaries.  If we want to talk 
about gangs and gang affiliations, our prisons are loaded with 
them.  We have prison gangs in just about every prison.  They 
bring drugs into the prisons.  The government knows that and the 
members on the other side know that.  Yet they say it is not 
really a big problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a major problem particularly in the prisons.  It creates 
threats to prison guards, police officers and parole officers. To 
give an example, let us take a look at the National Parole Board 
which has been threatened.  This candid memo by recently retired 
chairman, Willie Gibbs, represents the latest evidence of 
attempts by criminals to intimidate players in the justice 
system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2155"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT132"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT132"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2155

<A HREF="#LINKT131"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The retired chairman of the parole board stated this.  He also 
went on to state that it appeared to be most common in Quebec, a 
pattern that may have something to do with inmate population in 
Quebec, including the larger number of inmates with organized 
crime connections.  Gibbs stepped down as board chairman in July 
and his replacement is yet to be named. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what else was said.  This was recently obtained 
under the Access to Information Act and submitted to the federal 
justice department last January in response to a consultation 
paper.  It said “Fear affects the decisions you make.  The 
process could lead to new laws or procedures to protect parole 
officials, lawyers, jurors, witnesses, police and prison 
guards”.  We are talking about a number of people who put their 
lives on the line to protect us so that we feel safe.  They have 
stated this in report after report and the federal government 
does absolutely nothing in this regard.  We have to wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Correct me if I am wrong, as I know the hon. member for 
Waterloo—Wellington surely will, but as I grew up I was always 
led to believe, as I think most people in Canada were, that a 
government's first and foremost priority was for the safety and 
well-being of its law-abiding citizens.  I heard this as I grew 
up and I was led to believe that.  Yet since I have come to the 
House and before that time, I have done nothing but read papers 
and listened to victims' groups.  They all say the same thing. 
They cannot seem to get protection from the Government of Canada. 
The sentencing is not there.  The criminal justice system likes 
to talk a good fight yet it absolutely does nothing.  It supplies 
money to the lawyers.  It keeps the appeal systems ongoing.  It 
has a turnstile system that allows criminals back out on the 
streets just as fast as they can be charged and in many cases 
before the paperwork is done.  This is Canadian justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They think I am fearmongering.  Let us look at this report that 
said that police were also targets of intimidation ranging from 
simple warnings to open threats.  David Griffin, the executive 
officer of the Canadian Police Association said “that is a 
concern for police officers”.  He said “Organized crime will 
not hesitate to resort to bullying, threats and violence”.  We 
are talking about a breed of people that has chosen to live 
outside the law.  Let us say that David Griffin is fearmongering. 
He is only the executive officer of the police association.  This 
association represents 30,000 officers.  It expressed frustration 
yesterday that organized criminals operate with virtual immunity 
in this country while police are hampered by weak laws, a lack of 
tools and inadequate resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are our people who are trained to fight crime.  They 
warned the government and the government still has done nothing. 
We have members on the other side saying there is no such thing 
as organized crime in this country.  When we mention the Asian 
gangs, the Indian gangs and the white gangs we are fearmongering. 
That is all the members can say.  Yet ask the victims and talk to 
the their families.  Talk to the guards in the federal 
penitentiary who are too afraid sometimes to go to work.  Talk to 
them and not this bunch.  They would rather sit here where it is 
nice and safe and have a cup of coffee.  Talk to the guards and 
talk to their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  They have never been there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  No, they have never been there nor 
will they go there.  They might have to do something for a 
change.  They would finally find out what it is really like to do 
something for a change, instead of just saying we are 
fearmongering.  It seems strange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I ran for nomination in 1993, I remember this was the big 
issue.  This has been a big issue for a long time yet all of a 
sudden the minister says it is now a priority. The government is 
going to study a white paper.  It will study it and study it and 
then it will hire some more people to study it again and it will 
do nothing. 
The government will do absolutely nothing in regard to that 
outside of doing the study on it.  We know that and everybody 
else knows that.

is involved here.  As a matter of fact I cannot wait for the 
questions and comments because I have a few answers to a few of 
the questions that I am sure will come from one side or the other 
in regard to what is taking place here in organized crime. 
<P><A NAME="LINK282"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in listening to my colleague from Okanagan—Shuswap 
I know he comes to this debate with a tremendous amount of 
passion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps he could help us understand his understanding of the 
issue of this being all part of a larger picture.  We are talking 
about organized crime.  We are talking about some terrible event 
that happened to the reporter Mr. Auger. The allegations that it 
had something to do with bikers seem to be well founded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that kind of violent activity, that kind of 
manifestation of organized crime, is just one of the very tiny 
manifestations of organized crime.  It is part of an overall 
picture that has the power to immobilize us to neutralize our 
police forces.  Also many of these gangs end up funding national 
and international terrorist activities.  There is no line now 
between security issues and criminal issues, between organized 
crime and national terrorism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my colleague would like to expand on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is absolutely 
right.  It has gone through everything.  People are desperately 
looking for answers particularly from a government such that we 
have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An article in the Vancouver <I>Province</I> confirms that the 
RCMP have listed Stanley Ho as the leader of the Kung Lok triad, 
an organized crime group since 1991.  But despite this, Ho has 
received multiple visitors visas, has extensive holdings in 
Canada, is a donor personally and co-operatively to the Liberal 
Party and actually hosted a cocktail reception for the PM during 
the Vancouver APEC conference. This certainly has to raise lots 
of concerns for the people of Canada.  The list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>RCMP Corporal Reid revealed a massive penetration of the 
immigration computer system in Hong Kong by triads which resulted 
in the loss of thousands of visas as well as widespread improper 
issuance of visas to triad linked individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be lots of questions and fear about how far this 
really goes.  Even the members over there all of a sudden have 
stopped.  What is going on is well known.  It is not a small 
little group.  This has been reported in the papers.  Do we not 
think this brings fear into the hearts of average Canadians when 
they hear things like this, that this is where some of these 
party funds are coming from?  You bet it does. 
<P><A NAME="LINK283"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member 
opposite with some but not a great deal of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really has me on my feet is the allegation that he is 
trying to make with respect to party funds.  If he has any 
allegations to make, he should make them to the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police.  If you have any, you make them directly and you 
then take it outside and make them outside.  Because if you do 
not, you do not have the fortitude to repeat what you just said 
in this Chamber out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  May I respectfully 
suggest that members refer to other members through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite really 
should get his facts straight.  Less histrionics and more facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are quite simple.  We as a government have repeatedly 
injected resources and money not only into the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, but into CPIC which is something I am familiar 
with given my police background.  We have injected funds into 
immigration, into revenue, into the ports of entry and others. 
We have done all kinds of things with respect to assisting in 
this very important area.

federal levels?  No, we have not and we need to do more.  Will we 
do more?  Yes, we will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite should listen instead of fearmongering and 
trying to upset Canadians, as those people opposite are always so 
prone to do. It is their forte to always try to pit region 
against region, people against people and province against 
province. Instead of the politics of negativity, they should talk 
about what is positive and what we in the Government of Canada 
are doing that is positive.  They should listen.  They should get 
their facts straight and they should proceed accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  My, my, Mr. Speaker, is the hon. 
member ever an upset little Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what he said.  The Liberals expanded upon the 
ports authority?  They disbanded it.  What are you talking about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sure everyone 
in the House understands the importance of my intervention in 
suggesting that these two members in particular speak to each 
other through the Chair.  I am insisting upon it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must say you are far 
more knowledgeable and far better looking than the member on the 
other side, so I will keep that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ports authority has been disbanded.  The Liberals know that 
full well, but they will go on and on and on about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for my making allegations, I think it is the Vancouver 
<I>Province</I> newspaper and the RCMP that the hon. member had 
better take this up with. It was the RCMP that made these 
allegations, not me.  I am just reading about it.  I could read 
some more if the hon. member would like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought I would be nice and gentle on him today because it was 
the first day of parliament. I know how upset the member gets 
when his shoes are too tight or his shirts do not fit, but that 
is just the way he is, and I accept that as one of his downfalls 
or one of his pitfalls.  I do not mind that he has that type of 
temperament.  I understand that.  I do not think the people in 
the rest of Canada understand where he is coming from, but I am 
sure that his family and his one friend do, so I will just say 
goodnight on that one.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, public 
safety and protection are fundamental objectives of Canada's 
criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week's deplorable shooting of <I>Journal de Montréal</I> 
reporter Michel Auger once again brings home the need for 
effective action against such criminal acts.  Combating organized 
crime is a key part of maintaining public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw to the attention of hon. members a recent 
report by the Criminal Intelligence Service of Canada, CISC. CISC 
is the organization responsible for assembling the information 
and intelligence needed by law enforcement to carry on the fight 
against organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the keys to success in the fight against organized crime 
is partnerships between governments, between enforcement agencies 
and between the police and individual members of the public. CISC 
operates entirely on the basis of co-operation made available by 
such partnerships.  It provides a network by which police across 
Canada come together for the common purpose of fighting the 
spread of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does CISC have to say about organized crime groups in 
Canada?  The CISC annual report for 2000 reviews organized crime 
groups and their activities in Canada.  I should note, as the 
report itself does, that none of the references to criminal 
activity associated with ethnic or other groups is to be taken to 
suggest that all members of that group are involved in organized 
crime. The report does make it clear from the police perspective 
that organized crime extends its influence into many parts of our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, CISC reports that the Hell's Angels remain one of 
the most powerful and well structured criminal organizations in 
Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I should mention that I will be splitting my time 
with the hon. member for Scarborough East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CISC notes that the armed conflict which started in 1994 between 
the Hell's Angels and the Quebec based Rock Machine is likely to 
escalate, with expansion of the Hell's Angels and the Rock 
Machine's recent move into Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Hell's Angels continue to be involved in the 
importation and distribution of cocaine, the production and the 
distribution of methamphetamine, as well as the cultivation and 
exportation of high grade marijuana.  Members use a vast network 
of associates to assist in growth and harvesting of the drugs and 
with its illegal trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CISC also reports that the outlaw motorcycle gangs are involved 
in the illegal trafficking of firearms, explosives, the 
collection of protection money for both legitimate and 
illegitimate businesses, fraud, money laundering, prostitution 
and the use of intimidation and threats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CISC annual report goes on to describe the activities of 
organized criminal groups.  According to the CISC annual report, 
Asian based organized crime groups are involved in the 
importation and trafficking of narcotics, counterfeit currency, 
software, credit and debit cards, prostitution, illegal gambling, 
extortion and a variety of violent crimes, particularly in 
western Canada, but I might say also in my own region of York. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During 1999 the Asian based organized crime gangs continued to 
exploit Canada's ports of entry, attempting to import illegal 
contraband and illegal immigrants.  As members well know, 
Canada's public safety agencies thwarted several such attempts 
over the last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CISC expects Asian based criminal groups to increase such 
activities in the future.  That is why we are exercising 
increased vigilance and increased intelligence sharing to counter 
these efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These groups are expected to build greater alliances with other 
organized criminal elements.  They rely increasingly on new 
technologies to facilitate their illegal activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CISC notes that in the past, eastern European based organized 
crime groups have been involved primarily in extortion, 
prostitution and other street crimes.  It is reported that these 
groups are becoming involved in a variety of white collar crimes, 
including counterfeiting of credit cards and debit cards, as well 
as immigration fraud, organized theft and automobile smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police have also taken note of the increased involvement of 
eastern European based groups in drug smuggling and money 
laundering.  The CISC report also states that traditional 
organized crime groups remain a threat to Canada, despite the 
success of law enforcement efforts against the Sicilian Mafia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In western Canada illegal gaming continues to be the primary 
activity of such groups.  Elsewhere these groups are reported to 
be involved in drug trafficking, extortion, loan sharking and 
money laundering.  CISC notes that increased criminal activity is 
being reported in tobacco, alcohol and diamond smuggling.  It 
also reports increased criminal activity in the illegal import of 
firearms primarily from the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, illegal gaming is reportedly being used to finance 
many organized crimes and other criminal activities such as drug 
trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, CISC reports an increased likelihood of organized 
criminals to use computer hackers and individuals with 
technological skills to forge credit and debit cards, all of 
which gives a sophisticated edge to criminals and makes detection 
and enforcement that much more difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These facts compiled from Canada's most knowledgeable law 
enforcement officials by CISC underline the seriousness of 
organized crime activity in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to these threats, governments at all levels in 
Canada are working together in the fight against organized crime. 
First, we must know the problem and that is why the efforts of 
the CISC and law enforcement across Canada in intelligence 
gathering and sharing are so important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Armed with this information the government and its provincial 
and territorial partners have come up with new strategies to 
fight organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's record of achievement is clear.  We brought in 
Bill C-95, the anti-gang bill that introduced the concepts of 
criminal organization, criminal organization offence and 
participation in a criminal organization offence.  This was a 
tool the police asked for to investigate outlaw gangs, and the 
government acted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CISC report talks about money laundering.  We now have Bill 
C-22 in place which has one of the most comprehensive anti-money 
laundering regimes in the world.  With this legislation 
authorities can target cross-border currency movement and other 
superficial financial transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very vigorous proceeds of crime law in effect.  There 
are now 13 dedicated units in major centres across the country 
investigating and seizing the assets of criminals.  Some $70 
million in fines and forfeitures have been levelled against crime 
figures since 1997, a big blow to organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have bolstered our anti-smuggling initiative, increased RCMP 
presence at airports to fight organized crime and dedicated $30 
million this year to develop ways to help police deal with the 
use of new technologies by criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CISC report contains some troubling information and so it 
should.  Governments and Canadians need to know the extent of the 
problem we are dealing with and how organized crime targets us. 
Such reports have been of great use to us in developing 
appropriate strategies, developing the right enforcement tools 
and identifying areas for further research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fight against organized crime has been and will continue to 
be a key part of the government's longstanding commitment to 
safer communities.  The same commitment was again demonstrated by 
federal, provincial and territorial ministers in the outcome of 
their meetings in Iqaluit last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will not relent in its efforts to provide 
national leadership in the fight against organized crime, 
building on the advice of the police community across Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to what the member is saying, everything is fine and 
dandy in the fight against organized crime in Canada and the 
government seems to have been doing its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned the solicitor general's report on organized crime. 
If he read it, he would see that things are not as rosy as he 
seems to think they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He bragged about the government seizing some $37 or $57 million 
in proceeds of crime—I do not remember the exact amount—when money 
laundering and hard drug transactions in Canada total some $15 
billion a year. 
What our police forces can do in the fight against organized 
crime is just a grain of sand in the desert, and maybe this is 
due to the fact that we do not have the right tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 we passed a few amendments to the criminal code which 
took effect in 1997. These amendments were made under the name 
of anti-gang legislation so it would be easier to gain public 
support in that regard. But this name does not ring true because 
all those responsible for enforcing this legislation come to the 
conclusion that it is not anti-gang legislation since the desired 
results cannot be achieved. It is too difficult to enforce.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the member read section 477 of the criminal code. One has 
to prove that an individual was party to the activities of a 
criminal organization, that this individual knew that the gang 
members had engaged, within the preceding five years, in the 
commission of indictable offences under the criminal code, for 
which the maximum punishment is imprisonment for five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this being cumulative it is very cumbersome and complex to 
enforce and it is not needed to fight organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member heard the speeches, he heard the comments made by 
members of the Bloc Quebecois. We have been studying the issue 
since 1995: We are not talking through our hat, and neither are 
we reacting to what happened to one journalist. 
The situation is serious. Quebec and Canadian society is facing 
a complex problem, namely organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member opposite agree with the Bloc Quebecois that we 
need further tools? We need legislation with teeth. If we have 
to use the notwithstanding clause, if we cannot do otherwise to 
eradicate organized crime, is the member willing to go along 
with it? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for his question.  I do not think that talking about trafficking 
of narcotics, illegal gambling, extortion or prostitution is 
making light of the fact that this is a very serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out those issues very clearly in the CISC report.  The 
government has information and has acted.  The hon. member said 
that Bill C-95 was not much legislation at all.  It was passed in 
two days with the consent of all parties including his own.  I 
would suggest on reflection that maybe if it was not what the 
member wanted in 1997, his party should not have given it the 
support that it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very clearly we have said that we are prepared to deal with this 
issue.  We have brought in legislation and we will continue to 
fight organized crime wherever it exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my region of York we have a problem with Asian and eastern 
European gangs.  There was an excellent report done by our police 
force on this issue.  It is very disturbing to see the influence 
and the depth at which organized crime operates both in my own 
region and elsewhere in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice clearly indicated today that in 
consultation with her provincial and territorial counterparts she 
is prepared to look at whatever additional tools are needed, but 
I do not think an artificial date of October 6 will necessarily 
be the answer.  We need to make sure that the proper tools are in 
place, that those tools will meet the test of law, and that at 
the end of the day they can be used for the very purpose which we 
all in the House want to see, that is an end to the role of 
organized crime wherever it exists in the country so that people 
are not in fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CISC 2000 annual report is very important reading for all 
members.  That is the base on which the Minister of Justice and 
the Solicitor General of Canada have indicated that they are 
prepared to work with their counterparts and policing agencies 
across the country to provide additional tools for enforcement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
when hon. members rise at this time of the evening they usually 
say something like it is a great pleasure to participate in this 
debate and that it is an important topic.  Then they say some 
platitudinous things and sit down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times, in particular in the context of the debate this 
evening, when one wishes that hon. members would confine their 
speeches to areas in which they have some knowledge.  I like to 
remind hon. members from time to time that we are in the 
Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House referred this subject matter to the justice committee 
for study and a report back in a timely fashion with respect to 
the recommendations. 
That is a committee on which I enjoy sitting.  It is a committee 
that faces many of the most problematic issues of the day.  This 
is probably one of the most problematic issues.  We frankly have 
struggled on the justice committee to try to get a handle on this 
massive subject which goes to the very roots of our democratic 
institutions and is a real and palpable threat to our community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our dilemmas was speaking to the press, making speeches 
and conducting our deliberations publicly.  We all agreed on a 
self-imposed gag rule which turned out to be a bit of an oxymoron 
when it comes to members of the House.  We did that to provide 
some level of confidentiality so that when witnesses came before 
us they could feel some confidence that what they said would be 
held in confidence.  We in turn would get the real goods rather 
than the platitudinous speeches we so often hear about resources 
and funding, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We felt that this level of confidentiality would in fact make 
our report more meaningful so that we could then move to 
recommendations to the House which in turn might lead to useful 
legislative initiatives.  That is why it is my view that this 
call for an emergency debate is counterproductive.  It will 
pretty well guarantee that the work of the subcommittee will be 
compromised or possibly even useless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report will be meaningless because we will not get the real 
goods.  Witnesses will not tell us the real story.  They will go 
off record or speak to us outside the committee room about what 
they really mean to say.  They will not commit to writing and we 
will therefore be limited in what we can say in our report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a classic case of parliament shooting itself in the foot 
partly because of hysteria.  It is easy to state the problem, but 
it is much more difficult to apply one's mind to the resolution 
and to reply to the problem without lapsing into some generalized 
government bashing about cutting back, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last example of parliamentary ineptitude in this area is in 
my view with respect to Bill C-95, incidentally also sort of a 
pre-election response to a real problem.  Bill C-95 is now 
codified in section 467 of the criminal code.  It defines 
participation in criminal organizations.  This is a classic case 
of legislate in haste and repent in leisure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arguably Bill C-95, now section 467 of the criminal code, is one 
of the most useless bills parliament has ever passed.  The crown 
will not touch it because it is afraid it is not charter proof. 
The six elements of the offence, heaped upon a predicate offence, 
make the burden of proof sky high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in the court house knows that accused <I>x</I> has links 
to organized crime, but the crown is unable to prove all six 
elements beyond a reasonable doubt.  The police do not use it 
because of the ability to wiretap for in excess of a year. The 
time is too long.  Investigations change directions over the 
course of a year.  They question whether using this section will 
expose their whole case to a charter challenge.  Therefore 
literally years of work will go out the window because they are 
afraid that section 467 will not withstand a charter scrutiny. 
The disclosure requirements expose years of police work to 
defence lawyers and therefore to their clients. 
They can get everything they want with a normal application of 
wiretap provisions of the criminal code and not risk wasting 
thousands of hours of work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, parliament, in a pre-election knee-jerk reaction to 
a substantive problem, gave the police and crown useless or 
marginally useless tools.  I respectfully submit that is what 
this debate invites us to do once again.  We apparently do not 
learn.  As the famous Yogi Berra once said “This is déjà vu all 
over again”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compound legislative sloppiness with judicial laziness in the 
area of ever expanding definitions of disclosure and of 
relevance.  Crowns have an obligation to disclose to defence that 
which may be relevant to the accused presenting a full defence. 
Since defence is under no such obligation to disclose its 
defence, even if it does not have one, disclosure becomes one 
grand fishing expedition.  Crowns and police end up providing 
volumes and volumes of material because the judiciary will not 
circumscribe definitions of relevance. Therefore almost 
everything becomes relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become so bad that certain jurisdictions will not share 
information with Canadian authorities for fear that their own 
investigations will be compromised by permissive Canadian courts 
that allow this ever-expanding definition of relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People's lives are at risk.  Police spend endless hours vetting 
disclosure binders and needless time and resources are devoted to 
wild goose chases.  Then the defence, in an ultimate act of 
arrogance, will say “It is not in the right format” or “I want 
it tabbed and correlated”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is serious stuff and frankly an emergency debate is 
counterproductive.  It is a little like bringing gasoline to a 
fire.  It is a pathetic response by members opposite to attempt 
to show that they are doing something when in fact they are being 
counterproductive to the work of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the committee spent the entire week in Vancouver.  We 
walked the streets of east Vancouver with the police.  We spent 
some time on the docks and were there when containers were 
opened.  We went to the border and looked at how massive the 
problem is.  We went to the airport and even got on an airplane 
with customs officers and examined all the places where one can 
put contraband.  We were all profoundly affected by this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I hate to interrupt the hon. member who was speaking very 
well, but he, I and many other members are members of the 
subcommittee.  As subcommittee members we are under gag orders. 
While the member is speaking on this issue he is discussing in 
the House what we are not supposed to discuss.  If that is the 
case, why are certain members of the House under gag orders but 
not the government members? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sure that 
anyone who is listening is listening with heightened interest to 
the hon. member for Scarborough East.  It is a question of 
debate.  It is not a question for the Speaker to settle.  It is a 
question for the House.  That can be settled in some other venue 
but not here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member had been 
here at the beginning of my speech he would have noticed that 
hon. members on the subcommittee have basically ignored the gag 
orders, as has the hon. member opposite, and we are being reported 
in the newspapers.  Frankly, our confidentiality has been 
completely compromised.  We asked that this emergency debate not 
occur but it has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view the ability of the subcommittee to produce a 
meaningful report with confidentiality restrictions is completely 
shot.  I feel betrayed and disappointed that we cannot conduct 
the subcommittee in that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To finish off, all of us were affected by the lives that we saw. 
The undercurrent of violence is always there and the threat to 
our democratic life is profound and it is real.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The subcommittee is not ready to report and this evening's 
debate and the compromise by members opposite of these gag orders 
will make our report very problematic.  I am quite disappointed 
in the ultimate result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an enormous and significant problem.  It goes to the 
very root of our democratic way of life.  People in good faith 
could arrive at some meaningful legislative responses and the 
couple of suggestions I put forward with respect to 467 and with 
respect to the ever-expanding definitions of relevance are areas 
we should seriously explore.  I think that members in good faith 
could well arrive at some reasonable resolution of this matter 
and prepare a useful and a meaningful response for Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the member for a 
clarification with regard to the subcommittee.  I heard and was 
led to believe that the subcommittee report was under a gag 
order.  I heard the member from the other side say that this was 
no longer the case.  Is it my understanding that the member is 
now free to speak to us and the public about what went on in that 
subcommittee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the committee started out by 
exploring the issue of confidentiality.  It is clear that it is 
not working.  It is clear from the newspaper articles printed 
time and time again and quotes attributed to certain members of 
the House who are on the subcommittee that there is no realistic 
possibility that we will have the confidentiality we all wish to 
have.  As a consequence, this does not lead to the conclusion 
that the work of the subcommittee is without relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The material that we have had and I expect we will have over the 
course of the next few weeks is substantive, is useful to 
deliberations and will help us, I hope, suggest to parliament 
some reasonable legislative responses which will be of assistance 
in responding in a reasoned and deliberate fashion so that the 
government may draft legislation in response.

hour. He is a bit confused and, with all due respect, I will try 
to correct some of the things he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We one this side, my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois as well as 
the Alliance members who sit on the subcommittee, feel bound by 
the rules of confidentiality. I do not think that the members 
who have already spoken tonight or who will speak later on will 
break the confidentiality of the work being carried out by the 
subcommittee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I do not agree with the member that a more dispassionate 
and civilized debate, based on the insight parliamentarians 
should always demonstrate, could prejudice the future findings 
of the subcommittee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the leader of the Bloc Quebecois and member for 
Laurier—Sainte-Marie said, the subcommittee on organized crime is 
involved in a long term process where it will have to address a 
whole series of problems. What the Bloc Quebecois is asking for 
in the short term, by mid-October or in the near future, is that 
the government take very specific and time specific measures to 
declare illegal a number of criminal biker gangs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like our hon. colleague to tell the people who are 
watching tonight's debate that we can act at both levels, we can 
uphold our oath and also exercise caution and take our 
responsibilities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I disagree with the hon. 
member opposite.  I think our work is affected.  I think our work 
is compromised by the debate and that it will be politicized. 
The consequence of that will be legislation, which we already 
have an example of in Bill C-95, which in my view was legislation 
in haste, repent in leisure.  Bill C-95 was a knee-jerk response 
to a difficult problem, the result of which we are now reaping 
the whirlwind thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My view is that the work of the committee, which I thought was 
going at a reasonable pace, has now been compromised.  We probably 
will not enjoy the level of confidence from witnesses that we 
might otherwise have come to expect.  However, I hope that will 
not totally compromise the work of the committee.  Nevertheless, 
we will continue to vigilantly work at this problem.  I hope we 
will be able to respond in a timely fashion to this issue with 
meaningful legislative initiatives and suggestions which the 
committee can put forward to parliament and parliament in turn 
can put forward to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Just before we get 
to the next intervention, and without making any editorial 
comment, it was pointed out to me earlier that the Chair has 
become involved in issues relating to the in camera proceedings 
of committees in parliament.  While everything raised in the 
House was, in my opinion, raised legitimately in debate, it might 
be wise for all of us to remember the issues that have gone on 
before relating to committees and in camera proceedings of 
committees.  Again, I say that without making any editorial 
comment about any of the interventions by any members but we need 
to be mindful of our responsibilities in that regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I begin my speech, I wish to inform you that I will share 
my 20 minutes with my colleague, the hon. member for 
Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at why the Bloc Quebecois felt the need to 
debate this issue today. In fact, it is not just today that we 
have felt the need to address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole thing really began with the events that occurred in 
Montreal in 1995 when young Daniel Desrochers was killed by a 
bomb blast. We immediately felt the need to look at this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on, we had Bill C-95. 
It is true that the Bloc Quebecois supported that bill. Members 
will remember that it was passed on the eve of a federal 
election call. In other words, it was that or nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask members opposite to read the comments that we made 
back then. We said, among other things, that the legislation 
would never allow the police to catch the leaders, that it would 
never allow it to gather evidence. The leaders are always those 
who call the shots. Those at the bottom of the pyramid carry out 
the orders and pay for those at the top, who are never caught. 
We said that it would be much too difficult to collect evidence 
against these leaders and that crown attorneys and the police 
would come to the same conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then in 1996, since that legislation was not enough, the Bloc 
Quebecois member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who is just behind 
me, introduced a private member's bill that basically sought the 
same objective as today's motion, namely a tougher act to fight 
organized crime. This is nothing new. That was in 1996.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign in 1997, we debated this issue. We 
were calling for strong laws to fight organized crime, which is 
very active in Canada and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fall of 1999 a motion to establish a sub-committee to 
study organized crime was unanimously passed. This did not come 
out of nowhere, it was once again the Bloc Quebecois that had 
deemed it important to study the issue with every 
parliamentarian from every political party gathered around the 
table to work out a solution. It was adopted unanimously, and 
the sub-committee is in the process of studying the whole issue, 
but I will get back to this later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 2000, the three Bloc members on the sub-committee on 
organized crime issued a letter in the media saying that every 
available tool should be considered, including the use of the 
notwithstanding clause if necessary. That was in June 2000. If 
we were talking about it at the time, it was not as a result of 
some incident or an attempt on the life of a journalist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 1 I addressed the Canadian Police Association in 
Halifax. I raised the issue in my speech. I said “I think we 
have reached the stage where we must consider the possibility of 
using the notwithstanding clause should it be necessary to reach the 
goal we are pursuing, namely an efficient legislation to fight 
organized crime”. This is nothing new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the day, I heard the Liberals say that the decision to 
raise this issue today was an emotional reaction to the shooting 
of a Quebec journalist. This is not true. We want to debate this 
issue today because it is our first opportunity to do so and 
especially because all kinds of events took place, including 
that one. There were other events as well. The biker war has 
killed 150 so far. That is a lot of people, and it is nothing 
new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position has not changed since 1995. There is nothing new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is new, however, and I have to say it, is the arrogance 
shown by the government which has refused to allow the House to 
vote on our motion, to vote on a very concrete measure forcing 
the government to introduce, by October 6, effective legislation 
to fight organized crime. On top of that, on the same day, the 
Minister of Justice has announced that she will propose a motion 
to limit debate on another bill, the one dealing with young 
offenders. As a Quebecer I must say that I find this rather 
bizarre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one hand we have the Young Offenders Act which works well 
in Quebec. 
Quebecers are telling the minister “Do not touch the law, it 
works fine.  We do not need your Bill C-3”.  Yet the minister has 
informed us that she is going to steamroller over anyone who 
opposes this bill and ram it through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand Quebecers are nearly unanimous in calling for 
legislation with teeth to battle organized crime effectively. 
The government tells us “There will be no discussion”.  We did 
manage to get some discussion tonight, at last.  And the 
government tells us “There will be no vote either”.  How can 
Quebecers find anything of themselves in this government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not seek to win any votes with this. The Liberals are the 
ones looking for votes.  For the Liberal government, the 
equation is this “What do we have to do to get more votes?” 
Attack 12-year-olds, maybe lower the age to 10, put them in jail. 
As far as major criminals are concerned, there is the Canadian 
charter of rights.  That protects them.  They have the same 
rights as anyone else. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT142"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Minister of Justice's thought process makes no 
sense.  Since 1995, coming back to the subject, certain things 
have been done.  The witness protection legislation has been 
amended.  There is an act aimed at improving penal legislation. 
There is the 1997 anti-gang legislation to which I have already 
referred; the legislation regulating certain drugs and other 
substances has been changed, as has the legislation on the 
proceeds of crime.  The criminal code has been amended in just 
about every possible way imaginable, as has the Narcotics Act. 
The $1,000 bill has even been withdrawn, something the Bloc 
Quebecois has been demanding for the past three or four years at 
least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, however, there is one thing that must be pointed out. 
What is it?  In 1995, there were 28 criminal biker gangs in 
Canada; in 2000, there are 35 such gangs on police files.  The 
police have all the details on who the gang members are and so 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are more organized and richer than ever, and the government 
opposite is saying that everything is fine, that everything is 
under control and that there is no real need to change anything. 
There is especially no need to invoke the notwithstanding 
clause and section 33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms.  This is alarming.  People are worried, and with good 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real need for the sub-committee on organized crime. 
Everything that I have heard here represents facts that can be 
found in public documents. 
The only member who broke his oath, the only member who passed 
on privileged information that he received in the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights, which is looking at the 
issue of crime, is one of the members of the Liberal government 
across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that members opposite are looking for a way out because 
they are finding all this too much work.  They are either lazy 
or irresponsible.  We, however, will not back down.  This 
evening the debate is about whether it should be a crime to 
belong to an association of criminals.  If so, we will sit down 
and look for a solution up to and including using the 
notwithstanding clause, but that is not an end in itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, which is 
studying the whole issue of organized crime, has a long road 
ahead of it.  From it we will learn exactly what needs to be 
changed in the long term. 
There are things to do: protection of jury members, the way 
criminals move about across the country, the border problem. A 
number of things are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken part in many open line shows.  When I say that 
people are anxious it is because they are, but they are also fed 
up with a do-nothing government.  What they want is something 
that moves.  We are no longer in consultation mode with respect 
to criminal organizations.  We are in action mode.  Something 
has to be done and the public expects that from a responsible 
party and from a government that claims to be responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I invited the Prime Minister to assume his 
responsibilities as the head of the government and demanded that 
parliament vote on this important issue of fighting organized 
crime.  He did not assume his responsibilities at the 
appropriate time.  I would hope that there are people on the 
other side who will wake up and put the Prime Minister straight. 
<P><A NAME="LINK290"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as we now know criminal gangs of all kinds are expanding and do 
not hesitate to impose their law wherever they can and wherever 
it is profitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec a criminal gang like the Hell's Angels does a lot 
more than simply manage some trafficking. These people do not 
hesitate to use all means at their disposal, including of course 
illegal ones, to eliminate all those who put themselves in their 
way. Not long ago, I was against the adoption of an anti-gang 
legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2255"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT144"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT144"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2255

<A HREF="#LINKT143"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time I was convinced that police forces and the judicial 
system had all the tools they needed to stop the activities 
of all criminal organizations in Canada without exception and 
put all their members behind bars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With passage of Bill C-95 in April of 1997, I believe like many 
others, that some provisions of the new act, namely those on 
search and seizure, penalties for gang members, electronic 
surveillance, explosives and crime proceeds, could actually stop 
the illegal activities of most of these criminal organizations. 
Unfortunately I now have to change my mind since I see no real 
improvement in the fight against the activities of these 
criminal gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge members of the House to seriously consider 
any new reasonable measure that could help to put a stop to this 
high level criminality. Under the present circumstances, it 
seems almost impossible to put these offenders behind bars 
because they use the current legislation to thwart the very 
provisions that are supposed to put them out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that we cannot connect certain shifty individuals with 
organizations like biker gangs or well-known mafia groups? And 
how is it that it is almost impossible to connect many criminals 
with violent crimes or some other offence like drug trafficking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously I would not want to see the Canadian authorities go 
on a purposeless witch hunt across the country. I am quite 
capable of seeing the difference between ordinary people and 
notorious criminals. I also know, however, that there are many 
dangerous individuals out there who are members of the 35 biker 
gangs known in Canada who are ready to do anything and who brag 
about having committed criminal acts without being bothered by 
the authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore think it is important for us to adopt new anti-gang 
legislation that would give us the tools to separate the good 
citizens from the bad criminals, members of all kinds of 
organizations whose ultimate aim is to commit offences that will 
give them enormous financial benefits and even more power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other countries such as the United States, France, Italy and 
Russia there are laws that try to improve the tools the police 
and judiciary have at their disposal to help them fight 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, our neighbours to the south have the RICO Act, the 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which 
targets four violations related to infiltration of businesses by 
gangsters.  About fifty offences are clearly mentioned in that 
legislation and offenders are liable to a life sentence or 
twenty years in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what some parts of our Bill 
C-95 provide for, in the U.S. a person charged with an offence 
does not have to be convicted of the criminal activities 
mentioned in the RICO Act.  The prosecution just has to prove 
that some crimes, such as extortion, theft, arson, abduction, 
fraud or the printing of counterfeit money, were committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, with the RICO Act, contrary to what happens in 
Canada, there is a procedure called the reverse burden of proof. 
Under this procedure, once certain criminal activities have 
been proven beyond any reasonable doubt, the accused has to 
demonstrate to the court that the source of his assets is 
legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec as everywhere else in Canada, if members of the 
House were to promptly pass some new anti-gang legislation, we 
could, from then on, require any member of a criminal gang to 
explain before the court where he got luxury items, such as 
residences, cars, jewels and so on, when his income tax return 
shows a very modest annual income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another good example is section 265 of the French criminal code, 
passed in February 1981. It is the only one to explicitly forbid 
membership in a criminal organization.  It says, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone found guilty of membership in an association or 
involvement in an agreement designed to take one or several 
measures in preparation for one or several crimes against 
persons or property offences shall be sentenced to a period of 
imprisonment of five to ten years and may be denied entry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As people say in France, it is a well-known fact that membership 
in a crime syndicate is illegal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike what we see in Quebec and in Canada, criminals in France 
do not operate openly. If they were still in existence, the 
Bonnot gang would not be allowed to have a bunker or use calling 
cards. Some of its members would not be using complimentary 
tickets to attend a boxing gala. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Bloc Quebecois recently reminded us that 
organized crime is responsible for over 150 violent deaths. He 
also added that we now have a consensus in Quebec to act quickly 
to fight organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, the Quebec government, the Quebec Press 
Council and the Montreal Urban Community Police Department are 
among the groups urging the federal government to introduce 
harsher legislation against organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view, a partial suspension of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms is not to be excluded if it could help to 
achieve the desired effects, namely to quickly quash any 
increase in violence and the feeling that these criminals are 
untouchable, as they would like the population to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Believe me when I say that I am not trying to score political 
points when I stand here in the House to demand changes to the 
criminal code. 
In fact, because the illegal sale of all kinds of drugs brings 
every year some $10 billion to drug traffickers, we have to deal 
swiftly and firmly with such criminal activities. Are members 
aware that some young prostitutes hit the streets as soon as 
6 a.m. because they need a fix? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work of the House sub-committee on organized crime will 
surely continue for some time, I hope, in spite of the remarks 
made a little earlier by our Liberal colleague. However, we feel 
it is urgent to act in order to deal swiftly and effectively 
with those who treat the laws with contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I think it is urgent to act to quickly better equip 
ourselves to effectively counter organized crime because the 
situation is catching up with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I urge members of the House as well as government 
members to act as quickly as possible in order to repress more 
effectively all criminal gangs at work in Quebec as well as 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that the shortcomings of several of our laws are major 
assets for organized crime and its supporters. I would even add 
that the strength of organized crime lies in the weakness of our 
actions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK291"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is unfortunate and I regret that the leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois has made fun of my kind words concerning Mr. René 
Lévesque who was a journalist and a Premier of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How arrogant of me, an anglophone, to dare say something 
positive about a famous Quebecer. I truly admired Mr. Lévesque 
as a journalist. Mr. Lévesque understood human rights and 
liberties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Lévesque must be turning in his grave at this proposal of 
the Bloc Quebecois to limit freedom of association. This is the 
very freedom Mr. Lévesque defended as a journalist and as a 
premier of Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How ironical. The members of the Bloc, the sovereignists want to 
reduce the scope of this legislation. That is impossible, for if 
we reduced basic rights, criminal groups would win. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have something to say in this debate and I 
have waited a long time.  I am one of the few people in this 
Chamber who is a former journalist.  I can assure you, Mr. 
Speaker, that in my view, René Levesque, as one of Canada's most 
celebrated journalists, would indeed be turning in his grave at 
the very thought that his colleagues in Quebec would be proposing 
to lessen the rights of Quebecers, lessen the rights of Canadians 
as an instrument to get at criminal organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must tell a story, Mr. Speaker.  In my early young days as a 
reporter I myself had my own encounters with organized crime. I 
have great sympathy for the Quebec journalist who found himself 
wounded severely in the recent incident that has led to this 
debate.  When I started out at the Hamilton <I>Spectator</I> many 
years ago as a police reporter, the city editor at the time 
really admired the way I seemed to be able to get information out 
of anyone.  At that time I was only a reporter for two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hamilton has had a Mafia problem for some time and I imagine it 
still has a Mafia problem now.  It certainly did then.  There was 
a particularly notorious Mafioso by the name of Johnny Papalia 
who lived in town.  A couple of years ago he was gunned down in a 
contract killing.  Even for 20 years he has obviously had quite a 
reputation in his own organization and it cost him in the end. 
He was notorious and he used to operate from a little company 
called Monarch Vending which is on Railway Street, a little blind 
street in Hamilton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was happening was the <I>Globe and Mail</I> was running a 
series of exposés on the Mafia and the city editor in Hamilton 
wanted to match the exposé.  The exposés were about a different 
Mafia leader altogether, but he suggested I go down and get 
Johnny Papalia's reaction.  No one had ever interviewed Johnny 
Papalia.  He was notorious.  He was a tough guy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyway, I dutifully decided to take a taxi rather than my own 
car because of course even journalists do worry about these 
things and I did not want Johnny Papalia's friends to get my 
licence number.  I took a cab down to 10 Railway Street.  The 
cabbie said to me “You are going to see Johnny Pops”.  I said, 
“Well, yes”. The cab dropped me off. He was kind of interested. 
He drove down to the end of the street and backed up into a 
driveway.  He wanted to see whether I would come out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went into Monarch Vending and there was this great big guy. 
There were lots of thugs around in those days and they looked 
like thugs.  I said I wanted to see Johnny Papalia and they were 
so amazed.  This Mafioso guy came out.  He was a tough looking 
hombre and he said “I will tell you once, take off.  How dare 
you come here”.  I said, “Look, Mr. Papalia, I just came here 
to get your side of this article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>”. 
He raged at me and I backed up and out of the door and down the 
driveway and past his Cadillac.  He had a Cadillac in the 
driveway.  I got a little mad myself and I said “All right, if 
you do not want the damned story” and I took the newspaper 
article and spiked it on the radio aerial of his Cadillac.  I 
have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, for some time afterwards I did 
look under my car in case there was a bomb or any other thing but 
there was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those days, I think generally speaking, there was an 
unwritten rule.  That unwritten rule was that one did not 
intimidate, harass or threaten the life of journalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why we are having this debate tonight and why it is so very 
important is that organized crime has broken that code.  They 
have attacked a journalist in the course of his duty.  I have 
great admiration for the Quebec reporter.  I am glad he survived 
but we should all be desperately concerned when an event like 
this occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is absolutely right for this parliament to go on the 
attack against this kind of threat but I caution everyone that 
there is no journalist in this country, I am sure, who would 
really want to sacrifice our fundamental liberties just because 
one or two of us get killed because that is what does happen.  I 
lament the Bloc Quebecois.  They do not realize it is the same 
tradition of journalism in Quebec as it is in the rest of Canada.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec journalists follow the same tradition of defending basic 
rights. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You do not sacrifice a fundamental right like freedom of 
association because a journalist has been attacked, but what 
parliament must do is it must make these organizations pay.  The 
only way you can make organizations like this pay when they 
attack journalists, when they attack politicians, or when they 
attack justice officials, is to take business away from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proposed earlier, Mr. Speaker, that I really do think that the 
government has been going at this problem in bits and pieces. In 
fact over the last five or six years the government has failed to 
comprehensively address the ways in which organized crime is 
making money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have followed this debate this entire evening and a lot of the 
debate has focused on increasing policing.  There were some very 
good comments about taking the ports police away.  I do believe 
that our open ports and the ability to export any kind of 
contraband out of Canada is one of the major things that is 
fueling profits for organized crime.  That has been a very good 
suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But just adding police is not the answer.  As I alluded to 
earlier, we have to stop the ability of organized crime to 
make money in Canada and to launder money in Canada, and to 
engage in easy cross-border transportation, both in money, and 
information is another thing, and contraband.  We have not done 
very well there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had an opportunity in the past and we have not exploited 
it.  We need to go after, as I mentioned, non-profit 
organizations and charities.  I know this sounds preposterous 
that I should be bringing charities into a debate about organized 
crime, but I can assure the members opposite that this is very, 
very serious.  The charity industry is over $100 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was going through my pile of correspondence as I was listening 
to the debate. I had a number of annual reports from major 
charities.  I will not name them because it is a little hard on 
them in the context of this particular debate, but some of these 
charities were very prominent charities.  They sent their annual 
reports out and there is no financial detail.  There is no 
audited financial statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Major charities are operating with no transparency and it is an 
absolute invitation to organized crime.  One can set up a charity 
anywhere in this country and there is no requirement for them to 
report.  So the charities have become famous, I think worldwide, 
Mr. Speaker, for the ability for organized crime or ethnic 
organizations to finance terrorism abroad, you name it. They are 
able to finance everything through the various charitable 
non-profit organizations in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have complained about this issue many times.  I 
regret that the government has been slow to respond, but 
I regret also that I have had very little 
support from the opposition benches.  The opposition benches are 
constantly looking for opportunities to embarrass the government, 
and when a backbench MP comes along with something that really is 
central to solving the organized crime problem—or not solving, 
nothing solves it—but making it costly for organized crime to 
operate, I just have not had the support.  I regret that 
because I really think that many of the members on the 
opposite side are very sincere in what they try to do.  I think 
that by and large this debate, except where it entered into the 
delicate ground of interfering with our fundamental liberties, 
has been well aimed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to be a little careful because I do not want to cast 
aspersions on the justice minister and the solicitor general who 
very patiently took part in this entire debate and I hope receive 
some very good suggestions, but the responses from the justice 
minister and the solicitor general are still partial.  No one 
seems to recognize or appreciate that the Internet and electronic 
communications and the global marketplace are a boon to organized 
crime, an absolute boon to organized crime.  What we really have 
to do is have an open debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite a revelation to me to know that the subcommittee on 
organized crime was having in camera discussions.  That is pretty 
useless, I want you to know, Mr. Speaker, because I am a person 
who did not happen to be on that committee.  I can tell you that 
I would have had some input in that committee.  I can tell you 
that it was one of the places where I would have liked to have 
had some input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned tonight the subcommittee received a submission to 
which the justice minister alluded.  It was a consultation paper 
on the intimidation of key players in the criminal justice 
system. This consultation paper arose from a survey that was done 
in 1998 following a court case involving the Hell's Angels in 
which Quebecers were asked whether or not they feared reprisals 
if they did jury duty on a case involving organized crime like 
the Hell's Angels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think 81% of them said they feared intimidation, so the 
justice department issued a consultation paper which the 
subcommittee on organized crime is supposedly considering.  It 
seeks laws, regulations or penalties specifically aimed at 
intimidation of people in the criminal justice system like 
judges, juries, policemen and prison guards, but they left out 
politicians and journalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole way in which we try to control the bad side of 
society, the way that we try to get control over the negative, 
shadowy forces that would steal, that would kill, is through our 
politicians and journalists as well as through our criminal 
justice system.  I would submit that it is more so with our 
politicians and journalists.  The journalists are the ones who 
write the stories and put their lives in danger, and the 
politicians are the ones who act upon those stories and pass 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is ample opportunity for organized crime to get at 
politicians.  There is the instrument of blackmail.  I believe 
that there have even been instances where politicians in this 
parliament have been physically threatened.  That is possible. 
One can have one's family physically threatened.  I am not 
talking about the Quebecois member.  I think the problem is a bit 
more general than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot allow that to happen.  If there is to be a 
consultation paper that seeks to put in place new penalties or 
new laws preventing the intimidation of people in the criminal 
justice system, then those penalties, those new innovations, 
those initiatives, should apply also to journalists and 
politicians because there is no doubt about the seriousness of 
what has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome this debate.  I am just a little saddened that members 
of the Bloc Quebecois do not appreciate that they allow the 
criminals to stampede the politicians into passing laws.  That is 
what they are proposing, the notwithstanding clause to circumvent 
the constitution so that in one particular instance somebody can 
be arrested because they are wearing a Hell's Angels jacket. That 
is unacceptable, because if we had a law like that it could be 
used by another government against a separatist party or against 
any other kind of organization, the flavour of the time 
shall we say, decided was a threat to peace, order and good 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must never allow that to happen. The final analysis 
is that when we allow criminals to diminish our fundamental 
rights and freedoms then crime wins. 
<P><A NAME="LINK292"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his words tonight.  I 
certainly understand what he is saying, particularly with respect 
to organized crime.  When we hit the pocketbook, touch the 
financial resources, it will hurt and have an effect.  There is 
no doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really concerned that the member alluded to an incident 
where a journalist was shot and that there was a knee-jerk 
reaction.  Over just a short period of time over 150 people in 
Quebec alone have died at the hands of organized criminals. These 
include not only gang members but also innocent bystanders. That 
is just in Quebec.  That is not to mention what has happened 
across the country in many other areas where people have died. 
That is not to mention the hundreds and hundreds of young people, 
the most vulnerable, who have died of drug overdoses, who have 
been hired by organized crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT148"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is violence galore.  I do not think we can ignore the 
fact that violence is prevalent and that people are dying.  It is 
not a knee-jerk reaction to one incident.  When is somebody 
going to wake up, take the bull by the horns and say that is 
enough? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe it will infringe on the rights to belong to an 
organization, providing that organization is definitely connected 
to all these problems.  There might be even another one and 
another one.  I really think that the hon. member is missing the 
boat by simply saying that taking away all the methods of earning 
money will be the answer.  I think it has to be a combination. We 
have to start acting like we mean business.  Maybe it would be a 
drastic measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that we want to protect the liberties we are used to, 
the things to which we are so accustomed.  All of us want that. 
It was not the politicians.  It was not Mr. Trudeau and the 
charter of rights that brought in all these liberties.  It was 
the soldier over many years of protecting the country.  That is 
what brought us all these freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest a lot of these soldiers who died in wars to 
protect the freedoms we have would be turning over in their 
graves knowing how many people are being pulverized by these 
criminals.  Sooner or later we must get a little stronger in our 
thinking, other than what can we do to break the backs of their 
economy.  That is part of it, but in the meantime there will be 
an awful lot of violence to prevent that.  What are we to do 
about that combined complex problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, so we invoke the 
notwithstanding clause and we pass legislation that makes it a 
crime to belong to Hell's Angels, for example.  What if Hell's 
Angels organizers or the real Hell's Angels grab some kids off 
the street and say “Wear this jacket with Hell's Angels on it?” 
The kid is going to wear the jacket because he is going to know 
that if he does not wear the jacket he is going to be beat up and 
then he is going to be arrested by the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you not see, Mr. Speaker, how simple it is to destroy that 
very principle?  We are talking about sophisticated criminals.  I 
suspect, as a matter of fact I am sure, that the head of the 
Hell's Angels is somewhere over in Taiwan or out in the Indian 
Ocean.  Organized crime is a vast octopus even though the all 
powerful President Clinton cannot get a grip on where the 
leadership is coming from.  It is just like a bad James Bond 
novel.  They will be clever enough that they will embarrass this 
government and they will embarrass this country so much that if 
we actually restrict the liberties they will make sure the 
people we grab will be the innocent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I ask the member opposite, who cannot reply because it will 
not be his turn, is what he will do then if we circumvent the 
constitution, if we erode a fundamental right and we put innocent 
people in jail, and the Hell's Angels and the other motorcycle 
gangs go on in their lovely gun running, drug businesses as 
before? It is not the answer.  It is the abyss and we must not 
step into it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK293"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate having the opportunity to address the 
debate tonight.  I appreciate the hon. member across the way for 
staying as late as it is and hearing what I have to say.  At 
least we have one over there.  If it is all the same, I will go 
by the rule of Ecclesiastes where it says “The heart of the wise 
looks to the right and the heart of a fool to the left”.  I am 
going to look directly at you, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start by saying that the hon. member is talking 
about some very hypothetical situations:  what if, what if, and I 
can understand why he would do that.  There is a lot of 
situations that are rather hypothetical in what would happen. 
Nevertheless, it is not addressing the problem.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure I will get a reaction from the hon. member by making a 
couple of comments.  There is no doubt in my mind, I say 
unequivocally, that the charter of rights has set up many 
barriers to accomplishing good judicial answers in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concur with the Quebec minister of public security that the 
federal anti-gang laws are too complex.  They are costly and 
timid in stopping the province's brazen motorcyle gangs.  It is a 
charter of rights involving freedom of association.  It should be 
temporarily suspended in cases of suspected organized criminal 
activity.  I am sick and tired of criminal rights superseding the 
collective rights of law-abiding citizens.  I think on this point 
Canadians would agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to Supreme Court Judge L'Heureux-Dubé's 1997 comments in 
response to the Feeney case.  In her dissenting opinion Justice 
L'Heureux-Dubé suggested that now that the charter was 15 years 
old it might be time to reassess the balance courts construct 
between protecting the individual rights of the accused and 
preserving society's capacity to protect its most vulnerable 
members and to expose the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the most vulnerable members I think of the young 
people.  I think of the number of funerals I attended of students 
who died from drugs when I taught high school for 22 years back 
in the eighties and early nineties.  It was all part of this 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time we opened up the debate the judge is suggesting. 
We should determine whether or not the charter of rights should 
be extended to those convicted of committing a crime.  I am 
confident that the charter of rights should be reserved for 
law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic rights belong there: the right to a fair trial with an 
assumption of innocence until proven guilty and the right to an 
attorney.  All basic rights have to be there but once convicted 
how far will we allow the charter to apply to those convicted 
people?  It constantly puts up barriers and has created the very 
victims groups the other hon. member mentioned several times 
tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victims groups exist because they are not happy with the 
justice that has been prevailing in the land.  CAVEAT, CRY and 
all such organizations which represent thousands and thousands of 
Canadians did not organize because they were happy with the 
justice system.  It was just the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next item that bothers me is the ongoing rhetoric about how 
we have given the tools to the police and done all the wonderful 
things we need to do in order to help them fight crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a press release of September 15, 2000, about three days 
ago.  Its leading comments are “Less Talk, More Action, Says 
Canadian Police Association”.  It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“This week's shooting of Montreal journalist Michel Auger is yet 
another example of the scourge of organized crime in our 
communities”, says David Griffin, Executive Officer of the 
30,000 member Canadian Police Association.  “While organized 
criminals conduct their activities with virtual immunity, police 
are increasingly frustrated and thwarted in their efforts to 
fight back, due to weak laws, lack of tools, and a woeful lack of 
the necessary resources”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is their press release.  It is not mine yet I have heard 
rhetoric all night about what wonderful things they have done. 
According to this press release it is nonsense.  It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Canada has gained third world status as a haven for organized 
criminals,” said Griffin.  “The attack on Mr. Auger is just the 
latest example of the violence and intimidation tactics used by 
these gangsters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our democratic institutions are being threatened by the influence 
of global criminals.  Two Quebec prison guards were murdered, a 
Member of Parliament and his family were under police protection 
last fall after the member spoke out, and now a member of the 
media has been gunned down in an apparent attempt to muzzle his 
voice.  While politicians at all levels continue to point fingers 
in other directions or promise to do more, the reality on the 
frontlines is that we are barely fielding a team”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, this is the Canadian Police Association.  It is not 
the Canadian Alliance saying that.  It says that this government 
constantly insists that it has given all the tools necessary to 
do the job.  This press release of three days ago is very 
contradictory to those comments. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the national and international attention that has been 
drawn to this issue, the Government of Canada has done little to 
bolster enforcement in order to keep pace with sophisticated 
organized criminals...We have weak laws, weak budgets, weak 
technology and little support.  Our front-line officers are 
extremely demoralized.  On the other hand, organized criminals 
have billions of dollars at their disposal and are literally 
banking on the lack of enforcement resources to track their 
movements. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enough of the rhetoric about how much we are doing to help our 
police force get the job done that they need to do.  Let us take 
a look at the latest report of the Criminal Intelligence Service 
of Canada which stated, as reported in the <I>Hill Times</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtually every major criminal group in the world is active in 
this country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article goes on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, RCMP Superintendent Ben Soave, who heads the 
Toronto-based organized crime squad, warned organized crime 
groups are trying to corrupt politicians and police with bribes 
and blackmail.  They are a threat to our national security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other countries this statement would have been sufficient to 
appoint a royal commission in order to find a solution to this 
dangerous problem.  Sadly, not in Canada where politicians sit 
idly by. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another government organization is saying that this government 
continually insists that we are happy with the situation.  Those 
are their words, not mine.  This is their press release.  It is 
not mine.  Hon. members can point their fingers at this party all 
they want to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members should hear this factual story from the Ottawa 
<I>Sun</I> of April 25, 1999.  I will read it to them. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police began tracking the 30-metre 
pleasure yacht named the Blue Dawn in October of 1997, when 
it sailed east across the Atlantic Ocean from the quaint Nova 
Scotia town of Lunenburg...More than 150 officers had worked 
thousands of extra hours on the investigation, which would become 
the largest drug bust in British Columbia history.  But as the 
Blue Dawn waited some 400 miles off the B.C. coast in the 
chilly November air to transfer its treasure of Pakistani hashish 
onto a smaller vessel, the long and complex RCMP drug sting 
suddenly hit a snag...we had to tell our officers that they 
couldn't be paid.  There was just no money around to do it.  We 
told them they could complete the operation, but they wouldn't be 
paid for it...to their credit, (the officers) decided to complete 
the operation without pay...Had the officers decided not to 
proceed with the bust, however, nearly 15 tonnes of hash destined 
for the large cities of eastern Canada would have entered the 
country...the Blue Dawn was not the first time officers 
were forced to donate their time.  And I don't know how much 
longer their dedication to busting criminals will carry thus 
through this financial crisis we're under. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking them to do that for nothing?  That is a fact. 
Check it out.  Do not take my word for it.  Ask the police about 
the Blue Dawn, the big sting and all the donated time by 
police because we have not got the money to pay for it.  It is 
strange that we have money for all kinds of silliness.  When we 
look at the public accounts and the way they spend money on that 
side of the House, it drives us nuts, yet they cannot afford to 
pay the police in a major sting operation.  What is going on?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To talk about all these problems is not any good without 
suggesting some solutions.  Let me try. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the 
anti-gang legislation enacted in 1997.  I think there was one 
conviction but I understand that through plea bargaining that was 
thrown out; one conviction since 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, review the effectiveness of the proceeds of crime 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, improve the ability of the police to investigate money 
laundering and introduce legislation creating new financial 
reporting requirements for banks regarding suspicious 
transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, significantly increase penalties for drug smuggling and 
trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, amend the criminal code to include a penalty for 
contributing to the delinquency of a minor, for people who use 
minors for drug trafficking and for prostitution.  It is high 
time we socked it to them.  Instead we do nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, increase surveillance and controls along the borders, at 
ports in Canadian waters and abroad.  I stood at the Canadian 
port in Port Erie and asked the guards what were in the boats 
that were coming across.  They said they did not know for sure. 
I asked if they had any idea what they might be.  They said that 
if it was one level, it was probably cigarettes.  At another 
level it was probably booze.  At another level it was 
probably people.  If it was at another level it could be guns. 
Who stops them?  Nobody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I watched the boats go the other way to the U.S.  Guess what? 
They did not get half way across the water.  There was a patrol 
that stopped all of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh, increase the sophisticated technology to better detect 
drug shipments.  Do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighth, create a special investigative and tactical unit 
comprised of RCMP, Customs Canada, national defence, CSIS, solely 
used for combatting organized crime.  Do those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been in for seven years.  Organized crime has 
been here longer than that.  It has done nothing except implement 
the anti-gang thing in 1997 which did not accomplish a thing. 
That is what it has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Absolutely rubbish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  The member says “absolutely rubbish”. 
The government has done nothing else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on with stories from prison guards who talk 
about those who have been shot at or who are being threatened. 
Their families are being threatened in their homes and they are 
afraid to react against the gang activities in the penitentiaries 
because of the dangers it imposes upon their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put up a drug detector machine, a fancy several million 
dollar machine.  I forget what it is called but it has a name. 
They put that machine in the penitentiaries.  I have been to 
practically every penitentiary in the country and to many of them 
several times, visiting of course.  I have always insisted that I 
should go through this drug machine.  I am very fortunate that I 
passed all the time.  I asked who was tested by the machine.  I 
was told that the guards, the people who worked there, the 
volunteers and the lawyers who work for the inmates were not, but 
the visitors were.  Guess what they told me at one penitentiary 
when I asked what it did when drugs were detected on a visitor? 
The answer was “Go home, clean up and try again tomorrow”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of regulation is that?  That is what they are telling 
me in the penitentiaries.  Then we wonder why drugs are so 
heavily prevalent in these penitentiaries.  There are more drugs 
inside the prisons than there are on the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really tired of the constant rhetoric that comes from that 
side of the House about the wonderful things that the government 
has done.  Yet the problem goes on and on.  One member would say 
“rubbish, it does not”.  Talk to all the victims of people who 
have died from these kinds of activities.  There are thousands of 
them.  It is not so easy to see when the only thing the member 
does in the House is jump from seat to seat to get camera 
attention.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is late and I do not want to keep us here any longer than we 
have to.  There is one more thing that I want to say.  I want to 
quote from an article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> from RCMP 
Commissioner Philip Murray who retired not too long ago.  He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime in Canada is now so pervasive that police have 
been reduced to putting out isolated fires in a blazing 
underworld economy. Canada is particularly vulnerable to drug 
trafficking, the principal source of revenue for most organized 
crime groups, according to the Drug Analysis Section of the RCMP. 
Smugglers are attracted to Canada because of the low risk of 
arrest due to limited police resources that have stymied 
investigations, relatively light penalties and our sprawling, 
largely unmonitored borders. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these comments are coming from police commissioners, the 
police association, prison guards, victims, the cries from Quebec 
and the number of lives that are lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can somebody suggest to me that the charter is not a barrier to 
good justice in this land?  I would suggest that it is time to 
review that statement. It is time to open up that debate.  Let us 
not protect this document to the point that it allows all of 
these problems to continue to exist.  Let us heed the words of 
the supreme court justice who said it is time to review this 
after 15 years.  Is it having the effect of its intent when it 
was brought into being? I am not going to attack it and I do not 
think the hon. member across the way would attack it, but I think 
he would be willing to discuss it and see if we can improve it. 
At no time do I believe for a moment that Prime Minister Trudeau 
intended this document to be a political protective paper for the 
worst criminals of all kind.  I do not think he intended that, 
but it is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces do their best.  Alberta passed legislation to take 
11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 year old prostitutes off the streets of its 
cities.  Not to arrest them, not to convict them, but to get them 
off the streets and try to help them. A complaint was laid and it 
was determined by our courts that under the charter of rights it 
is unconstitutional to do that. If my hon. colleague and I were 
driving down the street and we saw an 11 year old girl on the 
street prostituting and we did not try to help her get off the 
street, I would be disgusted with him and I am sure he would be 
disgusted with me. That is what they are trying to do and we are 
letting a document such as this stop that kind of activity. That 
cannot continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will let the courts decide that it is okay for a 56 year old 
man to own, possess and enjoy child pornography. It was only 
going to be a temporary thing.  It would not take long.  We are 
still waiting two years later.  Why?  Because of one document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I love Canada.  I love our freedoms.  I have the greatest 
respect and regard for the soldiers who died to build and protect 
those freedoms.  If we are ever going to lose any freedoms, it is 
because of our failure as parliamentarians to implement the most 
elemental duty that we have, and that is to provide protection 
for the safety of our citizens.  We had better start doing it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, It is a 
pleasure to actually stand here in the House and represent them 
and have them formally named each time that I do stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite, the member for Wild Rose, spoke 
excellently.  I think he came up with a number of very good 
suggestions on how we could stiffen the laws to get at organized 
crime.  However, I invite him to review his own words in 
<I>Hansard</I> tomorrow and he will find that nowhere in his 
speech did he actually make an argument for using the 
notwithstanding clause to adjust the constitution or the charter 
of rights to limit association, to make it a crime to join 
motorcycle gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The closest he came to a criticism of the constitution was when 
he brought up the issue, as he alluded to it before, of the child 
prostitution legislation that was attempted in Alberta.  I am 
absolutely on the same wavelength with him there.  I think it was 
good legislation and it should have survived but it was overruled 
by an interpretation of a lower court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think if he really thinks about it, the member for Wild Rose 
will realize that the problem is not the constitution.  The 
problem is the interpretation of the constitution that is taken 
in varying forms by the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get his reaction here because we are having a 
debate in which we have an opportunity to put forward novel 
suggestions.  I think one of the problems that has bedevilled us 
as a society since the constitution came in and since the charter 
of rights came in is that there have been interpretations of the 
charter that we as parliamentarians know, from our own feelings, 
from contacts with our constituents and from our own sense of the 
nation, are sometimes not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would suggest to the House is that one of the reasons why 
we get this feeling is that we are never invited to appear before 
the courts for these interpretations.  We make the laws but we 
never have the opportunity to explain to the courts what we mean 
by the laws.  We never get to go before those courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to respond to this right now.  When there 
is a challenge before the supreme court, the justice department 
sends lawyers. I am not always sure that our justice department 
can advocate for the laws we pass in the way that I would wish, 
as indeed, Mr. Speaker, in our debates here, I often find myself 
at odds with our own justice department.  Would he think that it 
might be a good innovation, a good initiative, if we brought more 
lawyers into the House of Commons so the House of Commons lawyers 
could advocate on behalf of parliamentarians?  It is this place, 
parliament, that creates the laws, not government.  It is a myth 
that it is government.  Government brings them in and they go 
forward but in the end it is the vote of the parliamentarians 
here that determines the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts never hear the opposition arguments when legislation 
goes through.  They only see one side.  Unfortunately, as it 
stands now only the government advocates on issues pertaining to 
interpretations of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the member opposite and all opposition 
parties should get on side and pressure the government, pressure 
the Board of Internal Economy and pressure the Speaker to create 
more lawyers in this House to sit at that table who would act for 
we parliamentarians and advocate for the interpretations of the 
legislation for us on all sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then perhaps someone can say that maybe the charter should not 
apply to children in this circumstance. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, if I 
had an opportunity to plead before that court, I would say that 
my intention as a parliamentarian is never to put children at 
risk in that context.  The charter was never intended to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I cannot do it alone.  We need to have another voice in 
interpreting the charter.  It is not the words that are the 
problem.  If you start monkeying around with the words, Mr. 
Speaker, you will get into trouble.  That is exactly what Hitler 
and Stalin did.  They limited the right of association and that 
is how we got the night of the long knives or the night of the 
broken glass.  That is how we got the genocides in the Ukraine. 
We cannot do that.  We cannot limit the words of the constitution 
but we can certainly try to get parliament represented when 
interpretations of the constitution are going forward in the 
courts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was going to take 
notes but that was a fairly lengthy thing to which I do not know 
how to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add to the hon. member's words about what 
happened in terms of Stalin and Hitler.  I also remember the 
registration and confiscation of guns along with all the rest of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of things the member said that really 
frightened me.  The first one was that we need more lawyers in 
this place.  That is a little frightening to me.  I know what he 
is talking about.  He is not talking about sitting in the seats 
there but about sitting in the lawyers pew.  I do not think that 
would work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member has gone through creating a private 
member's bill.  I have gone through several of them now and I 
find it really frustrating when the bill keeps coming back and we 
have to do more work or when it does not meet the charter test. I 
do not have the expertise on just exactly how to word a bill in 
order to make it pass the test.  We say to those who are supposed 
to be able to do that “This is what I mean. This is what we want 
to happen with this bill”, but very few bills make it.  In fact, 
how many pieces of legislation have been rejected at the level we 
now have available to us because we feared it would not meet the 
charter test? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to visit the courts with the hon. member some time 
on a bill that we can agree on—and I am sure we might find 
one—and say “This is the intent of the bill.  What is wrong 
with it?  What can we do to prevent it from ever being 
challenged?”  We cannot do that.  It cannot happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a lower court that made the decision in the pornography 
case but it is now before the Supreme Court of Canada.  We keep 
saying “Let the process work”.  How many times do we have to 
continue to do this to protect those people who are a menace to 
our society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians are really tired of that procedure and we need 
to look at better ways of delivering justice.  We need to stop 
the barriers in the charter that have allowed this to happen. I 
do think it is a good one to debate but we could not debate it in 
this place without being called an extremist, a racist or all the 
other garbage that keeps flowing over.  The Liberals do not know 
how to debate.  They only know how to call names.  When will that 
ever end?  I doubt if it ever will.  As long as we have fools in 
here it will never happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK295"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member very well.  I 
have travelled with him to a number of prisons.  I know the hon. 
member was contacted by the Metis Association with regard to gang 
controlled child prostitution in Winnipeg.  I would like him to 
comment a little bit on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a comment a few minutes ago from the other side about 
judges interpreting the charter.  If judges are allowed to 
interpret the charter is there not something weak in the charter? 
Should it not be up to us as parliamentarians, particularly the 
government, to close any loopholes in interpreting the charter? 
Why should the charter be open to interpretation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it amazing that 
the basic ideas and principles behind establishing a document of 
rights is necessary to be open to interpretation.  I think that 
is absolutely a waste of time.  I do think that the intent of any 
document should be clearly illustrated.  If it does take better 
wording, then let us do it.  However, I do not think we have any 
trouble with the intent of the legislation. 
We should go at it and do it in that fashion but it is very 
difficult in a partisan setting.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the Winnipeg problem goes, it is a shame to see the 
number of under age, under 18 gangs running around the city 
wearing jackets to be identified.  They are responsible for home 
invasions and causing a lot of grief but our hands are tied and 
they should not be.  We could do something about it but we need 
the courage and the fortitude to do it, which is something this 
government is lacking.

<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
understand there will be only one other speaker after me in this 
debate, barring any last minute changes. I am saying this for 
the benefit of our security people, those who work in the 
cafeteria and our pages, who just started working today. Surely 
they will find it was a rather hard day's work. I want to assure 
them that it is unusual for the House to sit until 12.30 a.m. on 
a Monday night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not want to miss tonight's debate even though today's 
legislative menu was rather substantial. 
In 1996, as the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, I was the first 
member to introduce an anti-gang bill. The government used 80% of 
my bill in its own legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention this because in 1997 we were all convinced that we 
were doing the right thing. It was not a partisan debate. The 
Canadian Alliance, the Progressive Conservative Party, the NDP, 
the Bloc Quebecois and the government acted quickly to pass that 
bill. We did it in two days, which is rather exceptional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a climate of terror at that time. 
In 1995, in my riding of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, a car bombing had 
claimed the life of an 11-year old boy, Daniel Desrochers. At the 
same time, biker gangs were trying out a new strategy based on 
intimidation of the people within our justice system. Some 
people had been shot to death in our prisons. More importantly, 
for the first time in our history, biker gangs were using 
explosives on a large scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why Bill C-95 contained nine very important provisions. 
The first one—I will list them rapidly—was to create a “criminal 
organization offence”, which we included in the criminal code, 
whereby profiting from a crime or committing a crime for the 
benefit of a criminal organization was a new offence punishable 
by a 14 year sentence. Possession of an explosive substance was 
also liable to imprisonment for 14 years. There was an 
obligation for the solicitor general to report to the House once 
a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was another extremely important provision which I will 
have the opportunity to come back to: the possibility of 
obtaining from a judge wiretapping warrants for more than three 
months, from three months to one year, in fact. 
This provision was welcomed by the judiciary community as it 
hampered investigations to have a warrant for one or two months 
and then to have to go to court to ask for an extension. At the 
time, the legislator was extremely well-advised to allow 
wiretapping warrants for one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were also more generous provisions concerning searches 
and, of course, allowing a judge to subpoena individuals where 
there were reasonable grounds to fear that they would commit a 
crime, to issue probation orders, and to order them to keep the 
peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-95 was good legislation. I am convinced that, as 
parliamentarians, we went as far as we could in view of the 
information we had.

<A HREF="#LINKT156"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-95 contained another feature, that is to not allow a 
criminal sentenced for gangsterism to be paroled before having 
served half of his sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to remind the House tonight is that we must 
talk about these issues with serenity, of course. We must talk 
about these issues on the basis of all the information available 
to us and we must do so in a non partisan manner. We in the 
Bloc Quebecois are all doing this and I am convinced that our 
government colleagues are doing the same thing because the 
lives of our fellow citizens are at stake. And it is more 
fundamentally the way in which we want to see democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not possible for us to be members of parliament while 
outside, in communities, there are people who get away with 
bearing the colours of the Hell's Angels, the Rock Machine or 
any another criminal biker gang, and these people can make 
terror reign in communities. It is not possible that, year 
after year in February, we pass a budget, parliament's budget, 
and that, parallel to this an underground economy is put in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members that the underground economy, the activity 
of the underworld on the Canadian territory, is estimated at 
$200 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the debate to proceed with serenity as much as I am 
convinced that we must act quickly. We do not have much time in 
front of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 when we passed the anti-gang bill we took stock of the 
state of the underworld at the time and especially the 
criminalized biker gangs. Everything has changed since then. As 
parliamentarians, we should know that as long as we do not 
outlaw criminalized biker gangs, our legislation will have an 
extremely limited impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that? It is because the underworld is very dynamic, well 
informed, extremely rich and powerful. We should be talking 
about the way the underworld operates in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-95, which created a new offence concerning gangs 
activities, prescribed three things. The organization had to 
have at least five members. It had to have committed five crimes 
punishable by five years in prison, under the criminal code, in 
the last five years. 
What did the underworld, the Hell's Angels and other 
criminalized biker gangs do to circumvent this new provision? 
They made sure those who committed offences associated with 
gangs by planting bombs, killing people and benefiting from the 
underground economy did not have a criminal record. 
People who did not have a criminal record or previous sentences 
under the terms of section 487.1 could not be brought to court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, we should give serious thought to the fact 
that since 1997 not a single crown attorney in Winnipeg, 
Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick or Newfoundland has 
succeeded in getting a conviction under that provision. And that 
is not because of a lack of skill, hard work or knowledge of 
the law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of the attorneys was able to lay a charge so there was no 
trial in Canada and therefore no sentence, since no charges 
were laid. This is the worst part about the way organized crime 
operates in the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not mean we should throw in the towel and capitulate. 
Fatalism would then be our worse enemy.  It means we must 
seriously consider invoking the notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we consider using this clause?  Because we have 
considerably amended the laws over time.  We amended the 
criminal code at least eight times. 
And they were not minor cosmetic changes or marginal amendments. 
We substantially amended the criminal code and therefore our 
criminal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We amended the Witness Protection Act to ensure better 
protection for informants.  We know quite well that, in the area 
of criminal activity it is impossible to complete an 
investigation without some kind of co-operation, without the help 
of informants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We modified the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act to 
withdraw the $1,000 bill from circulation. If we were to ask 
police officers or those present in the House how many have a 
$1,000 bill in their pocket, very few would raise their hand. 
Casinos, travel agencies and people doing cross-border trade were 
compelled to report suspicious transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On eight occasions extremely significant amendments were made 
to the criminal code. Despite all that, organized crime has 
never been as powerful as it is now. This is why it would be 
very unwise to refuse to consider invoking the notwithstanding 
clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind hon. members that the notwithstanding clause is 
a legitimate one. We are not breaking the law and we are not 
violating the constitution by using the notwithstanding clause. 
Under the Constitution Act, 1982, we can restrict some freedoms 
that are considered fundamental, but not just any one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, we could not restrict the judiciary guarantees 
provided for in sections 7 to 14 of the act; we could not limit 
language rights nor mobility rights. But very conveniently it 
was provided in the Constitution Act, 1982, that under certain 
extreme circumstances we could limit freedom of association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely what this is all about. The Bloc Quebecois, 
the Fédération prpofessionnelle des journalistes du Québec, as 
well as other intermediary bodies asked the government to create 
an offence of association. Thus, membership in a gang such as 
the Hell's Angels, the Rock Machines or any other criminal group 
known to the RCMP or CSIS would be forbidden by the legislation. 
Membership in those gangs, working for them or acting in such a 
way as to making them richer and benefiting from membership in 
those gangs would be forbidden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the objective of the legislation?  It is not merely gang 
membership.  If members of the Hell's Angels, the Rock Machine, 
the Bandidos or any of the others joined together to do sports 
or some other activity, as legislators we would not be 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very well that these people are joined together for 
illegal gains.  What must be banned is membership in these biker 
gangs, linked with illegal gains, and thus with the acquisition 
of property, and of course the laundering of the proceeds of 
crime.  I do not believe that there is anything excessive in 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, the notwithstanding clause needs to be renewed 
after five years of use.  We could very well use the 
notwithstanding clause. 
I sincerely believe that the bill must define the gangs 
currently referred to.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“In particular” could very easily be added, along the lines of 
section 15 of the 1982 Constitution Act.  Some may say “Yes, but 
if an explicit reference is made in a bill to the Hell's Angels, 
the Rock Machine, the Dark Circle, or any other biker gang, they 
are just going to reorganize under another name”.  If they did 
so, but continued the same type of activities, recourse to the 
phrase “in particular” would enable us to prosecute them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the question we need to ask ourselves is this: If we 
do not act now, how far is this going to go?  We are familiar 
with the strategy used by the biker gangs. 
They began by infiltrating the economy.  Then they infiltrated 
major law firms, followed by major accounting firms.  In the 
last three years they have deliberately set out to intimidate 
the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After that it is very probable that the 
strategy of intimidation will extend to judges.  They could very 
well go after a judge, a parliamentarian and finally a head of 
state.  If we do not take tough action immediately, we can bet 
that there will be no limits on their strategy.  As we know, 
these people are driven by the desire for gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I repeat, we must act quickly, with vigilance and 
diligence.  There are enough good jurists and the legal 
community has enough talent and experience to come up with a 
bill whose wording is sufficiently precise to allow us to 
achieve the goals we seek. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois wishes to work together with all the 
opposition parties.  In the past, when we made gains in the 
struggle against organized crime it was because we worked in a 
very consensual manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking back to when the bill on the collection of DNA 
material was passed.  It was when young Tara Manning had been 
brutally murdered and all parties in the House worked together 
in a very mature manner.  That was how gains were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I will say that the best thing we can do for the 
security of our communities, for our senior citizens, for our 
young people who are listening to us tonight and waiting for us 
to take concrete action, is to recognize, with all the serenity 
that must characterize our decision making, that we are now at a 
point where the only way we will win the war against organized 
crime is by invoking the exemption clause, which is a legitimate 
clause, a tool that exists in the constitution of 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After having struck down the leaders of organized crime we will 
be able, in a few years, to re-examine the situation. I am 
convinced that we will win the battle against organized crime 
and once that has been done, it will be much easier for 
our fellow citizens to reconcile themselves with our democratic 
institutions and to have confidence in our decision-making 
process and, hence, in our parliamentary process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to 
participate in the debate tonight. We are debating the issue of 
organized crime and what Canadians want the federal government to 
do to fight organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of Canadians watching this debate, I am honoured 
to represent the Canadian Alliance as a recently appointed member 
of the subcommittee on organized crime which is currently 
conducting in camera hearings.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Committee members are under a gag order that the Liberal 
dominated committee has insisted on applying.  Therefore, I will 
be careful not to violate that order in my remarks tonight.  I 
will not be able to say certain things which I may have been 
tempted to say otherwise.  I will also be careful not to point 
fingers at any organized groups or organizations.  I will be 
diligent not to reveal any proceedings nor compromise the secrecy 
or security of the witnesses appearing before the subcommittee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can declare that this committee is a facade. My constituents 
and I and most Canadians are used to this kind of inaction by the 
weak Liberal government.  After seven years of being in power the 
government has finally created this committee to investigate 
organized crime.  Where has the government been for the last 
seven years?  Did it not know about the magnitude of organized 
crime? The government struck this committee simply because we are 
on the eve of the next election and the Liberals want to be able 
to say that they have done something about organized crime. What 
a sham. By the time the committee submits a report it will be too 
late for the government to do anything about it because the 
Liberals will not form the government after the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight our brothers and sisters from Quebec are demanding that 
the government do something before October 6 of this year. As 
everyone knows, last week in Quebec there was a brutal organized 
crime related shooting of a journalist, the well known crime 
reporter Michel Auger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry to say that this tired, weak, arrogant Liberal 
government that lacks vision will not be responding to Quebec's 
plea for immediate action against organized crime. The hearts of 
the people of Surrey Central go out to the people of Quebec. 
They have our sympathy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the committee does good work. I wish it could work fast 
and that we could get on with the work of combating organized 
crime and its effect on our society.  Organized crime in Canada 
takes many forms and is flourishing due to mismanagement and lack 
of vision and action by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International drug cartels use Canada as a point of transit for 
distribution of their illicit and life destroying products. There 
are many cross-border issues that bring organized crime into our 
country, including our close proximity to the U.S. and our lax 
laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no clear, precise definition of organized crime. It 
includes money laundering, drugs, weapons and commodities 
smuggling, counterfeit currency, credit cards, passports and fake 
identification, telemarketing, loan sharking, insurance fraud, 
theft, human smuggling, prostitution, extortion, home invasion 
and trafficking in stolen goods.  These are all areas within the 
purview of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corruption in our industries and political corruption in 
particular are the result crime that is highly organized and 
aimed at achieving the corruption of our public officials and the 
captains of our industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violence is a byproduct of organized crime.  It is a trap that 
criminals use to get what they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost to society is huge.  According to a CSIS report 
released in December 1998 it is estimated that the Canadian 
economy lost $14.8 billion to international organized crime.  The 
underground economy is big. It is a threat to our society and a 
threat to civilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion it is almost a national emergency. It is already 
late.  The government should have taken solid action many years 
ago. 
For many years our governments were asleep at the wheel.  The 
various Liberal and Tory governments failed to realize and even 
acknowledge the problem of organized crime, let alone the action 
plan to counter it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If politicians in our country deny or downplay the importance of 
organized crime and refuse to talk about it publicly because it 
may antagonize an ethnic community, or because it may upset the 
image of Canada or a province or a city as a crime free area, 
then organized crime has a licence to do what it pleases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the evidence, the infrequent official Canadian 
commissions into organized crime in the 1960s and 1970s all 
concluded that organized crime did not exist in Canada.  It was 
not until the 1977 report of the commission of inquiry on 
organized crime that the concept was finally documented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A CBC program in June 1977 provided Canadians with six hours of 
television about the mafia and triads in Canada, which finally 
brought the topic into the open for the general public.  Since 
then, none of the Liberal or Tory governments have taken any 
concrete action to curb it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our current Prime Minister believes in a don't worry, be happy 
policy.  Organized crime seems to be a campaign issue in the next 
election.  The government is soft on crime in our foreign 
missions and is weak in control and management of every 
department.  We regularly read about it in the newspapers these 
days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in British Columbia, my constituents always watch 
for and pay close attention to excellent new articles by Fabian 
Dawson of the Vancouver <I>Province</I> newspaper.  He has been 
diligent in chronicling the evidence and details of incidents of 
abuse totalling millions of dollars in over a dozen Canadian 
missions abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada had about 2,000 blank visa forms allegedly stolen from 
our Hong Kong office.  By failing to deal with corruption in our 
foreign missions, the government is providing a means for 
criminal entry into Canada and has hung a welcome sign on 
Canada's back door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is 788 files containing sensitive background 
information on businessmen and criminals have been deleted from 
the computer assisted immigration processing system in order to 
allow undesirable people and people who otherwise would not 
qualify to enter Canada.  The files will be altered simply to 
bring the criminal element back into Canada.  This information is 
given according to Brian McAdam, a former investigator and 
internationally renowned expert on triads.  McAdam also knows all 
about the so-called sidewinder investigation that has been tanked 
due to political pressure. What a bag of snakes that one is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my election I have been working with the RCMP to pursue 
reports from my constituents about harassment they receive from 
corrupt officials in Canadian offices abroad.  For example, my 
1998 report to the RCMP concerning visa scams resulted in the firing 
of local workers at Canadian missions in New Delhi, India and 
Islamabad, Pakistan.  Alleged bribes, stolen money, compromised 
interests of officials, and corruption from locally hired staff 
in many of our foreign missions is left unaddressed by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal element is now light years ahead of our law 
enforcement agencies. 
They have state of the art equipment because they have no 
shortages of resources.  They have unlimited money at their 
disposal.  They continue to exploit the lack of action.  That is 
typical of the Liberal government's poor record in preventing 
corruption to begin with and getting to the bottom of it once 
detected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government gives terrorists and organized criminals their 
tax free status in Canada.  About 50 so-called terrorist 
organizations enjoy tax free status according to CSIS. Taxpayers, 
through our federal government, are helping terrorists and 
organized criminals to send money to finance weapons acquisitions 
to commit terrorist activities in other countries. Even the 
federal ministers help them raise funds by attending their 
fundraisers.  These things are public knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring before the House rose for the summer recess I met 
with a group of Tamils who came to Parliament Hill. There was a 
huge number of people.  There was a big gathering, a rally.  I 
passed to the Prime Minister the petition they brought with them 
calling on the government to go forward with Canada's recent 
agreement to support the United Nations declaration to fight 
terrorism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At about the same time Canada Post was scrambling to try to 
prevent a so-called vanity stamp of a Tamil tiger from being 
released.  A stamp had already been issued to a Tamil tiger 
supporter even though that person was deceased before the stamp 
was issued which is contrary to vanity stamp guidelines.  As it 
happened, by mismanagement of our federal government our 
departments were not working hand in hand. Foreign affairs could 
have shared with Canada Post the details or pictures of 
individuals being proposed for vanity stamps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst criminal element already considers Canada a haven due 
to the lenient criminal justice system operated by the Liberals. 
Why is it that the Liberals only means of detecting criminal 
activity at our foreign missions and HRDC is through routine 
audits?  The Liberals refuse to implement a system of 
self-detection and self-correction in the operation of Canadian 
offices in foreign lands.  Indeed, they apply a cover-up 
mentality to internal audits that reveal serious and daunting 
information concerning abuses.  They try to hush up and discredit 
information pertaining to mismanagement.  The Liberals should not 
rely on the media or members of parliament and whistleblowers to 
protect Canadian interests and the loss of taxpayer dollars to 
the criminal element operating in foreign nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, they seek to punish whistleblowers who come forward 
with information to help correct the system, save taxpayers' 
money, protect our sovereignty and territorial integrity.  I am 
prepared to table in the House very shortly a private member's 
bill entitled the whistleblower protection act.  It has been 
delayed due to translation problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my constituents and Canadians I can recommend that 
to fight the effects of organized crime our federal government 
should have an integrated approach to the various departments 
such as justice, various law enforcement agencies, immigration 
and citizenship, foreign affairs and international trade, 
defence, revenue and customs, finance, transportation, 
telecommunications, even agriculture, fisheries and oceans 
because they have vessels to patrol, the RCMP, CSIS, the passport 
office and many other departments.  This is common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also have an integrated approach at various levels of 
government, the federal government, provincial and territorial 
governments and municipal governments.  We should also have 
co-operation between politicians, the judiciary and bureaucrats. 
They should complement each other in an effort to combat 
organized crime.  Organized crime is like a cancer and its 
control should be treated like a process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should give effective legislation to our law enforcement 
agencies.  We should reduce the unnecessary paperwork load that 
keeps the hands of law enforcement agencies tied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need better wiretapping regulations to assist the agencies. 
We need to amend proceeds of crime legislation.  We need to amend 
the Immigration Act.  There is a need to review penalties for 
organized criminals and drug dealers.  We should pass legislation 
with teeth, and there should be no more revolving doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation like disclosure provisions should not be used as 
fishing expeditions by lawyers for the criminals.  Laws 
pertaining to disclosure need to be amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be working closely with our foreign allies, our 
friends and other nations that want to combat organized crime. 
There should be a high level of co-operation and sharing of 
intelligence and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime is a systemic problem rather than a bad apple 
scenario.  We have to get tough and smart.  The lazy Liberal 
government should either effectively lead or simply get out of 
the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, today I see our young promising new team of pages. I 
would like to welcome them to the House of Commons and wish them 
all the best.  Today I was the first member to speak in the House 
and I forgot at that time and now I am the last member to speak 
as well.  It was really a serious issue.  I believe that all 
members of the House contributed to this issue and we should 
effectively deal with organized crime in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK298"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have one question for the 
member opposite.  Where has he been when the government passed 
legislation with respect to additional money for CPIC?  Where has 
he been when we added additional money for the RCMP?  Where has 
he been when we bolstered the immigration services?  Where has he 
been when we have co-ordinated such so that we have CSIS and the 
RCMP reporting to immigration when it comes to organized 
criminals coming into Canada?  Where has he been when we have 
negotiated either bilateral or multilateral arrangements with 
respect to other embassies in foreign lands and with respect to 
co-operation and sharing of information?  Where has he been when 
the government has acted repeatedly with respect to organized 
crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we doing enough?  I said in my comments that no, we have to 
continue to work, continue to pull together and to meet with the 
provinces and the territorial people to find solutions that are 
beneficial for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really would like to know where the hon. member has been 
during all these times when the government has acted and 
continues to act.  It is very easy to get into the politics of 
blame, negativity and hurl things like “They are soft on 
crime”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the former chairman of the Waterloo regional police and 
having been in charge of 700 police officers, I can tell the 
House that the government is not soft on crime.  We continue to 
work hard when it comes to crime issues, when it comes to justice 
and due process, when it comes to things like safety and security 
in our communities.  That after all is fundamental to the very 
fabric of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member, with all due respect, to read what the 
government has done, brush up on the statutes and the 
legislation, take a look at the strides and efforts that we have 
made in the past little while, especially in the last seven years 
since we have been in power.  Perhaps then he will get a better 
understanding of where we are heading as a country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy for the Alliance Party opposite to always try to find 
the wedge issues or the leverage issues that tend to pit 
Canadians against Canadians, region against region, people 
against people, and group against group.  That is its raison 
d'être. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reject it as do most Canadians because that is not what Canada 
is all about.  Canada is a much better place than the Alliance 
people opposite would paint it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to address the 
issue the hon. member has raised.  He asked where I was.  I want 
to ask him where he was when organized crime was taking place in 
the streets.  Where was he when the moral of police and law 
enforcement agencies went down?  Where was he when a major drug 
dealer was deported from the country in 1995?  He changed his 
name, came back to Canada in 1997 and is still dealing drugs in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was he when he saw the revolving door and that people were 
selling drugs on east Vancouver streets?  I went for a ride along 
with the RCMP one evening.  They showed me all around the back 
alleys where the drugs were sold and the druggies were using 
them.  The system is a revolving door.  The officers told me that 
as soon as Honduran refugees on the streets see the police car 
stop they raise their arms because they know the process.  They 
will stick their tongues out because they know they have to be 
checked.  No one is talking but the action is still taking place 
because the people are used to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the member to come to the streets of east Vancouver 
where people have been dying from drug overdoses.  The dealers 
are entrenched into the system and are not legitimate refugees in 
Canada.  The officers said that when they search the people who 
are selling drugs every one of them would have a certain amount 
of money of all denominations in their pockets.  They searched 
them and it was true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The officers said that if they were to search them they will 
have a business card of only one lawyer.  We saw probably 16 of 
them.  At every corner of the street they had the business card 
of the same lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the hon. member to visit east Vancouver to see it and 
not to sit here and simply make a political attack in the House. 
I invite him to look through the lens of issues, not through the 
lens of politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been the mentality of government members that when 
opposition parties raise some issue they first ignore it.  Then 
we increase the volume and they reject the premise like the 
member is doing.  When we increase the volume even more they 
steal the ideas.  They should have vision.  They should have 
taken action on organized crime many years ago.  The Liberal and 
Tory governments time and again denied that there was any 
organized criminal activity taking place anywhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they had taken action then and had vision we would not be 
facing this problem today. Government action is many years 
behind.  It should have taken action probably 10, 15 or 20 years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is never too late but it first has to acknowledge that there 
is a problem.  The Liberals time and again throughout this debate 
have rejected and failed to acknowledge that there is any problem 
with organized crime at this moment in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a proverb in English which explains the learning 
philosophy. 
I said it in the House some time ago but I will repeat it:  He 
who knows not and knows not that he knows not can never learn. 
The person will never learn until he recognizes that he does not 
know.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the Liberal mentality.  Hon. members of the House have 
time and again given many analogies and examples and quoted many 
experts about organized crime.  Even I can quote one. Recently 
the new head of the RCMP, Commissioner Zaccardelli, said members 
of organized crime were trying to corrupt and threaten parliament 
and other Canadian institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crime is everywhere.  As I said at the beginning of my speech, I 
am a member of the subcommittee.  I heard what other members did 
not hear.  The member probably is a member of that committee and 
he was not there.  I want to ask him where he was when the 
committee was having hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker I rise on a point of order. 
For the record I want to inform the member opposite that while I 
was on the organized crime subcommittee and still am, I was in 
Ukraine and Russia taking a look at organized criminal 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We did not really 
need that bit of information either.  It is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I asked the hon. member 
this question because he asked me where I was.  It is important 
that we take this issue in totality and try to help Canadians and 
to help future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an integrated effort, team work.  All of us should work 
together.  This is a very serious issue.  This is no time to play 
politics or political games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There being no 
further members rising on debate, I declare the motion carried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to)

House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to
