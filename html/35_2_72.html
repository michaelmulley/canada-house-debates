	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when this 
bill first came to the House, I referred to it as being a band-aid or a 
small piece of trim on a far larger problem. My opinion remains the 
same.
<P>
	Our problem is that government after government, Liberal or 
Conservative, keep on moving forward and never really solve the 
real problems with respect to Canadian content, with respect to the 
CRTC, with respect to the CBC. I therefore recommended to my 
colleagues in the Reform Party that we begrudgingly support the 
bill.
<P>
	It was rather interesting that the result of the vote on the bill at 
second reading was that 147 of the members of the House voted in 
favour of it and only 25 voted against it.
<P>
	I listened with interest to the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage and I quote from his speech of last 
week.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-I am pleased to rise today to speak on the hon. member's bill, and would like to 
take advantage of the same opportunity to congratulate him on the effort he has put 
into it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I, and I believe most of the other members of this House, share the objective 
sought by the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambtom in introducing this bill. We all 
agree that Canadians must be able to fully express their opinion on the programs 
they receive in their homes. We all wish to ensure that that Canadian consumers 
receive the programs they want at a reasonable price.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He goes on to say very specifically:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I congratulate the hon. member for his initiative.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To suggest that statement was somewhat less than genuine might 
be best put if I read what he went on to say. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This bill would, unintentionally, restrict Canada's capacity to guarantee Canadian 
content and the availability of French programming outside of Quebec. As a 
francophone from outside Quebec, I believe that access by the regions outside 
Quebec to French programs is essential-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It would be impossible for me to support such a bill that would take away the 
flexibility of the Canadian government. That would also go for Canadian content. It 
would also go for the rural regions. It would have a negative impact right across 
Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is clear the MPs are against negative optioning. The new president of the CRTC 
has indicated that she prefers the positive option. The cable companies have 
indicated that they are against and they do not intend to use it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Why do we have laws? With due respect to the shareholders and 
the management of the cable companies, I suggest that when they 
went ahead and used negative option billing and received a 
resounding rebuke from the people of Canada should be enough of 
a warning to us as members of Parliament that we should be taking 
steps to protect the members of the Canadian public from such 
activity as was undertaken by the cable companies. I suggest that 
this was totally disingenuous on the part of the parliamentary 
secretary, who after all was speaking for the heritage minister and 
the heritage department when he said: ``I congratulate this member 
on his wonderful bill but I am not going to support it''. It was 
significantly disingenuous.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Then we read in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> over the weekend about 
some of the background that has now become public.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Bureau argues that passage of the bill would effectively kill the chances for 
success of any new French-language speciality service.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Astral has a stake in two speciality channels that were approved this month by the 
CRTC: the Comedy Network and Teletoon, an animation station that will be 
broadcast in English and French-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``To put it simply, new French services just won't be able to survive.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The bill has other opponents, including the CRTC and heritage minister Sheila 
Copps, who say it could hamper the commission's ability to require cable 
distributors to offer services that it feels should be available to all in the national 
interest.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4530"> 4530 </A></B>
<P>
	The front benches of the government have suddenly woken up 
to the fact that as opposed to the steps that they have consistently 
taken time and time again to bring in their own vision of what 
Canada is all about, this bill will give Canadian consumers 
freedom and opportunity which the government would prefer they 
not have. In other words, those 23 speciality channels which the 
CRTC just licensed, without a form of negative option billing, 
probably will never make it to air or certainly some of them will 
not.
<P>
	The most blatant form of negative option billing was the one that 
was undertaken in January of last year. Members will recall that 
new channels were tacked on and a bill arrived in the mail box of 
the householder. This was rather sneaky because when many 
people receive a bill they simply pay it. Many people would have 
taken a look at that bill and because there was only $1, $2 or $3 
added to the bill, would have ignored the extra charges and paid it.
<P>
	I do not believe that any cable company, either in Quebec, 
Ontario or any other province, would have the audacity to do that 
kind of blatant negative option billing.
<P>
	What I believe could happen and I know this is the reason why 
the heritage department and the heritage minister is so opposed to 
this is that the cable companies could be offering different 
packages. With new technology they can now come up with 
different bundles or groups of offerings of channels.
<P>
	If I want to receive a particular channel then along with it comes 
all of this other material. If these channels are so good why are they 
not prepared to stand on their own? Why will cable companies not 
say it will cost you 75 cents to see French cartoons? Why would 
they not say it will cost you 50 cents to see speciality programming 
whatever the speciality programming is?
<P>
	I suggest the reason for that is because there is money involved 
and where money is involved there is influence. I am rather 
interested in the number of people who have been working the 
Liberal backbenches on this one. The list of lobbyists who have 
worked opposing the bill reads like a who's who in the Liberal 
Party.
<P>
	For example, the former minister of communications, Francis 
Fox, Liberal strategist, Michael Robinson who appears Thursday 
morning on CTV, the former CRTC guru, André Bureau, who I just 
finished reading, worked on the Liberal MPs to oppose this bill.
<P>
	I suggest to the backbench Liberals that they might want to give 
very serious consideration and ask themselves if it is more 
important that they fall in line with the very encrusted Liberal 
hierarchy and the front bench, or should they be making 
representations in this House on behalf of all Canadians?
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	This bill has been something of a sleeper. I commend the 
member who brought it to the House. I sincerely commend him 
because he took action on behalf of the people in his constituency, 
on behalf of the people in Ontario and indeed, by extension, on 
behalf of all people who receive cable in their homes. He brought 
forward this bill that is going to stand in the way of the kind of 
manipulation that there has been, not only by the cable companies 
but indeed by the heritage ministry, of what is good and what is not 
good, what is Canadian and what is not.
<P>
	This Canadiana idea and keeping it under control I suggest is the 
core of what is behind the front bench going against this.
<P>
	I ask Liberal members: When we had a vote in this House of 
Commons of 147 to 25, how in the world can any of them even 
contemplate changing their vote? This is truly going to be a time of 
counting, a time when we are going to see those who have the 
backbone to stand up to the front bench.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-216 and specifically 
to address the motions put to this House by the hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe and the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton who 
is the sponsoring member.
<P>
	The hon. member for Richmond-Wolfe has introduced a motion 
which would defeat Bill C-216. I cannot in good conscience 
support this motion.
<P>
	I was pleased to speak in support of Bill C-216 in the House on 
April 26 of this year. Those of us who have supported this 
legislation from the beginning are very pleased with the progress it 
has made. It is a testament to the quality of this legislation that it 
has made it this far.
<P>
	My comments during that first debate focused on consumer 
rights. I argued that this legislation is in the best interest of 
Canadian consumers.
<P>
	As members of Parliament, I believe it is our duty to protect 
those interests. Often when our constituents call us they forget that 
before we were elected and again after we are finished we were 
consumers, we are consumers, we are taxpayers and we will 
continue to be. It is not an issue that we are devoid and separated 
from. We do know what their concerns are.
<P>
	Since the bill was originally introduced a great deal of activity 
has apparently occurred behind the scenes. If we are to believe 
newspaper reports, lobbyists have been very active turning this 
matter into a linguistic issue. Rather than focus on the only issue at 
hand, the issue of consumer rights, lobbyists have focused the 
attention of members on a divisive national unity question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4531"> 4531 </A></B>
<P>
	I wonder why they did not raise the same concern when cable 
operators publicly stated that they will no  longer employ negative 
option billing practices. I wonder why they did not raise their 
voices when the government rejected the idea of a cable tax to 
support the CBC, the CBC which was created to be the main 
instrument to unite Canadians from coast to coast to coast and to 
keep Canadian culture distinct in North America.
<P>
	The argument that the demise of negative option billing will 
have a negative impact on French language programming simply 
does not make sense. The best way to ensure demand for television 
services in both official languages is to ensure audiences in both 
official languages.
<P>
	Burgeoning second language immersion programs across 
Canada are a testament to the growing number of bilingual 
Canadians. These Canadians will be able to enjoy and therefore 
demand quality entertainment in both official languages. That is 
the best way to safeguard demand for programming in both official 
languages.
<P>
	There is only one issue at the heart of this legislation: consumer 
rights. Do Canadian consumers have the right to be asked whether 
they want a product before being charged for it? Do they have the 
right to choose how they spend their entertainment dollars? The 
answer is an unequivocal yes. Canadian consumers have the right 
to choose whether they want a product before paying for it. This is 
just common sense. If we were dealing with any other industry 
other than the cable industry, it would not even be an issue. I do not 
understand why we choose to treat powerful cable operators with 
kid gloves. Canadians are telling us we have to stop.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I received many calls from my constituents this weekend urging 
me to support this legislation. In fact my voice mail kept filling up. 
I returned every call that I received and there was not one call in 
support of stopping this bill. There is no doubt that my constituents 
support this legislation. Let there be no doubt in their minds that I 
am listening and will vote in their best interests. I would urge all of 
my colleagues to do the same.
<P>
	It has been said, for those who argue in favour of government, 
that without government we are merely consumers. In this era of 
deregulation and government downsizing, it is important that we 
establish a regulatory framework which is consumer oriented. The 
passage of this bill would represent a giant leap in this direction.
<P>
	Certainly, cable operators have taken measures to encourage 
cable subscription from Canadians, as they should because they are 
in the business of making money. The various subscription 
packages available to consumers and the advent of direct payment 
schemes have proven successful for these operators. Direct 
payment in particular is a very powerful tool when combined with 
negative option billing because it gives  cable operators direct 
access to automatic payment from Canadians.
<P>
	When the cable companies implemented negative option billing 
a year and a half ago in Ontario, had my constituents not been 
concerned about this and had my constituents not called me, I 
probably would not have even realized that I was being billed for a 
service which I really did not want. Many of us do not even really 
know how much our cable bill is because we have so many other 
things that we are dealing with now. That means the cable company 
had the right to take money from my account even without my 
knowledge. Depending on one's income bracket, maybe $3 a 
month is not a lot, but if we add it up across the country, that is $25 
million a year taken from the pockets of Canadians without their 
consent.
<P>
	Just as cable companies will make every effort to maximize their 
profits, we as members of Parliament must make every effort to 
balance the playing field so that consumer interests are protected.
<P>
	The activities which have apparently occurred behind the scenes 
raise another issue: the relationship between elected officials and 
their constituents and that between elected officials and lobbyists. 
We made a red book commitment to consult with our constituents, 
not to consult with lobbyists. I say to all hon. members that we 
must honour this commitment.
<P>
	The cable companies in my area have been very good to me. 
They have given me good programming. They have helped me to 
pass my message on to my constituents. However, if my message to 
my constituents is that in order to get this hour every two weeks to 
communicate with them that I have to give in to the wishes of 
lobbyists, I am not sure that is the message I want to communicate.
<P>
	I would like to make a comment to the hon. member across the 
floor who spoke before me. We know who is who in the Liberal 
Party. Our constituents are who is who in the Liberal Party. We do 
not need lectures on backbenchers standing up and taking a stand. 
We do stand up and take a stand. We will continue to take a stand. I 
could perhaps suggest that the hon. members on the other side of 
the floor should have followed their own advice when it came to 
the gun legislation when they took polls in their own ridings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> We did.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beaumier:</B> We are united on this issue. I suppose it is not 
really the time to be fighting each other but I know who is who in 
the Liberal Party and I know who we owe in the Liberal Party when 
we get here: We owe the people who put us here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4532"> 4532 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to the motion by the sponsoring member, the hon. 
member for Sarnia-Lambton, I would urge all  of my colleagues 
to support Bill C-216. It is an amendment that seeks to clarify the 
intent of the legislation.
<P>
	I congratulate the member for Sarnia-Lambton for introducing 
this much needed legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is indeed a privilege to be able to enter the debate this morning, 
especially on the motion that would have the effect of taking away 
the essence or the substance of Bill C-216 which was presented to 
the House by the member for Sarnia-Lambton.
<P>
	I join my colleagues and also the member opposite in 
congratulating the member for Sarnia-Lambton for bringing this 
to the attention of the House and also for providing an opportunity 
for each of us to express ourselves and to vote on this issue and the 
motion before us which destroys the essence of the bill.
<P>
	I am going to oppose that motion and suggest why I want to 
support the bill and why I must oppose this motion. In the context 
of making this presentation I will address three questions: What 
would the benefits be of supporting Bill C-216? Why is the bill 
being opposed at this time? Why am I supporting the bill?
<P>
	What would the benefits be of this legislation if it were to be 
passed by this House? The number one benefit is that the freedom 
of choice would be given to the consumer. Recently the CRTC 
approved 23 new channels. The effort and the impact of those 23 
new channels is to give to the consumer a wide variety of choices in 
what they can pick off the air waves or in this case, from the menu 
that is being offered by the cable companies.
<P>
	If there is one thing we need in this world today, it is the 
opportunity to choose with so many different programs available. 
There will probably be very shortly through direct to home 
television and various other options some 200 channels available to 
the consumer. The consumer wants to choose not only what the 
service is that shall be provided to them but also the quality and the 
price at which that service or opportunity ought to be given to 
them.
<P>
	There are today many many providers of television programs in 
the world. We can get all kinds of information from cable 
companies. We can get all kinds of information from the grey 
market where companies are taking the signal directly off the 
satellite and beaming it out into the marketplace to the consumer.
<P>
	One could argue that the grey market is really not a legal market; 
it is a market which in fact is illegal because there is no legislation 
covering that issue. People are taking programs, using American 
addresses or some kind of vehicle that allows them to come into the 
Canadian area. They are watching these programs. The time has 
come for us to choose clearly and directly what it is that we want.
<P>
	There is fierce competition in the cable industry, in the satellite 
industry, in the whole area. As that competition becomes more 
aggressive and as that competition becomes more intense, the 
reason for interference by a commission of government is 
increasingly bad.
<P>
	We need to have a place where the consumer ultimately begins to 
rule what will enter his mind. It is through the mind that we finally 
determine our actions and the thoughts that take place. Members 
know that the actions we enter into are first of all thoughts in our 
minds. It is absolutely imperative that consumers be given the 
opportunity and the legislative protection to allow them to choose 
what will come. The cable company or any other group does not 
have the right to decide for the consumers what they will see and 
the price they will pay for it.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	What happened last January was the suggestion that the cable 
companies would present new packages and the consumers would 
pay the new prices. If consumers did not want the new package, 
then they could write, phone or communicate in some fashion to 
the cable company to indicate they did not want the service in their 
homes.
<P>
	People are busy. People are not always aware of some of the 
things which are happening around them. There is a habit of using 
automatic withdrawals from the banking system to pay for these 
items. Otherwise the consumer looks at the invoice and says: ``All 
right, I will pay it''.
<P>
	More significantly, in this busy world there are certain deadlines. 
People are given an option. They can say they do not want the new 
service, but they have to do it by a certain date. If the deadline is 
not met, the consumer receives an invoice for the new service.
<P>
	That is not a good idea. Consumers should know exactly what it 
is they are paying for. They must know exactly when they must 
make their decision. The point at which that ought to happen is the 
point at which we make the decision to buy a particular service. It 
is not the point at which the company says: ``This is what you are 
going to get and it will cost you another $5 per month after this 
date. The only way to avoid it is to tell us you do not want the 
service''.
<P>
	There is another thing which comes into play here, that is, there 
are more and more wireless television transmissions appearing 
than there are cable. Our cable companies have provided a 
tremendous service to Canadians. I want to congratulate them. I 
want to commend them for the quality and for the price at which 
they deliver the service. It has been excellent. However, a new era 
is rapidly dawning. We are going to move into the wireless 
transmission of television programs to an ever increasing degree.
<P>
	Why is this bill being opposed at this time? Could it be that this 
bill is being opposed because the current operation actually 
preserves the monopoly of the cable  companies in certain areas? 
Could it be that it would require the cable companies to become 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4533"> 4533 </A></B>
<P>
more aggressive in their marketing? That would cost a little more 
money than it does now. As a consequence it would reduce their 
revenue.
<P>
	Are the cable companies actually afraid of the wireless 
transmission? Will it make their installations obsolete? Could that 
be the case? Could it be that it will reduce the power of the CRTC 
to pick winners and thereby extend certain power to the 
commission that they would lose if negative option billing were to 
be outlawed?
<P>
	We can ask all kinds of questions. One begins to wonder what is 
the real reason behind this sudden shift in thinking on the front 
bench.
<P>
	Could it be that there is a fear that French programming would 
become uneconomic to transmit and therefore we would have to 
preserve that facility? Will we now force other people to subsidize 
that programming? Is there a concern that certain parts of Canada 
would resent subsidizing the television programs designed for a 
selective audience?
<P>
	If the programming is good enough, if the entertainment value is 
strong enough and if the people feel deeply enough about the issue, 
they will pay for the programming. We have all kinds of evidence 
to show that is the case. The issue of forcing people to pay for 
something that somebody else wants is not in the interests of the 
consumer generally speaking.
<P>
	These questions need to be addressed and they have not been 
addressed.
<P>
	Why am I supporting the bill? The time has come for us to 
recognize that the consumers must be able to choose to the greatest 
degree possible the kind of programming which they desire. It 
should be my choice. It should be the choice of every individual 
who has a television set and wants to subscribe to a service as to 
what it is they will choose. If they need to pay for it, they will pay 
for it on the basis of what they want.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Second, I am supporting this bill because technological advances 
increase the number and kind of choices available to consumers. 
The consumer today has a far greater number of choices available, 
and should be able to choose them. There should be no legal 
infringement on his ability to choose among these various kinds of 
programs. The motion before us will do exactly that.
<P>
	Monopoly protection also prevents the marketplace from 
operating and allowing individuals to have a level playing field as 
consumers and on the industry side as well.
<P>
	In light of the consumer, in light of a free marketplace and the 
people of Canada, I suggest we oppose this motion and support Bill 
C-216.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to speak on Bill C-216, the bill to amend 
the Broadcasting Act, as presented by my colleague from 
Sarnia-Lambton.
<P>
	Some members may recall that I voted in favour of this bill at 
second reading to send it to committee for scrutiny and debate, 
which is exactly what happened at committee where we started 
finding out that perhaps there were problems with the bill that had 
not been self-evident at first reading or second reading. I would 
like to briefly review some of the effects of the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is basically to amend the Broadcasting 
Act and Canadian broadcasting policy, and more specifically 
section 3 of the Act. I would like to refer to some of the items in 
section 3. For instance, in paragraph (b) it says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Canadian broadcasting system, operating primarily in the English and French 
languages-provides-a public service essential to the maintenance and 
enhancement of national identity and cultural sovereignty.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A little further, in paragraph (c), we read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>English and French language broadcasting, while sharing common aspects, 
operate under different conditions and may have different requirements.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We also read in paragraph (d), part (<I>iii</I>), and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Through its programming and the employment opportunities arising out of its 
operations, serve the needs and interests, and reflect the circumstances and 
aspirations, of Canadian men, women and children, including equal rights, the 
linguistic duality and multicultural and multiracial nature of Canadian society and 
the special place of aboriginal peoples within that society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I quote these excerpts from section 3 of the Broadcasting Act 
because I want to make a connection with another issue, and it is 
that successive Canadian governments have resisted repeated 
attempts by our neighbours to the south, during free trade 
negotiations for the Canada-U.S. agreement and NAFTA, which 
now includes Mexico, to include all cultural matters in these 
agreements.
<P>
	We realize and accept the fact that in Canada, certain elements of 
our culture, because of their very nature, require special protection. 
Successive governments have resisted attempts by our neighbours 
to the south to include culture and did so for very obvious reasons, 
which we find in section 3 of the Broadcasting Act.
<P>
	This bill will significantly amend section 3, without allowing for 
certain nuances and reflecting the fact that differences exist in our 
country. What we have here is a steamroller approach.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Instead of keeping the flexibility that section 3 of the 
Broadcasting Act offered to the government and to the CRTC, we 
are approaching it with perhaps more of a  steamroller approach, a 
one size cookie cutter fits all approach, where we do not accept that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4534"> 4534 </A></B>
<P>
there might be these nuances and differences that are worthy of 
protection and development.
<P>
	That is why successive governments resisted including cultural 
matters in the Canada-U.S. agreement and the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. With this act we are essentially gutting that 
section or the ability of the CRTC to use it and have our 
broadcasting facilities and infrastructure in the country evolve.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Good legislation should not have bad side effects. This is exactly 
the case we have today. We have a very well intentioned piece of 
legislation which I supported at second reading because I was one 
of those consumers. I was riled at my cable distributor for daring to 
do what it was doing at the time.
<P>
	We have a good intentioned piece of legislation which has some 
pretty serious side effects. That is what we as legislators have to be 
aware of.
<P>
	When the Speaker rises every morning to start the debate he calls 
upon la Providence, the Lord, to allows to make wise decisions and 
good laws. I would urge my colleagues from all parties, front and 
backbencher, to think seriously about approving a bill that has 
some unnecessary, unwanted and pretty serious side effects.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For example, I often wonder: If the CBC ever decided to insist 
the Réseau de l'information, RDI, be mandatory, could the CRTC 
make it so if this bill became law? The answer to that is far from 
clear, although most of the time the answer given is no, it could not. 
There would be a lot of problems, and it would not be possible.
<P>
	I find it somewhat regrettable that my fellow citizens in P.E.I., 
for instance, cannot get RDI at this time, although it is funded by 
all Canadian taxpayers, themselves included, because RDI has not 
yet asked the CRTC to do this. But if RDI did ask, the CRTC would 
no longer be able to comply. I find this regrettable, and it is one of 
the serious consequences I referred to earlier.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton, like all 
those who were involved in the consumer protests in early 1995, is 
trying to put an end to the marketing ploy of negative optioning. 
There is no doubt in my mind that this is a worthwhile objective, as 
I have said before. I again congratulate him on his efforts in this 
connection. Yet, in order to be successful in those efforts, my 
colleague has chosen to take away from the CRTC its power to 
force cable companies to carry certain stations, in order to comply 
with the provisions in Canada's broadcasting policy, an unforseen 
serious secondary effect.
<P>
	Bill C-216 is a bill of national interest, and one that warrants the 
most serious examination. Let us take all of  the time required to 
address the questions on which the bill focusses. I will be voting 
against Bill C-216, not because I support the practice of negative 
billing, which my colleague would like to see eliminated, but rather 
because I have the feeling that this bill has the potential to deprive 
the CRTC of its ability to contribute to the growth of this country's 
French language minority communities.
<P>
	Canada is a country peopled by two linguistic communities. We 
have created institutions with the mandate to reflect this reality and 
we must therefore ensure that, despite any technical and legislative 
changes we decide to make to these institutions, this reality is 
preserved.
<P>
	If the House decides to reject this bill, I hope that the 
government will still act swiftly to table a bill that would ban 
negative billing. There is no doubt in my mind, in light of all the 
discussions I have had with my colleagues in committee, that the 
House is almost unanimously in favour of banning negative billing. 
There is no doubt on this side. But if we go ahead, for goodness' 
sake let us avoid anything that could be harmful to society. It is 
with this in mind that I urge all my colleagues, especially 
backbenchers, to think carefully about the issue, and when they 
vote, in the next little while or later on, to say no to the negative 
impacts of Bill C-216.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-216.
<P>
	I congratulate my colleague, the hon. member for 
Sarnia-Lambton for bringing forward this private member's bill. 
He did so in response to consumer reaction as a result of the 
negative billing by cable companies in January 1995.
<P>
	The bill in its initial stages was widely supported and went to 
committee and now we have the amended version before us. It 
seems a lot has happened over the summer and some people are 
expressing concerns. My colleague for Ottawa-Vanier outlined 
some of those concerns and I really have to ask why.
<P>
	First, let us look at some facts. In committee on May 30, 1996 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
moved an amendment to Bill C-216. The amendment was adopted 
by the committee and the bill was reported back to the House as 
amended. The bill now includes a reference to cable companies 
serving 2,000 or more subscribers. This was added to address 
concerns from certain small time cable operators who claimed that 
for technical reasons they would be unable to comply with the bill 
as originally drafted.
<P>
	The phrase ``non-mandatory pay or speciality service'' was 
added to address concerns expressed by the hon. member for 
Ottawa-Vanier who argued that the  bill as originally drafted 
would somehow prevent the CRTC from requiring certain special-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4535"> 4535 </A></B>
<P>
ity services to be carried as part of the basic service offered to all 
cable subscribers.
<P>
	Finally, a change was made to allow for the substitution or 
addition of a new channel when there is no change in the price 
charged to the consumer.
<P>
	Bill C-216 applies only to non-mandatory pay or speciality TV 
services. The CRTC will continue to decide if a channel is 
mandatory or not. This bill does not affect existing channels such 
as RDI, CBC, CTV, TSN or MuchMusic. Small cable companies of 
less than 2,000 subscribers, which are mostly in rural areas, have 
been exempted from this bill. This bill does not prevent cable 
companies from substituting one channel for another provided the 
price does not increase. The facts speak for themselves. This bill 
should be supported.
<P>
	My colleague for Ottawa-Vanier talked about the side effects, 
the debate of lots of discussion this weekend, the side effects and 
the need for flexibility. An article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> on the 
weekend talked a considerable bit about what those perceived side 
effects might be:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Leading the charge against the bill is André Bureau, a former chairman of the 
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and now president 
of Astral Communications Inc. of Montreal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Bureau argues that passage of the bill would effectively kill the chances for 
success of any new French language speciality service.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Astral has a stake in two speciality channels that were approved this month by the 
CRTC.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those comments by Mr. Bureau are not exactly coming from a 
non-biased observer. That individual has a special interest in terms 
of maintaining the power they have at the moment.
<P>
	I want to outline that on that point of flexibility and concern for 
the speciality channels, especially in the area of language, it is not a 
concern that I have ruled out of hand. I have thought seriously 
about it over the weekend. I agree with many others that there is a 
need for those speciality channels. There is a need for those issues 
to be cabled into the livingrooms of people so that they can see, 
listen, debate and learn more from those kinds of channels.
<P>
	After serious thought I believe that concern can be addressed in 
other ways. There is still room for flexibility as a result of Bill 
C-216. I have only thought about it for a couple of days but one 
such way would be by offering a package inclusive of that 
speciality channel that may be required by the country. A package 
could be offered, the package could be priced and that channel 
could be part of the package. That way that service could be 
provided.
<P>
	I am suggesting that the facts speak for themselves. The concern 
raised by the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier in terms of 
flexibility is not a legitimate  concern. I encourage all members of 
the House to protect the consumers' interests and support Bill 
C-216.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Kamloops has three 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I first want to 
recognize and appreciate the gesture from my friend, the hon. 
member for Malpeque. It is with considerable enthusiasm that I 
speak in support of Bill C-216 in the name of the member for 
Sarnia-Lambton.
<P>
	It is one of those rare moments that we have in the House of 
Commons from time to time where members of all parties are 
asked to decide whose side they are on. Are we on the side of the 
cable companies and the vested interests associated therewith, or 
are we on the side of our constituents?
<P>
	As the member for Kamloops I suspect I am no different from 
anyone else in having received literally hundreds of letters, as well 
as petitions and delegations saying we have to rein in these cable 
companies and make them more sensitive to the consuming public. 
Thanks to the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton we have been 
given the opportunity this morning to say whose side we are on as 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	I suspect that the lobbyists and the mouthpieces for the cable 
companies have made their views known. Their case is weak. We 
here are elected to represent our constituents' best interests when it 
comes to this matter so that we enable them to make a decision on 
the kind of programming that is made available in their homes.
<P>
	I speak with enthusiasm in support of Bill C-216. I look forward 
to support from private members.
<P>
	We acknowledge there has been some pressure on members of 
Parliament. Let us also remember that this is private members' 
hour. We are voting today as individuals, not as members of 
political parties, not as members of some vested interest group. We 
are being asked to stand up in our place as independent members of 
Parliament, private members. Let us not be swayed by phone calls 
we have received from certain pressure groups and let us vote in the 
best interests of our constituents.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 11.45 a.m., the time provided for 
debate has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Accordingly, the question is on Motion No. 1. Is it the pleasure 
of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour will please say yea.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The question is on Motion No. 1.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As it is the practice, the division will be taken row by row 
starting on my left today where the mover would be sitting and then 
proceeding with those in favour of the motion sitting on the same 
side of the House as the mover over here. All those who are in 
favour on this side will rise by row. I will call the rows. Then all 
those in favour on this side will rise and I will let you know about 
that.
<P>
	When we come to those who are opposed we will follow the 
same procedure. I know you are all anxious to get on with it. All 
those on my left in favour of the motion will please rise.

	The House resumed from September 19 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-45, an act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial 
review of parole ineligibility) and another act, be read the third 
time and passed; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege 
today to participate in the debate on Bill C-45, a bill which 
addresses the concerns of Canadians, a  bill which strengthens our 
justice system and will keep our streets and neighbourhoods safer 
for our families and our children.
<P>
	I must first take issue with the motion by the members opposite 
that this bill be deferred for six months. I find it ridiculous that the 
Bloc would have put forth a motion that would delay the passage of 
this legislation. At this time when Canadians are expressing their 
concerns about safety, it would be totally unacceptable for us to put 
off the debate on this important legislation.
<P>
	I assure you, Mr. Speaker, that I am speaking for the majority of 
members here when millions of Canadians are very anxious about 
what the government is doing to proceed on debate, passage and 
implementation of Bill C-45. We are anxious to do this because this 
bill will help law enforcement agencies to do their jobs. It will keep 
dangerous criminals off the streets and it will make our society a 
safer place.
<P>
	We have as a government put in place a number of initiatives to 
address criminal and correctional law. Bill C-45 continues to fulfil 
our red book commitments to Canadians that we are serious about 
law and order and that we are taking this opportunity to address 
these issues. Bill C-45 addresses high risk offenders.
<P>
	Several measures place controls over persons convicted of sex 
crimes and other violent offences. These measures aim to reduce 
the risk that persons previously convicted of sex offences and other 
violent offences commit further crimes. They also address public 
concerns about violent sexual offenders.
<P>
	The dangerous offender provisions in the Criminal Code have 
proven to be useful mechanisms for sentencing serious offenders 
who pose a high risk of committing further violent offences. 
Through a special hearing, such offenders may be given an 
indeterminate sentence.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	It is proposed that the Criminal Code be amended to make a 
number of improvements to benefit society.
<P>
	Under the criminal law, a judge has discretion to sentence a 
dangerous offender to a fixed term. The task force on high risk 
violent offenders suggested that it makes little sense to go through 
an elaborate dangerous offender procedure only to obtain a definite 
sentence. Provinces have expressed support for this change.
<P>
	Under the proposed changes the judge will no longer have the 
discretion but rather will be required to impose an indefinite 
sentence.
<P>
	Currently a dangerous offender application must be made at 
trial. The crown will now have up to six months after conviction to 
bring a dangerous offender application.
<P>
	Furthermore, the process has been streamlined. The number of 
psychiatrists required to testify at a hearing has been changed from 
two to one.
<P>
	It is proposed that the initial parole review of a dangerous 
offender be moved from the third year of imprisonment to the
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4540"> 4540 </A></B>
<P>
seventh year. This brings the initial review by the national parole 
board closer to parole eligibility calculations for many of the 
serious personal injury offences.
<P>
	It is proposed that a new sentencing category to be called long 
term offender be added to the Criminal Code. The procedure would 
be similar to the process for dangerous offenders.
<P>
	The long term offender procedure will apply to persons 
convicted of crimes such as sexual assault or weapons charges. 
Under the proposal a convicted criminal found at a special hearing 
to be a long term offender would be subject to an imprisonment 
sentence suited to the offence with an additional period for 
supervision of up to 10 years. A person who cannot be found to 
meet the narrow definition of dangerous offender could be found to 
be a long term offender provided the criteria were met.
<P>
	It is proposed that a new judicial restraint provision be added to 
the Criminal Code. This procedure would focus on persons who 
pose the risk of committing a serious personal injury offence. The 
attorney general could bring an application where there are 
reasonable grounds to fear that an individual would commit a 
serious personal injury offence. These grounds would be examined 
at a hearing before a judge.
<P>
	As one of the conditions the judge could order that the program 
of electronic monitoring be applied if such a program were 
available in the province. The judicial restraint would last up to one 
year. A breach of conditions would constitute a separate criminal 
offence.
<P>
	As we can see from the foregoing comments, Bill C-45 deals 
directly with dangerous offenders, long term offenders and judicial 
restraint. These are safety issues which deserve debate in the 
House. These are measures which Canadians deserve in the law of 
this land.
<P>
	The victims of violence, the families of victims and sadly, the 
survivors of victims have shown us the need for the type of 
measures that are outlined in the bill. Law enforcement agencies 
from across the country have asked us to give them the opportunity 
to tackle crime with the types of tools that are provided in the 
legislation.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues on both sides of the House to support Bill 
C-45. I urge them to do so now, for to wait six months or even six 
weeks does nothing to address the concerns which Canadians have 
and does nothing to keep dangerous offenders off the streets. Why 
would we want to do that? How could we possibly go back to our 
constituents and say that we will do it down the road sometime? 
Why wait? Let us do the right thing today. Let  us show the 
leadership and conviction for those who have placed us in the role 
of legislators. Let us legislate what is right for Canadians and pass 
Bill C-45.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House today to debate Bill C-45.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	It never ceases to amaze me to listen to members opposite as 
well as to the official opposition. When it comes right down to it, 
they think very much the same when it comes to getting tough on 
crime and on criminals in this society. I note the Bloc members 
would like to liberalize criminal justice to such a point that I do not 
believe they would want to throw anyone in jail. They made that 
very clear in their support and the amendments to many of the 
proposals they put forward on section 745. I do not really see a 
whole lot of difference between the Liberals who are bringing forth 
this legislation and the Bloc members who want to liberalize things 
even further.
<P>
	That is not what Canadians are saying. They are complaining 
right across the country for substantive changes to the Criminal 
Code. They want a government that is serious about that but we are 
not getting that message. There is a lot of rhetoric on the opposite 
side about getting tough on crime and coming up with some very 
significant pieces of legislation to do it but the government is not 
doing it.
<P>
	The government is making more law, but what is that law really 
saying? On one side Bill C-45 comes forward and on the other side 
the Minister of Justice brings forward bills that would make 
indictable offences dual procedure offences. That is talking out of 
both sides of the mouth. The government is getting tough on one 
side and weakening on the other. What do we end up with as a 
result? Somewhere in between it is a status quo type of bill, but that 
is not what Canadians want.
<P>
	Section 745 symbolizes the sorry state the Liberal social 
engineers and soft on crime politicians have put upon the criminal 
justice system. It symbolizes the welfare state criminology 
philosophy that pervades corrections, parole and sentencing in 
Canada today. It is a philosophy whose key promoters argue 
wrongly that one, criminals commit crime primarily because they 
themselves are victims, and two, that crime including murder is 
mostly a product of social conditions. In short, it is a philosophy 
that draws attention away from individual responsibility and 
personal accountability for one's actions. I will return to those two 
themes shortly.
<P>
	Upon review of the proposed amendments to Bill C-45, I note 
that most are either minor or technical in nature. Quite frankly, they 
do very little to change the substance of the bill, which is to amend 
the Criminal Code to the extent that if Bill C-45 is passed by 
Parliament, the following changes will come into effect.
<P>
	First, applicants, including those now serving time for murder, 
will no longer be entitled to an automatic right to a section 745 
hearing. A screening mechanism will be utilized in that a superior 
court judge will first decide whether the application has a 
reasonable prospect of success before the applicant will be able to 
go before a community jury.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4541"> 4541 </A></B>
<P>
	The member who preceded me in speaking to this bill pointed 
out that it is the opposition that has held up this phase of the bill 
coming into law. I will take exception to those words because it 
was the Minister of Justice who introduced this bill in the dying 
moments of Parliament prior to the summer recess because he did 
not want debate on the topic.
<P>
	Most people want to see section 745 stricken from the code. 
However, that did not happen. The debate did not occur because the 
Minister of Justice left it until two weeks before the recess to ram it 
through, hoping that the opposition would take it and run with it.
<P>
	The Bloc members, the official opposition of this country, the 
separatists of this country, decided that they were going to interfere 
with that process even voting against it in hope that they could 
change it and liberalize it even further. That is what happened but 
the blame falls squarely on the shoulders of the Minister of Justice 
because the bill was introduced so late.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Another change that will come into effect with the passage of 
Bill C-45 is that persons convicted of multiple murders after the 
bill comes into force will not have the right to apply for early 
parole under section 745. That does not include the convicted 
murderers who were sentenced prior to this bill. Somewhere in the 
neighbourhood of 600 murderers who have received a life sentence 
will be eligible to apply under the old provisions of the code. Often 
we talk about making retroactive changes. This is one place that 
legislation could come into play where they would not have that 
provision suitable for them.
<P>
	The third point is the jury from now on will be required to reach 
a unanimous decision before the parole ineligibility is shortened, 
which is an advantage.
<P>
	Those three points are an advantage in protecting the country. 
However, they do not answer the concerns of most people. They do 
not go far enough.
<P>
	The effect of this legislation, which is most relevant, is that 
people like Clifford Olson and Paul Bernardo will be affected by 
the first and third proposals but not by the second. They may still 
apply for section 745 hearings and furthermore they may receive 
early release from life imprisonment. The possibility exists that 
they still could receive early release.
<P>
	I often think about murderers like Paul Bernardo and Clifford 
Olson and what they have done to members in  the community 
where I live. I know there are other families that struggle with 
knowing that Olson or Bernardo still have access to our courts, to 
the hearing process. There is no closure. I think more respect and 
dignity should be awarded in their direction, which does not seem 
to exist in this Parliament.
<P>
	For this reason alone the Reform Party cannot support this 
legislation. We are not going to support this bill. My colleagues and 
I have travelled this country and we have listened to every 
response, often emotional, of representations by victims' groups, 
police officers, prison guards and rank and file law-abiding 
Canadians. They want section 745 scrapped.
<P>
	Canadians are sending Liberal politicians a unified message that 
a killer who commits first degree, premeditated murder ought not 
to ever have the opportunity for early release.
<P>
	I am going to refer to my own community frequently because it 
is reflective of others in the country where tragedies and murders 
have taken place and have victimized the community as well as 
those closest to the families. I remember a a few years back that a 
seven-year-old mute girl was murdered by an individual. He killed 
her after he picked her up in the playground. It was a premeditated 
murder. He was charged with first degree murder and convicted.
<P>
	That crime is just as serious as those crimes that were committed 
against many families by Clifford Olson as well as Paul Bernardo. I 
do not think that killer should have any more of an opportunity to 
apply for early release than Clifford Olson or Paul Bernard. The 
bill falls short. Canadians tell us that life should mean life.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The first policy in our blue book under parole is that there should 
be no parole, that the full sentence should be served. That is what 
many Reformers are saying and it is quite reflective of what others 
in our society are saying as well.
<P>
	This is a sentiment of which the justice minister is either 
unaware or more likely a sentiment of which the minister has a 
vested interest in not being aware. To whom is he listening?
<P>
	The fact that there no longer exists truth in sentencing for killers 
outrages Canadians. They want to see a person who is sentenced to 
life get life. Consequently, a particular topic is finding its way into 
coffee shop and dinner table discussions. The feeling is that the 
return of the death penalty for capital murder is desirable and 
desperately needed. Therefore, I want to put the Liberal 
government on notice that a Reform government will hold a 
binding national referendum on the reinstatement of capital 
punishment. A Reform government will abolish, repeal and scrap 
section 745 of the Criminal Code. That is what Canadians are 
saying. As I pointed out, we are on record.
<P>
	For the three years I have served in Parliament I have noticed 
how the justice minister conducts business. It is obvious that 
instead of listening to victims' groups, ordinary Canadians, police 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4542"> 4542 </A></B>
<P>
officers or prison guards, the justice minister lends his ear to 
special interests, legal aid defence lawyers and other socialists soft 
on crime special interest lobbies.
<P>
	I sometimes find it remarkable who the justice minister picks to 
imply endorsement of his policies. He may have a representative of 
the chiefs of police or a representative of the Canadian Police 
Association. But is that reflective of rank and file chiefs and is it 
reflective of police officers across the country? I think not. One 
example of that was the gun control issue. It was not reflective of 
rank and file officers across the country. I think that sometimes 
certain associations and organizations become too politically 
involved.
<P>
	What a sad day it is when the minister, duly elected to serve the 
democratic wishes of Canadians, fails to do so. The government 
can be assured that Canadians will hold it accountable at the time 
of election. I look forward to that time. In fact, I am going to make 
sure that more of the government's position is clearly revealed in 
other areas of the country outside of my own. That is my campaign, 
to bring forward justice issues because I know it is close to the 
minds and hearts of a lot of people.
<P>
	Prior to my election to Parliament I served for 22 years as a 
police officer. I was on duty on May 24, 1977 when my colleague, 
Constable William Shelver was shot in the back of the head. His 
assailant, Roy Glaremin also shot and injured another constable 
that night. Mr. Glaremin applied for judicial review under section 
745 in 1993 and he has initiated proceedings for another review 
later this year. Lawyers tell me that he will likely be successful this 
time around. He shot a policeman.
<P>
	Nothing contained in the proposals brought forward by the 
justice minister to Bill C-45 will stop a vile killer like Glaremin 
from seeking early release.
<P>
	The bare truth about section 745 of the Criminal Code is that 
nearly 50 of the last 60 killers who have applied for early parole 
hearings using section 745 have had their eligibility period reduced 
from 25 years to 15 years. Most of these killers were imprisoned as 
first time murderers. Therefore, they are all eligible for early 
release under section 745. They can apply. Nothing proposed in 
Bill C-45 will change this reality. The claim therefore that the 
justice minister's tinkering with section 745 will toughen up parole 
criteria is not exactly that. It has been engineered to mislead 
Canadians to believe that real action has been undertaken by the 
government to keep killers in jail. The truth is that the justice 
minister has no intention of getting tough with criminals and the 
section 745 proposal is evidence of that fact.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	A certain number of those 600 eligible killers will not apply, as 
has been the case in the past. I do not think that will really change a 
whole lot under this present system. The reviews that will continue 
on will not only open up cases for those victims who have had 
loved ones murdered, it will cost taxpayers a considerable amount 
of money for hearings on the applications that come forward.
<P>
	I state for the record that the Reform Party will accept nothing 
less than the full repeal of section 745 of the Criminal Code. I also 
restate that the proposals put forward by the Liberal government do 
not properly address the concerns of the majority of Canadians. 
Anything less than a true life sentence is completely unacceptable 
where the killer has committed premeditated, first degree murder.
<P>
	Poll after poll, survey after survey that have been conducted in 
this country clearly reflect that people want capital punishment for 
first degree murderers. Section 745 is anything but a faint hope 
clause. Rather it is a sure bet law for killers, and it must be repealed 
and scrapped, not modified, not tinkered with. Canadians want 
nothing less.
<P>
	Another reason that illustrates why section 745 must be repealed 
is the case of Clifford Olson. Last April the serial child killer sent 
sneering personal notes to several MPs in which he boasted about 
his prospect for early parole under section 745. I notice this is 
continuing. His notes are generally signed: ``Yours truly, Clifford 
Olson, the beast of British Columbia'' .Truly he is a beast and 
should not even have the opportunity to do what he has done.
<P>
	Later this fall, Olson will have served 15 years of his multiple 
life sentences for mass murder and rape. He made his application 
for early release under section 745 on August 12.
<P>
	The case of Clifford Olson clearly illustrates that anything less 
than a true life sentence for killers, whether they be one-time 
murderers or multiple murderers, is completely unacceptable. 
Closure will come for victims, for communities, only when a true 
life sentence means exactly that. There will be no application for 
early release and victims will be able to rest easy.
<P>
	I urge members opposite to reconsider this bill. Certainly it has 
some positive attributes, I do not deny that but it does not go far 
enough. It does not invoke closure. It does not send a killer away 
for life where he should be. That is Reform's proposal and that will 
reflect most positively across this country.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois will vote against the bill, but for reasons entirely 
opposite to those stated by my hon. colleague from the Reform 
Party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4543"> 4543 </A></B>
<P>
	As we know, this bill amends section 745, under which prisoners 
may eventually apply for parole. Parole is not granted 
automatically; it may be requested and may or may not be granted.
<P>
	The amendments before us would require jury approval be 
unanimous rather than by two thirds majority, as it stands. What 
this means in real terms is that, at present, prisoners who apply for 
parole must first convince two thirds of the jury. It is no small task. 
It is not something that is easy to do. Let us face it, the burden of 
proof is already on the prisoners. It is an uphill battle for them.
<P>
	Now, if the requirement provided for in section 745 is unanimity 
rather than a two thirds majority, prisoners no longer face an uphill 
battle, but an unscalable wall. Basically, all it would take is for one 
member of the jury to have any hesitation for the whole process to 
be stalled. We might just as well say that parole shall not be granted 
to anyone under any condition.
<P>
	Section 745 would also be amended to deny serial killers, that is 
anyone who has committed more than one murder, access to this 
judicial review procedure. May I point out that an inmate's 
rehabilitation is not necessarily a function of the number of 
murders he may have committed as much as the circumstances 
surrounding these murders and the individual's character.
<P>
	Let us consider, for example, the case of someone who commits 
a murder in cold blood, compared to that of another individual who 
kills two people in a panic. The latter may feel regret as he never 
had the intention of committing these murders in the first place, 
whereas the former may not feel sorry at all but still have access to 
the judicial review mechanism, while the repentant killer, on the 
other hand, would not.
<P>
	The third amendment to Section 745 proposed in this bill 
provides for a selection mechanism whereby the chief justice of the 
superior court or the designated judge would determine, based on 
written representations, if the applicant has a reasonable chance of 
having his request approved by a jury. In other words, the convict 
who wants a judicial review must submit to the judge a written 
application outlining the reasons why he believes his request has a 
chance of being approved. The judge will then assess these reasons 
and determine if the application can be submitted to a jury, which 
must render a unanimous decision.
<P>
	As you can see, these three amendments to Section 745 would 
make the implementation of the review mechanism triply 
ineffective.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Beyond these technical considerations, one has to look at the 
reasons why this judicial review process was originally put in 
place. We all agree that, when someone is handed down a very long 
sentence-such as imprisonment for life or 25 years-for a terrible 
<P>
crime, one way of encouraging this individual to rehabilitate and to 
behave during his detention is to give him some faint hope that, if 
he does makes an effort to rehabilitate, he might eventually 
reintegrate society and become a good citizen. In other words, 
whether it is in jail or in any other sphere of human activity, 
motivation is always a powerful incentive.
<P>
	Clause 745 would have the effect of destroying this motivation. 
Consequently, from the time an inmate knows that, for all intents 
and purposes, his chances of again becoming a member of society 
some day are nil, or that he will have to wait too long for such 
opportunity, why should he make any effort to rehabilitate? Why 
should he display good or even exemplary conduct in prison?
<P>
	The proposed amendments to section 745 would have the effect 
of nipping in the bud any will to rehabilitate among those serving 
long sentences.
<P>
	We have to look at the nature of the problem. As the English 
expression so appropriately says:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
Is this an overkill? Let us look at the situation.
<P>
	On December 31, 1995, 175 people in prison were eligible for a 
judiciary review. Of these 175 only 76 had made such a request. Of 
these, 13 had not been dealt with. That means 63 had been dealt 
with. Of these, 39 obtained a reduction in their inadmissibility 
delay. That does not mean they were released, it means that they 
could make another request after a certain period of time.
<P>
	For those who had benefited from a release, as of December 31, 
1995 only one was a repeat offender and the offence was armed 
robbery.
<P>
	This is an overkill by the Minister of Justice.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	Clifford Olson is a problem, but within the actual rules of the law 
he has virtually no chance at all of obtaining an early release. Are 
we going to change a system that has been fine tuned over the years 
to make totally sure that an individual with no chance really has no 
chance?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I believe that we are up against a situation here where the 
Minister of Justice is in the process of playing up to  the Reform 
Party supporters, if I can put it that way, by applying rules similar 
to the ones Reform wanted to see implemented.
<P>
	Under the circumstances, this ill-advised political opportunism 
would run counter to the interests of our society and would, without 
a doubt, move a piece of legislation that was drawn up carefully 
over time several decades back in time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4544"> 4544 </A></B>
<P>
	If I may, I would like to make use of the few minutes remaining 
to me to go beyond the bill to some more fundamental 
considerations. Essentially, the entire question of incarceration of 
an inmate has two purposes: first of all, of course, punishment for a 
crime, but also, and above all, public safety.
<P>
	Often, although the crime committed requires punishment, the 
nature of the crime means that the person who has committed it no 
longer constitutes a risk to society and, provided a fine is paid or 
some other condition met, incarceration is not necessary, because 
public safety is not involved. When it is, however, imprisonment 
becomes necessary.
<P>
	But every imprisonment involves release, eventually. The 
important thing is to ensure the individual no longer constitutes a 
risk for society when the release does take place. Now, an 
important point: does the prison setting offer the incarcerated 
individual the rehabilitation he or she needs to no longer represent 
a danger to our society on release?
<P>
	Of course we could say: ``Lock them up for life. They will not 
get out until after they are dead, and then they are no longer 
dangerous''. Now that approach is extreme in the extreme, if you 
will pardon the overkill, and it does not reflect the basic values of a 
modern democratic society. We can do better than that. We can do 
better and we have the resources to do so.
<P>
	The rehabilitation process should be such that, when the 
individual leaves prison, he no longer constitutes a risk to society 
and above all will be able to make a positive contribution to 
society. We must turn a passive individual into a person who will 
be an asset to society or at least give him that opportunity, since we 
cannot force people to change.
<P>
	However that implies having a number of resources. It implies 
investing money to help this individual rehabilitate himself. As you 
know, I sit on the justice committee, and I had a chance to put 
questions to our experts in this field.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	I simply asked them when, if a person is locked up for a certain 
period of time, let us say 10 years, does the rehabilitation process 
start? Believe it or not, it may take from 18 and 24 months, which 
means that, during most of the time he is incarcerated, there will be 
used no attempt at rehabilitation, and ample opportunity for his  
behaviour to deteriorate. Only in the final months is an attempt 
made to make him less of a danger to society, because eventually 
he will have to be released. Even if he is in for 25 years, eventually 
he will have to be released.
<P>
	Our view of these issues goes back to the lack of resources only a 
few decades ago to help a person rehabilitate himself. Times have 
changed. If a person has some kind of chemical deficiency in the 
brain, we can treat that. We know that minute quantities of certain 
substances an individual may have too much or too little of in the 
course of his life can cause depression or manic states, in other 
words, they can significantly alter an individual's behaviour. It 
does not happen to everyone, but it does happen to some people.
<P>
	We also know that the environment in which a young child is 
raised can influence his behaviour as an adult. And we also know, 
because of more advanced studies and research, how to make an 
individual become aware of his problems and to react effectively.
<P>
	It is time that this knowledge was put to use in the prison system, 
so that, eventually, individuals would be kept in the system only as 
long as it took to turn them into full and productive members of 
society, who no longer pose a threat to the public.
<P>
	Any longer and they become more dangerous, time bombs 
waiting to go off. In conclusion, you will understand that the Bloc 
Quebecois does not wish to support this bill, but fervently hopes 
that there will be a complete overhaul of approaches to 
incarceration.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened intently to the member for Portneuf. I do not see very 
much difference in viewpoints by this member, certainly by his 
party, to that of the Liberals, especially to that of the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
<P>
	The member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce says nothing can replace 
the life of the victim. In the same breath he also says it is a waste of 
a life to keep a murderer in jail. That is what came about from the 
architect of section 745.
<P>
	I see no difference in what the member for Portneuf is saying to 
that which the architect of section 745 has said. I would like him to 
tell me and the rest of this country that the murderer of Constable 
Shelever, Roy Glaremin, is no more or less of a vicious murderer 
than Olson or of the murderer of Mrs. Morrison's seven-year old 
daughter who as a mute and who could not even scream out for 
help. Is he any more or any less of a vicious murderer than Olson?
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know personally any of 
these individuals and I am not a judge to make a judgment. I will 
say this. These murders should never  have happened. As a society 
the important question we must ask ourselves is how could we have 
prevented this from happening.
<P>
	At the moment we are speaking here to each other we know that 
young people are not being cared for, that some are hungry and are 
not attended to properly even at school. Why not? What are we 
doing to prevent this?
<P>
	Second, I am hearing about punishment the second time 
someone commits a murder. For God's sake, I do not want the 
second time to happen, if the first time ever happens. Let us 
rehabilitate this individual. Even if we want it otherwise, this 
person eventually will be liberated, will have served his or her 
term. He or she will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4545"> 4545 </A></B>
<P>
on the street and as dangerous as ever. We do not want this to 
happen. Let us rehabilitate them.
<P>
	In the first place let us not have conditions of life which fabricate 
vicious people. They are the reflection of our neglect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> It was very 
interesting, Mr. Speaker. The hon. member suggested we should 
prevent crime in the first place. I do not think anybody would ever 
disagree with that. Of course we would rather not have any crimes 
committed at any time, much less murder.
<P>
	I was rather interested in the rehabilitation statement the hon. 
member made, that we should rehabilitate these criminals and 
make sure they become productive members of society. I do not 
think anyone would disagree with that.
<P>
	The concern that I have, and I would like to ask the member to 
address this, is after we put all these special programs into place, 
after we put all these rehabilitation mechanisms in the place of 
work or the prison where this person is incarcerated and we go 
through all these machinations, what assurance would the hon. 
member require before the individual was released from prison that 
would give to society the assurance that person will not be a 
repeating offender?
<P>
	Could the hon. member tell us what are the tests he would apply? 
What are the indicators that future behaviour will be fundamentally 
different from the behaviour that got the person to perpetrate a 
crime of killing someone else?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, we know that companies wishing 
to hire candidates have a battery of written and behavioural tests 
enabling them to determine in advance of hiring whether 
individuals will be able to perform the required duties, whether 
their behaviour, social values and abilities will meet their future 
employer's expectations.
<P>
	We also know that great strides have been made in behavioural 
psychology in recent years. All the scientific knowledge for 
determining whether or not an individual  has been rehabilitated 
already exists. Is it infallible? Science is human, and is therefore 
fallible, but the odds are in favour of success, while with the system 
we now have, the odds are against it. That is what I am saying.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to begin by asking my friend, the member for Portneuf, 
if by any chance he has been discussing this issue with his 
constituents, because our views are so different that-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think that the member has 
misunderstood me. The period for asking questions is over, and we 
are resuming debate. The hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan 
has the floor for his speech.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, on with the debate. I apologize for 
that little intercession. I was hoping to get a question in.
<P>
	Rising to speak to Bill C-45, the Liberal government's response 
to calls for tougher parole eligibility guidelines, the reasons why I 
will not be supporting this bill are numerous, and many of my 
Reform colleagues have already touched on the legislation's 
shortcomings in this and in previous debates.
<P>
	In deciding what to speak on in relation to Bill C-45 I had to 
choose between the bill's merits, of which there are few, and its 
apparent lack of consideration for murder victims and their 
families. I chose the latter if only to highlight the Liberal 
government's total failure in this regard.
<P>
	Victims rights groups in Canada like Canadians Against 
Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination, CAVEAT, 
Victims of Violence, Crime Responsibility and Youth, CRY, and 
others have been calling for the elimination of Bill C-45. These are 
victims advocates spokespeople. It is a request, as I say, that is long 
overdue and appears to have been once again ignored by this 
government.
<P>
	Yet what is it that victims rights advocates and Canadians in 
general find so offensive about section 745 of the Criminal Code? 
Pointedly, Bill C-45 still allows section 745 to remain, albeit in a 
somewhat watered down form. However, the fact remains that 
section 745 is  still there and murderers will still be able to use its 
provisions.
<P>
	I know that some of my Liberal friends across the way and their 
Bloc supporters will argue this bill is too harsh, but Reform's belief 
is that this bill does not go far enough. Our belief that this is the 
case is grounded at least in public support. That was to be the 
question I was going to ask my friend, the member for Portneuf, 
how much public support he feels comes from his constituents.
<P>
	I have listened to some hon. members, including the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, wax eloquent in defence of section 745. 
After all, that member was one of the driving forces behind the 
repeal of capital punishment during the Trudeau reign of error. He 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4546"> 4546 </A></B>
<P>
and his Liberal colleagues were also instrumental in establishing 
section 745 in its present and soon to be amended form.
<P>
	If Canadians think about it for a minute they will have as good an 
understanding as anyone about why the present Liberal government 
will not repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code. If the government 
chose to repeal section 745 in its entirety it would have to admit in 
front of all Canadians that it made a terrible mistake by putting it in 
the Criminal Code in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Imagine the media questions the poor Minister of Justice would 
have to answer if his government were to do the right thing and 
eliminate section 745. I think that is the crux of the issue here. If 
the government repeals and in essence admits it was wrong, it 
would be forced to admit that the Reform Party and every Canadian 
who wanted section 745 eliminated was right. It is not about to do 
that.
<P>
	Beyond that, if Canadians accuse it of being wrong on the issue 
of section 745, it also leaves it vulnerable in just about every other 
area of criminal justice reform. By extension one would then be 
able to criticize every other area of Liberal policy making, which is 
easy enough to do already.
<P>
	For example, the Liberals and their Tory predecessors have spent 
the country $600 billion into debt. They do not want the deficit to 
get to zero any time soon because to do so would mean that they 
would have to again admit that years of deficit spending were 
wrong. What do they do? Like with every other issue, they tinker 
around the edges but the problem remains. In essence, Liberal 
governments never treat the illness or underlying problem. They 
sort of stick band-aids on the patients in the hope they will not 
realize how sick they are.
<P>
	I could go on about Liberal mismanagement but I have only 20 
minutes and would be forced to stray from the subject at hand 
which is their half measure approaches to the issue of criminal 
justice reform. Half measures throughout.
<P>
	In any event, the Liberals have decided it is in their best interests 
politically just to tinker with 745 rather than scrap it. It is my hope 
that when Canadians go to the polls the next time they will do what 
is in their best interests and scrap this Liberal government.
<P>
	While Canadians are trying to fathom exactly why a government 
which claims to be responsible has a clause allowing persons 
convicted of first degree murder to get out of doing the full 25 
years, they would be within their right to ask what opportunity do 
murder victims and their families have at a second chance. That is 
very basic to this whole argument. What about the victims and their 
families?
<P>
	Canadians know the answer to that question just as readily as do 
Liberal members across the way. The answer is none. Murder 
victims and families do not have a second chance. Yet across the 
way they still insist that this bill is an enlightened approach. They 
call section 745 the faint hope clause. In reality they should have 
called it the get out of jail card.
<P>
	It is not just the public calling for the elimination of section 745. 
A former member of the Liberal caucus has a private member's 
bill, Bill C-234, calling for this very repeal. Yet at every turn this 
bill has met with delay and obstructionist tactics by a government 
intent on burying the bill. Small wonder that Reform is cynical of 
Bill C-45 which is now before members.
<P>
	I also want to touch on some of the points raised by both the 
justice minister and our colleagues from the Bloc. The justice 
minister in his previous speech addressed the business of whether 
section 745 was originally brought into the Criminal Code without 
the full knowledge of the people. Members from the Bloc have 
previously commented on the backroom shenanigans that occurred 
in 1976 when capital punishment was being removed from the 
Criminal Code and this section was brought it. The people of 
Canada knew nothing about this or its potential impact and they 
certainly did not give their consent to it.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	All we need to do is look at the hue and cry which arose across 
the country as first degree murderers began to apply and receive 
reductions in their parole ineligibility.
<P>
	There was not a great degree of awareness across Canada about 
what was happening in this area of the criminal justice system. I am 
also going to suggest that the justice minister has not adequately or 
successfully addressed this point.
<P>
	The justice minister also spoke highly about the protection 
afforded the justice system as a result of juries' being able to decide 
on the acceptability of a section 745 application. That is fine. I 
believe juries are an integral part of the judicial process, but juries 
can act and decide only based on the information they receive. 
Juries have  not always made decisions in the best interests of 
society because they have been deprived of the information they 
needed to make a just decision.
<P>
	I also suggest that if we examine the limited role juries will now 
have under this amended section 745, all kinds of concerns and 
questions are present. For example, what kind of information will a 
jury receive? Will it receive information pertaining to the specific 
acts the individual has committed, the circumstances surrounding 
them, the pain and horror caused by that individual's actions not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4547"> 4547 </A></B>
<P>
only to the victim but to the victim's family and to society in 
general? Will the jury get that sort of information? If the past is any 
indication, I suggest it will not. Then how can it make a reasoned 
judgment?
<P>
	Therefore when the justice minister suggests that all is well 
simply because a jury of common people picked from the 
community will be addressing the issue, I suggest there is a 
weakness in that argument. That weakness is clear according to the 
information which may be placed before a jury.
<P>
	I say to the Minister of Justice that a jury cannot act on any 
information except that which is placed before it. In the case of 
section 745 hearings this leaves much to be desired in terms of the 
horror an applicant has caused the surviving family and friends of a 
victim.
<P>
	I do not believe this government and its justice minister truly 
understand the horror inflicted on murder victims by way of their 
families, friends and society. I can say this because it is most 
certainly not reflected in the bill we are debating today.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, Bill C-45 shows the justice minister has 
little empathy with the families of murder victims. These families 
are survivors. These families have endured nightmares as a result 
of the heinous crimes committed against their own flesh and blood. 
The memory of a family member or a friend who has been taken 
away by the cruel act of murder is insulted by this bill which 
contemplates a reduction in the punishment of its perpetrator.
<P>
	Back in June members of the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs heard firsthand the horror of Sylvain Leduc's 
grandmother whose grandson was viciously murdered. The 
committee also heard from the mother of Leslie Mahaffy. Leslie 
was brutally murdered by Paul Bernardo.
<P>
	I know my Liberal friends across the way who are chatting about 
other matters will bleat plaintively that Bernardo has already been 
declared a dangerous offender and that this bill has no force or 
effect where he is concerned. That is not the point. When we hear 
these stories we realize and understand the pain that families and 
friends could be forced to endure every time one of these sick, 
twisted animals applies for an early parole. Any avenue such as 
section 745 which provides killers  with a chance for early release 
makes a mockery of the term life imprisonment.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The penalty for premeditated first degree murder is life 
imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 25 years. A life 
sentence is not about rehabilitation, as we have heard today, it is 
about punishment and retribution for the most horrible crime in 
society, the unlawful and deliberate taking of an innocent life.
<P>
	The justice minister does not believe in punishment or 
retribution as necessary to the sentencing process. He seems only 
to focus on rehabilitation, which we have heard echoed by the Bloc 
speakers. That is what we have been getting from his colleagues in 
every aspect of the Liberal red book promise for safer streets and 
communities.
<P>
	The same applies to their half hearted overhaul of the Young 
Offenders Act, which my constituents are in the process of having 
their say on in a tele-vote. My constituents are going to give me 
their input and then I will come back to the House with a private 
member's bill reflecting their wishes.
<P>
	I know this concept of voter consultation is alien to many Liberal 
members, but trust me on this one. If they were to ask Canadians 
whether they favoured scrapping or amending section 745, 
Canadians would vote to scrap it in a second. Section 745 of the 
Criminal Code nullifies the penalty for first degree murder. It 
provides murderers an opportunity for a judicial review of their 
parole ineligibility after they have served just 15 years of a life 
sentence.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, victims' groups, the Canadian Police 
Association and a majority of Canadians believe section 745 
should be eliminated completely. Nothing except the full 
elimination of that section is acceptable to the Reform Party, and 
98 per cent of our delegates at our national convention in June 
voted for its complete elimination after debating and voting on this 
issue.
<P>
	Bill C-45 strips multiple or serial killers of the right to apply for 
early parole. However, this applies only to multiple murders 
committed after the passage of the bill. This creates categories of 
killers. There will be good killers and bad killers.
<P>
	In true Liberal fashion, good killers are granted special status. 
This seems to be the hallmark of the government. Got a problem? 
Give some group or organization special status and that will fix 
everything. Want to get around being able to hire people on merit? 
Just give special status, preferential hiring for certain people. It 
goes on and on. Liberals cater to one group at the expense of 
another, call it a progressive policy and then criticize anyone who 
questions their approach.
<P>
	In any event, good killers will have the right to appeal for early 
release from prison while bad killers will serve out their life 
sentence.
<P>
	As of December 1995 there were 574 first degree murderers 
incarcerated in Canada. Of those, approximately 5 per cent were 
multiple killers, so-called bad killers. Multiple killers sentenced 
after the passage of Bill C-45 will not be eligible to apply for a 
reduction, but this does not appease people like Mr. and Mrs. 
Rosenfeldt, whose son was murdered by serial killer Clifford 
Olson. The Rosenfeldts, the Mahaffys, the Frenches and many 
other Canadians will not be satisfied until multiple killers receive 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4548"> 4548 </A></B>
<P>
fair and just penalties, consecutive life sentences for each of the 
lives they took. Clifford Olson should be serving 11 consecutive 
life sentences.
<P>
	As well, if the jury denies them a reduction in their application 
for early parole, the provisions of section 745 will allow them to 
appeal again and again. The same process will be applicable to all 
first degree murderers.
<P>
	Let me finish by saying that Bill C-45 and a review of the killer's 
application by a judge will do nothing but add an expensive layer of 
bureaucracy to a growing justice industry. Bill C-45 is nothing but 
the government's-

Canadians are distressed about the cutbacks to the CBC, but thanks 
to the Liberal government there is a new CBC that is taking over 
Canadian media. It is the Conrad Black Corporation.
<P>
	The Conrad Black Corporation will bring cost effective and 
sanitized news coverage. It will not waste money or time on 
bringing balanced reporting. Mr. Black's president, Mr. Radler, has 
said their newspapers will not even bother reporting fairly on issues 
raised by New Democrats who, by the way, speak for middle class 
working Canadians.
<P>
	The investigation of the Hollinger's monopoly has been dropped 
by the Federal Bureau of Competition Policy. Why? It is because 
Conrad Black sent $12,500 to the Liberal Party and $11,000 to the 
Reform Party. These contributions help in Conrad's bid to be the 
new unfettered and very biased CBC.
<P>
	While the old CBC is being dismantled, Liberals will have a new 
corporate network to advertise their vision of tax loopholes for the 
rich at the expense of program cuts for middle class Canadians. It 
is, after all, Conrad Black's corporation and he believes that only 
the wealthy and big corporations really matter.

Officer of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, stated: 
``The political climate in Quebec has no impact on investors' 
decisions, and I do not see why it should''.
<P>
	It is high time that the Prime Minister and the members of his 
government stopped looking outside their own backyard for the 
causes of Canada's and Quebec's weak economy and start taking 
action to help unemployed Canadians regain their dignity by 
finding jobs.
<P>
	Canada's official unemployment rate stands at 9.4 per cent 
compared to 5.1 per cent in the U.S. The reality is that, while more 
than 1.5 million Canadians are looking for work, their Prime 
Minister and his government are acting irresponsibly instead of 
looking for ways to help them. What is the Prime Minister waiting 
for?

Speaker, September 21, 1996 marked the fifth anniversary of 
political independence and the end to communist rule in Armenia.
<P>
	Following the 1915 genocide, the Armenian nation first gained 
independence from the Ottoman Empire on May 28, 1918. 
Unfortunately, this independence was to last only a few short years 
until

the communist takeover on December 2, 1920. After 70 years of 
communist tyranny, the Armenian nation once again gained its 
independence with the disintegration of the U.S.S.R.
<P>
	Canadians of Armenian origin have made a significant 
contribution to the Canadian cultural mosiac. They continue to 
grow and prosper in Canada by embracing the democratic 
principles of freedom, justice and equality that exemplifies the 
Canadian way. We wish for the continued and speedy growth of 
freedom and democracy in Armenia.

<P>
	We all recall that, in the last election campaign, the separatists 
promised that all federal employees in Quebec would have jobs 
should Quebec become independent. After the majority voted no in 
the last referendum, federal public servants are now being told that, 
if and when there is another referendum, they should go and see the 
federal government if they want to keep their jobs.
<P>
	How do you like that? The PQ and BQ want Quebec to separate 
from Canada but would have the Canadian government keep 
federal employees living in Quebec on its payroll after Quebec 
becomes independent. Federal employees have seen through the 
separatists' little game. Next time, an even stronger majority will 
vote no.

poster in Quebec City depicting their opposition parties on an 
evolutionary scale with Reform at the bottom of the chain.
<P>
	It is curious that these posters were unveiled at a time when the

	It seems the Liberals have little tolerance for opposing

Reform in the last election.

this sleazy Tory tactic. Now it appears that the Liberals are 
stooping to the very same sleazy Tory tactics.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last weekend, two other generals broke the wall of silence 
and added their voices to those of the military who challenge 
General Boyle's leadership.
<P>
	Generals Vernon and MacKenzie had very harsh words for the 
Chief of Staff. The fact is that, in spite of the  efforts made by the 
Prime Minister and his defence minister to plug the holes, the ship 
is taking on water everywhere.
<P>
	Given the new and very harsh criticisms that were levelled not 
only at General Boyle, but also at the Prime Minister, who is 
accused of not being loyal to the armed forces, will the Prime

and to personally intervene to settle the leadership problem that 
exists at DND and at the head of the Canadian Armed Forces?

<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the mark of a 
democratic society is that individuals are free to criticize the 
government. It is not unusual for governments to be criticized by 
former politicians. I have to say that one of the many blessings I 
have as Minister of National Defence is that from time to time 
many former members of the armed forces pop up and make 
certain contributions to public debate.
<P>
	Generally those contributions are constructive. In some cases 
they are critical. That is the right of those individuals. In some 
cases they are uncomfortable with the direction in which we are 
taking the armed forces. In other cases it is to set the record straight 
and to put their own time in office in a certain light with respect to 
posterity.
<P>
	This is quite normal in a democracy and it certainly does not 
shake our resolve to continue the course that we have embarked on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, these are not ordinary citizens taking part in a debate. We 
are talking about generals, the highest ranked officers in the 
Canadian army, who, as soon as they leave the military, express 
their feeling of helplessness over the lack of leadership in the 
forces.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	The minister can talk about a public debate in our great society, 
but what is truly extraordinary is to have an army with no leader 
and no minister. It appears that, in some cases, soldiers are now 
ashamed to wear their uniform, because of the lack of leadership at 
the national defence department. On August 29, General Boyle said 
in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that he would resign if his leadership was 
questioned.
<P>
	Could the defence minister tell General Boyle on our behalf that 
his original statement on his leadership was far preferable to his 
present desperate attempt to hang on to his job as Chief of Staff, 
when he no longer has credibility? Could the minister convey the 
message to General Boyle?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, in the House, members must always 
address the Speaker and not one another.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can 
understand your confusion between the hon. member and me in the 
way we look. I can say that we share fundamentally different 
convictions about the country and about the direction of the armed 
forces.
<P>
	I am quite surprised by what the hon. member has said. 
Somehow he has elevated the position of a general officer retired 
<P>
from the armed forces into some privileged position within 
Canadian society. Well, I have news for him. We are all equals in 
Canadian society, whether we are ex-generals, plumbers or 
carpenters. We all have the right to take part in the democratic 
process and express our views.
<P>
	The hon. member sat through the questioning last week. He did 
not take part in it. I think he understands the process. It is a process 
which he supported, and the former Bloc leader, now the premier of 
Quebec, supported when he was in the House, which is to have an 
open, independent inquiry so that all the issues can be heard and 
that no individual, no circumstances should be judged in isolation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week the Prime Minister spoke of the major job of 
making cuts and reorganizing the Armed Forces, which his 
Minister of Defence and chief of defence staff had ahead of them.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. I cannot ask it of 
the Minister of Defence, for he is protecting himself now. Will the 
Prime Minister admit that such cutbacks and reorganization require 
total credibility and that, under the present circumstances, neither 
the Minister of Defence nor General Boyle inspire sufficient 
confidence among military personnel to acquit themselves of this 
important task? Could the Deputy Minister respond?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it would be 
useful if the hon. member were to talk to his colleague, the hon. 
member for Rimouski-Témiscouata. Last week on RDI she said 
that the armed forces were in need of a good house cleaning. I 
believe those were her words; I do not have the French translation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I believe she said that the Canadian Forces needed a good 
housecleaning, and that Mr. Collenette-pardon me for using my 
name-was the one who needed to do it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In other words his own colleague two seats away expressed 
confidence in me and I am very grateful to continue with the work I 
am doing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Last week, the Prime 
Minister attempted to make light of what General Clive Addy had 
to say by describing it as the words of a frustrated individual, who 
was not pleased at having been forced to leave the Army and was 
therefore criticizing the Armed Forces. Now it is General Lewis 
Mackenzie's turn to question the leadership of the Armed Forces, 
and even the loyalty of the Prime Minister, by saying: ``He is very 
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4553"> 4553 </A></B>
<P>
loyal to his staff, which I find admirable, but he ought to be equally 
loyal to the Army.''
<P>
	How can the Deputy Prime Minister again ignore the extremely 
harsh criticisms of the Prime Minister being made by other retired 
generals?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member seems to be preoccupied with the remarks of former 
officers of the Canadian Armed Forces. What I am concerned with 
are the views and opinions of serving officers of the armed forces. I 
met with the leadership last week and despite the problems, despite 
all of the things that are going on that make them feel rather bad 
and which are bad for the institution, they are solid in their support 
and they want to continue forward.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to General MacKenzie, they are so proud they are afraid 
to wear their headgear when driving. That is the situation.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. How can the 
government continue to play down what is going on, when never in 
the history of the armed forces have we seen so much questioning 
of and dissatisfaction with a chief of staff, whom the minister keeps 
defending?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of Canada's 
prominent historians, Desmond Morton, said some time ago on a 
radio program that there are always problems with peacetime 
armies.
<P>
	What we are facing in Canada is not unlike what our allies are 
facing. I raised this last week. It happened also after the second 
world war. When there is a massive demobilization of resources 
and personnel, it creates a lot  of disquiet among the ranks. After 
all, the military is a very hierarchical and very authoritarian 
organization and when rapid change is thrust upon it, it makes it 
very difficult for the institution to accept.
<P>
	However, I have to say that after nearly three years in the job, I 
am impressed with the men and women of the armed forces and 
what they have done to accommodate the changes, to accommodate 
the budget cuts, the reduction of personnel and the introduction of 
private sector methods in terms of purchasing. All of that they have 
done in an exemplary fashion.
<P>
	I would only hope that hon. members opposite could focus on the 
good things the men and women of the armed forces have done and 
not on the negative things.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister talks about what a great job the military troops are doing. I 
say that is absolutely true, but it is in spite of his leadership, not 
because of it.
<P>
	The minister also just said that he would like to hear from 
serving officers. The truth is that these people are afraid to talk. 
Only when there is safety in retirement do people like 
Major-Generals Brian Vernon and Lewis MacKenzie say things 
like: ``Jean Boyle has lost the trust of his troops and should resign. 
He is not credible to those who are serving this country. Soldiers 
are embarrassed to wear their uniforms in public''. What a sad day 
it is when we see soldiers and troops who are absolutely ashamed to 
drive around in their vehicles in their uniforms.
<P>
	My question to the defence minister is this, and I will give him a 
hint that this is no riddle: Just how many major-generals does it 
take to get the defence minister to do the honourable thing and fire 
Jean Boyle?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I forget my 
lines from Gilbert and Sullivan, but if I could recite them I am sure 
the hon. member would have a place in them.
<P>
	The deputy critic of the Reform Party on the weekend on CBC 
said: ``I do not wish to convict General Boyle. I would like to see 
him out of the seat right now because I think he is doing 
tremendous damage to the forces''. What the hon. deputy critic said 
was that he was asking for removal, not for dismissal.
<P>
	Again, we have two separate points of view from members of the 
Reform Party. The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands, who is 
not here today, went on to say-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Beaver River.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, my 
colleague did say that the very least Jean Boyle could do out of a 
sense of honour would be to step aside and if he is proven innocent, 
then that is fine and he can  return to his job. There is certainly no 
shame in saying that.
<P>
	Lewis Mackenzie hit the nail right on the head this weekend 
again when he spoke out. I always listen to guys named Lew; 
believe me, I know it is safe. He said that the Prime Minister and 
the defence minister were putting stubborn political pride before 
their duty to the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4554"> 4554 </A></B>
<P>
	Rank and file soldiers feel tainted by the Somalia scandal 
because the Liberal government has failed to do the right thing, the 
honourable thing, and ask Jean Boyle to resign.
<P>
	I ask the minister, or perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister: Why 
are they sacrificing their duty to the men and women of the 
Canadian Armed Forces to protect their pitiful political pride?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad the 
hon. member allowed me the occasion to find another citation from 
the deputy critic of the Reform Party. He said: ``There is a whole 
bunch of excellent people in the armed forces. Super people and 
good leaders as well. Unhappily, the tar or the mud that is being 
flung at the top is floating down and sticking to some of these 
people''. Who is flinging the tar and the mud? It is the opposition.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
only people who are flinging mud right now are those people who 
have served in the armed forces and know full well what is going 
on there and what the morale has stooped to.
<P>
	Jean Boyle can no longer lead the Canadian Armed Forces. It is 
as simple as that and I do not know why he cannot get it through his 
head. By blaming his subordinates, Boyle has lost the confidence 
of his troops. The Prime Minister and the defence minister are no 
better. These big boys prefer to puff out their chests in some macho 
defence of General Boyle instead of simply admitting they were 
wrong.
<P>
	I ask the minister one more time, will he just forget about his 
political pride, his political record of not firing people? Will he just 
put aside this political huffing and puffing once and for all, admit 
he was wrong and fire Jean Boyle?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
answered these questions for what I think is the sixth day in a row.
<P>
	There is a commission of inquiry. The inquiry will look at all the 
facts of concern to the hon. member. When the inquiry finishes its

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a study published last week, Royal Bank analysts 
estimated that using part of the surplus of the unemployment 
insurance fund to lower premium rates would create tens of 
thousands of jobs in Canada. It will be recalled that the surplus in 
the unemployment insurance fund will reach five billion dollars 
this year.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. When will the Prime 
Minister announce a reduction in premium rates in order to create 
thousands of new jobs, instead of using the money of workers and 
companies solely to lower his deficit?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member 
knows, the unemployment insurance premiums are set in the fall in 
conjunction with the Minister of Finance and the Minister for 
Human Resources Development. That will be announced when the 
decision has been made.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, bureaucratic explanations are not what we want, we want 
to see the government doing something to create jobs. Here is a 
golden opportunity to lower premium rates, lower payroll taxes, 
which do nothing but kill jobs, and create these jobs. Instead of 
that, I get a bureaucratic answer. In the 1994 budget, the Minister 
of Finance said himself that lowering unemployment insurance 
premiums by 7 per cent would result in the creation of 40,000 jobs.
<P>
	I put the question to the Deputy Prime Minister, to the 
government, or to whomever is at the helm: When are you going to 
take action?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question of jobs is 
an interesting one. We have already had some 669,000 new jobs 
since this government took office. We have already dropped 
unemployment insurance premiums from over $3 at the time we 
were elected to the present level which is substantially below that.
<P>
	We already have those job creation schemes. There have been 
some 766,000 new jobs in the private sector alone since we were 
elected, some 80,000 jobs last month. Job creation is this 
government's job and we are doing it.

Speaker, since the Liberals returned to power, the government has 
been shameless in its favouritism in dealing with the carrier 
Canadian. The Minister of Transport, after blocking Air Canada's 
access to the Asian market, did a repeat this summer by taking 
away its route to the Czech Republic and giving it to its competitor, 
Canadian.
<P>
	Air Canada's traditional market, Europe and the United States, 
becomes more and more accessible to Canadian, and meanwhile, 
the Canadian government keeps Air Canada away from the most 
lucrative routes on the Asian market: the old double standard.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that favouring Canadian over Air 
Canada means 7,000 Air Canada jobs in Quebec are in jeopardy?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the policy of the government with respect to our two 
major carriers is one of even-handedness. Air Canada for example, 
the company the hon. member is concerned about, is flying to Asia, 
Hong Kong and Japan for the first time as a result of decisions by 
this government.
<P>
	I would remind the hon. member, with respect to the route to 
Hong Kong he mentioned, we negotiated with the Hong Kong 
authorities who agreed with exactly the number of flights per week 
that Air Canada asked for. The result was that when Air Canada 
established its route shortly after we had been dealing with the 
Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong authorities, it now 
wishes to have a change. The trouble is that Hong Kong has many 
things on its mind at the present time, including the establishment 
of a brand new facility on Lan Tao Island which will indeed be the 
world's most modern airport when it is opened.

American Airlines has with Canadian. In fact, British Airways also 
has links with it. However, Air Canada has links with Lufthansa

because of its links with Lufthansa because it may benefit 
Lufthansa or some German provider of services, I think that would 
be absurd.

<P>
	This minister and his chief of defence staff have lost the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is a sad day in the development of our military. The minister has 
created a culture of fear in his  own department, ordinary rank and

marshalled on the way to the inquiry. Top generals are told by the 
Prime Minister if they do not like it they should quit and get out.
<P>

a possible fencing in of the areas. When we were there we had 
protective foot gear and lo and behold a number of students came in

	Some time ago, the Minister of Canadian Heritage criticized the 
CBC for not doing enough, in her view, to promote Canadian unity.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the budget cuts imposed on the CBC,

anger with the CBC for apparently not doing enough to promote 
Canadian unity?
<P>

	Does the Minister of Canadian Heritage not realize that, had she 
not wasted $45 million on all kinds of gadgets to promote national 
unity and sunk $100 million  into a broadcast fund she wants 
control over, the $127 million in funding she just took away from 
the CBC could have been maintained? How much more does the 
minister plan to divert from cultural institutions just for her 
propaganda purposes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

those to government operations in general is simply not true. The 
CBC cuts amount to 23 per cent, which is less than the cuts 
sustained by individual government departments.

television. The massive cuts this minister undertook at the CBC 
last week shows she has absolutely no vision for the future of the 
CBC. That lack of vision has created across the board cuts that 
threaten both radio and television.
<P>
	Will she admit to the House that she again has broken a Liberal 
election promise with respect to the CBC funding?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party says the 
cuts took place last week. The cuts were announced last February 
and amounted to a total cut to the corporation of approximately 23 
per cent, something which certainly is going to be very difficult for 
the CBC to carry out. It is something that I believe, with the 
creativity of the management and the board of the CBC, will 
certainly be within their power to carry out.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>

number of things this year compared with last year. First of all, the 
catch rates were better. In the sentinel survey in some cases the 
catch was double to 25 times greater than last year. The fish are 
larger and the size range is greater.
<P>

mentioned to her last week, both from Îles-de-la-Madeleine as well 
as from residents of P.E.I., to get this environmental ticking bomb 
up and out safely from the bottom of the ocean, which is exactly 
what happened this summer.

	The Irvings have agreed, which they did not do last year, to 
destroy the PCB contaminated fuel. This can cost anywhere 
between $2 million and $10 million. That will be absorbed 
completely by the Irving company.
<P>
	The Government of Canada and I support very strongly the 
polluter pay principle. That is why, once all the bills are in, 
estimated at between $30 million and $35 million, we will make an 
application to the oil pollution fund. In that way we can recoup on 
behalf of the taxpayers every single last penny of that $35 million.

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the finance minister or in his absence 
for his representative.
<P>
	I remind the House that in the October 1993 campaign the 
Deputy Prime Minister said: ``Food isn't subject to GST because 
it's a necessity and so are books''. A year earlier the government 
whip stated: ``GST on reading material is a bad policy and 
undemocratic. It creates more unemployment''.
<P>
	Have these members forgotten they made these statements and 
that Liberal policy during the campaign affirms a tax free status on 
reading material?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question of the tax 
base is an important one. The member of the Reform Party should 
be aware of what her party has said.
<P>
	The Reform Party has said that it would include a policy that 
would tax food and drugs, which would make the GST more 
effective. That is the policy of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Now the hon. member has complaints about the tax on books. 
Where would the money come to replace those funds? That is the 
question I have for the Reform Party.

the attempt by the Liberal government to push through a package of 
cuts to the Canada pension plan benefits, including cuts to people 
with disabilities, by early October.
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister listen to New Democrats,

increased revenues by dint of tax increases alone. That is entirely 
false.
<P>
	We have seen revenues grow, as most governments have. The 
vast majority of those increases have come from economic growth 
alone. In fact, the government has not raised personal income tax

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am now ready to rule on the question of 
privilege raised by the hon. member for Crowfoot on September 
16, 1996 concerning the proceedings of the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs on Bill C-234, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to thank the chief government whip, the hon. 
members for St. Albert, Mission-Coquitlam, Fraser Valley East, 
Lethbridge, Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Calgary North, 
Okanagan-Shuswap, Wild Rose, and Yorkton-Melville, and the 
sponsor of the bill, the hon. member for York South-Weston, for 
their contributions in this matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In their comments, members informed the House that the 
standing committee had dealt with the bill, defeating every clause, 
and had decided not to report the bill back to the House. In his 
submission, the hon. member for Crowfoot stated that the 
committee had breached his privileges as a member of the House 
by having voted in its meeting of June 18, 1996 not to report Bill 
C-234 back to the House. He also contended that members of the 
justice committee were in contempt of Parliament for their actions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Any matter concerning the privileges of members, particularly 
any matter which may constitute a contempt of the House, is 
always taken very seriously by the Speaker.
<P>
	It should be made clear at the outset-and this is a longstanding 
principle-that it is not for the Chair to get involved in matters 
within a committee unless there is something so extreme and so 
blatant that it goes beyond accepted limits and constitutes a 
contempt of the House or, in some inordinate way, a breach of 
privilege on an hon. member.
<P>
	As noted in Beauchesne's sixth edition, Citation 24, which was 
quoted in part by the hon. member for Crowfoot, ``the privileges of 
Parliament are rights which are absolutely necessary for the due 
execution of its powers''. As hon. members know, these privileges 
are precious. They exist in order to ensure that members individu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4561"> 4561 </A></B>
<P>
ally and the House as a whole can properly  discharge their 
functions as the elected representatives of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	But at the same time, parliamentary privilege is limited. It 
ensures freedom of speech and, by extension, the right of every 
member to vote freely on matters before the House. It also ensures 
that the House has the unimpeded service of its members. Finally, 
privilege exists to maintain the authority and the dignity of the 
House. While the matter before us is serious, I am more inclined to 
view it as a substantive grievance rather than as a question of 
privilege.
<P>
	That being said, this grievance is serious enough that it warrants 
further comments.
<P>
	As all members know, committees are the creatures of the 
House. When a bill is referred to a committee, that committee is 
empowered to examine that bill, amend it if in the opinion of the 
committee it is in need of amendment, and to report the bill to the 
House with or without amendment. These powers are explicitly 
stated in citation 831(2) of Beachesne's sixth edition, which was 
quoted by several members. While it is often said that committees 
are masters of their own destiny, they do remain subsidiary to the 
House and cannot substitute themselves for the main body. 
Bourinot's commentary in his fourth edition, at pages 520 and 521 
makes this quite clear. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every committee on a public bill is bound to report thereon. The House alone has 
power to prevent its passage or to order its withdrawal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	This comment is based on a Canadian precedent dated May 14, 
1886, and is found in the Senate <I>Debates</I> at pages 516 and 517.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On the other hand, unless the House specifically sets a date for a 
committee to report a bill back to the House, the bill remains in the 
possession of the committee until such time as it is reported to the 
House. While a committee should always endeavour to report a bill 
to the House in a timely fashion, having decided not to report the 
bill does not preclude the committee revisiting the bill and 
reporting it to the House at a later date. Therefore, the justice 
committee's decision not to report Bill C-234 to the House at this 
time is not an offence against the authority or dignity of the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Hon. members should keep in mind that the House always has 
the power to modify the terms of the committal of a bill to any 
committee. Should a member or a minister be of the opinion that a 
committee charged with the review of a bill is defying the authority 
of the House, he or she may choose to bring it to the attention of the 
House by placing on notice a motion to require the  committee to 
report by a certain date. As hon. members know, this can indeed be 
done under Government Orders or Private Members' Business, but 
such a notice of motion could also be placed under the rubric 
``Motions'' and be dealt with under Routine Proceedings. As 
Speaker Fraser ruled on July 13, 1988, at page 17506 of the 
<I>Debates</I>, referring to the then Standing Order 56(1)(p), which is 
our current Standing Order 67(1)(p):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This Standing Order lists as debatable items usually raised under Routine 
Proceedings ``motions-[concerning] the management of the [House] business 
[and] the arrangement of its proceedings.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The rubric ``Motions'' usually encompasses matters related to the management of 
the business of the House and its committees, but it is not the exclusive purview of 
the government, despite the government's unquestioned prerogative to determine the 
agenda of business before the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Under our current practices, the Chair may well accept, after due 
notice, such a motion, on the condition that it is strictly limited to 
the terms of the committal of a bill to a committee and that it is not 
an attempt to interfere with the committee's proceedings thereon. 
In so doing, the House would have an opportunity to determine 
whether the bill should remain in committee or be reported back.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In our procedures, the House must always retain control over 
business it refers to committee. In different circumstances, a 
situation could arise whereby a majority of members, regardless of 
party, might, for whatever reason, decide to remove or not remove 
a bill, even a government bill, from committee.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-234 is the property of the House which it has delegated to 
the justice committee to examine. As with any bill referred to 
committee, the House would usually wait for the justice committee 
to report. However, should the House be of the opinion that the bill 
has remained with the committee too long it can look into the 
matter.
<P>
	Speaker Fraser noted in ruling on a similar matter on February 
26, 1992 at page 7624 of the debates:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If the House wishes to take cognizance of this, if the House wishes to exercise its 
authority, then of course it may do so. But in my view, it would not be correct or 
proper at the present time for the Speaker to intervene.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I concur with Speaker Fraser's view.
<P>
	Since hon. members and the House have a remedy to their 
grievance I cannot find that the decision taken by the committee 
has prevented members from expressing their opinions or attending 
to their parliamentary functions. Therefore there was no breach of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4562"> 4562 </A></B>
<P>
privilege because the capacity of honourable members to carry on  
their duties as members of the House has not been impaired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Again, I thank the hon. members for raising this important 
matter.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I move that the third report of the Standing Committee on

<P>
	I would like to split my time with the hon. member for St.

committee on the issue of Canadian tax property some harsh 
criticism of the auditor general's report.
<P>
	While the report accepts as proper the auditor general's criticism 
of government policies, institutions and practices which lead to 
waste and inefficiency, it considers inappropriate any criticism 
which involves waste or inefficiencies due to the actions of 
bureaucrats.
<P>
	The latter type of criticism-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> On a point of order, the hon. 
member for Mississauga South.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4563"> 4563 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask the Chair to clarify 
whether it is necessary for the House to give unanimous consent 
for the concurrence of that motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The answer to the question 
raised by the hon. member for Mississauga South is no. This 
business is on the Order Paper and Notice Paper as item No. 2, and 
so we will proceed with the business of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will continue with my debate. The 
latter type of criticism is seen to involve allegedly inappropriate 
second guessing of decisions reached by bureaucrats carrying out 
their assigned functions in good faith.
<P>
	I believe this distinction between these two types of criticism 
made by the auditor general is inappropriate. Waste and 
inefficiency occur both because the government sets the wrong 
policies and because bureaucrats err in the interpretation of what 
might be ambiguous directions flowing from the laws that guide 
their actions.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	For example, consider that the auditor general discovers that 
government policies have seriously damaged coastal fishing in 
Canada. In my view, it does not matter whether this damage has 
occurred as a result of a faulty regulation passed by Parliament or 
whether it is due to the judgment of bureaucrats in the field who 
have erred in the interpretation of empirical evidence.
<P>
	Let me now turn to my personal interpretation of the validity of 
the points raised by the auditor general. He noted that the intent of 
the Canadian law on the taxation of all capital gains may not have 
been carried out as a result of faulty decisions made by bureaucrats 
in the Department of Finance.
<P>
	I listened with great interest to the presentation of a number of 
complex issues by representatives of the finance department as 
well as a group of distinguished lawyers specializing in foreign 
taxation. In brief, here is what I have learned.
<P>
	Whenever Canadians decide to move abroad permanently they 
have to pay taxes on accrued capital gains. This can be done easily 
and fairly for capital gains associated with stocks, bonds and other 
assets for which objectively determined prices exist. However, 
some assets, in particular real estate and privately held companies, 
can be evaluated reliably only when they are traded. In addition, 
the market for such assets may be depressed, and forcing a sale 
would not be in the interests of either the emigrant or the Canadian 
taxpayer.
<P>
	It therefore seems to be fair and reasonable that the Parliament 
of Canada has permitted emigrants to declare such assets to be 
treated as so-called taxable Canadian property, which means that 
capital gains are taxable in Canada only when such property is sold. 
However, there  is a complication. If the sale takes place 10 or more 
years after emigration, according to bilateral international 
agreements the sale of the property results in capital gains taxes 
payable to the country of the emigrant's new residence. Since 
Canada is a country of large net immigration, this provision 
appears to work in our country's favour though, to the best of my 
knowledge, this has not been verified empirically.
<P>
	Family trusts in law are treated much like people. When the trust 
is shifted abroad, readily valued capital gains are taxed 
immediately and others are registered as taxable Canadian 
property. The trust at the heart of the controversy owns very large 
claims on privately held business in Canada which therefore escape 
the payment of capital gains taxes upon moving abroad.
<P>
	The auditor general argued that the transactions surrounding the 
movement abroad of this trust violates the spirit of the law that 
capital gains taxes have to be paid on all accrued capital gains. 
However, this argument involves a narrow interpretation of 
domestic law and neglects the existence of international taxation 
agreements which always take precedence over domestic law.
<P>
	I think Revenue Canada treated the trust in question 
appropriately. If it had acted differently, it would have violated the 
right of equal treatment under the law for all.
<P>
	The Finance committee hearings brought up some other issues 
like the use and timing of some advance rulings and the shift of 
assets from publicly traded firms to privately held companies. I did 
get the impression that some of these actions were motivated by the 
desire to minimize tax applications of the trust upon emigration. 
This is disturbing in a sense. But given the complexity of taxation 
laws, I cannot blame owners of large assets for hiring the best 
lawyers available to help them minimize their tax liabilities.
<P>
	I heard no evidence that the letter of the Canadian law had been 
broken by these transactions. The entire episode reinforced my 
conviction that Canada needs a simplified, flatter system of 
taxation.
<P>
	Let me now turn to what I found wrong with the administration 
of the law pertaining to taxable Canadian property. Officials have 
acknowledged that they have less than complete information about 
the disposal of such property after the emigrants move abroad and 
that therefore some capital escapes untaxed.
<P>
	To deal with this problem the committee report recommended 
that the immigrants be required to register their Canadian taxable 
property and to pay a security which would be applied to tax 
application whenever the property was sold.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4564"> 4564 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	I agree with the registration requirement recommended and 
frankly I am surprised that it did not exist in the past. If the 
imposition of this regulation is the only result of the inquiry, the 
auditor general can be proud.
<P>
	However, to keep costs down and laws fair, I recommend that the 
government does not impose the requirement for security on 
emigrants. I suggest that instead the government use existing 
information and resources by putting a conditional lien on real 
estate held as taxable Canadian property.
<P>
	Revenue Canada's operational division can be required to report 
when relevant assets change ownership in the case of privately held 
companies. These provisions would be very cheap since they 
involve existing knowledge and institutions. This recommendation 
is at the core of the Reform Party's minority report.
<P>
	Let me note in closing that during the finance committee 
hearings I repeatedly listened to some people advancing 
propositions about deliberate tax evasion, collusion of the Revenue 
Canada officials and their political bosses with wealthy Canadians 
to avoid taxes, and biases in the technical testimony given by tax 
lawyers. In spite of serious efforts on my part, in no case could I 
discover any evidence of wrongdoing.
<P>
	I may have a mental block on this issue or my intellectual 
capacity is inadequate to capture the intricacies of taxation laws 
and alleged conspiracies. I have similar problems with conspiracy 
theories about the assassination of President Kennedy, the current 
fiscal crisis of government and the death of Elvis Presley. 
Rationally I cannot rule out that these conspiracies exist, but I have 
accepted that I may have to die without ever knowing for sure 
whether or not they are true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last May 
the auditor general tabled his report in this House. In that report he 
included a chapter regarding the family trusts which he believed 
should be brought to the attention of this House. With hindsight, I 
think he was absolutely correct in doing so.
<P>
	Just today for example, the Minister of National Revenue in this 
House not even an hour ago said that the report by the finance 
committee on the issue would ``ameliorate the deficiencies in her 
department''.
<P>
	The report by the finance committee was based on the referral of 
the family trust issue to the committee. The mandate given by the 
Minister of Finance was not to pass judgment on the work of the 
auditor general but to look into the matter regarding the taxation of 
family trusts.
<P>
	I find it disconcerting that the finance committee would take the 
mandate that was given to it and go beyond that mandate and pass 
judgment and comment on  the work of the auditor general who is 
an officer of this House, not an officer of the committee.
<P>
	If I may quote from the finance committee report, on page 6 it 
states: ``Revenue Canada and the Department of Finance could 
have more fully documented the decision making process that led 
to the rulings''. That has to be one of the great understatements of 
this Parliament.
<P>
	Let me give a quick synopsis of the documentation as the auditor 
general found it. On December 3, 1991, Revenue Canada advised 
the Department of Finance of the proposed transactions and that it 
intended to refuse to grant a favourable ruling.
<P>
	On December 12 Revenue Canada's rulings review committee 
decided that a favourable ruling should not be provided. On the 
same day, Revenue Canada advised finance that it would not rule 
and requested finance to leave the interpretation of the act to it.
<P>
	On December 16 the taxpayers' representatives were advised 
that a favourable ruling would not be provided.
<P>
	On December 18 Revenue Canada informed the taxpayers' 
representatives that it could not accept their offer of December 16, 
1991.
<P>
	On December 18, a memorandum was prepared for the assistant 
deputy minister of Revenue Canada advising the deputy minister 
that the department was unable to rule favourably.
<P>
	On December 23 a revised memorandum is prepared for the 
deputy minister advising that the taxpayers' proposal is not 
acceptable.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	That is a document of the transactions in this case.
<P>
	On December 23, the very same day the memorandum was 
prepared saying that it was not acceptable, all records of all 
meetings ceased. Somehow later that day there was a complete and 
absolute turnaround in the decision making by the Department of 
National Revenue admittedly at the urging of the Department of 
Finance. The ruling was completely and absolutely reversed.
<P>
	The point the auditor general brought to the attention of this 
House was that an issue of this magnitude affecting hundreds of 
millions of dollars of tax revenue, whether the ruling was right or 
wrong, the process by which they arrived at the decision that was 
ultimately communicated was absolutely and totally unjustified. 
There was no documentation whatsoever that the auditor general 
could find to support the favourable ruling. Every meeting that was 
documented from the time it was first received until the day a 
turnaround was done said they could not justify granting a 
favourable ruling.
<P>
	It was not whether or not the issue was correct. It was the method 
by which it was done. As the auditor general has stated, as an 
officer of this House, as an auditor,  when he finds this type of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4565"> 4565 </A></B>
<P>
decision making, what else is he to do but to bring it to the attention 
of the House?
<P>
	That he did and that he was absolutely correct in doing. For that, 
he has been chastized by the finance committee. If I may quote 
from page 3 of the report: ``It would be asking too much however to 
expect the auditor general also to scrutinize the day to day work of 
each of the many technical professionals in the public service''. 
Going on: ``In short, the auditor general cannot be asked to 
intervene in the public servants' reasonable exercise of their 
professional judgment''.
<P>
	Is this reasonable exercise of their professional judgment? 
Absolutely not. The whole paper trail says that they were going to 
rule adversely and somehow, somebody in one day turned that 
absolutely and completely around.
<P>
	Continuing on, the report says: ``Public servants, like other 
workers cannot be held to an impossible standard of perfection. 
Provided their actions are reasonable, professionally competent 
and carried out in good faith, they should be allowed to do their 
work without fear of being pilloried many years later for those 
actions''. There is no way the actions by Revenue Canada can be 
considered reasonable, professionally competent and carried out in 
good faith when there is no documentation to support their decision 
making.
<P>
	Another issue I would like to bring up is the report by the finance 
committee criticizing the auditor general for allowing the breach of 
the confidentiality rule as far as Revenue Canada is concerned. 
That is a hypocrisy, if I may say so.
<P>
	We have before us at this time Bill C-41 and page 16 says: ``The 
information banks that may be searched under this part are the 
information banks designated by the regulations from among the 
information banks controlled by the Department of National Health 
and Welfare, the Department of National Revenue and the Canada 
Employment and Immigration Commission''.
<P>
	The Divorce Act is being amended to allow the information bank 
of the Department of National Revenue to be available to be 
searched. Therefore, this idea that the auditor general has breached 
the confidentiality of the Income Tax Act is a hypocrisy on behalf 
of the government.
<P>
	The finance committee should respect the mandate given to it by 
the Minister of Finance: to investigate the circumstances 
surrounding this family trust. Therefore, I would like to move an 
amendment. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the words ``September 
18, 1996'' and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``be not now concurred in but that it be recommitted to the Standing Committee on 
Finance with instruction to amend the same to remove all references to the mandate 
of the auditor general.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment proposed 
by the hon. member for St. Albert is in order.
<P>
	We still have a period of questions or comments to the hon. 
member for St. Albert.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the member for St. Albert. He talked about the issue 
of confidentiality in the income tax system. This is a very 
important issue. It was touched on by virtue of the auditor general's 
investigation in this matter.
<P>
	For those people who do not know, our system is based on a 
certain integrity of the system. Information that is given to 
Revenue Canada is basically confidential. In other words, if any 
one of us here submitted our income tax return to Revenue Canada, 
we would not anticipate that another person could get that 
information and use it for whatever purpose.
<P>
	I would be interested to know the comments of the member 
because I know he has some experience in the area of accounting 
and possibly auditing.
<P>
	When we choose an audit sample, the idea is to get a sampling of 
what is going on in a department or a typical population base, but 
we must be certain when we direct this at something as sensitive as 
Revenue Canada that the population base is basically large. In other 
words, we want to know as a general rule how certain procedures of 
Revenue Canada are undertaken. It is incumbent on the auditor 
general to respect the confidentiality of the system in choosing that 
audit sample.
<P>
	In reading the report of the auditor general, I was somewhat 
chagrined to discover that the audit sample represented only one or 
two cases. The problem with that is that when there are only one or 
two cases, after a while when we start describing what the cases are 
like, it becomes very easy for somebody in the general public to 
identify the taxpayer.
<P>
	The finance committee was really addressing the issue of 
whether the bases of the audit sample were such that the auditor 
general contravened the intent of Revenue Canada to have 
confidentiality. For instance, if he did the same thing with one of 
us, if he said it was a member of Parliament who comes from St. 
Albert, by the time he was through defining a sample, we would all 
know who it was.
<P>
	Could the member address the very important issue of 
confidentiality in taxpayer information?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand where the member is 
coming from. The confidentiality of the Income Tax Act is 
sacrosanct and our concept that taxpayers voluntarily assess the 
amount of taxes owed by them is on the understanding that the 
information is confidential and will not be held against them at a 
later date.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4566"> 4566 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The auditor general, as far as I am aware, did everything he 
could to try to maintain that confidentiality. It certainly was not the 
auditor general that breached the confidentiality rule.
<P>
	This was the point I made in my speech. The member pointed out 
that perhaps we could identify this particular tax cut. I am looking 
at Bill C-41 and I quoted that the Department of National Revenue 
information banks are now going to be opened up for searches.
<P>
	Obviously the Divorce Act and Bill C-41 will allow a particular 
person to search the data banks at Revenue Canada for information 
on a particular person, for example, an ex-spouse. What happens to 
confidentiality under Bill C-41? It is right out the window, 
absolutely and completely. Name, social insurance numbers, 
taxable income and everything else will be on the table for people 
who have a specific interest in that particular taxpayer. That is why 
I find this whole comment from the government side to be 
absolutely and completely hypocritical. Right now we are debating 
Bill C-41 which guarantees that the confidentiality of Revenue 
Canada will be breached.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity, through this 
motion, to discuss one the greatest scandals in the history of federal 
politics. The saga began last May 7, when the auditor general, 
Canada's watchdog over public finances, the one who makes 
federal public servants and politicians accountable, shed light on 
this scandal.
<P>
	What happened is that the government allowed a Canadian 
resident, a billionaire, to transfer to the United States assets of $2 
billion that were held in a family trust, without paying any tax on 
the capital gains realized on these assets.
<P>
	How was the person able to transfer these $2 billion? After all, 
Quebec and Canadians taxpayers get sued if they owe one dollar in 
taxes to Revenue Canada. So, how did this billionaire manage to 
transfer his billions to the United States? He did two things.
<P>
	First, he benefited from the complicity of officials from Revenue 
Canada and the Department of Finance and, second, he obtained an 
interpretation of a section of the Income Tax Act that normally only 
applies to non-resident holders of capital in Canada, such as 
Americans, Europeans and others from other continents. However, 
in the case of this scandal uncovered by the auditor general and 
involving the billionaire, a distorted interpretation of the section 
was made.
<P>
	On December 12, 1991, Revenue Canada issued a ruling to the 
effect that this billionaire and trustee did not have the right to 
transfer billions of dollars tax free.  However, on December 23, 
when everyone had left for the Christmas holiday and had turned 
their attention to their families, to the festivities and to what was in 
store for 1992, some officials from the revenue and finance 
departments in Ottawa somehow found a way to reverse Revenue 
Canada's ruling, so that the billionaire could transfer his billions to 
the United States without paying his due to the taxman.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	This process is all the more shocking because there is no record 
of any meeting. There are no minutes from these meetings of 
December 12 and 23, the outcome of which was that, initially, the 
billionaire was told no, and later on was told yes, with the blessing 
of Revenue Canada and the Minister of Finance, and billions were 
transferred tax free. No paper trail. And that is one of the main 
discrepancies raised by the auditor general in his last report.
<P>
	When this scandal came to light, it was quite something to see 
the Liberal members on the public accounts committee, the 
committee that receives the auditor general's report for study and 
that calls witnesses to appear before it to shed more light on the 
scandals uncovered by the auditor general. It was a sight to behold 
to see the Liberal members rising solemnly before the cameras and 
saying that the Liberal government would get to the bottom of this 
scandal.
<P>
	The member for Brome-Missisquoi stood before the cameras 
and said: ``This is ridiculous, this took place in 1991, under the 
Conservatives; we will get to the bottom of this''. And he worked 
himself into quite a lather.
<P>
	Two days later, he was nowhere to be seen. Two days later, the 
member for Brome-Missisquoi had disappeared. The story was 
that he was in his riding attending to urgent matters. He stayed 
there nearly two weeks. Lip zipped, he hid, because he knew very 
well that he had perhaps said a bit too much, that perhaps his 
government, the Liberal government, lacked the political will to 
get to the bottom of this billionaire scandal.
<P>
	And indeed, since then, we have found out from the government 
side that it was perhaps not just the Conservatives who were behind 
this scandal, that if we scratched the blue a little, there would also 
be a little red underneath. The attempts to bury this scandal are 
quite astonishing.
<P>
	First, the question of this two billion dollar trust was referred to 
the finance committee for study. I have nothing against the finance 
committee, and do not wish to run down what it is doing, but it is 
not that committee's place to cast light on this sort of financial 
scandal. Moreover, the government has seen fit to give the finance 
committee a very clear mandate, which was necessary in order to 
avoid coming up against this type of ambiguity in the Income Tax 
Act in future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4567"> 4567 </A></B>
<P>
	The mandate was not to bring in experts, or public servants, 
or even politicians, who were behind that shameful decision in 
1991, in order to ask questions and really get to the bottom of 
the matter. Not in the least. That is the mandate of the public 
accounts committee. Passing the scandal over to the finance 
committee for analysis was the first way of clouding the issue.
<P>
	Second, in early June my Bloc Quebecois colleagues and 
myself-my colleagues in the opposition-were witnesses to a 
session in which the auditor general's mandate, reputation, 
integrity, and competence were smeared during his appearance 
before the finance committee.
<P>
	It was shameful, really a cheap shot, as they say, to have the 
chairman of the finance committee, the Liberal chairman of the 
finance committee, lecturing the auditor general because he had, on 
behalf of the people, and on behalf of the Parliament of Canada, 
brought up one of the worst financial scandals to have occurred in 
the federal administration for decades. It was embarrassing to see 
the chairman of the finance committee depriving all of the MPs 
sitting on that committee of the right to speak, while he alone 
grilled the auditor general, trying in every way possible to back 
him into a corner and undermine his credibility. Committee 
chairmen have resigned for less in the past.
<P>
	We must understand who the auditor general is. It is important to 
understand this because if he is being denigrated by the Liberal 
majority, there must be a reason. He must have found out 
something. He must have found out about a scandal that might 
affect the senior levels of this government. The auditor general is 
the one who, on behalf of Quebecers and Canadians, scrutinizes 
government accounts, departmental accounts and the attitude of 
public servants.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	It is his task to oblige these senior executives and government 
ministers to give an account of themselves. That is his duty. If the 
auditor general finds out that money is being wasted in the 
departments, as he has pointed out in successive reports since this 
venerable institution first came into being, and as he will surely do 
next Thursday when he tables his report in the House, the 
government is then forced to act to clean up public finances, to 
restore integrity to the administration of public funds and also to 
plug tax loopholes as he recommends.
<P>
	The auditor general is not the government's auditor. He is the 
auditor of Parliament. He is the people's auditor. He is the one who 
says when public moneys are well managed, when taxpayers' 
money, money they worked so hard to earn, is well spent or 
misspent or the Income Tax Act is properly enforced. Since early 
June, the Liberals have done nothing but tarnish the reputation of 
the auditor general. That is a very sad commentary on this 
government.
<P>
	This scenario went on throughout June and July, when the 
finance committee sat and the chairman of the committee 
unilaterally decided to invite his expert friends. Six of the eight 
experts invited to the finance committee were people who, without 
wishing to undermine their credibility, certainly had no credibility 
in this particular case. And why not? Not only because they were 
invited by the Liberals, but because these experts are the very 
people who help wealthy Canadian families find all kinds of tricks 
to avoid paying their share of income tax, to avoid paying taxes to 
Revenue Canada.
<P>
	Backed by government officials and perhaps also by politicians, 
as we may find out some day, these same experts helped transfer $2 
billion to the U.S. without a penny being paid in taxes.
<P>
	How can you ask these experts who help wealthy Canadian 
families evade tax, which means that these families do not do their 
share to put our fiscal house in order, to take a stand against a tax 
provision that enabled these families to transfer billions of dollars 
to the U.S.? That makes no sense. They cannot be both judge and 
judged.
<P>
	Just last week, the Liberal majority on the finance committee 
decided to submit their recommendations to the government, so 
that such ``ambiguity'' would not be a problem in the future. What 
did the Liberal majority say in its report? It said three things.
<P>
	First, listen to this, the same scenario was continuing. They 
pursued their smear campaign against the auditor general, saying 
that he was unable to understand these matters, did not understand 
how the Income Tax applies to billionaires who want to transfer 
billions of dollars tax free.
<P>
	They even said he may have been remiss in his duties since the 
information he gave made it possible to guess which family was 
behind this scandal, when in fact the information was leaked from 
Revenue Canada to the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. It was probably a public 
servant who was also outraged by his colleagues' actions in this 
matter who revealed the owner of this trust fund to the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>. It was not the auditor general. Again, in polite terms, the 
Liberals presented this fact as though it was the auditor general's 
doing. It is a disgrace.
<P>
	They added that the Income Tax Act had to be implemented 
properly, that it had to be fair and unambiguous. The government's 
second recommendation was to say: ``Now that the scandal has 
been uncovered, now that we have put our finger on the so-called 
taxable Canadian property tax provision''-which originally was 
to apply only to non-residents and which allowed the $2 billion to 
be transferred out of the country in one of Canada's worst financial 
scandals-``instead of maintaining this ambiguity, we will open the 
gates so everyone can use this taxable Canadian property clause to 
do just about anything, like transfer hundreds of millions or 
billions of  dollars to the U.S. or to other places around the world 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4568"> 4568 </A></B>
<P>
without paying a penny in tax on the capital gains from these trust 
funds''.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Just try dong that as the average taxpayer. Just try to get out of 
paying $10 in federal tax, and they will be after you. Even when we 
get notices telling us we made a calculation error, when there is a 
difference of 50 cents between what we calculated as tax owing and 
what Revenue Canada has calculated, we have to make out a 
cheque for 50 cents. And now they are letting two billion in assets 
go to the U.S., which represents hundreds of millions of tax dollars 
in lost government income. And, by the way, that lost income of 
hundreds of millions of dollars will be made up for by you and me, 
and all the taxpayers in Quebec and in Canada, while they are just 
allowed to slip out of the country with no problem.
<P>
	The senior officials had an advance ruling; they can do as they 
please. What is more, the Liberal majority report, which has 
become the official government position since last week, becomes 
the law. This is anarchy, this is a free for all for millionaires and 
billionaires. They can do what they please in future, while the 
average taxpaying wage earner will be crushed by the Canadian 
taxation system.
<P>
	In the last three years, and even during the time of the previous 
government, so much in the way of sacrifices was called for, the 
taxpayer has been bled dry, the law has been so tightened up. To 
take unemployment insurance as an example, workers have 
become so marginalized, workers and entire families in Quebec 
have become marginalized they experience a great deal of 
difficulty in getting back into the work force. Yet the millionaires 
and billionaires are fine, no more problems for them, they can do as 
they please.
<P>
	This government, this Prime Minister, this Minister of Finance, 
despite their high calling, serve only millionaires and billionaires, 
not the average taxpayer; it is not true, not with their scheming, not 
with such an attitude and certainly not with recommendations that, 
in a matter of hours, managed both to tarnish the reputation of the 
auditor general, the watchdog for the government's finances, and to 
open up the gates for millionaires. Mr. Speaker, this is not right.
<P>
	If we look at the process alone, they did everything they could to 
obscure matters. They went so far as to tarnish the auditor general's 
reputation, to question his competence, and then opened the gates 
by saying that henceforth, this exception, cooked up on December 
23, and approved with millionaires and billionaires in mind, will 
now become the law in Canada.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Hard to believe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Yes. One tax law for the poor and middle income 
taxpayers. When your income is modest, you pay: you pay the 
taxes. You pay them all, not more or less. When you are poor, you 
are stomped on by this  government, but when you are a millionaire 
or a billionaire, Revenue Canada and the Finance Department open 
their doors wide to rush through an advance ruling so that you can 
do as you please.
<P>
	This is what things have come to. It is not right. But if it is not 
right, if it is really not right, what is behind it? That is what we are 
trying to find out. First of all, we are trying to get the Liberal 
government to put the report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance where it belongs, in the garbage, and then to shut the gates, 
rather than throwing them wide open. That is what we are trying to 
do.
<P>
	My second point is that the government should finally agree to 
what we have been asking for since the auditor general's report was 
published, and that was to refer this issue, which was quite fittingly 
raised by the auditor general, to the public accounts committee, 
which is in a position to shed all the necessary light on this 
financial scandal. Public servants and politicians made this 
decision at a time when everybody was partying, while everybody 
thought the government and their public servants were taking care 
of them, and these people allowed this financial scandal to occur. 
Let us bring them before the public accounts committee and 
question them and oblige them to give an account of themselves, 
and that applies to this government as well.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	As I said earlier, if we rub a little bit, underneath the blue we will 
find a bit of red. Maybe if we scratch some of the blue, we will find 
some tories behind all this. We may find them at very senior levels 
in government, perhaps in the entourage of the Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Maybe we will find some worthy Liberal millionaires and 
billionaires gravitating around the government in power, who were 
able to take advantage of a decision made in 1991, which served as 
a precedent for opening the flood gates, and which from now on, in 
any case, with the Liberal majority report, will ensure that 
everyone can get millions and billions out of the country. Not poor 
people, not the middle class. They have no money. The government 
comes down hard on them, but millionaires and billionaires, the 
friends of the party, those who give $50,000 or more to the Liberal 
Party, will have no problem. They get the red carpet treatment and 
can do whatever they like.
<P>
	They will pay for this mess. They will pay the political price for 
it. You may be sure the opposition will not let them get away with 
it. From now on, the official opposition is on the war path, to serve 
taxpayers in Quebec and Canada as well. We will call on the people 
to tell this government to behave like a responsible government, 
not like a government for millionaires and billionaires.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4569"> 4569 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, while I listened to the speech made by the hon. member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot the same question kept coming to my 
mind and I would like him to elaborate on this: Why this 
diversion? In politics, when one wants to turn attention away from 
something, one looks for something that will do precisely that. 
But this is going a bit far.
<P>
	Why go so far as to call into question an institution such as the 
Auditor General of Canada? The auditor general is not appointed 
by the opposition or by lobbyists, but by Parliament as a whole to 
audit the work of the government. Consequently, he has the support 
of both the opposition and the government. The auditor general was 
appointed by this Parliament and this gives him an authority that 
usually puts him above partisan opinions. But in this particular 
case, the Liberals sitting on the committee decided to attack that 
institution.
<P>
	There must be a reason for that. I think it is basically because the 
government was just confronted with the fact that it does not 
comply with the principles of equity and fairness when it comes to 
tax expenditures. For three years now, the official opposition has 
been telling the government that an in-depth review is in order. A 
technical committee was set up. We recommended that the exercise 
be of a public nature and that a democratic debate take place on the 
issue, but this was not done.
<P>
	Now, the government has just been caught with its pants down. 
To get out of having to explain how someone can send $2 billion 
out of the country tax-free at a time when the government tells us it 
needs all the money it can get its hands on, it tried to create a 
diversion.
<P>
	I have two questions to put to the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot. First, is this diversion justified and, 
second, has the loophole created by this interpretation been 
plugged? The government has known about this situation for a few 
months. Canadian citizens who owe $50, $100 or $200 often have 
to write the government to defend themselves at a cost that is 
higher than the amount claimed. Can these people be assured today 
that the loophole that was created has been closed and that the 
current government has resolved the ineffectiveness of its 
predecessor?
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my dear colleague 
from Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup for his eloquence and his 
excellent question.
<P>
	Yes, the government has things to hide. If the government had 
nothing to hide, when the auditor general published his report on 
the scandal of the $2 billion transferred out of the country tax-free, 
if this annual report had been dealt with in the usual way, that is to 
say, if it had been referred to the public accounts committee, my 
colleague, the hon. member for  
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, who chairs this committee, 
would have shed light on the reasons behind this decision with the 
help of his colleagues from Trois-Rivières and Portneuf. Such is 
not the case.
<P>
	As I said earlier, this matter was referred to the finance 
committee, which was asked to make recommendations on future 
policy but not on the 1991 case. So the government has things to 
hide and there are sources close to the Liberal Party of Canada, 
close to the Prime Minister's office or the finance minister's office 
who have everything to gain by sidetracking this case.
<P>
	Let us not forget that this 1991 advance ruling by public 
servants, which was only made public in March 1996, created a 
precedent. Since then, anyone could have transferred millions or 
billions of dollars to other countries around the world. Of course, 
the government has things to hide.
<P>
	To answer your second question concerning the loophole, no it 
was not plugged, it was actually enlarged by the Liberal majority 
proposals, since the twisted interpretation of what constitutes 
taxable Canadian property obtained from Revenue Canada and the 
Department of Finance on the basis of the transfer of these $2 
billion to the U.S. was allowed by senior officials, this twisted 
interpretation has become official government policy, an equally 
twisted policy serving millionaires and billionaires at the expense 
of taxpayers in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I understand it, the debate takes place in this context. 
The auditor general brought down a report which had something to 
say about family trusts. The Liberals opposite felt that the auditor 
general was overstepping his mandate and should not be 
investigating family trusts.
<P>
	In my business experience it is often the things that we do not 
know that hurt us more than what we do know.
<P>
	My question for my hon. colleague is this. Is it not the 
appropriate function of the auditor general, acting in his capacity as 
auditor, to investigate and bring to the attention of the government 
that which it does not know? Is the auditor general not doing 
exactly what he should be doing by bringing this to the attention of 
the government?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, in its report, the Liberal majority did 
question the mandate of the auditor general, claiming that he had 
overstepped his mandate.
<P>
	In fact, he was well within the scope of his mandate. In the recent 
past, between 1982 and 1994, there have been no less than seven or 
eight cases of interpretation regarding taxation, taxation law, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4570"> 4570 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian Income Tax Act by the auditor general. That is his job 
too. He  does not only look at expenditures and waste. He also 
looks at how public funds are administered, how the money 
taxpayers in Quebec and Canada entrust with the federal 
government is administered. That is his job. He is directly 
mandated to do that.
<P>
	This is rather surprising, because, while the auditor general's 
reputation was being tarnished, in a carefully crafted passage 
covering about ten pages, with the Liberals using the six experts 
who testified before the finance committee last summer as their 
authority-the six experts working for wealthy Canadian families 
and helping them find ways to dodge tax-these six experts could 
have been confronted to at least 15 academic tax experts, 
researchers, real experts with no connection with wealthy Canadian 
families or interests in firms like Stikeman Elliott, for example, 
that may in the past have helped put away hundreds of millions of 
dollars in tax havens or elsewhere thanks to a twisted interpretation 
of certain provisions of the Income Tax Act.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>

	It is rather strange that these six experts are the ones who help 
the millionaires, that the Liberals quote them as authorities, while 
about fifteen others are saying that the government misinterpreted 
the Income Tax Act, that the public servants did something wrong 
in 1991 and that, with the agreement of the politicians of the time 
and the ones currently in office, they did not act in the interest of 
the true taxpayers. Things are not going well. We are in a system of 
institutionalized scandals. We are in a system-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha, Ha.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier: </B>I hear Liberal members laughing on the other side. 
Instead of laughing and making silly comments that have no 
basis-because they did not even read the report of the Liberal 
majority and our dissenting opinion-they should do their 
homework, which is to protect the interests of their constituents, 
not those of millionaires who gravitate around the Prime Minister's 
office or the Department of Finance, perhaps in the hope of getting, 
at some point, a job of deputy minister, minister, chair of a 
committee, assistant or Secretary of State within this government.
<P>
	Such is the political system of the Liberals. This is what 
motivates them. It is not to do their homework and to protect the 
interests of their constituents. If this were the case, they would not 
give their support; they would not laugh when we discuss one of the 
worst financial scandals, one that is fuelled by the government.
<P>
	If the Liberals truly want to protect the interests of their 
constituents, they should oppose their government and the 
establishment, because the establishment is doing things that go 
completely against the interests of Canadians.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-45, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial review of parole 
ineligibility) and another act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan has two minutes to complete his remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for clarifying that point. I did get cut a little short prior to 
question period.
<P>
	We are resuming debate on Bill C-45, which is the Liberal 
government's response to calls from the public for tougher parole 
eligibility guidelines. The main thing I have noticed so far in this 
debate is that there are real differences of opinion between this 
corner of the House and others.
<P>
	One difference concerns the word retribution. There is an 
element of retribution in the idea of punishment that the public 
believes in but that is not concurred in by the other side. The other 
difference is the emphasis on rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is a 
wonderful thing. By all means we should go for rehabilitation of 
criminals, for prevention and all of that. But once done there is an 
element of retribution for what has happened.
<P>
	Another big difference I have noticed between ourselves and 
others in this House is the element of consultation or listening to 
the public. That is a strong point on the part of Reform. We make it 
a point to get out and listen to what people have to tell us. It seems 
that the Liberals in particular will make the decision for the public. 
It is an elite decision. They do not have to listen to what the public 
has to say. They say: ``We know best. Therefore, it shall be this 
way''.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	With those differences in mind, I would like to conclude by 
saying that Bill C-45 may delay, but it will not prevent killers from 
getting a judicial review and ultimately an early parole. According 
to the judicial review reports of March 1994, 128 first degree 
murderers were eligible for judicial review. Of the 71 who applied, 
43 had completed their judicial review, while 28 were outstanding. 
Out of the 43, 19 received immediate full parole eligibility, 13 had 
a partial reduction and 11 only were denied.
<P>
	Bill C-45 and the review of a killer's application by a judge will 
do nothing but add an expensive layer of bureaucracy to a growing 
justice industry. Bill C-45 is nothing but the government's attempt, 
once again, to  tinker with the justice system. In this case it is 
tinkering with the penalty for first degree murder.
<P>
	Bill C-45 is not the first attempt by the Liberals to tinker with the 
issue of early release. However, with a bit of luck it will be their 
last before a Reform government steps into the breach and finally 
eliminates it altogether.
<P>
	I will conclude my remarks by serving notice of my intent to 
vote against Bill C-45. In its present form I do not believe the 
people of Nanaimo-Cowichan would expect me to do anything 
less.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was listening to my hon. friend very carefully on this issue, 
particularly his comments about consulting people and his 
comments about retribution.
<P>
	This bill and section 745 talk about, for all intents and purposes, 
first degree murderers. Short of killing a first degree murderer, 
what is the maximum penalty which a first degree murderer can 
get? The maximum penalty that we can give to a first degree 
murderer, if we do not hang the person, is life. That is the penalty: 
life in prison. That is the sentence passed by the court in every case 
where a first degree murderer gets life.
<P>
	What are we saying when we talk about the 25 years? 
Twenty-five years is the time at which the murderer can apply to 
the parole board for consideration for parole. Parole is not 
automatically granted. This does not open the doors to every 
criminal after they have served 25 years. This is an opportunity for 
murderers to go before the parole board to ask for eligibility. That 
does not mean they are going to get parole. If they do get parole, 
they are still under the sentence of life imprisonment for the rest of 
their natural lives. If they breach their parole conditions, they go 
back to prison under the sentence of life imprisonment for the rest 
of their natural lives.
<P>
	When I have an opportunity to make my remarks I will explain 
why I do not believe that section 745 as it is currently written in the 
law is appropriate and why it should be amended.
<P>
	My hon. friend talked about consulting the people. I want him to 
answer this question for me. All applications under section 745 
which proceed must go to a jury. That jury is a jury of peers in the 
community. The justice community is seeking the opinion of 
ordinary people in Nanaimo-Cowichan or wherever else they may 
be. They may be grocery store clerks, owners of shops, insurance 
people or whoever gets called for jury duty. They will be put on a 
jury and they will be consulted as a community as to whether or not 
the person is one who should be granted the opportunity to apply 
for parole prior to 25 years. That seems to me to be consulting with 
the community, the ultimate consultation with the community, 
which is by a jury of one's peers.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4573"> 4573 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	I ask my friend, does he disagree with that kind of consultation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, to answer the hon. member, I do not 
disagree with jury consultation. The problem I have in connection 
with Bill C-45 and section 745 of the Criminal Code is: What 
information will the jury be given? Will they get all the information 
about the pain, the anguish inflicted on the victim? Will they get 
the real impact of what has happened to the victim's family and 
friends? The answer to that is probably no. The real thing about a 
jury, and it is right that the member raises it, is: What information 
will they get and what will they base their judgment on except all of 
that information?
<P>
	Let us go back to another comment made by the member, that the 
only thing we are looking at here is life imprisonment. I had Private 
Members' Bill C-261 in the House on Friday. That bill, after 
having consulted with the people of Nanaimo-Cowichan, 
addressed the matter of the death penalty. Consulting with my 
community I found that the majority of people expressed an 
interest and a desire to revisit the whole business of the death 
penalty in Canada.
<P>
	That again has been taken away from the people by the elites in 
this country, going back to 1976 specifically by my predecessor, an 
honourable and noble parliamentarian by the name of Tommy 
Douglas. Having heard the people of Nanaimo-Cowichan, he said 
that yes the majority wanted to keep the death penalty but he came 
to the House and said that he must vote his conscience.
<P>
	This is one of the basic problems we have in the democracy of 
this country: Who is listening to whom and who is acting on whose 
behalf? Are we listening to the people or do we, you the elite, know 
better?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to return to what the hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan said 
before question period, around 1.50 p.m.: that juries have often 
acquitted or released people who, in his opinion, ought to have 
been sentenced, because the juries had certainly been deprived of 
the information they needed to make a just decision. That they had 
not been made aware of all of the points in a case, in testimony or 
in documents, or whatever, but at any rate were lacking information 
which, in the opinion of the hon. member, led to their acquitting 
someone accused of some crime, whether a heinous one or not, he 
did not specify.
<P>
	I would just like to tell the hon. member from the Reform Party 
that, unfortunately-or fortunately depending on which side one is 
on-this is the way our Canadian justice system was designed. 
Justice for the people by the people. The justice of God will be 
meted  out by Him, in due time, but in the meantime it is applied by 
human beings.
<P>
	On my way here today, I heard a report about a recent discovery 
somewhere in Australia which indicated that, contrary to what 
everyone has believed, human beings have been on Earth for 
175,000 years. Traces of their presence have been found. I would 
say that human beings have also been trying for 175,000 years to 
eliminate violence, murder and heinous crime. It is a human 
instinct to protect oneself, but we have not been successful.
<P>
	If the Lord is a truly loving God, I know He will not put the 
Reform Party in power for the next four years. Should such a 
calamity come to pass some day, however, I am convinced that the 
Reform Party will not succeed in eliminating crime in Canada 
during their four years in power. I am pretty certain that the status 
quo will remain, the statistics will remain unchanged, as will 
everything else.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, I had the distinct impression from what the hon. 
member for Nanaimo-Cowichan said that he is not challenging 
section 745 but the basis of Canada's justice system.
<P>
	It has always been said that under our system, we would rather 
let the guilty go than run the risk of convicting the innocent. If we 
look at the Reform Party and the courts they would establish, it is 
the other way around. Let us arrest everyone to make sure some of 
the guilty do not escape.
<P>
	This is a reversal, not only of the burden of proof but of the 
situation. I would like to ask the hon. member if I understood him 
correctly. Is this what he had in mind when he made his statement? 
I wonder whether it would not be better to keep the system we have 
now. Quite frankly, I prefer that system to the one proposed by the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously we need a legal system in 
Canada, but the system we have is more concerned about criminals 
than about victims, in my opinion. We are looking for justice, and 
at the same time we are trying to listen to our constituents.
<P>
	If a system does not work the way people want it to work, we 
must listen to the people. That is why I asked the hon. member for 
Portneuf whether he consulted his constituents before reaching his 
conclusions about the justice system in Canada and what should be 
done with these trials.
<P>
	We must consult the public, and when we do, we hear something 
else, and that is the point I am trying to make.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity today to explain my position 
on this bill, and I have to say at the outset  that I am opposed to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4574"> 4574 </A></B>
<P>
bill and will vote against third reading, for reasons I intend to give 
in my speech.
<P>
	In my opinion, the bill goes counter to the principles governing 
the treatment of offenders, and that is why I am against this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At the report stage in my remarks I reviewed the principles of 
sentencing in relation to this bill and how this bill served those 
principles. I mentioned in the course of my remarks that the 
principal cause of my objection to this bill was the requirement for 
unanimity in the jury on the question of early release for an inmate. 
In my view, the other two aspects of the bill which I did not 
particularly like but was willing to go along with simply fell flat in 
the face of this requirement for unanimity in the place of the jury.
<P>
	My very learned and capable colleague, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Justice, argued vehemently that the 
requirement of unanimity in a jury was something that was 
commonplace in our society and was part of the long tradition of 
the common law. I agree with him fully in that regard. However, 
what he neglected to mention and what I think is a fair comment on 
his defence is that juries have never been involved in sentencing. 
Sentencing has always been the purview of a judge. The jury is in a 
position to determine guilt or innocence but not to determine the 
sentence to be imposed on the offender.
<P>
	Accordingly, while I could sympathize with the argument as far 
as it went, in my view it is wholly inappropriate for juries to be 
involved in the question of sentencing. That is a matter that falls, in 
my view, within the purview of a judge. It has done so for hundreds 
of years and ought to remain there.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I indicated also my displeasure at the entire process under 
section 745 which involved a jury in this whole matter since to me 
it smacked of being involved in sentencing. I did not get time to 
complete my remarks, so perhaps that was not clear from what I 
said.
<P>
	I would like to go back to the four principles of sentencing that I 
talked about. I mentioned first, the protection of the public; second, 
the punishment of the offender; third, the rehabilitation of the 
offender; and fourth, the deterrence to others. I believe those are 
the four principles on which any sentencing bill ought to be judged.
<P>
	Does the bill further the four principles? I would like to deal with 
each of the principles and indicate in my view how this bill fails to 
enhance any one of those principles to the benefit of the general 
public, except for possibly one, and in a way that I feel is 
inappropriate.
<P>
	The effect of the bill will be to keep people in prison for longer. I 
think everyone in the House agrees. The  Reform members in the 
House have been arguing strenuously that they get out too early and 
they will continue to get out too early under this bill. If 
implemented, in my view, very few will be able to apply 
successfully for early release under this bill. I suspect my 
colleagues opposite know it but for political reasons they wish to 
argue that the bill does not go far enough.
<P>
	The bill does go far. I think it goes too far. The hon. member 
opposite knows perfectly well with a unanimous jury requirement 
chances of someone getting out are going to be down significantly 
from what they are today.
<P>
	How does it enhance any one of these principles? Let me turn to 
the first one: protection of the public. Protection of the public is the 
paramount purpose of incarceration. I am firmly of the belief that if 
an offender is a danger to the public, that offender should be kept in 
prison to the full extent of the law, that is, to the full extent of the 
sentence that has been imposed on him or her. Under the current 
law, that is exactly the situation.
<P>
	Hon. members complain that these people can apply for early 
release too soon. Application is one thing; granting is quite another. 
I invite members to look at the record, to examine it critically if 
they wish in respect of releases under this section of the Criminal 
Code. The protection of the public has been paramount in the 
minds of juries involved in this process and in the minds of the 
National Parole Board when an application gets to it following a 
successful jury application.
<P>
	The record of the inmates who have been released on parole 
justifies confidence in the system that we have in that only two out 
of something like 50 have encountered difficulty with the law. 
Neither has committed a murder. One has gone missing and the 
other has been charged with some other offence and is back in 
prison I assume.
<P>
	The track record of this section has been very good. That 
evidence, I submit, is being ignored in this debate. It should be 
enhanced. It should be drawn to the attention of the public who, 
once they have examined it, might have a different approach if 
there is any unanimity on the points in this bill.
<P>
	Since most of the persons who are currently released under the 
existing system are not a danger to the public-and virtually every 
one of them has been established not to be a danger to the public-I 
suggest we have no basis for suggesting that the public protection 
is at risk. Therefore we do not need to stiffen the rules relating to 
early release on that ground.
<P>
	Second, I will turn to rehabilitation of the offender. How is 
rehabilitation of the offender enhanced by keeping the inmate in 
prison for longer? I will talk about this in relation to punishment 
later, but most criminologists would agree that lengthy 
incarceration does not enhance rehabilitation of the offender. 
Rehabilitation can be accomplished in a relatively-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Protection of society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4575"> 4575 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I just dealt with that argument. If only the 
member had been listening instead of babbling away over there 
he might not be yelling at me now. He can yell to his heart's 
content. I have some remarks to make and I suggest he sit and 
listen.
<P>
	In my submission the rehabilitation of the offender is not 
enhanced by a sentence in excess of 15 years. I do not think we 
would find a criminologist in the country who would suggest that a 
longer sentence assists in rehabilitation.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	Third, I turn to the deterrent effect of a lengthy sentence. A life 
sentence, the sentence for murder and which is conveniently 
forgotten a great deal in this debate, in my view is as great a 
deterrent as this law should have and does have. I submit it is a 
great deterrent for murder.
<P>
	The point is most murders, from my limited knowledge in this 
area, are crimes of passion. I do not think the offender sits and 
thinks of the consequences of his or her acts when the murder is 
taking place.
<P>
	I know hon. members may suggest that if the sentence were 
heavier fewer murders would take place, but that is certainly not 
the experience here or in any other country. A heavy sentence is 
entirely appropriate for murder, but a lengthy prison sentence in my 
view does not act as a deterrent to others. I think the fact that a 
murder has taken place is the deterrent. It is a crime that is 
abhorrent to most other people in our society, and justifiably so.
<P>
	I turn finally then to the question of punishment. The question 
really is do we improve our law by increasing the length of time 
served in jail in terms of punishment of the offender? Have we 
achieved something that benefits our society as a whole?
<P>
	I have a real objection to the view that we improve the 
punishment of a victim by lengthening the sentence. I say so 
because I am concerned that as a society we judge the seriousness 
of an offence by the length of a sentence. Yet virtually every 
offence in our Criminal Code and virtually every offence in any 
statute is punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment or 
imprisonment in lieu of payment of the fine.
<P>
	When I was practising law and I went to court to see people 
getting charged with speeding, for example, the fine was $100 or 
five days. Someone could serve five days or pay but they had a 
choice. They could go to jail or pay. Why would we ever give 
anybody the option? Why is a fine not mandatory and if they do not 
pay their fine they lose their licence, or their car is taken away or 
something like that? Why do we send people to jail at public 
expense when there is no reason from the point of view of 
protection of the public to send them there?
<P>
	Surely as a public policy matter the reason people should be 
imprisoned is to protect the public. It should  be a matter of last 
resort. We send people to prison when someone is going to be a risk 
to others. When they are not, we try to devise another punishment 
that fits the crime but is not one that involves great public expense, 
which imprisonment involves, again conveniently forgotten as we 
discuss this bill, and which may involve substantial damage to the 
offender, perhaps unintentional or perhaps intentional but damage 
to the offender.
<P>
	I am not suggesting when I talk about other punishments that I 
am agreeing with the hon. member for Calgary Northeast who 
wants to bring in whipping, caning and spanking.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You are agreeing with him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member thinks I am agreeing with him 
but I want to assure him I am not.
<P>
	Whipping was abolished in this country some years ago and I 
have not gone to Singapore to see how caning is carried out there, 
as I know the hon. member for Calgary Northeast wanted to do 
before the member for Calgary Southeast blew the whistle and then 
got drummed out of the party.
<P>
	She pointed out the extremism. She recognized extremism when 
she saw it and she blew the whistle. I always thought the Reform 
Party favoured whistle blowing legislation but when she blew the 
whistle she got the boot. I can only say that it leads me to suspect 
that its support for whistle blowing legislation is only skin deep and 
it would change quickly if it got any more seats, just as its sense of 
democracy seems a little odd.
<P>
	In any event, I want to make it very clear that it is not whipping, 
caning or spanking that I am talking about.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It works.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says it works. The evidence is 
that it does not work. I would not want to confuse him with facts.
<P>
	I am talking about alternative punishment that we know we talk 
about. We have heard a lot of talk about alternative punishment, but 
when it comes right down to it we have not done a great deal about 
it. We have not looked at alternative ways of dealing with people 
aside from putting them on probation. The public regards probation 
as a cop-out, something that has happened where instead of putting 
the person in jail we put them on probation.
<P>
	Jail is the measurement of punishment in this country. The 
longer the sentence, the more serious the crime. If someone 
commits a serious crime and gets a short sentence the public tends 
to regard it as a miscarriage of justice. Why? Because there is no 
other punishment. If a person goes to jail, normally when they get 
out of jail they are scot free. Everything is over. There may be a 
period of probation and there may be something else added but 
usually if there is a jail term nothing else is  added. The jail term is 
what the public looks at as the measure of punishment. I suggest 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4576"> 4576 </A></B>
<P>
that we have to change that. I invite hon. members opposite to think 
of changing it and look at alternative measures.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Why, for example, when someone commits the crime of theft, do 
we not look at making them pay back the person they stole the 
property from at something like double the value of the property 
they stole?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Because they do not have any money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says they do not have any 
money. That is not always true, especially in shoplifting cases.
<P>
	Why, for example, would they not look at other alternatives like 
requiring extensive community service instead of sending them to 
jail at public expense? This alternative, in my view, is not explored, 
possibly because the law does not allow it or the policy of the law 
does not recommend it and because the public expectation is that if 
the person committed a serious offence, bang, he has to go to jail. 
There has to be a jail term and punishment.
<P>
	What do we have for murder? A jail sentence is required but the 
penalty for murder is a life sentence. I have no quarrel with that. It 
is entirely appropriate because there will be some murderers, and 
hon. members opposite talk about these particular persons all the 
time in their speeches, who in my view should never be released 
because they pose a danger to the public and should remain locked 
up.
<P>
	On the other hand, there are a large number of persons who have 
committed murder who pose no danger, who are remorseful and 
who wish they had never done it and, in my view, ought to be 
released and become contributing members in our society again.
<P>
	That is why I have difficulty with the whole concept of minimum 
sentences in the Criminal Code. I do not agree with minimum 
sentences. In my view there should be judicial discretion, 
particularly on the question of release. The National Parole Board 
is perfectly well equipped to make decisions on who is and who is 
not a danger to the public and release accordingly.
<P>
	I have some additional figures to support my suggestion on the 
statistics relating to sentences for murder. I want to point out some 
of these figures to hon. members opposite because they may have 
forgotten them.
<P>
	When we looked at the capital punishment issue in Parliament 
some years ago some figures were prepared concerning the period 
prior to the moratorium on capital punishment which started on 
January 3, 1968. From 1961 to 1968, 28 cases, in the case of 
murder, were sentenced to death and commuted to life. The average 
time served in those 28 cases was 12 years before parole.  There 
were five life sentences without having been sentenced to death 
with the average time served being 6.2 years before conditional 
release was granted by the parole board.
<P>
	From 1968 to 1974 there were 44 sentenced to death, with 13.5 
years the average sentence served; 85 were sentenced to life with 
7.7 years being the average sentence served.
<P>
	If those figures were adequate punishment then, and I would 
suggest they were, why is it so inadequate now? Why do we have to 
lock them up for so much longer today at public expense, at a cost 
of $40,000, $50,000 or $60,000 a year depending on the level of 
security. However, of course Reform does not care about money. 
All it wants to do is cut pensions.
<P>
	I want to turn to the cases that have occurred from 1976 to 1984, 
in other words the experience since this act came into force. Of 
course, people who were sentenced before the act came into force 
were unaffected by its provisions. Capital murder, 45 cases, 
number of years served, 15.46; non-capital murder, 268 cases, 
average number of years served, 10.43. These are averages. If these 
are adequate punishment why are we proposing by this bill to 
increase the number to 25 years with virtually no chance of getting 
out? I submit that it does not make sense.
<P>
	I want to say that if 15 years was good enough for the last 20 
years, we do not need to increase it to 25 years now.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	I want to turn to Matthew's Gospel and read one line: ``Always 
treat others as you would like them to treat you. That is the law and 
the prophets''.
<P>
	The hon. members may say that if they were guilty of murder 
they would like to go to prison for life and stay there until the end 
of their natural days. Perhaps at their age 25 years would expire 
before that happened anyway.
<P>
	I want to say this. After a year or two they would wish they had 
not done that. They would wish they were out. I am sure that is the 
case. I have visited these prisons. I know what they are like. I know 
the people there all want to get out. They do not want to stay 
despite the suggestion of hon. members opposite.
<P>
	In my view if we were to treat these others as we would have 
them treat us, I do not agree with locking them up without any 
opportunity to apply for parole no matter how good they have been, 
no matter how hard they try, no matter what efforts they make a 
reconciliation or whatever feelings of remorse they may have. I do 
not think those are grounds for keeping someone locked up forever.
<P>
	I turn to hon. members and suggest again that they reread the 
story of the Good Samaritan. The question asked at the end of the 
story is who was neighbour to the  man who fell among thieves. It 
was the person who had pity on him, who had compassion on him. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4577"> 4577 </A></B>
<P>
These people are our neighbours whether we like it or not. Some of 
us might not like it, but they are our neighbours.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What about the victims?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I am not forgetting the victim. I am coming to the 
victim. As neighbours to both the victim and his or her family and 
to the perpetrator, the offender, we have a duty. We have a duty to 
the victim's family to bind the wounds and share the sorrow. We 
also have a duty to the offender to heal and try to reconcile that 
person with the society which he has foully wronged. In my view, 
our obligation to do that extends to offering some glimmer of hope 
to that person, some opportunity when good behaviour can result in 
something of value.
<P>
	In any approach to this bill we can all win if we go for 
reconciliation and release because those things go together.
<P>
In conclusion I quote a speech that I think fell on deaf ears in 
Shakespeare's <I>The Merchant of Venice</I>. I will try it today because it 
sums up my argument very briefly:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The quality of mercy is not strain'd;<BR>
 	It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<BR>

	I have spoke thus much to indicate my reasons for voting against 
this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as always, the eloquent member for Kingston and the 
Islands has favoured us with his prose. As always, hidden in the 
jewels of his prose, is perhaps a bit of wisdom or perhaps a bit of 
fantasy.
<P>
	I ask the member for Kingston and the Islands, whose heart is so 
full of compassion for the perpetrators of crime, to reflect on the 
words by a former British prime minister. On the sixth floor of this 
very building there are portraits of past British prime ministers, one 
of whom is Benjamin Desraeli.
<P>
	The member opposite was so quick to stand and shout charges of 
extremism at this side of the aisle because we would say that those 
who break our laws should be sanctioned. That is part of the social 
contract.
<P>
	I wonder if he realizes that when he hurls that charge of 
extremism across the aisle at us, Benjamin Desraeli, the great 
British prime minister, once said that today's extremist is 
tomorrow's moderate. We are the pathfinders. We were called 
extreme because we said that it would be a good idea for us not to 
leave future  generations of Canadians bankrupt because our 
generation spent beyond its means.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	When the House decided it was going to do away with the death 
penalty 30 years ago, the quid pro quo was 25 years. It was not 15 
years or 10.43 years. It was 25 years. As a civilized society we 
would no longer take a life because a life had been taken. We would 
protect society. There would be deterrence because 25 years means 
life, but we would not be taking a life.
<P>
	Members today have a duty and a responsibility to the victims 
and to the potential victims which should override that 
compassionate, soft heart. Yes, we should all be compassionate. 
However, if it was the member's family or if it was the member's 
neighbour who was violated by a murderer, would he feel so 
charitable? Would he think that there should not be a sanction 
beyond a fine, or that simple remorse is good enough?
<P>
	As a society we are not going to get blood from a stone. We are 
not talking about manslaughter. We are talking about premeditated 
murder. We are not talking about accidental murder or crimes of 
passion. We are talking about cold-blooded, premeditated murder. 
It is important to make that distinction.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member opposite to justify to the people of 
Canada why he thinks those who commit cold-blooded, 
premeditated murder are worthy of compassion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member has asked three 
questions. He asked what my position would be if it was someone 
in my family who had been murdered. I have not had that 
experience. I can only hope that I would take the approach which I 
have described in my speech.
<P>
	I would remind him of the appearance of a gentleman to give 
evidence before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs during the pre-study of this bill last June. He had lost a 
loved one through a murder. He was opposed to this bill. He spent a 
great deal of time and committed a great deal of his resources to 
working with inmates in trying to achieve reconciliation and in 
trying to bring them back as working, capable and law-abiding 
members of our society.
<P>
	He believed that was the right approach and he said so before the 
committee. He did not take the view that the person who had 
committed the offence against his loved one should spend the rest 
of his days locked up in prison. He felt it would be better for 
society if that person, assuming he was not a danger to the public, 
could be released and could participate in society as a law-abiding 
citizen.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4578"> 4578 </A></B>
<P>
	Surely the lives of all of us would be enriched if that were the 
case, if that person could in fact be released and would not have 
to spend the rest of his or her time sitting in jail doing, practically 
speaking, nothing.
<P>
	That was his approach. I agree with that approach. It is exactly 
the approach we should take.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member, when he contemplates not the notion 
of punishment but the notion of what is best for our society, would 
agree that if the person does not pose a risk to society, after a 
reasonable period in jail, should be considered for release. I know 
there has to be some sentence served, and 15 years is a long time, 
despite what hon. members suggest. If after 15 years in prison the 
person is no longer a risk, why would we not look at release as a 
possibility? It may be on terms. It always is because the person is, 
after all, under a life sentence. There will always be some 
reporting. There will always be some checking on whereabouts. 
There will always be some restrictions on movement. That follows 
with a life sentence. That is part and parcel of it.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Hon. members say that life only means 25 years. It does not 
because at the end of 25 years murderers still have to apply for 
parole and may not get it.
<P>
	I could name some murderers, and I am sure hon. members 
opposite can too, who are most unlikely to get out under any 
circumstances until the end of their natural lives. There are some in 
prisons in my community who are there for the rest of their lives. I 
know they are not going to get out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> As long as we have people like you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Hon. members can hoot and holler but this is the 
fact.
<P>
	If the public is protected, in my view, we are all enriched by 
making change and saying let us get on with life. Our place as a 
society is to live with the people that are our neighbours, that are 
our fellow citizens. It is not to say that because you have done 
certain things we will shun you forever from our presence. At some 
point we have to recognize that those people may well be back. 
Indeed we should be saying that we will have you back. There are 
going to be terms because you are going to be on a life sentence, 
but we will have you back on certain terms and encourage your 
participation as law-abiding citizens again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
never thought I would see the day that I be voting the same way as 
the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands against a bill. He will 
be voting against the bill for a totally different reason than I am 
because he is applying this warm, fuzzy, love the criminal logic, 
Liberal latitude thinking solely of the criminal, whereas I am 
saying it is time we addressed the victims.
<P>
	Thousands and thousands of victims belong to organizations 
trying to get something done. One petition presented by CAVEAT 
had 2.5 million signatures. Darlene Boyd collected one million 
more signatures. When that many Canadians are joining forces, 
trying to get something done, why would this social engineer we 
call a justice minister literally ignore these petitions? Or better yet, 
what does ignoring these petitions tell Canadians about the Liberal 
government and the justice-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Your time has 
expired, hon. member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I had the opportunity to speak on this bill at 
second reading. At the time, I raised the issue of attitude toward 
this bill, which is an important issue.
<P>
	I think the remarks I made then are still valid, as the government 
did not bring in the amendments we thought it might make to the 
bill to enhance the Canadian system.
<P>
	From the outset, I must say that this is a bill that draws on the 
responsibility of the law makers. It does not deal with details, but 
with important matters affecting human beings, the lives of human 
beings, people, not only criminals, but also the victims' families. It 
makes deciding the issue all the more difficult.
<P>
	We are dealing with a bill to amend the rules for setting the 
parole ineligibility period for individuals sentenced, say, to 25 
years in prison and who, under the existing rules, after serving 15 
years, may apply for a reduced sentence and be released early.
<P>
	We can either give way, as the Reform Party did, to anecdotal 
accounts, individual cases, the kind of stuff that makes the first 
page of newspapers. Our first reaction may be to say: ``The system 
should be much more repressive, to give people who commit such 
heinous crimes no chance of ever getting out of prison''.
<P>
	That is the first attitude, the first reaction we may have, but I 
think that, as law makers, we have a duty to look further, beyond 
this first reaction. We must go and see what the reality is for the 
people in these situations.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	As of December 31, 1995, 175 prisoners were eligible for this 
program. Of these, 76-already fewer than half-had applied for a 
reduction in their number of years of imprisonment without 
eligibility for parole.
<P>
	Of these 76 cases, 39 were granted a reduction. And at December 
31, 1995, out of this total, there was only one repeat offence, a case 
of armed robbery. This was not a repeat offence involving 
assassination or murder, but armed robbery.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4579"> 4579 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, overall-those listening to us know this-there is no 
perfect system that would completely eliminate errors. In all 
human endeavour, there are forms of error. What we must do is 
evaluate whether the system now in place has given and continues 
to give satisfactory results, and then find ways to improve it.
<P>
	I think the situation needs to be looked at very carefully. In this 
regard, the Minister of Justice perhaps gave in too quickly to 
representations that I would call a bit more election minded. We are 
seeing the Reform Party's relentless pursuit of this issue. The 
justice minister, perhaps knowing that an election was coming up, 
gave in a little too quickly. And since he knows that the system is 
working reasonably well, he said: ``We will table a bill with 
amendments that are neither fish nor fowl and that will not really 
improve the situation''.
<P>
	Therefore, rather than adopting this attitude and resorting to a 
litany of examples, as the Reform Party is doing, or to simply try to 
gloss over the situation, as the bill does, I think that we must look 
further for the attitudes to adopt and the positions to take.
<P>
	First, we must ask ourselves whether our goal is to punish these 
people, who are in prison for prolonged periods, some up to 25 
years. Is our goal to rehabilitate them? Is our goal to ensure 
society's safety? In the end, are we not trying to do all these things? 
And must we not try to find a satisfactory balance?
<P>
	Let us remember how it works at the present time. Under the act, 
when someone applies-as we know, 76 of the 175 eligible have 
applied-he appears before a jury, 8 out of 12 of whom must agree. 
These jurors are members of society who have agreed to decide, 
based on their abilities and on the information before them, 
whether the person should benefit from a shorter ineligibility 
period than the one originally set. In other words, the person could 
be paroled at an earlier time than originally set out, at the time of 
sentencing.
<P>
	Let us not forget that this process comes into play 10, 12, 14, 16 
or 18 years after the sentence was handed down. A distinction must 
be made between the time a person was sentenced and the time his 
ineligibility is reviewed. These are two very different issues. To be 
sure, there are times when a person changes his behaviour to the 
point where he could reintegrate society. Statistics tell us that this 
is often the case.
<P>
	However, under the current system, victims, who are an 
important factor in the equation, do not have enough of a say in the 
process. The relatives of victims live a very difficult situation. 
When the victim is a young person, a brother or a sister, the grief is 
such that the survivors look for a way to alleviate it. One such way 
is to think that this unfair, terrible and unacceptable death was 
caused by another person and it would not be humanly correct to let 
this person benefit from a situation where he would not be made to 
realize the seriousness of his action.
<P>
	We agree that there should be greater representation of the 
families of victims. This could be an option for the future, one that 
should have been examined more thoroughly and that should have 
been included in this bill.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	The minister now wants a unanimous decision. This means that 
not 8 out of 12 but 12 out of 12 jury members will have to agree to 
reduce the ineligibility period. This means that everyone on the 
jury must keep an open mind, that no one must decide a given 
application can never be approved on principle. Otherwise, the bill 
would, perhaps not hypocritically but somewhat artificially, close 
all the doors, eliminate any possibility of rehabilitation, without 
actually using the word.
<P>
	On this point, I think the minister is hiding behind a smoke 
screen. That is one of the reasons why we cannot support the bill as 
it now stands, because the government maintains that the decision 
should be approved not by 8 out of 12 but by 12 out of 12 jury 
members. Could a compromise have been reached? Maybe, but the 
government has made no move to that effect.
<P>
	The other criterion is the link to multiple murders. Someone held 
responsible for the murder of more than one person would not be 
eligible. I do not think there is a causal link. Is a double murder 
more serious than a single one? Are there not other elements that 
must be considered, such as the circumstances surrounding the 
case, that are as important as the number of people killed if not 
more so?	
<P>
	It is not an easy situation. It is not easy to evaluate. We have to 
study the present system, and ask ourselves whether this system is 
working as it should, whether there are improvements to be made 
and whether there is anything that should be studied a little more in 
depth.
<P>
	We made representations. We tabled them in the House. 
However, the government did not accept any amendments. I think 
this is one area where we should move carefully. We have to make 
sure that the decisions we make represent a strong consensus 
within society. These are things which have a bearing on us as 
human beings.
<P>
	In this regard, I object to the statement by the Reform Party, 
which said a while ago: ``If you were in such a situation, if a 
member of your own family had been killed-''
<P>
	I think this kind of attitude is very dangerous. We are not in such 
a situation, we are legislators, in a Parliament, who have to make 
decisions for the society as a whole.
<P>
	Here is another example: If I do not keep to the speed limit on 
the highway, I may be highly indignant at the consequences, such 
as being arrested or the like, but it does not necessarily mean that I 
am right.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4580"> 4580 </A></B>
<P>
	In the case of murders, where relatives of the victims are 
emotionally deeply wounded, it is very difficult to ask people in 
that situation to be objective. I do not think it is up to them to 
determine what the sentence should be. It is up to us as legislators 
to take on our responsibilities and evaluate the situation.
<P>
	When judgment is passed, when a person is found guilty of a 
murder and is therefore a criminal, we have to determine, then, the 
sort of person involved and the kind of sentence we are going to 
impose, and it is normally 25 years. But 10, 12, 14 or 15 years later 
we have to review what happened and current circumstances, 
taking into account the behaviour of the person in jail.
<P>
	I believe we must also take into consideration the opinion of the 
family and find a way to allow for the best possible judgment in as 
many instances as possible. In this area, the present system has 
produced some interesting results. It is true enough that there will 
always be crimes which grab the headlines and which we will find 
abhorrent. Yet I think we should also-and I believe it is an 
obligation for the legislator-go and look at all the other cases. If 
among the 39 reductions of the ineligibility period there is only one 
case of recidivism, it means that 38 of these people did not 
re-offend.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	That means that a number of these people are back on the streets 
and do not constitute a security risk in our society. We have 
managed to reach one of our goals I just mentioned, securing 
rehabilitation without endangering society. We have to make sure 
our actions do just that.
<P>
	Should we have simply referred this bill back to committee to 
hear more experts, study various cases again, evaluate this situation 
once more and look for some compromise? Should we have 
amended the bill so that families can be heard when a review of 
parole ineligibility is requested? Should we have raised the ratio of 
jurors from 8 to 9 or 10 out of 12? Is this something we should have 
looked at?
<P>
	These are important aspects which the government has refused 
to consider, so that we are now heading for a dead end. The 
government knows the present system gives fairly good results, but 
it has to deal with electoral pressures. Reform members have been 
talking about petitions with thousands of signatures asking for 
harsher treatment of criminals.
<P>
	But the responsibility of government members in this area is not 
to give in to voter pressure, but to ensure that the systems they set 
up are effective and will properly meet the objectives of our 
criminal justice system.
<P>
	It is true that individuals must be very conscious of the 
consequences of their actions and that punishment must be 
proportionate to the offence so they understand the consequences 
and know what they are exposing themselves to, but, we must also 
ask ourselves if we are  able to rehabilitate some of the individuals 
we put in jail and if we must keep in jail those we cannot 
rehabilitate because they pose a threat to society.
<P>
	I think that, as legislators, we have that kind of responsibility, 
and the bill before us does not improve in any way on the current 
situation. If we adopt this bill, we will not be in a position to say, 
five or ten years from now, that we improved the possibility of 
rehabilitation and our society a safer place.
<P>
	We consider the bill to be incomplete and in need of more fine 
tuning, that is why the Bloc Quebecois cannot vote for it unless the 
government amends it in a way that brings it more in line with the 
objectives set at the beginning of the process. The government 
should also take this opportunity to study the whole question of 
violence in our society to be able to avoid simplistic solutions, 
because the solutions put forward by the Reform Party will not 
solve the problem and will not reduce criminality.
<P>
	There will not be fewer murders because people will not have the 
possibility of getting a reduction of their parole ineligibility period. 
This is not the way things are decided at the time the crime is 
committed. As legislators, I think we have to review this issue, to 
refine it or, if absolutely necessary, to maintain the current 
legislation, which still has given interesting results, and introduce 
new legislation only when we have been able to put on the table 
solutions that will really improve the situation. That is why the 
Bloc members will vote against the bill.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I ask the hon. member how many individual families he 
knows that have suffered this trauma of having somebody in their 
family murdered, what the consequences were for these families 
and how they coped with this situation.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	I know a few such families and I find it almost unbelievable that 
we do not address this issue. We looked more or less at the issue of 
rehabilitation rather than at the trauma these people have caused in 
the communities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête: </B>Madam Speaker, for each of the bills we vote on, we 
have not necessarily personally experienced the situations facing 
the people whom we have to make decisions on.
<P>
	Except that, in the present situation, perhaps because of my age, 
we have had to give much consideration, in the past 20 years, to the 
objectives we were aiming at with the justice system. We put in 
place some things that are aimed at a form of rehabilitation and I 
believe we were pretty successful. No one challenged the statistics 
that were given on that. These are official statistics.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4581"> 4581 </A></B>
<P>
	Of the 175 people eligible as of December 31, 1995, 76 applied 
for a reduction of their parole ineligibility period; 39 got a 
reduction and only one committed another crime. The crime was 
armed robbery, not murder.
<P>
	So, this information tells us the current system is still working 
pretty well. There are certainly things we must look at more 
closely, and one of the elements that was not put forward in the 
reform to insure better rehabilitation is the issue of consulting the 
families when we decide whether or not to reduce the parole 
ineligibility period. We should add that, we could put it in more 
specifically, we could give them a more important voice in the 
process, and I am part of that.
<P>
	It is important to understand all the psychological process that 
these people undergo. The evidence is there: the families of victims 
do not suffer any less. It is not because the murderer is going to 
serve 25 years that the victim's family is going to grieve less. There 
is no direct link in this respect.
<P>
	Nobody has ever proven there was one. If we have proof, I would 
like to see it. I understand that, for someone in such a situation, for 
a victim's parents, life is very hard, but the way to alleviate their 
sadness is not necessarily to make sure that the individual who has 
committed the murder, the criminal act, is punished. It will not 
make them feel any better.
<P>
	I believe that, as lawmakers, we have to take the whole situation 
into account. We have to look more into what human reactions are 
in such situations and act accordingly. At the moment, the way 
things are handled, I believe that the status quo is much better than 
the amendments proposed by the government or a rigid approach, 
which would not solve anything.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
in the last sentence I think we were getting to what I am interested 
in, which is the actual position of the Bloc Quebecois on this 
section. Is it that the status quo is what the law should be or is it that 
the status quo is better than the amendments that have been 
proposed? Exactly what is it?
<P>
	The hon. member in his speech said that maybe we have not 
taken into account the perspective of the victims. Maybe the hon. 
member has not read the bill. I draw his attention to page 4 of the 
bill, section 745.3(1), subparagraphs c and d.
<P>
	One thing the jury shall consider-it is mandatory-is the nature 
of the offence for which the applicant was convicted. That deals 
with the hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan's problem that the 
jury does not know how heinous the crime was.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	Second, sub (d) states that any information provided by a victim 
at the time of the imposition of the sentence shall be considered by 
the jury. That is, any information provided by a victim at the time 
of the imposition of the sentence or at the time of the hearing under 
this section. It is obvious that the victim's perspective is dealt with 
in subparagraph (d). The jury is required to consider any comments 
that the victim's family made at the time the sentence was imposed 
or at the time of the review under this section. Perhaps the hon. 
member could explain why he feels this bill does not deal with the 
victims.
<P>
	Could the hon. member please, in one sentence, tell us what the 
position is of the Bloc Quebecois so that the people of Quebec 
know? Is the position that the current law is just fine? If it is, say 
so. If it is not, what precisely is wrong and what would the Bloc 
Quebecois suggest should be in the bill?
<P>
	May I remind him in closing, while he is thinking about an 
answer to those two questions, that he and some hon. members, in 
my opinion, are confusing section 745 with sentencing. This has 
nothing to do with sentencing. Sentencing is imposed by the law. 
Life imprisonment is the sentence. Section 745 deals with how long 
a person has to stay in prison before they can apply for parole. 
When the jury decides that it will be 15 years instead of 25, it is not 
deciding to let the person out, it is deciding that the person will 
have to serve 15 years before they can make an application to the 
parole board. It is the parole board that will decide under the 
appropriate legislation whether that person will be released.
<P>
	Let us stick with the legal realities of what we are talking about. 
We are not talking about sentencing. We are talking about how long 
the term will be before a person can apply to the parole board.
<P>
	What I am really interested in is what the heck is the position of 
the Bloc Quebecois?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête: </B>Madam Speaker, in response to my colleague's 
question the easy part of my answer is that we certainly do not want 
the Liberal wishy-washy approach. This is very clear.
<P>
	They claim they want to change things, to make them better, but 
in the end they just make suggestions that slam the door, because 
they do not have the guts to clearly say what they want, because 
they are influenced by right-wing attitudes and the Reform's 
approach. To save some votes, they do something which is neither 
here nor there. For instance, compared to the way things were 
before, requiring unanimity in the jury is tantamount to slamming 
the door.
<P>
	When you think that screening by a chief justice will be required 
before any application is submitted to a jury, this means that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4582"> 4582 </A></B>
<P>
chances of parole are almost non-existent.  To exclude all those 
committing multiple murders is trying to close the door on 
something that has no basis.
<P>
	The Bloc is not ready to put up a smokescreen with such purely 
cosmetic amendments. If the government wants to make changes, 
it should propose real fundamental changes; once they are on the 
table, we will examine them and see if they would really bring 
about some improvement.
<P>
	As the member knows, statistics show that the present system is 
far more efficient than the one they are proposing. They have 
submitted a bill with a little window dressing in order to be able to 
say to people: ``Look. We have done something about that issue; 
the results are not so important; we put a bill to the House and we 
hope to score some political points with that.''
<P>
	That is unacceptable on the part of a supposedly responsible 
government.
<P>
	As far as confusing sentencing, I think the member missed part 
of my presentation. This is exactly what I explained when I said we 
had to make a fundamental difference between the sentence given 
by a judge and the evaluation of the ineligibility period, or the 
eligibility later on.
<P>
	When time comes to decide if, after 15, 18 or 20 years, someone 
will be eligible for parole, the situation is entirely different from 
the initial one, because years have gone by and circumstances have 
changed. I think our position on this point is quite clear.
<P>
	Finally, I think we could go further in consulting the families.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Indeed, I think that the measures proposed in the bill do not go 
far enough, that they should be strengthened. With what we know 
today about the rules that govern human activity, I think we could 
go much further, because we have to rise above the anecdotal and 
demagogy and try to draft a bill that will improve the situation.
<P>
	Instead of voting for this tarted up legislation, the Bloc 
Quebecois would much rather keep things as they are and continue 
to trust the people who gave us what we have now, so that in a 
number of years we will have scrutinized this whole issue. No one 
in the Bloc ever said that we were not ready to reflect upon this. We 
should go back to the committee, go back to the drawing board and 
come back will a truly finished product.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on 
this very important issue at third reading stage.
<P>
	To approach the issue I will take a little walk through history and 
have a look at where this section came from,  how it came about, 
why there is a problem and what the Liberal government proposes 
to do about it. I support the legislation and I will explain why. I will 
try to indicate why I do not think the criticisms that have been 
levelled against the legislation really stand up to logic.
<P>
	Let us go back to 1976 when Parliament abolished capital 
punishment. There was a huge debate. The representatives of the 
people in this House decided for whatever reasons that capital 
punishment was going to be abolished.
<P>
	Once we abolish capital punishment for high treason and for first 
degree murder, what are we going to do with people who have 
committed high treason or first degree murder? We have to do 
something with them. There are really only two things we can do. 
We can either put them in jail and throw away the key and never 
look at them again, which is life in prison, period, full stop, or we 
can put them in prison for life with an opportunity to apply for 
parole at some point in time if they have demonstrated a number of 
things, including that they will not reoffend and that they have been 
rehabilitated.
<P>
	If society opts for life in prison, full stop, that is it, there is no 
need to discuss when these people might get parole because they 
are not going to get parole. Back in 1976 our society decided not to 
take that approach. That is a fact. That is a 20 year fact. So we are 
dealing with facts, not how we would like things to have been in 
1976, but how they are in 1996. We have to deal with what has 
happened over the last 20 years.
<P>
	What did Parliament decide? Parliament decided not to go with 
life in prison, period, full stop. It decided to go with life in prison 
with a chance of being considered for parole after 25 years. Some 
might argue that should have been where it stopped. But there were 
people who were concerned back in 1976, as there are people 
today-and we just heard one of them speak-that this is an 
awfully long time and that people do change, that they do 
rehabilitate, that they do become different people and that the 
quality of mercy we should extend to them.
<P>
	Those people said there might be circumstances where a person 
has committed a first degree murder for one reason or another and 
has served 15, 16 or 17 years, and maybe there will be cases where 
that person deserves to be allowed to apply for parole.
<P>
	So a line was drawn by the parliamentarians of that day in 1976, 
and that line said if you commit first degree murder, you will be 
sentenced to life in prison. You will have the opportunity to apply 
for parole after you have served 25 years. By the way, you do have 
a faint hope of applying for parole before 25 years if you take the 
section 745 route.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	What is the section 745 route? Murderers have to serve at least 
15 years. Once they have served their 15 years they then apply to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4583"> 4583 </A></B>
<P>
have a jury consider what, whether  they deserve a retrial, are not 
guilty or are a different person? No. It is for a jury to decide 
whether the person should be allowed to apply to the parole board 
at any time between 15 and 25 years. That is what the jury is 
deciding in that case.
<P>
	The person goes before a jury of his peers, ordinary citizens of 
the community who have been brought in under the juries acts of 
the various provinces, and the community thereby is consulted, 
which is exactly what the Reform Party wants. It wants the 
community consulted. What better consultation is there than 
members of a jury from everyday Canada listening to the 
application of a convicted murderer?
<P>
	Let us not forget we are not talking about refugees here. We are 
talking about convicted first degree murderers, people who have 
killed people, people who have done the worst thing that we can 
think of in society, which is why they must spend the rest of their 
lives in jail unless they are paroled. That is the reality. They must 
spend the rest of their lives in jail unless they are paroled, which is 
the worst sentence we can give short of hanging in this country.
<P>
	One could make much of the fact that it is a 25 year sentence, but 
that is not true. It is a life sentence. We should deal with reality, not 
rhetoric.
<P>
	The murderer goes before a jury. We know this is happening but 
why is it coming up? Finally since 1976 more than 15 years have 
passed and these first degree murderers are starting to make their 
applications. Without quibbling about the numbers, the numbers I 
have show that out of 2,085 murderers currently in the prison 
population as of December 1995, 574 of them are first degree 
murderers. I am concentrating my remarks on first degree 
murderers. Of those 574, 175 have already become eligible to 
apply under section 745 as it currently exists. Out of those, a 
whopping percentage, one might say, has been successful in getting 
some reduction. That is the problem because this gets people all 
upset.
<P>
	We have people who have killed police, children, mothers, 
fathers, some of them are killing their own children, name the 
horrendous crimes, and some of them are being allowed by a jury 
of ordinary Canadians to what, get out of jail? No. They are being 
allowed to apply to the parole board to demonstrate why they 
should be allowed out on parole.
<P>
	Some would have the section abolished. I was one of those who 
supported at second reading the bill from the hon. member for York 
South-Weston that would have abolished section 745. I want to 
address this because the Reform Party has made a lot about all 
these people who supported that bill and who are now supporting 
this bill. Let me tell members why.
<P>
	At the time the hon. member's bill was brought forward this bill 
was not here. Section 745 as it is written  is no good, plain and 
simple. Therefore if we do not fix it we have to get rid of it. There 
was nothing by way of fixing on the agenda. I do not want it in the 
Criminal Code as it currently exists, which I will explain in a 
moment. In the absence of a suggestion to make it better, stronger, 
to tighten it up and look after some of the loopholes that I think are 
there, there was no alternative but to vote in favour of a bill that 
would call for its scrapping, which is exactly what I did.
<P>
	Now in response to the obvious desire of the House of Commons 
to do something about section 745, the Minister of Justice has 
come up with this bill. Let us look at it. What was one of the 
problems with section 745? Personally I have a problem with the 
fact that only eight out of twelve jurors can make the decision to 
allow for a reduced period of time before applying for parole. The 
hon. member for Kingston and the Islands does not agree with me. 
It should be unanimous. The hon. member who just spoke from the 
Bloc Quebecois does not agree with me. He does not think it should 
be unanimous. It should be.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	It is the crown representing the people that must convince a jury 
beyond a reasonable doubt, all 12 of them, that the person is guilty. 
That is a very onerous burden. The crown must convince a 
unanimous jury that this person, beyond a reasonable doubt, is a 
murderer, has done the most heinous thing that this country knows 
about, that is kill, take another life. That is a very high burden.
<P>
	Once the crown has met that burden and has demonstrated to a 
jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, unanimously, that the person is a 
murderer, it is not too much to ask that the murderer demonstrate to 
a unanimous jury on a lesser burden, balance of probabilities, that 
the murderer deserves to have an opportunity to apply for parole 
before serving 25 years.
<P>
	Why should it be that it is only the crown who must convince a 
jury unanimously? Why should the convicted murder, who in effect 
is seeking clemency, not be required to show a unanimous jury that 
he should be entitled to clemency, that he should be entitled to that 
which he is not entitled to by law because he must serve 25 years.
<P>
	That is why there is a real problem. It is not fair that the 
convicted murderer has a lesser burden than we in society who are 
trying to be protected from that person. That person lost his rights, 
as far as I am concerned, when he took another human life.
<P>
	He has to serve the penalty imposed by society unless society 
decides to give him a second chance. How does society decide? 
The section 745 process. It is society by way of a jury. It is not 
some judge. It is not the Minister of Justice. It is not the House of 
Commons. It is a jury of peers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4584"> 4584 </A></B>
<P>
	A person must wonder, if you are in the Reform Party, with the 
greatest respect, how it is that 80 per cent of applications have 
been allowed by juries, not by judges, but by ordinary Canadians. 
Eighty per cent of them have been allowed. These people are 
insurance brokers, neighbours, in the lawn bowling league, 
grocers, clerks and car salesmen in your community sitting on a 
community jury making the decision. It may have been only eight 
out of twelve. Four did not want it and fought really hard. Eight 
out of twelve was good enough. How wrong have the juries been? 
Anybody can fool around with statistics.
<P>
	We have already heard that of the people who have been granted 
parole by a jury, by the community, one has reoffended. Out of 50, 
one has reoffended so far. One is too much. That person was 
sentenced for armed robbery. As far as I am concerned, one chance 
and you are gone, buddy. You had your chance. You were sentenced 
to life. You have committed armed robbery. I will never see you 
again. Take care. Enjoy Kingston prison. One out of 50 is as close 
to perfect as we can get without being perfect, in terms of whether 
or not they have convicted another crime.
<P>
	There is another aspect to it and that is denunciation. That is a 
fair question and is a reasonable thing to ask about. What is a 
human life worth? Is it worth killing the killer? Some would say 
yes. Is it worth locking the killer away and letting him or her rot in 
prison? Some would say yes.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	How far do you go? Why not just give them bread and water, 
hard labour, or put them into a military camp? Why not send them 
up to the Arctic? There are all kinds of approaches that people can 
take but society as a whole has decided that short of hanging, 
murderers are going to spend the rest of their natural lives in 
prison, in reasonably human conditions, with food, water and 
amenities unless they can demonstrate why they should get out.
<P>
	In my opinion this bill plugs the loophole of requiring unanimity. 
That reflects the same considerations that the community gave in 
convicting the person of the crime in whether or not they should 
receive clemency. That is really what we are talking about under a 
different word, clemency.
<P>
	Are we going to make murderers sit in prison for the rest of their 
lives, or at least 25 years of it, or are we going to give them an 
opportunity to try to demonstrate to the parole board prior to 25 
years that they should be let out? Remember the parole board has 
the legislative ability to decide whether people should be let out or 
not. If a person is in prison for life the parole board can only let that 
person out as the legislation states.
<P>
	The first thing that is good about this bill is that unanimity is 
required. It is going to tighten up  applications and fewer people are 
going to get out. That is exactly how it should be because this is a 
faint hope clause. In my opinion, it should be the exception who 
has demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt, at least to a jury, 
that he deserves the clemency of society notwithstanding that he 
took a human life. This person has spent a period of time in prison 
and as a result has learned a lesson and will never commit this 
crime again. There are a whole series of reasons why this is done.
<P>
	One hon. member was quite right in saying that no matter how 
long a person serves in prison, the victim's family will never feel 
better. That is true. The victim is dead but that is a circular 
argument. Except with money crimes a person can never put 
anybody back in a situation that that person was in before a crime 
was committed.
<P>
	If you are assaulted, Madam Speaker, and somebody gets two 
years in jail, I am sure if somebody asked you if you would prefer 
never to have been assaulted and had your nose broken and your 
eyesight destroyed or whatever the case may have been, or should 
the guy have gotten five years, you would say you would never 
have had the crime in the first place.
<P>
	Obviously we are reacting as a society to things that people 
would rather not have had happen. People kill people so we have to 
deal with them. Being human beings there are a variety of reasons 
for this.
<P>
	The first thing to do is to tighten section 745. We live in a 
political world, a political place and we have to recognize when 
something is or is not doable. For a variety of political reasons at 
this point in the history of this country abolishing section 745 is not 
doable. Members can rant and rave all they want, it is not doable.
<P>
	If that is recognized as the case then the next best thing is to 
make the best of what is offered. Everybody in the House except 
for a few hon. members would argue that there is something wrong 
with section 745. Some would say get rid of it, others would say 
tighten it and then there are various planes in between. Very few 
would say that it is perfect the way it is although some would.
<P>
	In a real world if you are not going to get what you want you go 
for second best. Second best to abolishing is fixing. To say that I 
did not get abolition therefore I am going to oppose it under all 
costs is shortsighted.
<P>
	In my opinion what should be done is to make suggestions for 
betterment. That was my suggestion before the justice committee a 
year and a half ago. It was roundly dismissed by the justice 
minister. A year and a half later there it is in the legislation. So you 
can do that.
<P>
	The screening process, unanimity of the jury and nobody who is 
a multiple murderer will ever have an opportunity to apply for 
parole are enough for me to support this bill.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first of 
all, I want to clear up some misconceptions. At the beginning of his 
speech, the hon. member gave us the historical background of the 
judicial review, but forgot to mention certain things. Indeed, the 
judicial review came into force in 1976, when the Trudeau 
government wanted the death penalty to be abolished. That much is 
true.
<P>
	But why was the judicial review established at that time? To 
ensure a majority to vote in favour of the death sentence. That is 
why in 1976 the government tried to amend what is contained in 
Bill C-45. To get the votes. It is important to understand how things 
stood at the time. There was a little bargaining going on at that 
time, one vote on one thing for a vote on another thing. I will give 
you this if you give me that. In politics, that is essentially what the 
Liberals do regularly: ``Vote for me and I will vote for you some 
other time''.
<P>
	As for the present legislation and the three proposed 
amendments, it is obvious that, despite the rhetoric we just heard, 
these three provisions will not improve the legislation.
<P>
	Let us take, for example, the first amendment, which requires 
unanimity instead of the support of two thirds of the jury. If one 
member of the jury says no, the judicial review application will be 
rejected. The Bloc Quebecois has proposed changes to these 
amendments, which were brought forward by my colleagues at 
second reading.
<P>
	The second amendment concerns the removal of the right of 
multiple murderers to apply for judicial review. This amendment is 
totally arbitrary and unfair. I think we could have focused on these 
words instead of relating facts that we continuously read about in 
the newspapers.
<P>
	As for the third amendment, will it increase access? This 
amendment will restrict access to the judicial review. It will 
become practically impossible for anybody to use it. We have 
suggested that this whole issue be sent back to committee for 
further study.
<P>
	Here is the question I want to ask my colleague: Is he willing to 
defend this bill before his caucus, to send it back to committee and 
to stop relying on the emotional reactions that this bill has created 
because it was introduced in the House following certain events?
<P>
	Therefore, why not suggest that his caucus do a more detailed 
study, and, in particular, that ordinary Canadians, who could give 
this bill more credibility, be consulted?
<P>
	In closing, I would tell him this: The public would be happy to 
have its say on this amendment to the act. I would also tell him that 
using this bill to play politics is political opportunism and not the 
best way to ensure a good bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Madam Speaker, it is interesting that the member 
calls for consultations. I would remind him that Bill C-41 is before 
the House. A section of that bill got a lot of headlines and a lot of 
debate in this House. One of the sections that was dealt with in Bill 
C-41 was section 745. Surprise.
<P>
	I was on the justice committee then. A lot of people had the 
opportunity to make whatever submissions they wanted to make on 
section 745. A few did. A few did say to get rid of it and a few said 
to keep it.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	There was ample opportunity for consultation with respect to 
section 745. That is exactly where I moved my amendment to 
require that the jury be unanimous in reaching its verdict. When I 
say verdict, I should not use that term legally; I mean in reaching 
its decision of whether or not to allow for reduced eligibility for 
parole.
<P>
	There was a lot of consultation on section 745. As it happens it is 
a huge bill which also contains the words ``sexual orientation'' and 
everybody started talking about that, except the people on the 
justice committee who were doing their jobs. We looked at every 
section and talked about a whole host of sections and made 
amendments. There were consultations.
<P>
	Also, I have no problem at all, none, in saying that if there is one 
single member of a jury who says no, then it is no. Just as the 
convicted criminal has no problem if one single member of the jury 
says not guilty and the other 11 say guilty and he walks free. He has 
no problem with that. I have no problem with one saying no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
heard in the speech by the hon. member that he still referred to this 
clause as the faint hope clause. I would suggest that after 80 per 
cent approval of some of these applications it has become the sure 
bet clause, not the faint hope clause.
<P>
	He also said that through the use of a jury the voice of the people 
would be represented through a unanimous decision. If he is really 
concerned that the voice of the people is heard, then he would 
probably support a referendum on capital punishment. A national 
binding referendum would certainly give the voice of the people a 
chance to be heard.
<P>
	I know the gentleman from our work together on the justice 
committee. I would say that he is a real fighter but I find it amazing 
that he would fight for second best. Apparently he believes 
abolishment would be first best. He said that fighting for second 
best is what we need to do.
<P>
	I remind the member that if he is going home at night not to go 
only half way or he will never get there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4586"> 4586 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Madam Speaker, I know the gentleman from my 
days on the justice committee and I know him as a fighter as well.
<P>
	Faint hope. One reason there is an 80 per cent success rate is that 
it is 8 out of 12. I think when there is unanimity it will get back to 
where it should be, the exceptional case and not the rule.
<P>
	On a binding referendum. I do not agree with referendums, 
generally speaking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Do you believe in elections?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Yes, I do believe in elections. As a matter of fact 
that is why I am sitting in this seat. When I first ran in 1988 I told 
the people of Scarborough West that I did not believe in capital 
punishment. I have never believed in capital punishment, ever 
since I found out what the heck it was. I stood up and I said that and 
I am here for my second term. If they want to get rid of me on that 
issue, I am not going to change my mind. I do not believe in capital 
punishment. I do believe in life incarceration unless it is 
demonstrated that society should grant clemency. That is where I 
draw the line.
<P>
	Concerning accepting second best, I do not think that section 745 
should be abolished because I do think there is the occasional 
person who would benefit from this. Everybody, depending on the 
facts, will show mercy in a certain set of facts. That is the point of 
this clause: to show some compassion in certain circumstances. If 
we shut the door completely to compassion and hope, what is left in 
life?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it has been a lively debate and time is drawing on.
<P>
	It is very obvious that the Reform Party believes that all persons 
convicted of first degree murder should be imprisoned for life with 
no chance for parole or conditional release in any form for 25 
years. Consequently, section 745 of the Criminal Code should be 
repealed.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	I remind the hon. gentleman from Scarborough West that when a 
criminal or a murderer is before the justice system, he gets 
convicted or he gets released. If the sentence he gets is not to his 
liking, he can appeal the decision and he can keep appealing the 
decision until he reaches the Supreme Court. We have seen in the 
last decade or so that anyone convicted of murder receives the best 
judicial people in the world to defend them. If we have gone 
through the process and the person is given a life sentence, it 
should mean life.
<P>
	It is only because some weak-kneed politicians have refrained 
from making decisions which would benefit this country that we 
are $600 billion in debt today which our future generations will 
probably never look after. Weak-kneed politicians, out of 
convenience, have said  that punishment is not a deterrent. I would 
like anyone to prove to me that punishment is not a deterrent.
<P>
	I wonder why the government is continually bringing forward 
bills which introduce severe punishment for society. The 
non-compliance bill is definitely one which tries to infer that stiffer 
punishments will deter violators. If it works in monetary bills and 
in other bills, why will it not work in the justice system?
<P>
	The Reform Party mirrors very well Canadians' displeasure with 
the current weak justice system. Criminals are brazen and tough 
and do not respect the justice system.
<P>
	During the weekend of September 16 in Winnipeg a senior of 75 
years of age found herself with two intruders in her bedroom at 
night. What did these people do? They rolled her up in a blanket 
and made sure she could not move. They tried to take off her 
wedding ring. They said if they could not get the ring off they 
would cut it off. Finally they tore off the chain which was around 
her neck. They went through her premises, ravaged about and took 
what they wanted. Then they stabbed her in the neck and in the 
shoulders and left her for dead.
<P>
	What happened? This lady managed to get to a telephone. She 
called the police to tell them what had happened to her. What 
happened within 15 or 20 minutes after the police arrived? The 
same criminals came back to the same house looking for more stuff 
to plunder. They thought they had probably killed the lady and she 
would not have been able to phone the police. They were brazen 
enough to take the chance to return to take more items.
<P>
	I suggest to the House that these people probably felt that if they 
got caught they would be better off inside the prison system 
anyway, so why would they not go back to see if there were more 
things in the house? Is this the type of society we want to protect or 
that we want to encourage to develop in future generations?
<P>
	What happens to the victims and their families? Fortunately, I 
have not had to stand at too many murder victims' graves. I have 
never seen any faint hope clause for them. There is not one single 
instance where those victims will take another breath of fresh air. 
Those people are put six feet under the ground and all the families 
have to remember of that person is a mound of dirt and a headstone.
<P>
	I listened to the family who had their 16-year old daughter 
abducted in the middle of the afternoon. She was tied up, thrown 
into a storage shed and froze to death. After 15 years I have never 
heard those people say: ``We don't wish that our daughter was 
back''.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	It appalls me when I hear some people in this House say that we 
have to rehabilitate these criminals. The person that committed that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4587"> 4587 </A></B>
<P>
crime was never found. These  people have never had to think 
about how they would feel toward that criminal, but every time 
they talk to a community or share their experience, all they have 
left are the positive memories that child provided for them. This 
teenage girl had a tremendous influence on her class and on her 
community, and her life was snubbed out without any 
consideration.
<P>
	Now they want to tell me it is some chemical imbalance that 
makes people do something like this. Never in my 60 years had I 
even thought of considering that. The people who commit some of 
these heinous crimes have never had any discipline. They have 
never had any punishment. They have always had their way and 
they only think of one thing: themselves. They would not hesitate 
to put a knife or a bullet into somebody else if they thought they 
could get some advantage from it.
<P>
	I do not know what it will take for politicians to realize that in 
the past 25 years this country has become a worse place to live in, 
not a safer place. Twenty-five years ago we had been farming for 
about a dozen years and we never thought of locking the door. We 
never thought of locking our gas tanks. We never thought that we 
should stay at home at night because there could be somebody 
loose and on the prowl. My in-laws who lived in town never dreamt 
of locking their doors.
<P>
	Today people dare not go away. If they do not get robbed or if 
their buildings are not ransacked, something is wrong. I wonder if 
this is the type of society we have come to appreciate and accept. 
As long as I am in this House I will speak against this type of 
society. I have been to countries and have seen what has become of 
societies that have to protect themselves from the criminal 
element. They put steel fences around their property and they keep 
the criminals out, not in.
<P>
	If this government does not start to realize that is the direction 
we are going in, it will not be too many generations before we are 
doing the very same thing. We can see the start of it in some 
communities already. Rather than protecting their homes from 
criminals, they are protecting themselves so they cannot get out 
into society.
<P>
	One Monday morning in early September I turned on the radio 
and heard of a young girl named Megan Ramsay. She was five 
years old. Her mother's common law husband smashed her head in 
with a baseball bat. A five-year old kid. How can a human being be 
so degrading that they can do that?
<P>
	I had to put down animals when I farmed but I never had the 
heart to use a stick or a bat to kill them. I would go for some kind of 
instrument that put them away quickly. Here in a family situation a 
stepfather used a baseball bat. And when he was arrested he was 
charged with second degree murder. Tell me ladies and gentleman, 
how can we put second degree murder on somebody who uses a 
baseball bat to kill a five-year old girl?
<P>
	That is how insensitive we have become to this type of conduct. 
We have come to the point where we know it is going to happen 
every day. If it has not happened to us personally, we say that we 
are lucky. But there is no place in this country where it is safe 
anymore. Twenty-five years ago I did not know what a drive-by 
shooting was. Today we see it in rural communities like Miami and 
Altona, Manitoba, areas where there was practically no crime 25 
years ago. What has happened to this country? We have 
representatives in this House who really do not care in what 
direction we are going as long as it buys them a vote and they will 
be back here.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	I hear members say that society has made these decisions. I have 
never seen a referendum on capital punishment. I have not seen a 
referendum on section 745 to circumvent the judgments the 
judicial system puts on the criminal or murderer.
<P>
	If we are going to stand up in this House and use rhetoric that 
seems to suit our ears instead of addressing the issues, we will not 
make very many decisions to benefit this country.
<P>
	Why am I so dead set against reversing sentences when they 
have been pronounced by our judicial system? If we circumvent 
one law we can do it in other laws.
<P>
	There is a situation right now in my province where a farmer has 
gone to jail for selling his own grain for the best price he could. 
That is not the worst violation, but we also have a farmer who has 
been benefiting tremendously by keeping his mouth shut and not 
opening up to say what really happened. If this is justice we are 
going down the wrong track.
<P>
	When we are going down the wrong track it is only a matter of 
time before we have a derailment. The derailment of the justice 
system over the last 25 or 30 years is something everybody saw 
coming as soon as capital punishment was done away with, without 
going to the people for their advice. It was politicians who thought 
they knew better. They knew what the country needed. Today I 
must say we have gone a long way toward that derailment and 
sooner or later the whole train will crash.
<P>
	We have seen it in different countries where that has happened, 
Rwanda, Africa and other countries in Asia. We can name one after 
another.
<P>
	We still have a democracy where we can change things, but if we 
are going to address our problems the way we have in the last 
couple of sessions, I do not have very much hope that we are going 
to avoid catastrophes.
<P>
	Hon. members across the way know that when we came in here 
and said zero in three they threw up their hands and said ``no way, 
we don't need to balance our budget''. If they had done it three 
years ago as we asked them to do we would have money to spend 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4588"> 4588 </A></B>
<P>
on  rehabilitating some of these minor criminals, not the major 
criminals.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Tell the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> That is the truth. It is the honest to goodness 
truth, and the hon. member knows it. Six hundred billion dollars in 
debt and his grandchildren will never pay it. That is the truth.
<P>
	If hon. members say that is not the truth, then let them call it a 
lie. If it is not the truth then it is a lie and we have $600 billion of 
debt.
<P>
	I am sure the people who helped implement the policies which 
created that debt are not going to pay it back. They would not even 
want to try.
<P>
	It is the same way with the justice system. If they want to try to 
reverse the system they had better start getting on track and doing 
something about it instead of using rhetoric which sounds like it 
was taken from some futuristic generation that did not know what 
death was. That is what we are talking about.
<P>
	When I stand at the graveside of one of those murdered people I 
know there is an imprint on that family for its entire life. Nobody 
can erase it no matter how the criminal is rehabilitated. The 
impression on the memory is there.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	I will tell the House how I know this. My grandmother, who 
came out of the Russian revolution, reminisced day after day 
before she died about the tragedies she had faced. She died while in 
a coma. These families that have murder victims in their families 
will never forget it no matter how rehabilitated the criminal is.
<P>
	If that is not a message that should go to everyone's heart I do 
not know what else I can say. Does anyone want to see that vision 
in their dying days? Does anyone want to lay there in a coma 
thinking: ``I was there and I helped defend the criminals instead of 
going after the protection of the victims and the citizens''?
<P>
	We heard a Bible quote from someone which stated we should 
forgive. I also know a Bible quote which states that the government 
has been given the sword to exercise it. That does not mean just to 
defend its borders. The government is there to exercise that sword 
to protect its individual citizens, which is one thing this 
government is not doing. It is weak-kneed and arrogant and will not 
listen to the general public.
<P>
	If we went to a referendum today on capital punishment, if any 
indication of my constituency has an effect over the country, it 
would pass by 85 per cent to 95 per cent. Why are we afraid to go to 
a binding referendum? Why do we not give the people in this 
country a chance to say what they feel? Why do we not finally 
listen to the grassroots people and do what they want us to do? No 
way. That is too easy. We would rather  sit here day after day and 
joke about the problems we have in this country.
<P>
	It is not a joke anymore when we have hundreds of people 
murdered every year and hundreds of thousands of people on 
welfare who cannot find a job because we have spent the future 
they deserved. What else can I tell this Parliament? Disband and 
have an election? No, we do not want elections too often because 
that is costly, I agree, but I am sure that a lot of these issues will not 
be talked about in the next election. They will be hid underneath 
some other political rhetoric.
<P>
	What are we going to do about that? After 60 years in this 
country I have seen the good times and the poor times, but I hope 
we get better times. In 1972 when we had probably the most fluent 
times in the farming industry, when wheat went from $1.50 to $5 or 
$6, my mother said you will see starvation in this country. This is 
exactly what happened in the Soviet Union in 1912 to 1914. People 
got rich. I said it could never happen. Today I have seen it. I have 
seen food banks which I have never seen before in every city and 
every town, something we thought could never happen in this 
country.
<P>
	There have been drive-by shootings which we thought could 
never happen in this country. We have had mass murders to an 
extent we had never seen before and we are saying that the price of 
justice is not a deterrent. Punishment is not a deterrent. Why are we 
implementing any legislation? Why are we giving speeding 
tickets? Why are we giving this and that? Abandon them. If 
punishment is not a deterrent let us forget it.
<P>
	I appreciate these few moments. I hope I have a few members 
thinking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened attentively to the remarks of the hon. 
member across the way. I want to tell the House how profoundly I 
disagree with many of the things he said. He is making this country 
appear uncaring. He is making us into something other than 
Canadians, and he is wrong. All Canadians are proud of the great 
record that we have in terms of our crime rate, which is much lower 
than many others, and so on.
<P>
	Some people across are going to heckle.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	The crime rate has fallen 1 per cent for the fourth year in a row. 
Violent crime fell 4 per cent, the third decline and the largest drop 
since 1962. The homicide rate has dropped 3 per cent, reaching its 
lowest level since 1969. Minor assaults have dropped 3 per cent. 
Sexual assaults dropped 21 per cent. Homicides involving firearms 
dropped 10 per cent.
<P>
	We heard comments from the hon. member across, somehow 
trying to draw a parallel between the situation in this country and 
the civil war that occurred in the  Soviet Union under the white and 
red Russians. That is what he said.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4589"> 4589 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Yes, the member across the way has said it, it is so much 
rhetoric. That is what we have just heard from the member across 
the way.
<P>
	Finally, he told us that the situation in Canada resembled, or 
could resemble, that in Rwanda. Such statements are insulting.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some hon. members across are displaying, by a show of hands, 
the number of murders occurring in a given community. They want 
to stop others from speaking, and that is typical of the Reform 
Party. They think they have a monopoly on the truth.
<P>
	Canadians know what they are all about. It is a game of fear and 
hatred that they are trying to promote, Canadians one against the 
other. That is wrong. That is not the type of country in which we 
live. Notwithstanding the best efforts of the Reform Party, it is not 
the country in which we will live.
<P>
	The hon. member who just spoke talked about capital 
punishment, about having a binding referendum on capital 
punishment.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Where did this guy come from?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I know where I came from. I came from my 
constituency. I was elected by my electors eight times. The day 
after tomorrow it will be my 20th anniversary in public office. The 
member across who is still wet behind the ears in this House should 
have a bit more respect.
<P>
	The hon. member's colleague in his speech was a bit more polite 
than the one who is heckling now said about capital punishment 
that we should have a binding referendum in Canada. The member 
is free to campaign on that if he wishes.
<P>
	I have spoken on the debate in this House against capital 
punishment. I have, following that, made copies of my speech and 
sent it to every elector in my constituency. In the subsequent 
election, which is the last one, they sent me here with 82 per cent of 
the votes in my riding.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not on that issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The member may say not on that issue, and 
perhaps he is right. The point I am making to him is that if he thinks 
he can get elected on that issue alone, I will tell him that he is 
wrong.
<P>
	Instilling that kind of hatred in Canadians is not going to work. It 
is wrong. Does the hon. member or any of his colleagues know, for 
instance, that a country could not even be admitted to the European 
Economic Community if it had capital punishment?
<P>
	Does he know, for instance, that the country with the lowest 
murder rate in the western world is Belgium, which has no capital 
punishment and has not had for decades and decades? It was 
probably the first European jurisdiction to be that way.
<P>
	Does he know that the country with the second lowest murder 
rate in the western world is the Irish republic? It does not have that 
either. Does he know? Does he care? No, because it does not fit into 
that kind of hate pattern they are trying to instil in Canadians.
<P>
	It is not going to work in this country because Canadians are 
smarter than that. They will not fall for that kind of nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is 
improper and unparliamentary to start referring to us as hate 
pushers of any nature. I would ask this member to retract it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to respond to the 
hon. member.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> We still have 
two minutes for questions and comments. Had the hon. member 
completed before the interruption of a point of order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I will continue my comments 
very briefly about the crime rate in Canada and about what this 
government is doing.
<P>
	This government has taken the proper approach. This 
government has seen one party across the way say we should send 
this bill a lot further down the road. The other party said we should 
not have done anything at all. The government did not do either 
with the propositions. We did the right thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I thought a 
point of order was called. I do not think it was addressed at all here. 
Are you going to have the point of order addressed?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It was not a 
point of order. I have addressed it. The honourable member has 
continued on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
