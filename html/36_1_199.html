</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to 
introduce my first private member's bill on behalf of the 
citizens of Lethbridge and indeed of the children of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill is an amendment to the Criminal Code that would allow 
courts that convict a person of an offence under the child 
pornography provisions of the Criminal Code to order the 
forfeiture of anything used in the commission of an offence under 
this provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment, once passed, would give courts and law 
enforcement officials one more tool to use in their fight against 
child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that my colleagues on all sides of the House will 
join with me in supporting the bill.  The bill gives courts the 
same authority to deal with child pornographers that they have 
under 55 other federal statutes, giving children protection that 
is long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close by recognizing the efforts of our law 
enforcement officials who fight the spread of child pornography 
and who have been instrumental in developing the bill.  I would 
especially like to recognize Detective Inspector Robert Matthews 
of the Ontario Provincial Police, Project P, the OPP Child 
Pornography Unit, and to all those who continue the fight against 
child pornography I say keep up the good work.

important lifesaving treatments, but there is difficulty in 
providing adequate dialysis service and the rates of organ 
donation are not sufficient to meet the need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call upon parliament to work in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have the honour to present a petition this morning 
which is signed by over 100 residents of my constituency of 
Burnaby—Douglas. 
It draws to the attention of the House that volume discounts for 
rapists and murderers, which is the law in Canada today, cheapen 
life, that an average one murder per month in Canada is committed 
by a released person on parole, that the lives of individual 
victims are erased from the sentencing equation and that the 
suffering, the pain and the death of the second, third or 
eleventh victim is of no consequence to the courts.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the petitioners call on parliament to enact 
legislation to reduce the inhumanity to families of victims, 
restore truth in sentencing and to enact Bill C-251 to prevent 
multiple murderers and rapists from getting one sentence for

to be appointed by the minister of industry, science and

released from this obligation in the year following its creation 
once it had complied with the conditions of incorporation and 
only once the grant had been paid.  In April 1993, as the 
$504,805 granting conditions, the minister had to appoint two 
directors.  The other directors, for a total of nine, are 
appointed through the usual nomination and election procedure. 
The link between the fund and the agency ceased on September 30,

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is difficult for members who are very interested in 
topics like this, but I have pointed out on a number of occasions

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have an application for an emergency 
debate from the hon. member for Selkirk—Interlake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that a similar motion was brought up the other day. 
I would ask him to be very succinct in his explanation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, precisely what is happening is nothing.  There has been 
an impasse in the negotiations and the government has given us no 
indication of how it will move this forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The union and the government are at loggerheads. I think the 
financial harm, the loss of productivity, the drastic economic 
conditions in agriculture all make it incumbent on us as elected 
members in the House of Commons to debate this issue and show a 
consensus or a full airing of all the issues involved in this 
strike action and the repercussions on Canada as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that would be very beneficial in moving this strike 
along.  The government and the unions have known since 1993 that 
the wage freeze that was in place was to end and that it has 
ended.  Why there could not have been something in place I do not 
know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not here asking for this emergency debate to determine why 
things happened or why things are not moving ahead so much as 
reinforcing that this is an emergency to the Canadian economy. It 
is an emergency to farmers and their families, to the union 
people and their families.  It is the duty of the House of 
Commons to do everything possible.  I believe this is an 
emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The request for an emergency debate was 
received yesterday at 3 p.m.  I have instructed my officials to 
get further information to me and I will make this decision some 
time before question period.  I will return to the House.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1998 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK33">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-72, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, to 
implement measures that are consequential on changes to the 
Canada-U.S. Tax Convention (1980) and to amend the Income Tax 
Conventions Interpretation Act, the Old Age Security Act, the War 
Veterans Allowance Act and certain acts related to the Income Tax 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, members opposite should be 
keen to support Bill C-72, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, 
the 1998 budget and technical measures.  In doing so they will 
support broad based and fair tax relief for low and middle income 
Canadians and their families as well as targeted relief for those 
Canadians who need it most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that, as in the past, they will deny Canadians once 
again and go on to criticize and make wild projections to achieve 
objectives that would put Canadians' recent success in 
eliminating the deficit in jeopardy.  A vote for Bill C-72 
amounts to support for reducing taxes for 14 million Canadians, 
support for removal of 400,000 Canadians from the tax rolls, 
support for providing tax credits for interest payments on Canada 
and provincial student loans, support for allowing Canadians to 
make tax free withdrawals from their RRSPs to fund full time 
education and training, support for extending the education 
credit to part time students, and support for providing a tax 
credit to individuals providing in home care for an adult 
relative, and certainly much more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as I have said, I have grave doubts about my 
colleagues' tax cutting credentials.  My memory may be faulty but 
I cannot recall their supporting a single tax cutting measure we 
have brought forward during the last two parliaments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly with Bill C-72 my friends opposite can tangibly 
demonstrate they truly want to reduce taxes in a sustainable 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. members opposite that when the division is 
recorded for Bill C-72 they can vote yea for tax relief for 
Canadian taxpayers and their families or they can vote nay.  It 
is really that simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the finance minister noted when presenting the 1998 budget, 
the measures in Bill C-72 represent the first steps toward 
general income tax relief, the first steps on which this 
government has already built with the 1999 budget.  Together, the 
two budgets provide $16.5 billion of tax relief over the next 
three years.  Moreover, as the minister recently noted, this is 
only the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the federal deficit behind us Canadians can now look 
forward to tax relief in budget after budget in the foreseeable 
future.  Of course at the outset, given that the financial 
dividend that allows broad based tax relief is modest, so too 
must be the initial relief itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not provide unaffordable relief that would jeopardize 
our regained financial health and impinge on Canadian priorities 
such as health care and education.  Accordingly and in keeping 
with the nation's priorities, the measures in Bill C-72 act first 
to reduce taxes for those who can least afford to pay them, low 
and middle income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us contains two measures providing 
general tax relief.  The first is a proposal to increase the 
amount of income that low income Canadians can earn on a tax free 
basis.  As my colleagues know, personal tax credits ensure no tax 
is paid on the basic amount of income.  This helps to make 
Canada's tax system fair. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1025
<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the 1998 budget the basic personal amount that 
Canadians could earn tax free was set at $6,456 while the spousal 
and equivalent to spouse amounts were a maximum of $5,380. 
Effective July 1, 1998, Bill C-72 proposed to increase these 
amounts by $500 for low income Canadians.  This will effectively 
increase the amount of tax free income by a maximum of $500 for 
single taxpayers with income under $20,000 and by $1,000 for a 
family with income under $40,000.  As a result of this measure 
some 400,000 low income individuals will be removed from the tax 
rolls and another 4.6 million taxpayers will pay less income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will also know that the 1999 budget proposes to build 
on this measure by extending the $500 increase in the basic 
amount to all Canadian taxpayers and increasing it by a further 
$175 for a total increase in the basic amount of $675.  This 
would mean that effective July 1, 1999 the basic amount of income 
that all Canadians can earn annually on a tax free basis would 
rise to $7,131.  Effective the same date, the maximum spousal and 
equivalent to spouse amounts will increase to $6,055. This will 
more than offset the effects of inflation on these amounts since 
1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interest of fairness the largest proportionate benefit of 
these measures will accrue to low income Canadians.  On top of 
the 400,000 lower income Canadians who will no longer pay any 
federal income taxes due to the measures in Bill C-72, the 1999 
budget would remove 200,000 more Canadians from the tax rolls for 
a total of 600,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To continue with the measures to provide broad based relief, 
Bill C-72 proposes to eliminate the 3% general surtax for those 
with incomes up to about $50,000 and to reduce it for those with 
incomes between $50,000 and $65,000.  As my colleagues will 
recall, the previous government introduced the general surtax as 
a measure to help fight the deficit.  Accordingly, having 
eliminated the deficit, it is time for us to eliminate the 
surtax.  This measure eliminates the 3% surtax for almost 13 
million tax filers and another 1 million taxpayers will pay 
significantly less surtax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having begun the process of eliminating the 3% surtax in the 
1998 budget, the 1999 budget proposes to complete the process and 
eliminate the general surtax for each and every Canadian 
taxpayer.  This action will bring an end to this surtax for the 
2.7 million Canadian taxpayers who continued to pay it in whole 
or in part following the 1998 budget.  As a result, effective 
July 1, 1999 the 3% surtax will have been eliminated for all 15.1 
million Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I turn to some of the targeted measures included in the 
legislation I underline that these two measures in Bill C-72 
provide very progressive tax relief.  That is because as a 
percentage of current tax, the tax reductions are highest at 
lower incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each budget since we have taken office, including the 1998 
budget, our government has provided targeted tax relief where the 
need was greatest and the benefits were substantial. Reflecting 
this fact, Bill C-72 contains several targeted measures, 
particularly those related to the Canadian opportunities 
strategy.  Canada operates in a fast changing, competitive and 
interdependent world economy, an economy that is increasingly 
knowledge based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts speak for themselves.  Since 1981 the number of 
available jobs for Canadians with a high school education or less 
dropped by some two million while more than five million jobs 
were created for those with higher qualifications. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT6"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT6"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1030
<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as all members in this House realize, not all 
Canadians are in a position to access the knowledge and skills 
they will need throughout their lifetime to find and keep good 
jobs in a changing labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barriers, most often financial barriers, reduce access to 
post-secondary education for many.  Accordingly, the 1998 budget 
and Bill C-72 propose several tax measures to provide financial 
assistance for students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Student debt has become a heavy burden for many Canadians.  In 
1990 a graduate completing four years of post-secondary education 
paid an average student debt load of about $13,000. This year the 
same graduate's average debt will almost double to about $25,000. 
Moreover at the beginning of the decade, fewer than 8% of student 
borrowers had debts larger than $15,000.  Now almost 40% are in 
that boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial burden on students must and will be reduced. To 
that end, Bill C-72 contains measures to provide all students 
with tax relief for interest paid on their Canada and provincial 
student loans.  This will take the form of a 17% federal tax 
credit that will apply to both federal and provincial student 
loan programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of dollars and cents, for a student with a loan of 
$25,000, it will mean a reduction in federal and provincial taxes 
of $530 in the first year alone.  Over a 10 year paydown of a 
student loan, the new tax credit could mean as much as $3,200 in 
tax relief.  This measure will benefit about one million 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget contains several other measures to help manage 
student debt.  While they are not included in this piece of 
legislation, I will take a brief moment to remind my colleagues 
of these important measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, besides the tax credit, we increased the income 
threshold used to qualify for interest relief on Canada student 
loans by 9%.  We introduced graduated interest relief which will 
extend assistance to more graduates farther up the income scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked that lending institutions extend the loan 
repayment period to 15 years for individuals who have used the 30 
months of interest relief.  Moreover if after extending that 
repayment period to 15 years a borrower remains in financial 
difficulty, there will be an extended interest relief period. For 
the minority of graduates who still remain in financial 
difficulties after taking advantage of these relief measures, we 
will reduce their student loan principal by as much as half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together, these new interest relief measures will help up to 
100,000 more borrowers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To keep a job or to get a new one, many Canadians who are 
already in the workforce want to take time from work to upgrade 
their skills through full time study.  There are many of them and 
we hear from them in our constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals are looking to upgrade their skills and need the 
time away from work to do so.  They often lack the resources to 
pay for these types of programs and courses. The legislation 
before the House includes several new measures to improve 
Canadians' access to learning throughout their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first of these measures is the proposed tax free registered 
retirement savings plan withdrawals for lifelong learning. An 
individual who has an RRSP and is enrolled in full time training 
or higher education for at least three months during the year 
will be eligible to withdraw up to $10,000 from their RRSPs, up 
to a maximum of $20,000 in furtherance of their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course to preserve the role of RRSPs in providing retirement 
income, the amounts withdrawn will have to be repaid over a 10 
year period.  In many respects, what we are proposing in Bill 
C-72 resembles the very successful home buyer's plan where 
Canadians can access their RRSPs when they are purchasing a home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that every member in this House and all 
Canadians would agree that there is a need to continually upgrade 
knowledge and skills. 
That can be particularly hard for the growing number of Canadians 
studying part time while trying to manage the difficult balance 
of work and family. Therefore, we are proposing to extend the 
education credit to part time students.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposal, part time students will be able to claim an 
amount of $60 for each month they are enrolled in a qualified 
course lasting at least three weeks and including a minimum of 12 
hours of course work per month. This measure will lessen the 
expense of education and facilitate lifelong learning for over 
250,000 part time students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, members will recall that to help parents save for their 
children's future, the 1998 budget introduced the Canada 
education savings grant to make registered education savings 
plans even more attractive.  The government will provide a 20% 
grant on the first $2,000 deposited in annual RESP contributions 
for children up to age 18, up to a maximum annual grant of $400 
per child. This truly makes RESPs among the most attractive 
savings vehicles available to Canadians for their children's 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past year we have already seen the impact of this 
particular initiative with the success that RESPs are having by 
increasing the pool from what was $2.5 billion before this 
initiative to approximately $4 billion just over this past short 
while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Educational assistance payments are for students enrolled in 
full time education.  However, taking into consideration the 
special needs of disabled individuals, Bill C-72 proposes to 
allow disabled part time students to qualify to receive 
educational assistance payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the bill proposes to assist income constrained families 
by increasing the amounts they can transfer out of their RESPs 
into their RRSPs in the event their children do not pursue higher 
education.  Specifically, the amount will be increased to $50,000 
from $40,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-72 also contains several other targeted measures that are 
worthy of support by the House.  Among them is the proposed new 
caregiver credit.  The credit would reduce the combined 
federal-provincial tax by up to $600 for those Canadians caring 
for an elderly parent or disabled family member.  It would 
provide assistance to about 450,000 caregivers that normally 
would not qualify for the infirm dependant credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To improve equity in the treatment of self-employed and 
incorporated businesses—and I know hon. members across the way 
would want to support this measure—Bill C-72 proposes that 
self-employed Canadians be able to deduct health and dental 
insurance premiums from their business income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure hon. members would also want to support this 
initiative.  To support communities and the thousands of Canadian 
volunteers who provide essential emergency services, the 
legislation before us proposes that the tax free amount for 
volunteer firefighters be doubled from $500 to $1,000.  This 
measure will also be extended to other emergency service 
volunteers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time constraints preclude me from addressing at length the many 
other contents of the bill.  I trust that my colleagues will 
address these matters either in debate or at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the view from this side and the view from the other side 
do not always mesh, I trust on this occasion we will see eye to 
eye, given that Bill C-72 contains tax relief measures for 
Canadians, tax relief upon which the government built in the 1999 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust members opposite can put aside the usual rhetoric and 
support the beginnings of what we on this side of the House see 
as a plan to continue to provide broad based tax relief in each 
and every budget, year after year. I call upon the members in the 
opposition parties to support Bill C-72.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is an honour to rise today and speak to Bill C-72.  I 
would like at this time to seek unanimous consent to split my 
time with the member for Lakeland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is it agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the members of the 
House for that consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are studying Bill C-72, an act to amend the Income Tax 
Act, to implement measures that are consequential on changes to 
the Canada-U.S. tax convention, and its full title is quite a 
mouthful. Quite frankly this bill has a loaded title to go along 
with all the clauses and subclauses which make it up, a lot of 
rhetoric and a lot of grey areas.  This government should be 
ashamed of itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same government that is in such a rush to get 
through its legislative agenda that it has invoked closure 49 
times to date.  It is so worried about shutting down the 
opposition that it has cut off debate on bill after bill, but for 
what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I have been listening now for a couple of minutes and I 
hear discussion of closure and various things— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member has 
just started his speech.  I am sure he is just about to make his 
comments relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am just getting warmed 
up here.  All of this is relevant because now we can send it to a 
Liberal controlled committee where debate is also curtailed by 
the heavy-handed democracy there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our day is so filled with crucial legislation that everyone 
awaits with eager anticipation to see what new pearl of wisdom 
will come out of this administration.  My constituents tell me 
day after day that they would meet the suggestion with a few rude 
comments which I really cannot explain here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems our days are going to be filled with sloppy bills that 
are badly designed and which go mere inches toward what the 
Canadian people are most in need of:  real tax relief.  Canada 
has miles to go to make up for decades of neglect and 
mismanagement.  We can still vaguely remember the days when the 
dollar was at par or even above the U.S. dollar and when it was a 
real tragedy when unemployment rose above 5% or 6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals become masters at taking the proposals made by 
other parties, watering them down and offering the struggles of 
average Canadians as proof that their administrations were good 
for this country.  That is not so. We have never had more proof 
than now in that Canadians are struggling to overcome the 
suffocating, self-righteous intrusions of this government.  What 
success we enjoy as individuals or as small businesses is in 
spite of this government, not because of its misguided programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say the government cannot have a good idea once 
in a while.  Bill C-72 has a clause that restores the previous 
$5,000 credit for investment in labour sponsored venture capital 
funds.  Some of these funds are quite active and really serve a 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite a few people lobbied hard for that inclusion last year and 
now we see it takes the finance minister only 12 months to get on 
board with the idea.  This gives us hope that perhaps he will 
wise up to other proposals that interest Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child care expense deduction has been raised to $7,000. That 
is a good start.  We are always in favour of allowing Canadians 
to keep their own money. But this deduction is not available to 
all parents and that is a tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard ministers opposite plant their Florsheims in their 
dental work time after time and spend precious days in this House 
arguing over what they really meant and who they meant to offend 
or not offend.  We have wasted time arguing over who cares and 
does not care in this House. I suspect we have succeeded in 
showing the majority of Canadians that this place is more about 
playing politics than shaping public policy. That is a travesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth of the matter is that there are clauses in this bill 
that can be commended in principle.  The life learning plan 
allows Canadian residents to take money out of their RRSPs, if 
they can afford to have any, to pay for full time training for 
themselves or their spouses.  That is a great idea.  I do not 
know if everyone in that situation can afford full time training 
as opposed to something a little more flexible, but the intent is 
a noble effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware that RRSP contributions have fallen off in the last 
two years as well.  There is something like $126 billion in 
unused contribution room outstanding.  As I said, it is a noble 
effort and let us hope there are a few Canadians out there who 
can actually afford to get retrained and plan on using that 
retraining here in Canada rather than being forced to go to other 
countries by our high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the same analysis applies to another program 
concerning part time education.  Eligible part time students can 
use education tax credits and child care expense deductions to go 
back to school.  I presume that helps young single mothers in 
particular.  There is a lot of merit in doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I could be more specific with these measures but the fact 
is that this government has pulled a fast one on all of us. The 
Library of Parliament was caught flat footed with this bill and 
it expressed extreme frustration that there was no time to 
properly analyze the clauses in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though Bill C-72 was supposedly printed on March 9, the 
date on the folder, the library had no access to a copy of it 
until March 17.  The researcher complained that this omnibus bill 
was just too thick to get through and really understand it in 
less than a week. 
Yet we are expected to speak to it with two days' notice.  What 
on earth is this government up to?  Are we on a fast track again? 
The calendar is not crowded enough with significant legislation 
to justify this kind of bullying and arm twisting.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that we are dealing with the tax code, probably the 
most thick-headed and misguided document in the English language. 
It is convoluted, complex, and all of those great terminologies. 
Lawyers have written in their own secret codes, 1,600 pages of 
every possible definition of every possible object, and they 
still have to take people to court to apply the statutes.  It 
seems that Quebec can have plain language legislation to make 
legal documents truly available to the people they apply to, but 
this government shows no interest in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In thousands of cases every year, thousands of Canadians 
citizens and businesses are put through a wringer to get them to 
conform to an incomprehensible juggernaut of legalise and secret 
passwords that even Revenue Canada has to admit it gets wrong on 
occasion.  However, it does not do that often because in the way 
of this government it has taken on the corporate culture of 
self-righteousness and the attitude that big government knows 
best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do not see in Bill C-72 is any admission by the finance 
minister, his bureaucrats or any of the Liberal members on the 
finance committee that this system is out of control.  We cannot 
afford it.  We see a clause that reduces the individual surtax by 
a few more dollars.  That is a good idea, but who on the 
government side would dare to stand to defend putting taxes on 
taxes in the first place?  Yet this goes on year after year. 
Canadians are still waiting for this government and the previous 
government to wake up and straighten out the mess they have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 5% surcharge which remains untouched for now falls on 
incomes as low as $60,000.  There are thousands of workers in 
high tech industries or specialized manufacturing who can make 
that much.  What do they do?  They take their skills and their 
incomes and they maximize them south of the border.  Brain drain 
is a common phenomenon.  The Liberals maintain their punitive tax 
structures and wonder why Canadian artists, entrepreneurs, 
doctors and scientists head for a friendly climate.  We could add 
hockey players to that list too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not like they cannot see it coming.  My home province of 
Saskatchewan started driving out opportunity and entrepreneurship 
years ago. It has been rewarded as being a have not province by 
the government in Ottawa.  No wonder Roy Romanow and the Prime 
Minister get along so well.  They have the same tax philosophy. 
We have a government that sees nothing wrong with discriminating 
against single income families and that perpetuates applying 
taxes on taxes, punishing the very people it relies on to pay the 
bills through taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government really has nothing important to contribute so it 
keeps its head down, trying really hard not to upset anybody, 
while it rushes half-baked legislation through the House.  It 
hides behind self-fulfilling opinion polls and paid for studies 
that tell it what it wants to think.  It only adds to the pile 
that makes up the tax code, never thinking that there might be 
something worthwhile underneath or another way to approach the 
subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been proven that lower taxation leads to higher revenues. 
Alberta and Ontario are certain proof of that.  Ireland has just 
reduced its tax regime and it is booming.  Why can we not catch 
on to that ideology? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worst of all, it tables bills like this which announce all over 
again what Canadians have already heard and paid for in the 
previous budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is hungry for any positive PR spin.  We heard the 
finance minister claim that the country can only afford his style 
of nickel and dime tax adjustments and that it costs the 
government to give people their money back.  What a ludicrous 
idea.  We have a new program to help farmers in the prairies; $85 
million to top up their NISA accounts.  The unfortunate part is 
that it is an insult.  One very seldom qualifies for NISA.  It is 
a net income thing.  So the $85 million is really a teaser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what it costs because year after year the finance 
minister announces that his programs will cost the treasury so 
many billions of dollars.  He goes ahead and subtracts that 
amount from the nation's books.  He takes it right out of the 
taxpayers' pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if Canadians are picking up on this yet, but the 
day is rapidly approaching when they will finally put their 
finger on what bugs them about this government.  The auditor 
general has done a great job of painting a picture of what the 
minister and his finance cronies are up to.  Maybe Canadians view 
public accounting in much the same way as they do the tax code. 
It is very convoluted and complex.  Nobody really understands it. 
But this practice is pretty easy to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister makes an announcement of, say, $2.5 billion.  Then, 
without parliamentary approval, he charges that to the 
expenditure side.  The government says “Look we would like to 
give you that tax break, but you can see that there is no money 
left on the bottom line”.  The money has taken wings and flown 
off to pay for a scholarship fund that nobody asked for.  Few 
will enjoy it and it will not even come into existence for 
another full year.  The way our Canadian dollar is shrinking the 
students may get 50 cents on the dollar by then.  According to 
our tax code anyone who tried to run a business booking expenses 
that way would find themselves in deep trouble with Revenue 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are hiding it very well in this country, with our low 
productivity and so on, because of the strength of the American 
economy south of us, but we cannot count on that forever.  We 
need to stand alone. 
The bills will come due and then everyone will see where these 
years of Liberal mismanagement have led us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are really lagging behind in our productivity against our 
American counterpart and others in the G-7.  We have a low 
dollar, very high taxes and low productivity.  The polls show us 
that no one really identifies with this concept of productivity. 
Maybe that is because it has been so long since we have had any 
that nobody recognizes it any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry made several comments to that extent, 
which I would like to quote.  He was addressing the issue of the 
standard of living in this country.  He pointed out that since 
1987, just a mere decade ago, Canada's standard of living has 
increased by only 7%.  The standard of living of our counterpart 
to the south has increased by 17%.  That is a 10% difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the slide that he was showing, the income gap 
between the U.S. and Canada is 30%, and growing at a rate of 
about a $9,000 difference in income between Canada and the United 
States.  That correlates into about $28,000 for a family of four. 
Those are Statistics Canada's numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the impact on Canada's productivity, the 
industry minister went on to say “Canada has the lowest growth 
rate in productivity in the G-7”.  We are 17th in the world, 
which is certainly not good enough.  Why?  It is because of high 
taxes and the low dollar.  We are paying more and getting less. 
It is very unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry minister also pointed out that we have much higher 
taxes in Canada than they do in the United States.  Our tax rate 
is 130% of that of the United States.  If we couple that tax rate 
with the low dollar, we are on a downhill slide.  We see omnibus 
bills like this which continue to shove Canadians farther down in 
that sinkhole of despair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to present an amendment at this time.  I move:

Old Age Security Act, the War Veterans Allowance Act and certain

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  In my opinion the 
amendment is receivable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased today to speak to this bill, a budget implementation 
bill.  Many comments have been made on this bill and I am sure 
there will be many more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak in a very general way about what the implementation 
of the parts of the budget that this involves will do and the 
impact it will or will not have on families across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last couple of months, since the discussion and the 
anticipation of the finance minister's budget really started to 
heat up, and even over the five years that I have been a member 
of parliament, I have heard more and more from people who say 
they feel guilty as parents or as small business people who want 
to pass their business on to their children because they are not 
saving the amount of money they should be saving in order to pass 
the business on or to allow them to help their children as they 
raise their families or as they go on to pursue further 
education. 
I have heard people express the guilt they feel because they are 
just not doing what they should be doing to help their children 
and to help pass the business on.  That has really been a concern 
for me.  The guilt should not be felt by most of the people that 
I have heard from because, clearly, the money is just not there 
for them to save.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot of talk recently, talk backed up by chief 
bank economists and by the government's own pollsters, which 
indicates that productivity in Canada has been dropping steadily. 
If we ask most Canadians they probably will not understand in 
detail what productivity means.  However, what they do understand 
is that their standard of living is getting lower and lower all 
the time.  It is a key thing to remember that over the past 10 
years and more, each year Canadians have had less to live on. 
Their standard of living has been dropping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear these people say they feel guilty because they are 
not saving what they should be saving to help their children with 
their education or to help pass their farms on to the next 
generation, I think it is important for me to tell them now that 
it really, in most cases, is not their fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to note whose fault it is.  It is 
clearly the fault of the government, for what it has done and 
has not done over the past five years.  It is the fault of the 
Conservative Party, which was in office for nine years and which 
kept jacking up taxes.  I cannot even remember how many tax 
increases there were, but dozens and dozens of times the 
Conservative Party raised taxes in various ways.  It is the fault 
of the Conservative Party and it is the fault of previous Liberal 
governments, many members of which are still in the House 
today.  They raised taxes and went on their spending sprees, and 
we are seeing that develop again.  By doing that they have denied 
Canadian families; parents of children who have decided they want 
to further their education and farmers who want to pass the farm 
on to the next generation.  It is very difficult.  It is the 
fault of government which has denied these people through high 
taxation and low growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the fault of governments and I want people to know that. I 
want the people who have been talking to me and saying that they 
feel guilt to know that they should not feel guilty, because I 
know that most of the people who have talked to me about this 
have done everything they possibly could to save money.  They are 
cautious in their businesses.  They spend very little and live on 
very little in many cases, yet they just do not have money to 
save. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear members opposite hollering that that is not fair and not 
right.  Look at the statistics.  The fact is that the savings of 
Canadian families have been dropping on a regular basis.  That 
happened again this year.  It is happening right now.  Savings 
this year will be lower than they were last year.  This is a 
trend that has been taking place for some time.  It is a real 
serious concern that has not been dealt with by the budget.  It 
certainly has not been dealt with by the parts of the budget that 
we are talking about implementing here.  For that reason I cannot 
possibly support this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I have people come to me and say they feel guilt because 
they are just not saving what they should be saving for all of 
these things that are so important to them, I have not thought of 
telling them that it is not their fault and that they should look 
at what has happened and the reality of how every year more and 
more of what they earn is not left with them, is not left in 
their pockets for them to spend as they see fit.  Instead, it has 
been taken away by governments more and more and spent by 
governments on things that they somehow feel are more important 
than the issues that the families themselves have determined are 
most important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That attitude bothers me.  I think it bothers most Canadians 
when a government and a finance minister feel that they somehow 
know better than the general Canadian population, than parents, 
how they should spend their money and how they want to spend 
their money and what is important to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we could change that attitude and convince the finance 
minister and the Prime Minister that Canadians themselves, 
mothers and fathers who are desperately trying to put money 
together to pay for university or technical school education for 
their children or for something that will help them get good 
jobs, know best how they want to spend their money.  Perhaps we 
could convince governments to leave more money in the pockets of 
the people who earn it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make clear that I am not against taxation.  I am not 
proposing that we eliminate income tax completely.  I am not 
proposing that we eliminate all the other taxes, although I 
certainly believe we should eliminate some of them.  I believe 
the level of tax now is completely out of line.  When we see 
about half of what we earn being taken away from us by 
government, we know taxes are too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of 50% it would be far more reasonable to move the total 
tax package down to between 20% and 30%.  I think issues like 
health care are important to people.  People do not object to the 
money being spent on health care if it is spent wisely.  That is 
part of the problem with health care.  Even the money that is 
being spent is not being spent wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another part of the problem is that the government has cut back 
on transfers to the provinces by almost $7 billion a year.  These 
transfers are to pay for health care and advanced education and 
the funding has been reduced dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member across the floor is saying that in the budget a small 
part of that was given back.  That is so true.  They have given a 
small part back and have said “Aren't we grand?”  They have cut 
somewhere near $20 billion—I forget the cumulative amount—over 
the past five years and now they are to put back a billion or two 
over the next couple of years.  That is not good enough. That is 
nothing to brag about.  Part of the problem is that they cut back 
on the amount transferred to the provinces for health care, 
making it extremely difficult for the provinces to deal with the 
health care issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another part of the problem is that in many cases, partly due to 
unreasonable restrictions on the part of the federal government, 
the provinces are not allowed to do what they have to do to make 
the system work well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen that attitude problem in this government, in the 
Conservative government before it and in the Liberal government 
before that.  It has to change.  If we could change that attitude 
we could make some real progress.  We could start leaving more 
dollars in the pockets of the people who earn it. If there could 
be a quick tax reduction right now, maybe five years from now I 
would hear some people saying that they are finally starting to 
be able to save a little more.  Because they are saving a little 
more they will be able to help the children a little with their 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am from a farming community so I mention farming because it is 
extremely important to me.  I might hear people say they can save 
a little more because they are not paying so much out in taxes. 
Over half the cost of fuel is tax, which is completely out of 
line.  Farmers also pay a lot of income tax, although it will not 
be much this year.  They did not earn much because there is a 
real mess in the industry.  However over the years they have paid 
a lot of income tax and a lot of other taxes.  They are 
overtaxed, no doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that and because of that we are seeing farm families 
that in many cases will not be able to help the next generation 
to purchase the farm business and to develop it. 
This is a direct result of overtaxation and the complete lack of 
willingness on the part of the government to do something about 
it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We laid out a plan before the finance minister presented his 
budget which would have given Canadians $25 billion a year in tax 
relief.  It was not an unreasonable plan.  It was verified as 
being very viable by some of the best economists in the country. 
We know from the work we have done that it is a very viable plan. 
In our plan we would make payments on the debt every year and 
increase to some extent funding to health care and to other key 
areas.  That is a very reasonable expectation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister had his chance.  I do not know his motives, 
but if he would have had his way maybe he would have gone further 
toward our plan.  Probably he was not allowed to do so by others 
in cabinet.  Do I fault the finance minister for that?  Yes, I 
do.  I absolutely fault him for that because he has to be strong 
enough and show enough leadership to make that happen.  He has to 
make that happen and he did not.  He failed miserably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to impute motive.  I do not know the motive of the 
finance minister, but this was pretty much a do-nothing budget in 
reality.  The government is talking about next year's budget 
already.  It is trying to forget this one.  We have noticed that 
in question period.  It is talking about next year's budget and 
has just gone beyond this year's budget.  It is unbelievable. 
Clearly it knows this year's budget was a failure on the part of 
the finance minister and a failure on the part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just have to ask why.  Was it because the finance minister did 
not want to do something?  It may have been.  The Prime Minister 
will be stepping down within the next year or two.  I think all 
Canadians expect that.  The finance minister will pretty much be 
put in as leader of the Liberal Party.  Because that leadership 
race will be a little over a year from now, we have to think that 
the finance minister will want to have a knockout budget next 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe some people would say next year is good enough.  There are 
a couple of things wrong with that.  First, Canadians who are 
desperately trying to save to put their kids through college, 
technical schools and whatever, or who are desperately trying to 
save so they can somehow transfer their small businesses and 
farms to others, just cannot do it.  They need that relief now. 
There are families struggling just to make ends meet.  I am 
talking about food and basic clothing.  There are many families 
in that position.  They see virtually no help until next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen next year?  We have seen how cabinet has 
influenced the finance minister already.  He may have the best of 
intentions to come out next year with a budget much like what we 
proposed.  Will cabinet allow that?   All the heritage minister 
thinks about is spend, spend, spend, and maybe put through some 
dumb legislation like the split-run magazine legislation.  That 
is another issue and I will not get into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several other ministers like her.  They want to spend. 
They think elections are bought and won.  They do not really 
care, I guess.  I should not really say that because I do not 
know.  I know they care about the country.  They would not be 
here if they did not.  They clearly do not understand that what 
is necessary is to limit spending and give Canadians money or 
leave it in their pockets.  It should not be taken from them and 
given back.  It should be left in their pockets as much as 
possible.  They did not do that this year.  If they do not 
understand that and if they are not willing to let the finance 
minister do that, they probably will not let him go quite as far 
as he would want next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might get a budget next year of maybe $15 billion in tax 
reduction.  That is not good enough.  Families need a reasonable 
amount that leaves room in their budgets to deal with a downturn 
in the economy and that type of thing. 
Our plan does that.  The room is there.  We will not start 
building up deficits again under any circumstances, yet we can 
offer in our package $25 billion in tax relief.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the finance minister is willing to give $15 billion in relief 
over the same period, it just is not good enough.  He may think 
it will help him win the leadership race.  I think he will do 
that anyway, but will he win the next election based on that? I 
think not.  It just will not happen with that kind of budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are starting to understand what is going on. Canadians 
have always known they are overtaxed, but they are starting to 
see exactly what the possibilities are.   Finally they know too 
much is being taken from them, that their standard of living has 
dropped on a regular basis, that it is difficult to make ends 
meet, and that they cannot save for things that are really 
important to them.  Now they are starting to see why. This is key 
to what is happening right now.  Canadians are looking in more 
depth into the issue.  They understand more and more.  The 
government could do a lot more but it has done very little with 
the budget.  Bill C-72 implements a budget that just does not do 
what it should have done.  That is of real concern to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the people who have felt guilty because they cannot 
save that the guilt should not be on their shoulders.  The guilt 
should be on the shoulders of government members for not acting. 
They are the ones who had the opportunity to act very quickly on 
this issue.  They could have offered $2,500 in tax relief, for 
example, to a family earning $30,000.  That would have meant 
$2,500 more in the pockets of taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then some families might be able to put a bit into a registered 
retirement savings plan to further reduce their taxes. More 
families would be able to save a bit more so that their children 
could go on to a technical school, a college or a university 
after secondary school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what that would mean.  It would also mean the health 
care system could be improved so that waiting lines do not get 
longer and longer as they have been for many years now.  The 
number of people waiting for health services in extremely serious 
areas is becoming larger and larger on a regular basis due to 
wrong actions taken by the government and lack of action by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased that Canadians in a much broader or much more 
in depth way have recognized that the government has failed 
miserably.  I can safely say that if people from the Lakeland 
constituency or many others across the country were standing in 
my spot in the House when the vote is taken, they would be saying 
some of the things I am saying and would vote against the bill. 
The bill implements parts of a budget that is totally inadequate. 
It is a failure and I believe I am saying what they would say.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would mention right off that it is very difficult for the Bloc 
Quebecois to support Bill C-72, because we realize once again 
that the government's priorities are not in the right place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain aspects of it worth keeping, but the bill does 
not resolve the situation of Quebeckers entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have been here only since June 1997, I realize that 
the same thing happens all the time on the other side, 
regardless whether the year is 1997, 1998 or 1999.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I was invited to comment on the 1999 budget.  Often 
the agenda of the government across is hard to follow.  They are 
trying to bring us back to 1998 provisions, when the fact of the 
matter is that, whether it be 1997, 1998 or 1999, it is always 
the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government used the money in the employment insurance fund, 
cut transfers to the provinces and, through all sorts of little 
indirect taxes, managed to bring its deficit down to zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if this government had wanted use the surpluses at its 
disposal in a more logical way, not just now but also in the 
1998 budget, we would find much more interesting measures for 
Quebeckers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, last year, in 1998, the budget did not provide 
anything for the unemployed, the students and the sick. These 
people thought that this year, in 1999, the Minister of Finance 
would announce measures that would be much more fair and just, 
measures that would allow them to breathe a little more easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, the unemployed, the sick, the young, the students and 
the poor realized that, perhaps, one more effort was necessary 
to enable this government to achieve a zero deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, it is difficult to understand how this government 
plans its budgets. I do not know of any Quebec or Canadian 
business that would remain in operation with such forecasts. It 
is easy to predict a zero deficit in 1998, 1999, and again in 
the year 2000. But then, what does the Minister of Finance do 
with his officials? He fiddles with the figures. To fiddle with 
the figures means to manipulate them on all fronts. First, the 
government claims there is hardly any surplus in the employment 
insurance fund. But this year, in 1999, surpluses will reach $26 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, they were also very high and I am almost certain 
that, in the document tabled this morning by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development on the current status of the 
employment insurance program, we will find things that need to 
be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it came to power, this government has been trying to 
create two classes in Canadian society: the rich and the poor. 
The worst of it is that the money of the least well off is being 
used to benefit the most well off.  For several years now, 
whenever there have been tax breaks, the Bloc Quebecois has 
asked that they be targeted so as to help those who have paid 
down the deficit recover some of their money.  But this is not 
what has be happening.  It is not what happened in 1997 and 1998 
and it is certainly not what happened in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI fund belongs to unemployed workers and employers.  This 
government has not put one red cent into it.  What is it doing 
with the money in the EI fund?  It is siphoning it into the 
consolidated revenue fund, not just to be able to hand it over 
to the richest members of society but also to use in its forays 
into areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The examples are numerous. 
Well we remember the September 1997 throne speech where it was 
already apparent that this propagandist government was prepared 
to interfere in provincial affairs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs told the House that 
our constitution was one of the most decentralized in the world. 
They are working daily to take this increasingly unitary Canada 
and use the constitution to centralize the government.  Why? 
Because they are going to negotiate internationally. 
International law will play a role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people on the other side of the floor, and those in English 
Canada, do not understand the globalization issue. But we know 
very well that if they turn up at negotiations without having 
remedied that lack of understanding, they may be told “Put your 
own constitution in order; put your own affairs in order; 
respect your partners and then we will start negotiating”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day this government is involved in meddling into areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, so that it can show internationally 
that it is now a central government with a constitution that 
allows it to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how all of its actions are carried out, and this is why, 
within the framework of a bill such as Bill C-72, we find only 
minor measures, mere crumbs thrown at those who need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to employment insurance, is there anything more 
distressing in life than losing one's job?  With the 
restructuring and readjustments that are going on in many 
companies, people are losing their jobs and need retraining. 
They need a chance to catch their breath.  But when they turn up 
at the Human Resources Development offices, they are not sure 
whether they will get any EI benefits.  The concerns of our 
unemployed are increasing.  We know that only 40% of workers who 
pay into the plan are entitled to benefits.  This is a matter of 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even more disgusting is that the little people are 
making sacrifices, the least well off, the unemployed, the 
single mothers, the students, and now they are seeing the money 
going instead into the Canadian government's consolidated fund, 
from there the Minister of Finance can distribute it anywhere 
and everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-72 is silent on the millennium scholarships. Yet, that 
program was announced in the 1998 budget. We know it will soon 
be implemented. What does that mean for students in Quebec and 
in the rest of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we have a very good loans and scholarships program, 
one of the best in North America. Now, the federal government 
will get involved, through this scheme, in a provincial 
jurisdiction. A student who will apply to the foundation will 
have to make a report to be eligible to the loans and 
scholarships program. Some young people may be penalized by this 
administrative ambiguity, particularly since the Quebec 
government already has an infrastructure, through its loans and 
scholarships program, that provides very good services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who, at the federal level, will administer the foundation? It is 
a private body headed by the president of Bell Canada. This is 
worrisome. We do not know how much it will cost. We do not know 
how it will work, but we do know that it will deprive Quebec 
students from hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will understand that, when the government came up with 
its social union, when it negotiated with the other provinces, 
the Premier of Quebec, Lucien Bouchard, could not sign that 
agreement. We saw what happened with the last budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also see how this government is putting itself into the 
position of being able to distribute gifts in all provinces and 
especially to meddle in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A business facing financial difficulties usually looks first 
within the organization to see if it can cut expenses in order 
to increase revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat on the public accounts committee, and I realized on 
many occasions that the departments had not yet made the effort. 
They did make the effort when it came to cutting personnel and 
services to the public. 
However, when it came to big salaries, managers and money that 
could benefit those who make significant contributions to the 
Liberal Party of Canada, the government has a very hard time 
housekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government doing to eliminate its deficit?  It pumps 
off the surpluses in employment insurance.  It made draconian 
cuts to transfer payments in health care, education and social 
programs.  In addition, this government has became expert at 
adding little taxes to public services, such as passports, 
national parks and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the government has stopped providing services free of 
charge.  However, in a society such as ours, the government has 
its share.  We are having to keep paying for services paid for 
by taxes that come out of the pockets of taxpayers and, 
moreover, we are overtaxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not get back to Bill C-72. Another ploy the federal 
government used to get more money into its coffers was to 
harmonize the GST.  In New Brunswick, it was smooth sailing, but 
not in Quebec.  Figures and statistics were trotted out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Minister of Finance is a creative bookkeeping 
artist.  He is tops in his class.  For the 1998 budget, the 
difference between forecasts and the actual figures varied from 
40% to 50%.  How can we believe such a Minister of Finance?  An 
entire country does not know what to think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important minister after the Prime Minister is the 
Minister of Finance.  However, his actions and the fact that his 
forecasts are not more rigorous undermine the credibility of the 
entire government. 
We have denounced this situation countless times in the House, 
before the Standing Committee on Finance, and wherever we got 
the chance.  People are clearly having trouble understanding 
what is going on and they are having particular difficulty 
figuring out what this government is really trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1997 we saw that it was getting ready to interfere 
in provincial affairs, strengthen its Constitution and try to 
show the rest of Canada that the country was a unitary state, 
but fortunately Quebeckers saw through this.  In fact, the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I> recently published the results of a poll showing that, 
if a referendum were held, 49.2% of the population would vote in 
favour.  This poll was taken before Bernard Landry, Quebec's 
Minister of Finance, brought down his budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same government sent its ministers, senators, secretaries 
of state and private members to fan out through Quebec during 
the break and still they dropped 4% in Quebec. 
The Bloc Quebecois now has 46% of voting intentions in Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proves that, even if the government is trying to pull the 
wool over the eyes of the other provinces, Quebeckers can still 
see clearly and understand that, if they want Quebec to take its 
rightful place in the world market, there is but one solution: 
Quebec sovereignty.  It is the way we will be able to continue 
to put forward the ideas of the great Quebeckers who have, since 
the quiet revolution, seen things clearly and have seen that 
Quebec no longer had a place within the present federal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois cannot, therefore, give full support today to 
these small amendments to the Income Tax Act, in the form of 
Bill C-72. 
Possibly we would like to see other provisions in the 1999 
budget that would meet the needs of the least well off.  There 
could be targeted tax reductions, not the general ones that were 
the result of taking money contributed by the unemployed and 
their employers from the employment insurance fund.  There would 
have to be a general redistribution to everyone, starting with 
the poorest members of society, who have paid for the richest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fears about this government, particularly with all that is 
coming up to do with globalization, is that, despite all of the 
economic upheavals there are going to be in the years to come, 
this government is already taking steps to create two classes in 
Canada, the rich and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois, a party more open to the middle class, 
hope that people, whether rich or poor, can be treated fairly 
and equitably.  This is not going to happen with what the 
federal Liberal government is introducing this morning. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak to Bill C-72, 
the income tax amendments act, 1998.  I will be sharing my time 
with my colleague, the member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland 
Valleys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by drawing attention to the fact that the bill we are 
debating today is as a result of the 1998 budget. Thinking of 
that budget, what it contained and the amendments now before us 
as a result of changes to the Income Tax Act, we remember this 
budget as something that came from the government side of the 
House being characterized as the education budget, the youth 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the spokesperson for the NDP on post-secondary education I 
went through that budget and talked with students and student 
organizations.  It was to take stock of whether this so-called 
education budget, and now the income tax amendments that flow 
from it, contained measures that would really assist students in 
Canada.  Throughout 1998 as the impact of the budget began to 
unfold it became very clear that although this was characterized 
and held up by the Liberal government as the great education 
budget, the reality was that very little had changed in daily 
lives of students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who defends the interests of students, along with 
other members of the House who have concerns about students in 
Canada, I think there was one really despicable thing in that 
budget.  While we were told it was an education budget, secretly, 
through the back door, there was something that was not announced 
in the finance minister's speech.  It was changes to the 
Bankruptcy Act which impacted on students, changing the laws 
affecting bankruptcy so that students could no longer declare 
bankruptcy after having exhausted all other means. 
They could not declare bankruptcy after two years but had to wait 
ten years.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of weeks ago I attended a press conference held by the 
Canadian Federation of Students where a test case was being 
brought forward to challenge the bankruptcy changes made by the 
Liberal government in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Annik Chenier is a young woman who attends Saint Paul 
University here in Ottawa.  She had a student debt of $63,000. 
After some very modest interest relief and debt remission, Ms. 
Chenier was still left with a debt of over $50,000.  She had left 
school and was now working and would be paying close to $700 a 
month on her student loans.  Ms. Chenier had tried to obtain a 
reduction and a different type of payment plan but had reached 
the end of the line.  Because she had no other options available 
to her she wanted to declare bankruptcy.  She could not do so 
because of the changes in last year's budget. I bring this up 
because this really portrays what students are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill before us today there are some minor changes, a 
kind of tinkering, that provide some relief to students.  I will 
go through them.  The basic inequality and crisis being created 
as a result of the retreat of public funding, the massive 
increase in tuition fees, the increase in student debt, remains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have students like Ms. Chenier and other students across 
Canada still facing very desperate circumstances and still facing 
collection agencies that harass students.  I have had phone calls 
from students crying because they have been harassed by 
collection agencies at work or school. Canada student loans have 
been privatized, turned over to banks which get a premium on 
student loans and if students go into default, through no fault 
of their own, they are turned over to collection agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is very important to point out that with some 
provisions in this bill, some debt reduction, Canada education 
savings grants, the 17% federal tax credit, while they do provide 
some minor relief, unfortunately the reality is they do not 
fundamentally or substantially change the situation for students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One good measure was included, assistance for students with 
dependants.  This, which was actually a Liberal red book promise, 
provides grants of $3,000 a year. That was a good measure and 
something I am glad to see the government acted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very disappointed, as I know students across the country 
and Canadians in general were, that the relief promised in the 
budget in terms of what was actually provided fell far short of 
people's expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the changes in this bill involves personal income tax. 
If we look at the example of a one income family of four earning 
$20,000, under these provisions that family would get a tax cut 
of $165.  It is certainly better than nothing but I have to 
compare that to a letter I received a few days ago from a woman 
in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She described her situation to me.  She works in a fast food 
outlet, making minimum wage.  She is raising two children and 
pays more than 50% of her income toward rent.  She was writing to 
me about housing because I have raised the issues of housing and 
homelessness.  With the measures we are debating today, would 
that woman and her kids be better off?

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would she have more money substantially to pay for her rent? 
Would she have more money to put food on the table?  Would she 
have any money to put into savings for RRSPs for her kids' 
education which is one of the provisions in this bill today? She 
is struggling even to pay the rent, so any hope for her to put 
money into an education plan is something way down on the agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to the conclusion, as my colleagues in the NDP have, that 
again this budget has failed in these amendments to the Income 
Tax Act before us today.  It has failed in terms of dealing with 
the growing inequalities that face us in society.  I hear some of 
the debate from the members of the Bloc who are pointing out the 
same kind of situation in terms of the constituents they 
represent as well and their perspective on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have a really serious problem in this country.  We 
have now had a succession of budgets.  We had the education 
budget.  We had the budget this year that was a so-called health 
budget.  There is talk about the children's budget next year. 
None of these budgets or the income tax amendments that flow from 
them serve to substantially alter or change our tax system to 
make it fairer and progressive and to make sure that for low 
income Canadians, poor Canadians who have borne the brunt of 
massive cutbacks and of inequalities in our tax system, it will 
improve life in a meaningful way for those Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is a real sad day for Canada. That is why my 
colleagues and I in the NDP voted against the budget last year. 
It failed to address those issues.  Certainly in terms of the 
income tax amendments before today us when we look at the 
criteria of who this budget really helps, does it really help the 
people who are most in need, we come up with the same answer, 
that this budget and the legislation before us today have failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess we cannot escape the glaring facts that after tax 
inequalities are increasing and that low income Canadians and 
students are falling further and further behind.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened to my hon. colleague's 
comments with interest.  It would be nice if all the debates in 
the House of Commons were as thoughtful, well researched and 
reflective as the one we just heard.  Unfortunately that is not 
the case.  Too many people read from prepared texts and so on 
that someone else has written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are talking about income tax.  I suspect that when 
people hear that term they get crinkly feelings up and down their 
spine. There are probably hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, 
of Canadians sitting in their offices, their homes, their 
factories or plants just dreading the time when they have to go 
home and get out all those little pieces of paper, T-4 slips and 
so on and start filling out that bloody form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitution says we are not allowed to impose cruel and 
unusual treatment on people.  I suspect asking people to fill out 
their tax returns is a form of cruel and unusual treatment.  It 
is a painful experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I ran into some young people who are 
self-employed. They are in the consulting business.  They were 
absolutely livid because they fill out their tax returns, work 
very hard for all their money and have to send off cheques and 
cheques, all this cash to the federal government.  They felt 
depressed. They were so frustrated. It is almost a form of 
self-mutilation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People sit down at a desk, with papers piled all over, trying to 
figure out what the hell that form says.  They read through the 
explanations and that is complicated, step by step.  There are 
computer programs now. The laugh of the century was this elderly 
woman came to my office in Kamloops the other day and said “I 
just filled out my tax return and I do not understand parts of 
it.  I wonder if you could get me a copy of the tax act”. 
She was thinking this was a little book, something like a little 
handout.

can guarantee that no one could understand it. Nobody can 
understand it. I will bet there is not a person in the world who 
understands this pickup truck full of tax law.

thereof is of short duration and incidental to the principle 
carried out by it, or (b) the company, although incorporated 
after January 1, 1972, primarily for the purpose of carrying on 
the business of investment and it intends to remain a company 
described in subparagraph 2(3), or subsequently from 5(2) to 
5(17), or (c) it is not necessarily in the public interest that 
this act apply to the company, having regard to the purpose of 
the act and to any one or more of the following factors:  (1) the 
persons to whom the company is indebted in respect of money 
borrowed by it, or (2) the amount of the indebtedness by the 
company in respect to the money borrowed by it, or (3) the nature 
of any security given by the company in respect of money borrowed 
by it, and (4) the extent of the integration of the company's 
activities with the activities of its subsidiaries, if any, and 
with the activities of any corporation of which it is a 
subsidiary and any other subsidiaries of that corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we go to subsection 2.  Here the minister, if he decides, 
may revoke an exemption granted under subsection 4. If subsection 
4 does not follow subsection 2(b) and the minister ceases to be 
satisfied that any of the criteria referred to in that subsection 
are met, then when exemption from this application is granted 
under subsection 2 or subsection 15, following 2(b), then the 
corporation, after January 1, 1972 that is, if it is primarily 
for the purpose of carrying on the business of investment, then 
this exemption shall not be revoked.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  It is perfectly clear.  It is simple. It 
cannot be revoked after all of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person would have to have 50 law degrees to figure out what on 
earth that says.  Let it be perfectly clear, this is what this is 
all about.  There is more gobbledegook in this piece of 
legislation.  There is more muffle buffle jumble bumble than we 
can imagine.  If one has a well paid tax lawyer or a very 
experienced tax adviser, one can buffalo almost anybody into 
saying this should be deducted, that should be deducted, and so 
on.  It is like I am reading from some sort of tragicomedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could read tens of thousands of other pages, but I would 
challenge every one of the bright MPs in this building to say 
that they understand even one page of the tax act.  I know nobody 
here is able to.  The ones who are not here today, maybe they are 
the intelligent ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who have to deal with this tax act will be unanimous in 
saying that no one knows what the hell it says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Hire a tax lawyer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my Liberal friend says this 
is simple stuff.  Maybe to a certain kind of mind this is simple 
stuff.  But to an intelligent mind, it is gobbledegook. Look at 
it.  I know I cannot hold up a prop, but this really is not a 
prop.  Look at all of its pages.  They are all grey. There is no 
white, because if it is grey, it is open to interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine those guys who work in Revenue Canada and have to deal 
with this book day in and day out.  It takes a special kind of 
personality to handle that kind of stuff.  Thank God they have it 
because I know I do not have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no white pages, they are all grey.  Everything is 
grey.  If one has a good tax lawyer, a good tax accountant or a 
good tax adviser, one can probably get out of paying the kind of 
taxes one ought to be paying.  That is what it is all about.

best-sellers are right at the front. What are they?  Ways to avoid 
paying taxes.  Jacks tax adviser, Mary Jane's and so on, 
everybody has a favourite tax book and it is updated every year 
because these things change every year.  That is what we are 
doing today. They are mainly designed to show how to avoid paying 
taxes.  They are today's best-sellers.  I am sure my Conservative 
friend would agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Serious players probably have them for their night time reading. 
People can go to seminars on how to avoid taxes altogether.  It 
is called a tax haven, the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas or the Isle 
of Man, all sorts of things.  For a nice fee, these seminars will 
lay it all out, how to avoid paying any income tax at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a depressing debate today.  These 
provisions by and large are probably fairly decent.  There is a 
tidbit here to help this group, a minor change to help that 
group, but nothing will change.  It is just more gobbledegook, 
more complexity and more fuzziness in the tax system and people 
will be happy for the little bone the Minister of Finance 
has tossed them in this little change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are demanding real tax reform. They want to change the 
system.  They want to toss out the pickup truck full of books and 
start all over again. They want a real tax system, a progressive 
tax system.  They want to stop the use of the tax system to 
achieve all these minute changes in today's society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance is here. 
I value his judgment.  I hope he asks me a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not time that we sat down as a finance committee or as a 
committee of the whole parliament and went through our tax act? 
Let us identify the major exemptions in our tax act and apply a 
cost benefit analysis to every single one.  What is the cost of 
this tax loophole, or tax exemption, and what do we get from it? 
If it is not clear that we get more than it costs, then we should 
toss it out the window.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  I am asking him a question.  I ask the

through our tax act, do a cost benefit analysis on every single 
major tax exemption and if it does not make financial sense, toss 
it out?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  And a challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  And sometimes a challenge, I would 
agree, to listen to the hon. member across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do have a 
lot of respect for the member.  He is a member of the finance 
committee and does contribute substantially, I might add, to the 
debate in the finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to his suggestion about looking at the tax system, the hon. 
member knows that the finance committee is the master of its 
own destiny.  If the finance committee would like to look at the 
tax system, who am I to stand in the way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all here to help 
ensure that Canadians receive the best possible government 
services.  I would engage in any sort of debate 
that would provide more value for tax dollars for Canadians. That 
is certainly why I am here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sometimes ironic to hear a member from the New 
Democratic Party, although I sometimes feel that the 
member does not quite fit that mould but nonetheless he is a member 
of the New Democratic Party, talk about taxes and the need for 
tax reform and the need to ensure that Canadians' tax paying 
burden is alleviated. 
We certainly have begun to do that on this side of the House beginning 
with the 1998 budget and continuing in the 1999 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Albeit it is a beginning and I do not think anyone here on this 
side of the House thinks that this is the end of the work on the 
tax file, but the hon. member should stand up and at least say 
that he can support the measures in this bill. There is the 
increase in the basic exemption, the elimination of the surtax, 
the tax credit interest on student loans, the registered 
education savings plan, the ability to withdraw money from 
registered retired savings plans to finance part time education, 
the child care expense deduction, the caregiver tax credit, and 
the increase in the emergency volunteer tax credit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of issues.  The hon. member is correct when 
he says there needs to be additional work with respect to the tax 
system.  I grant him that. The member should acknowledge that the 
work this government has started to do on that file is work he 
should be able to support and continue to support as before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I had a vision as my friend 
was speaking.  It was a vision from Hindu philosophy of a 
multi-armed goddess.  She has about 15 arms. I imagined these 
arms going into every back pocket and every front pocket, picking 
our pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What my friend did not mention was the new tax collection 
agency, a monster tax collection agency that not only will have 
federal hands going into people's pockets but will also have 
provincial hands tied in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somebody said it is like a drunken sailor taking taxes.  It is 
not like a drunken sailor spending money, because drunken sailors 
spend their own money.  These guys spend other people's money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, to say that none of this is worthwhile would be folly. Of 
course many of the provisions will be helpful.  It is like the 
situation of a young boy begging on a city street, obviously 
living in a horrible situation. The boy stands there with a cup 
and asks for a dime. Someone gives him a dime and thinks the kid 
should be thankful, he should be happy with that.  That is what 
we are getting here, little dimes in the beggars' cups and we are 
being asked to say is this not wonderful, thank you very much, 
Mr. Minister of Finance.  These changes are a mere a pittance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Vancouver talked about the student debt load, the 
horrible situation young people face trying to afford an 
education.  We are supposed to be up here leaping for glee 
because they are now going to possibly deduct some interest from 
$26,000 to $50,000 student loans.  It is sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are minute improvements to our tax system.  But when we 
have to back up a pickup truck for the piles and piles of this 
stuff, this is not the way to approach real tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome my hon. friend's suggestion that we raise this at the 
finance committee.  Perhaps one day we can initiate a real 
process of tax reform coming out of this House of Commons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
always with great pleasure that I listen to my hon. colleague 
from the New Democratic Party, the member for Kamloops, Thompson 
and Highland Valleys.  We never know quite what we will hear 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time the member spoke on the budget, he was talking 
about sex with bears.  Today he was talking about multi-armed 
Hindu goddesses.  He is certainly a Renaissance member of 
parliament who can describe things in ways which certainly can 
connect not just with other members of parliament but with 
Canadians, and probably with bears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member described the government as a multi-armed Hindu 
goddess.  There is another kind of Hindu goddess, a 
multi-breasted Hindu goddess. Sometimes the multi-armed Hindu 
goddess looks at the taxpayer as a multi-breasted Hindu goddess. 
She seeks with those arms to attach her hands to the collective 
teat of the Canadian taxpayer.  Her grip is so fervent and so 
ferocious that ultimately the taxpayer and Canadians suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to keep abreast of tax issues both in the House 
of Commons and with all Canadians. Tax issues are fundamentally 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-72, which implements some of the budget's proposed 
changes to the tax act further complicates an already far too 
complicated tax code.  I think all members of the House agree 
that the tax code is too complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the New Democratic Party was speaking of the 
complicated tax code.  One of the Liberal members suggested that 
he hire a tax lawyer. It should not be necessary for a Canadian 
to hire a tax lawyer to deal with his or her own government, to 
effectively represent themselves.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past 20 years the tax code has become increasingly 
complicated, increasingly Byzantine, to the extent now that in 
every budget Canadians can expect the tax code to become further 
complicated, more difficult to understand and to increase the 
need for Canadians to hire tax accountants just to read some of 
the books the hon. member from the New Democratic Party 
described.  There are also clinics for people to learn how to, 
not evade taxes because that is illegal, but to avoid taxes or 
pay less taxes.  Canadians, in some cases, are investing abroad 
in places like the Cayman Islands or looking for tax shelters in 
other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians would benefit not just from reduced levels of 
taxation and more broadly based tax reduction but from a 
simplified tax code.  This is an area that I would argue is tied 
in directly with productivity.  One of the barriers to success, 
to entry for entrepreneurs and to entry to the free market is a 
complicated tax code.  Currently the tax code is a barrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure, relative to other jurisdictions, that 
Canadians are not paying disproportionately more because they are 
Canadians.  Currently they are.  The Mintz report on taxation, 
which was presented to the House of Commons finance committee I 
believe in early June, gave some very concrete examples of the 
discrepancies between Canadian business taxes and the U.S. 
business tax system, both in terms that we are paying more and in 
terms of some fundamental differences in the tax code that should 
be addressed so as not to disadvantage Canadian businesses and 
therefore Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government speaks of the fundamentals of the Canadian 
economy and says the fundamentals are strong.  I remind members 
and Canadians of what those fundamentals are.  We have seen 
personal disposable income drop 9% in recent years.  In the same 
period we have seen U.S. personal disposable income increase by 
11%.  We have the lowest productivity growth of any G-7 country. 
We have record high rates of personal bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a negative savings rate. Canadians are in fact going 
behind a bit every year.  They are not saving but falling behind. 
They are digging into their pockets and into their savings in 
order to make ends meet and stay ahead of the game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some enhancements which are laudable to RESP 
flexibility for people to transfer funds to RESPs.  Those types 
of changes do not benefit Canadians if they cannot afford to 
contribute to an RRSP in the first place.  It is a difficult 
challenge to invest in RRSPs.  I know mutual fund sales are off 
conservatively this year.  I expect when the numbers are tabled 
we will see that RRSP contributions are also down this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unused portions of RRSPs is mammoth in Canada.  Canadians 
have not been able to exercise their RRSP contributions to the 
full extent.  Why?  They are paying too much taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the total federal tax take of the government was, I 
believe, $112 billion.  This had risen to $150 billion by last 
year.  This growth of approximately 25% in federal taxes has come 
directly from the pockets of Canadians at a time when they have 
seen federal spending on health care decline dramatically by $16 
billion in round figures, although some say it is as high as $18 
billion.  They also see that the provinces have received less in 
transfers from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one taxpayer and that taxpayer has borne the brunt of 
deficit reduction over the last several years.  They deserve, at 
this time, an opportunity to reap some of the rewards for those 
sacrifices they have made. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no good for the government to be in the black if 
individual taxpayers are in the red.  That is currently the case. 
We have the highest rate ever of personal bankruptcies.  We have 
the highest rates of personal debt ever.  This is a frightening 
statistic if we consider the impact for instance of global 
deflation trends which some say are threatening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wealth is a relative concept.  It is not really a singular 
criterion.  One's wealth or a country's wealth is a comparative 
figure.  We compare the wealth of a country and the wealth of 
individuals in that country to the wealth of individuals in other 
countries. We are at a time when we are telling Canadians they 
have to invest more to save for their retirement, they have to 
protect their own retirement funds because the CPP is rather 
dubious in terms of its ability to provide the kinds of 
retirement incomes Canadians will need in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are telling Canadians to invest more and to take greater 
responsibility for their own retirements.  At the same time we 
are forcing Canadians to invest 80% of their RRSP investments 
within Canada.  This is perverse.  The Dow Jones, which recently 
cracked the 10,000 mark, has performed extraordinarily well in 
recent years.  Since 1993, when this government was elected, the 
Dow Jones has increased by 172%.  The Standard and Poor's, S & P, 
is up by 180%, both U.S. markets of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The TSE is up only 60% since 1993.  That may seem like a lot but 
in a relative sense it is not.  Our domestic equities markets are 
grossly underperforming equities markets in the U.S. and 
elsewhere.  Canadians in a relative sense have become poorer. 
This perverse policy of forcing Canadians to invest in one 
jurisdiction or another and denying them the opportunity to 
achieve geographic diversification is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we have seen the Canadian dollar decline by 16% 
relative to the U.S. dollar.  Not only are the government's 
policies of reduced productivity, high taxes and disincentives 
for success denying Canadians growth in their own economy but its 
policy on RRSPs is actually denying Canadians growth for their 
retirement incomes anywhere.  This is perversely wrong.   If the 
government cannot get its act straight in terms of running this 
economy to benefit Canadians, it should not force Canadians to 
invest where they will not be able to maximize their returns 
where there are opportunities and where there are governments 
elsewhere that are doing a better job of creating opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent KPMG study commissioned by the government to study 
the cost of doing business in Canada has been lauded by the 
government and used as a tool to demonstrate its somehow good 
economic management of the country.  The KPMG study effectively 
said that Canada is a cheap place to do business, that we have 
low real estate costs, that our labour costs in a relative sense 
are less.  It said that basically doing business in Canada would 
cost less than doing business in some other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If our economy were clicking on all cylinders, as the Minister 
of Finance has asserted in the House in recent weeks, the price 
of doing business in Canada would be quite a bit higher.  With 
economic growth come economic cost increases and upward 
pressures.  The reason the cost factors are not growing 
significantly in Canada is that we have not had the sustained 
economic growth that has been enjoyed by other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The KPMG study points to a fundamental flaw of this government's 
policies and to the fact that we are not achieving that level of 
economic growth Canadians would be capable of achieving if the 
government were to make a significant step toward providing broad 
based tax relief to Canadians and toward providing Canadians with 
an opportunity to succeed in their own country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason why young Canadians seeking greater opportunities are 
leaving Canada and going to the U.S. is that while they may 
recognize there may be greater costs, there are greater 
opportunities.  They are willing to make that choice.  Perhaps 
members opposite should stand along the borders, waving the KPMG 
report in the faces of Canadians as they leave and say please do 
not go, it is cheaper here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is like the Kmart or Zellers or Wal-Mart approach to 
economic development.  We cannot get better in this country by 
devaluing our way to prosperity.  During the summer when our 
dollar was hitting record lows the Prime Minister said it was 
good for tourism.  The logical corollary of his argument was that 
if we reduced our dollar to zero we could give away all our goods 
and become the greatest exporting nation in the world. This is 
insane.  We cannot devalue our way to prosperity.  We need to 
significantly invest in Canadian productivity initiatives to 
ensure that Canadians have an opportunity to participate in the 
economic growth and are not inhibited by government policies that 
hold them back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not address some of those fundamental issues 
I described.  It is looking at different fundamentals than the 
ones I see.  When the government says fundamentals of the economy 
are strong it reminds me of what expatriate Canadian economist 
John Kenneth Galbraith said, to beware of governments that say 
the fundamentals are strong.  Galbraith had a point.  Usually 
when governments say the fundamentals are strong they are trying 
to hide something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like a government where the industry minister says the 
productivity is very bad in Canada and we have to do something 
about it. In the same speech the industry minister says Canadians 
are paying 20% higher taxes than in the U.S.  Then the finance 
minister says that is not so bad.  Productivity is not bad. 
Canadians are not concerned about their standard of living. 
Perhaps this is an intentional effort by the government to create 
confusion, to try to distract Canadians from the real issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are concerned.  Canadians are increasingly concerned 
about productivity.  Canadians are increasingly concerned about 
their standard of living.  That the dollar hit record lows this 
summer is directly correlated to the fact that our productivity 
growth has continued to underperform that of our trading 
partners.  The dollar is linked very closely to productivity. 
There has be a secular decline in the dollar over the past 30 
years.  We need to do something now to avert further currency 
crises in this country.  The best way to approach that is through 
productivity.  The best way to approach productivity is through 
addressing some of the impediments to productivity, the 
structural impediments we have in the Canadian economy. Those 
include the highest income taxes of the G-7 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are structural impediments like interprovincial trade 
barriers which deny Canadians the ability to gain a competitive 
or comparative advantage within their country, a regulatory 
burden like a toll highway which is an interprovincial barrier in 
New Brunswick.  The hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester has 
raised this point in the House.  His interventions have taken a 
toll on this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are issues of regulation.  We have suggested as part of 
our prebudget submission that the government have a regulatory 
budget whereby regulations are costed.  We take into account 
several costs, not just the cost to the government of introducing 
and enforcing a regulation but the cost to society, the cost to 
Canadians for complying with those regulations.  Then those costs 
are compared, particularly the cost of compliance which is 
egregiously high for Canadians, to the actual dollar value of the 
benefit of that regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having a regulatory budget and choosing some departments each 
year to be scrutinized in this way would force governments to 
make the same types of decisions with Canadians' money that they 
make with their own in a fiscal budget.  That would be one step 
in addressing the regulatory burden we have which by all accounts 
is excessive and does inhibit productivity and growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no core industrial strategy.  It has no 
agenda on an area as important as industrial strategy at a time 
when we are entering the 21st century.  It is at a time when 
change is occurring at an ever increasingly rapid pace.  It is at 
a time when we need government to take significant action on a 
number of fronts and provide meaningful visionary leadership on a 
number of issues, including tax reform.  This government is on 
cruise control. 
It is a caretaker government.

perilous time for Canada to suffer from this leadership deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time we need governments to make strong decisions.  We 
need the types of policies the previous government engaged in, 
for instance, policies like free trade, policies like the 
elimination of the manufacturers sales tax, and policies like 
deregulation of financial services, transportation and industry. 
Those were the types of visionary policies that were necessary 
then and were brought into being by a legislatively active 
government, not a government that would even consider proroguing 
halfway through its term because it did not have anything to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact since that time the challenges have become greater for 
Canadians.  Since that time it has become even more important 
that we have governments taking strong steps and doing the right 
sorts of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Economist</I> magazine in its January edition last year 
indicated that the elimination of the deficit in Canada was 
largely due to structural changes made to the Canadian economy by 
the previous government.  Those were the types of visionary 
changes I just described, whether it is free trade or elimination 
of the manufacturers sales tax.  Unfortunately these types of 
policies are not forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has seen fit to continue its huge tax grab on the 
EI fund, taking $19 billion from workers and employers.  At the 
same time it is slashing benefits and punishing seasonal 
employment.  The government does not consider the law of 
unintended consequences when it implements policies.  It looked 
at seasonal workers and said that it would cut benefits to them. 
Many seasonal workers are not working at all now and are living 
on provincial social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took people who were contributing, who were working, and 
denied them any opportunity to participate at all.  Farms in the 
Annapolis Valley in Nova Scotia cannot find seasonal workers now 
because if they do seasonal work they will lose their benefits. 
Direct disincentives have been created for people to do what they 
want to do, to go out and work.  The government did not replace 
it with a co-ordination effort to provide Canadians who were 
employed in seasonal work with an opportunity to work in various 
industry sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are serious issues.  There are serious problems.  A 
further complicated tax code is not the answer.  I have not had 
one constituent ask me to complicate the tax code.  Broad based 
tax relief is part of the answer as well as an industrial 
strategy which will make Canada a richer country, not a poorer 
country, in the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am a 
bit disappointed in my colleague's comments when he talked about 
leadership.  If anything, the government has provided the kind of 
leadership that is required to move us into the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We inherited a government with a very huge deficit and debt, 
high interest rates and a high unemployment rate.  We turned it 
around in a matter of six years into one of the finest countries 
in the world.  We are leading the G-7 in terms of growth and we 
have balanced the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague talked about productivity.  That is a very 
important subject, but it can also be very subjective when one 
gives his or her views on the question of productivity.  If 
productivity means the net worth of a society is a positive then 
we are very productive.  If a country is productive and the net 
growth is more jobs being created than being lost then we are 
productive.  If we look at leading sectors of the economy such as 
high technology, transportation and others to see what we are 
doing on the international scene and in the regional market then 
we are a productive society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly looking at productivity in a very subjective way, like 
looking at a flock of birds going after one worm, is not 
productivity.  There is not enough food to feed every one of 
those birds.  I would caution my colleague not to point a finger 
and use labels that will create more confusion than 
understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure my colleague will agree that overall the government 
has provided Canadians with the necessary leadership.  The 
government has given us a stable environment for business and for 
the economy to grow.  Government does not create jobs. Government 
creates the proper environment for job creation.  The private 
sector creates jobs.  All government has to do is get out of the 
way of the private sector so that it can create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gentleman, from a party that has given us the worst ever 
deficit in the history of the country, gives us a lecture in 
terms of what is good for Canadians.  He should stand and reverse 
his speech to tell the public how good the government has been, 
not only to his party or what is left of it but to people as a 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his insightful and erudite intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the previous government, the Progressive 
Conservative government, reduced the deficit as a percentage of 
GDP from 9% when it took office to a little over 5% when it left 
office.  The PC government of Brian Mulroney inherited a $38 
billion deficit in 1984.  The Liberals know a lot about deficit 
and debt because they built debts and deficits from the late 
sixties and the seventies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The types of visionary policies that were implemented by the 
previous government resulted in this government's ability to 
reduce the deficit.  Many members opposite are the same members 
who railed against the GST and against free trade.  They then 
embraced those policies because they recognized that those 
policies would make a difference and that those were policies 
Canada needed at a very important time.  Once they were elected 
they recognized those were the right policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1974 Trudeau threatened and scare mongered Canadians by 
saying that wage and price controls would be a bad thing.  After 
the election he implemented Bob Stanfield's idea of wage and 
price controls.  Oil was 18 cents a gallon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some parties are talking about corporate reimaging and new 
names.  The Liberal Party of Canada should be called the 
flip-flop party of Canada because that party will stand for 
anything to get elected and, once elected, stand on any Canadian 
to implement its agenda of high taxes and cuts to areas that are 
important to Canadians like health care. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to address a couple of points raised by the member.  He 
talked about disposable income in Canada going down by 9%, but he 
did not explain to Canadians why disposable income apparently 
went down.  He did not talk about the fact that disposable income 
means net paycheque and how that has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the impact of contributions to RRSPs, reduced 
taxable income which reduces the tax burden but also shows a 
lower net pay.  The former child exemption was taken out of the 
tax act and became the child tax benefit and the national child 
benefit program.  Taxes went up but the benefit came from 
outside.  It was similar with the GST rebate and health spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to compare ourselves with the U.S. we have to 
understand that Canadians do not pay for health care.  We have a 
not for profit system whereas in the U.S. it is for profit.  U.S. 
incomes have gone up simply because their cost of health care is 
going up astronomically relative to what it is in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has made a serious error.  He should acknowledge it 
and explain to the House that he was in error.  He said that in 
1993 the personal income tax revenue to the federal government 
was $112 billion.  He then went on to refer to more recent 
numbers, I believe it was 1998, and say that the projection was 
$150 billion. 
He also said that was 25% more out of the pockets of Canadians. 
He did not say that in 1993 the unemployment rate in Canada was 
11.2%.  Now it is 7.8%.  There are 1.5 million more Canadians 
working and paying taxes.  The increase that he attributes to 
Canadians is not the same Canadians paying more tax; it is more 
Canadians paying tax.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should correct the error or the impression he has 
left with the House.  It is very important to know that personal 
income tax revenue has increased primarily and exclusively 
because more Canadians are working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I made some notes during 
the hon. member's question.  I am glad he asked me to explain why 
personal disposable income has dropped in Canada.  Despite his 
assertions to the contrary, Canadians pay more taxes now than 
they did in 1993.  They pay a higher percentage individually of 
their paycheques to taxes.  Due to the fact that the government 
has not even addressed the issue of bracket creep, two million 
low income Canadians are paying taxes now that would not have 
been paying taxes otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the member mentioned the unemployment rate.  He is 
quite right that recently the unemployment rate has decreased. 
Anyone who knows anything about economics recognizes that it 
takes approximately five years at a minimum for economic policies 
to have the impact of reducing unemployment.  He is quite right 
in acknowledging that the policies of the previous government 
were successful after having been implemented and with the 
passage of time in achieving a declining unemployment rate. 
Policies like free trade are largely responsible for the type of 
economic growth enjoyed by Canada at this juncture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to remind the hon. member again where his party 
stood on issues like free trade and the GST, but they stood 
against the types of policies that have resulted in the growth 
they are now boasting about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talked about 
costing things out.  In the prebudget submission by the 
Conservative Party it did everything except cost out what the 
measures cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me help the hon. member.  He referred to a whole bunch of 
tax initiatives.  What did they cost?  They cost the treasury $17 
billion.  If the government were to adopt what that party would 
like, we would be back in deficit.  I am sure it would be way 
above the $42 billion where it left us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess the parliamentary 
secretary decided not to read the costing at the back of our 
budget plan “Unlocking Canada's Potential”.  Over three years 
we would have liked to have provided Canadians with $18 billion 
of tax savings.  In the first year we would be looking at about 
$8 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is using Liberal math in this regard.  That is 
typical of a member and a government that utilize Liberal focus 
group economics.  I would gladly send the hon. member a 
calculator and a copy of “Unlocking Canada's Potential”.  In 
the future for the next budget I suggest that he and his 
government take our plan very seriously because we want to unlock 
Canada's future for the 21st century.  I hope his party starts 
sharing that value. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
just past noon on the day after celebrating St. Patrick's Day I 
want to say that I made several contributions last night to the 
tax system along with my colleagues.  I will temper my remarks 
with the realization that that occurred. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the member opposite that it is really quite mind 
boggling to sit here and listen to a member of the Progressive 
Conservative caucus spend almost his entire time defending the 
Brian Mulroney government.  I really would have thought it would 
be in his best interest to distance himself from that memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian people passed judgment and reduced that caucus in 
1993 to a group large enough to fit into a phone booth. There 
were a few more elected in the last election, primarily from 
eastern Canada, and one from Ontario.  Anyone would have thought 
that those members really would not want to revisit what happened 
during the Mulroney years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us realize something.  The 1980s were absolutely the best 10 
years this country has enjoyed in terms of revenue, and yet that 
government managed to run overdrafts every year during times of 
tremendous prosperity.  It is only since 1993 that the country 
has been put back on track.  I do not know that we will see the 
kinds of increases in real estate values that local communities 
enjoyed in the 1980s, but we certainly have a much stronger 
economy today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very hard to understand why a government would 
intentionally, at times of high revenue, spend its revenue to the 
point of running a $42 billion deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  A deficit is an overdraft.  What the member 
neglected to mention is that the $42 billion was not a one time 
thing.  It was every year.  That government intentionally, every 
year, during times of high revenue, overspent when it should not 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During those times municipalities across Canada realized what 
was happening.  Municipalities put their houses in order. 
Municipalities paid down their debt.  My own city of Mississauga 
is debt free.  Municipalities across the country realized that 
they had an opportunity during times of high revenue to put some 
money away, to pay down debt, to not run deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear about the cuts which this government has made.  What 
choice was there?  Do we continue to spend into oblivion?  Do we 
continue to run up the overdraft and increase the debt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I should mention that I am splitting my time with 
the member for Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way a government deals with its finances is to run that 
overdraft or deficit until it gets to the end of the budget year. 
Then it takes that deficit and piles it on top of the debt. 
That, in essence, is how we have arrived at such a large debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has made commitments.  We have reduced the debt 
by $20 billion.  In two successive budgets we have reduced taxes. 
Is it enough of a reduction?  Of course not.  I would like to see 
more.  My constituents would like to see more in the way of tax 
reductions.  I believe they will.  That is a commitment that our 
finance minister has made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To stand and simply, in many instances, mislead people with some 
of these statements and accusations about our tax system does an 
injustice to the Canadian people.  We should tell them the facts. 
Is our tax system complicated?  You bet it is.  Should we review 
it to see if we can smooth it out?  I think we should.  In fact 
the federal government has negotiated harmonization agreements 
with some provinces and attempted to do it with others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would harmonization mean that since there is only one taxpayer 
that maybe we should have one tax collector instead of the very 
complicated system that we have in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government would not be afraid to admit that the tax system 
is complicated.  It has been built, layer upon layer, over the 
years, which makes it extremely difficult for the average 
Canadian to understand or for the average member of parliament to 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay tribute to a group which I think is doing some 
very good work to help particularly low income Canadians 
understand the tax system. 
It is a group made up of volunteer chartered accountants and CA 
students, sponsored by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
Ontario, which runs free tax clinics to help thousands of low 
income Canadians fill out their tax forms and pay their taxes.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just by way of a little commercial to the taxpayers, since we 
are coming up to that time, the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants can be reached at 1-800-387-0735, extension 462. 
People can call them and get free advice on dealing with the very 
complicated matter of filing their income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate the institute.  I think it is a very 
positive thing and something from which the taxpayers will 
clearly benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to return to the issue of harmonization.  I have said in 
this place before that this country has a large number of taxes, 
and people do pay a fair amount of money, so it seems to me that 
there should be a way to streamline and reduce the collection 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done that in some parts of the country.  I think we need 
to continue talking about it, but the provinces tend not to want 
to do that.  They do not want to give up their fiefdoms.  I guess 
that is understandable, except that they know as well as we do 
that there is only one taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill that we are dealing with will amend the Income Tax Act. 
Instead of talking about somebody's poor memory as to what went 
on in the Mulroney years and the size of the deficit, I have not 
heard anybody talking about the specific amendments, so I 
researched some of them and I want to share them.  I think they 
are pretty good and Canadians should know about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will introduce a new non-refundable tax credit for 
individuals to an annual maximum of $500.  Canadians need to know 
that when they are filling out their tax forms.  They should ask 
their accountants about it.  Or if they are going to the clinic 
sponsored by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, they should 
ask about it.  It reduces the surtax, which is something we heard 
many people calling for.  This bill does that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure I think is very important.  The homebuyers plan 
will be modified to allow for tax free withdrawals from RRSPs to 
acquire homes for disabled individuals, whether or not they are 
first time homebuyers.  That is a very significant issue.  It 
shows that we recognize that the disabled community needs some 
assistance in buying homes.  Obviously, if their disability 
inhibits their ability to earn income, they need help. 
Therefore, not only first time homebuyers, but people who are 
disabled will actually be able to draw from an RRSP to buy a 
home.  I think it is a terrific idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tax credit for interest on student loans.  We hear 
about the debt burden of students.  The one thing that we should 
recognize when we do an analysis is that, if the taxes are high, 
what is the other side of it?  We have heard Reform members say 
they would bring in user fees.  The cost of university in this 
country is substantially lower, probably four times lower than 
the cost of a similar university program in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Reform Party believes in two tier health care. 
We do not.  We believe that should be funded through the tax 
system.  We are absolutely opposed to the two tier health system 
that these folks talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have run out of time, but there are a lot of other areas which 
I would like to mention.  There is a tax credit for caregivers. 
There is recognition of part time education and single moms. 
There are all kinds of serious benefits for the taxpayer in this 
bill.  It is beyond me why everybody in the House would not 
support it so that we could get the message out and concentrate 
on communicating the facts instead of misleading the Canadian 
public. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, as usual I found the emissions from this member to be 
rather interesting, particularly the commercial for the CA group, 
when he himself, this Liberal of great high esteem, admitted very 
freely that to file one's income tax is a complicated matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He knows full well that this government has had opportunities to 
simplify the tax system since 1993 and prior to the nine-year 
sabbatical given to the Liberals by Brian Mulroney.  Yet his 
government has done nothing to simplify the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it very gratifying to hear this member freely admit that 
the income tax system is so complicated that he was happy to give 
out the 1-800 number to give people a hand.  It would be nice if 
he were to do his work and if the members of his party were to do 
their work to simplify the tax system so that people would not 
have to make that phone call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the House to the issue of the two tier 
health care system which was created by the Liberals.  People who 
are desperate or people who have money can go to the United 
States, thanks to this government, thanks to its $16.5 billion 
gutting of the transfer payments to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member and his Liberal colleagues are very proud of the 
fact that supposedly we have a balanced budget.  He fails to take 
into account the rip-off of working people through the so-called 
employment insurance fund.  That is not a premium; it is a tax. 
It is a tax because far more money goes into general revenue than 
ever goes out in benefits.  It is this government that has cut 
back on the benefits, cut back on the benefit periods and cut 
back on the benefit program so that it would end up with a 
surplus.  On the backs of employers and employees it has managed 
to come up with this myth of having a balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member comes from Ontario, which has the 
excellent government of Mike Harris.  That Conservative 
government has decreased taxes, which is something the finance 
minister and the Liberals do not understand.  That has resulted 
in the most vibrant economy in the entire Dominion of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not about time for us to have some truth, some truth about 
the fact that there is far more going into the employment 
insurance fund than is coming out because of the cutting, hacking 
and slashing of the Liberals?  The fact is that they are managing 
to talk about a balanced budget because they are ripping off the 
employers and employees who are forced to pay into the employment 
insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member of the 
Reform Party typically talks about cuts to the provinces for 
health care of $16 billion over the mandate.  He does not talk 
about the $11.5 billion in one budget, in one fell swoop, that 
was put back into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers have actually said that they would take 50% of the 
surplus to pay down the debt and 50% to reduce taxes.  Then they 
say that they will take another 50% to put into health care and 
maybe another 50% for something else.  Come on.  Do they think 
the Canadian people are stupid?  They know the cuts the Reform 
Party has proposed in its campaign documentation.  It would slash 
anything to do with heritage.  It would cut the military.  It 
would introduce two tier health care.  It would destroy the 
relationships between the federal government and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the EI fund, this government has balanced the 
books of this country and the EI surplus exists because the 
economy is strong, because we have created jobs.  There are 1.6 
million more Canadians working since this government took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our facts are very clear.  The Reform is just blowing smoke.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
today the House is debating the implementation of the 1998 
budget; not the budget that was just delivered by the finance 
minister, but matters relating to the budget of the prior year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary has reviewed very well the many 
important initiatives that were included in that budget. 
I will spend my time replying to some of the comments made by 
hon. members in this debate because I believe there is some 
clarification necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Conservative Party talked about personal 
income tax revenue to the federal government.  He pointed out 
that in 1993, when the government took office, personal income 
tax revenue amounted to some $112 billion.  He also said that in 
1998 the amount of personal income tax revenue collected by the 
federal government was some $150 billion.  It is a $38 billion 
increase in personal income tax revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to suggest that this represents a 25% increase in the 
personal income tax burden of Canadians.  To leave it like that 
is not correct.  It is an error to leave the impression that 
somehow the personal income tax burden of Canadians actually 
increased some 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that in 1993 the unemployment rate in Canada was 
11.2%.  In 1998 the unemployment rate dropped to 8%.  If the 
unemployment rate goes down that must mean more people are 
working in Canada, and indeed 1.6 million more Canadians are 
working and they are paying their fair share of income taxes.  It 
adds to the personal tax revenue of the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase does not have to do with rising rates of income 
taxation or some sort of penalty by eliminating deductions that were 
otherwise available to Canadians back in 1993.  It has 
exclusively to do with the fact that there are more Canadians 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point that out because Canadians should understand that in 
this place sometimes there is the tendency to provide a little 
information but not all of it and it would tend to lead to one 
conclusion when in fact the full story would lead to quite 
another.  That is part of the caution that anybody watching the 
debates in the House of Commons should take.  It comes to an 
issue of credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in this place members debate and present information 
principally by providing selective information rather than full 
information, they put the credibility of themselves as well as 
the credibility of this place on the line when they do not tell 
the whole story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal spokesman for the Reform Party, the member for 
Lakeland, spoke for some 40 minutes and talked about income taxes 
again.  I wrote some notes from his comments about the level of 
taxation.  Certainly there is a lot of interest in Canada to have 
lower income tax levels so that we can have more disposable 
income.  There is a ripple effect in terms of jobs creation, et 
cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal spokesman, the lead spokesman for the Reform Party 
of Canada, spoke for 40 minutes.  He was not subject to questions 
and comments.  He provided certain information to the House which 
again was grossly in error and totally incomplete as far as what 
the true facts are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to put on the record what in fact the issue is with 
regard to the taxation rates of Canadians.  I sat down and in a 
very general way and calculated the income tax burden of someone 
who is making $60,000 a year in Canada.  I used no general 
deductions such as RRSPs or any other.  It was simply done as an 
employee who makes $60,000. We know they get a basic 
non-refundable tax credit of $6,542.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also tax credits for any amount they paid for EI 
premiums and CPP premiums.   When they deduct that approximate 
$7,000 they get an amount of income of some $53,000.  On $53,000 
the taxpayer would pay 17% on the first $30,000, which is $5,100. 
They would pay 26% on the remaining $23,000, which is $5,980. 
The approximate federal tax burden is $11,000. Provinces have 
different rates.  For discussion purposes, if we assume a 
provincial income tax rate of 50% of the federal taxes payable 
that means that the total federal-provincial tax bill to a 
Canadian making $60,000 a year is $16,600. As a per cent of the 
gross income of $60,000 that is 27.7%.  A single person making 
$60,000 pays an income tax rate of 27.7%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went further and looked at what the tax burden was for someone 
who was making $35,000 a year.  Similarly they get the basic 
non-refundable tax credit and a couple of notional tax credits 
for CPP and EI premiums paid.  When we take that roughly $7,000 
off the $35,000, it means that the first amount of $30,000 at a 
rate of 17% is $5,100 and the balance of the $5,000 is taxed at 
26%.  If we do a quick calculation, including the gross up for 
the provincial tax payable, we will find that the effective tax 
rate for someone making about $30,000 is a little over 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went even further.  I looked at somebody making $20,000 a 
year.  With the notional reductions, et cetera, their tax rate is 
less than that still.  We go from 27% to 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I looked at these things I understood the actual burden of 
taxes. I have seen articles in newspapers where parliamentary 
journalists who have been here a long time continue to talk about 
Canadians paying a 50% tax rate, which is the highest marginal 
rate they would pay on taxable income over $59,180.  Ninety per 
cent of all Canadians pay a rate of taxation somewhere between 
20% and 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the point.  The principal spokesman for the Reform Party 
on this said we need tax relief in Canada.  What we need to do is 
bring down the income tax burden on Canadians to between 20% and 
30%.  If we look at what I just laid out in terms of the tax 
burden on Canadians, it ranges from 20% to 30% for those who are 
making $60,000 or less.  The only conclusion I can reach is that 
the Reform Party is calling for lowering the income tax burden 
for Canadians who are making more than $60,000 a year.  That 
represents about 10% of all income tax payers.  It is effectively 
a call based on the true reported results of Revenue Canada on 
who pays how much taxes and at what rates.  It is actually a 
dedicated policy of the Reform Party to reduce taxes for the 
highest 10% income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows precisely why Canadians have to look very carefully 
when people make representations such as the Reform Party and the 
Conservative Party have made.  They have provided very little 
factual information.  It has been more rhetoric than accuracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members will take to heart that in our income tax 
system only 10% of Canadians make more than $60,000 a year. 
Across the board tax increases, particularly those that affect 
those at the highest marginal bracket, are not in the best 
interests of all Canadians. That is why this government has 
provided tax relief targeted directly and more specifically at 
low and middle income Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the participation of the member opposite who is a 
member of the finance committee.  I believe he is a very astute 
member of that committee and mostly does his math right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very interested in his presentation of the facts.  I 
believe his characterization of our members is not accurately 
portraying the facts and is probably a bit of stretch, if I can 
be kind.  We do have a deep desire on this side of the House to 
deal with the facts, to debate the issues and to avoid personal 
attacks such as we get from the member who spoke before him over 
and over again to the point where it really does decrease the 
respect people have for members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He thought Reform's agenda was just to reduce the taxes for 
those who make over $60,000.  We know there are marginal tax 
rates which are so very important to many Canadians, in 
particular to poor Canadians.  If we take into account moving out 
of the income bracket where one is eligible for some of these 
so-called benefits the Liberal government and the Conservative 
government before it arranged in the tax system for people, when 
we think of the loss of eligibility for those programs, as one's 
income goes up the effective tax clawback or tax rate on that 
marginal income is extremely high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I do not have the numbers with me but one the 
calculations I saw put that number at around 60%.  I think the 
income level was around $25,000 a year for a family.  If it 
earned more money because of the total impact not just in the tax 
scheme but on the family budget, it meant that basically some 60% 
of its additional earnings was lost.  It was not effective to 
give it more income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the so-called rich, we know that many families 
earning $60,000 and more are just ordinary families nowadays 
trying to make ends meet.  Both people are working because they 
cannot live on one income.  Many of them are forced into that. We 
know that the marginal tax rate is around 50% when one combines 
federal and the provincial taxes.  I do not think that I have 
ever heard of a person whose annual income is $1 million a year 
paying anywhere near $500,000 in taxes. For the hon. member to 
accuse us of wanting to give a tax break to the very wealthy is 
perhaps empty because it seems to me that the very wealthy 
already do avoid those taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, again, these are two very 
good examples of how the presentation of information would tend 
to lead to one conclusion because it is explained in a very 
selective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone has worked for some time during the year and would be 
off due to layoff or for whatever reason and qualify for benefits 
and receive those during the same taxation year, under our system 
of employment insurance now Canadians who make over $48,000 and 
also have received employment insurance benefits would be 
required to repay a portion of that based on how much income they 
earned over $48,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has just described a situation and talked about 
60% tax rates and so on.  Reformers are basically saying if 
someone made $60,000 and part of that was employment insurance 
benefits and they had to give it back to the government because 
they made too much money, that would be effectively a 100% tax 
rate.  That is how they get these high numbers because they 
assume if one has to give back what they should not have received 
in the first place, it is equivalent to a 100% tax rate. 
It is the exact argument that was used with regard to the 
proposed seniors benefit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised a second item with regard to whether a million 
dollar taxpayer pays $500,000.  He pays a 17% federal rate on the 
first $30,000, 26% on the next $30,000 and 29% on anything in 
excess of that plus 50% federal.  If it is an employee with a T4 
slip he or she will pay very close to $500,000 on a million 
dollars of taxable income. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
interesting to debate this issue today.  I remind all members 
present, at least those who are awake and paying attention, that 
we are debating Bill C-72, an act to amend the Income Tax Act and 
to implement some of the measures announced in the budget not 
this year but last year.  I took note of the fact that it was on 
February 24, 1998 that the budget speech was given which promoted 
and put into effect the issues we are now debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need to take the first few minutes of my speech to talk about 
that process.  I have high respect for the Government of Canada, 
not necessarily the government that is currently in power but for 
the concept of government in Canada.  I have a high respect for 
democracy and it is appropriate for us to be aware that there is 
a serious flaw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally budget measures are kept secret.  There are some 
valid reasons for that.  It is possible that if people know in 
advance of substantial changes in tax structures or government 
benefits or programs they could either buy low and sell high or 
make some other financial decisions that could benefit them at 
lot personally.  It has been a tradition that budget matters have 
been confidential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have noticed in the last three or four years that 
the budget is not confidential at all.  I think the Liberals are 
trying to deal with one of the problems arising from this fact. 
They are getting a smaller and smaller kick from the budget 
speech since most of the details are announced on Monday and the 
speech is given on Tuesday.  They selectively and incorrectly 
leak information to the press. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that is rather inappropriate—and it is not that 
people have a chance to talk about it before the budget is 
announced, though that is a violation of a principle of 
parliament—is that we have no way of influencing the budget. 
There is no mechanism in Canada's parliament to actually change 
these things because of the way it happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister, probably the Prime Minister and several 
other bureaucrats sit in a small room somewhere and come up with 
these schemes.  It is no secret that a lot of these schemes are 
based on political considerations in the hope of getting 
re-elected.  Besides that a great deal of attention is paid to 
messaging and communicating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in favour of good communication.  Let us communicate the 
truth to the people.  The way they communicate is very important 
because they want people to believe certain things about what 
they are doing to maximize their chances of re-election.  If I 
can put it bluntly, they just want to look good.  I suppose there 
is nothing wrong with that.  My colleague from Crowfoot and I 
like to look good.  There is nothing wrong with wanting to look 
good but we need to be realistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 387 days after that budget was presented by the finance 
minister we are now debating it.  It is a farce because at the 
end of this debate there will be a vote and there is no way we 
will be able to reverse what the finance minister announced on 
February 24, 1998.  We know that, because government members are 
forced to vote for these measures. 
It has to do with the ridiculous notion that if we ever vote 
against a government money measure it somehow shows lack of 
confidence in the government and we therefore need to have an 
election.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While members stand to vote, presumably on Bill C-72, they will 
actually be standing to declare their desire not to have an 
election.  That is totally absurd.  One should not have to answer 
one question when the result applies to something totally 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the House need the ability as individual members of 
parliament to speak and to vote against measures that are to the 
detriment of Canadian taxpayers.  We need a way of amending and 
actually altering legislation in a meaningful way so that the 
Canadian citizen, the Canadian taxpayer, is represented in a 
tangible way that protects his or her interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP member from Kamloops actually stole part of my speech. 
In preparation for speaking today I obtained a copy of Bill C-72. 
I know, probably more than anyone in the House, that I cannot use 
props.  This is not a prop.  It is just a copy of a 157 page 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an opposition member of parliament whose job it is to find 
ways in which legislation can be improved and to give 
alternatives to the Canadian people, I find it distressing that 
the things announced by the Minister of Finance over a year ago 
could be brought before the House in a bill that was tabled on 
March 16, 1999.  Today is March 18.  The bill was first 
introduced a scant two days ago.  As I have said it is 157 pages 
long in both official languages.  We could cut it in half in 
terms of functional reading in either one of the languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Kamloops read a part of the Income Tax Act and 
we all just about broke up.  It was a comedy act.  It was an 
endless stream of incomprehensible gibberish.  I did not even 
look at the Income Tax Act.  I looked at the bill which amends 
the act and other acts.  The bill amends the Canada-U.S. Tax 
Convention Act, the Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act, 
the Old Age Security Act, the War Veterans Allowances Act and 
certain acts related to the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did the same as the member.  I opened Bill C-72 and began to 
read it.  I will not perform the same act he did because it would 
look as if I were copying him.  However, when preparing for my 
speech I thought I should just read some of the bill so Canadians 
would know how convoluted it is.  Let me read from page 104: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—if the completion date in respect of an eligible amount 
received by the individual was in the preceding tax year, the 
total of all amounts each of which is designated under subsection 
(3) by the individual for the particular year or any preceding 
taxation year included in the particular period, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) in any other case, the amount designated under subsection (3) 
by the individual for the particular year. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is only one of the sections.  I suppose if we really worked 
we could understand it, but it is very complicated. There are 
also formulas that apply in the Income Tax Act.  It goes on and 
on.  It is totally convoluted.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a debate on the issue before us which gives us the 
ability to look at the bill in detail and to propose amendments. 
We need a mechanism in parliament whereby we could say that an 
amendment was necessary.  If we are able by debate to persuade 
the majority of members in the House, regardless of what their 
whips tell them, that collectively in our wisdom something should 
be changed, then it should be changed.  It should not involve a 
vote of confidence in the government.  It should not involve the 
question of having another election.  It should be that we are 
making a law for the people and should do it better.  There is no 
mechanism to improve anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating a bill over a year after the budget was 
presented.  In the end we will go through a robot-like vote and 
it will be passed.  It will go to the Senate and will be passed. 
Everything is done in lock-step.  It is just absolutely 
ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a quote which I have used in the House before.  It will 
read it again because it is appropriate.  There are endless 
convoluted rules.  We need tax lawyers to compute one page of it. 
I suppose one could say it is a classic.  It is by Alexis de 
Tocqueville, a very famous historian and politician who visited 
America and wrote a four volume book called <I>Democracy in 
America</I>.  He observed how democracy works.  I am a defender of 
democracy, but I am also not so naive as to think we have reached 
the apex of what it can be.  There are a lot of areas to improve. 
It reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—after having thus successfully taken each member of the 
community in its powerful grasp, and fashioned him at will, the 
supreme power then extends its arm over the whole community.  It 
covers the surface of society with a network of small complicated 
rules, minute and uniform, through which the most original minds 
and the most energetic characters cannot perpetrate to rise above 
the crowd.  The will of man is not shattered but softened, bent 
and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are 
constantly restrained from acting.  Such a power does not 
destroy, but it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but it 
compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till 
each nation is reduced to be nothing better than a flock of timid 
and industrial animals, of which the government is the shepherd. 
I have always thought that servitude of the regular, quiet, and 
gentle kind which I have just described might be combined more 
easily than is commonly believed with some of the outward forms 
of freedom and that it might even establish itself under the wing 
of the sovereignty of the people. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is what is happening here.  I am amazed at the 
amendments in the bill with respect to deducting RRSP money from 
tax when used to educate children.  On the surface it looks like 
a wonderful idea because one can avoid paying taxes on some 
income.  I ask a fundamental question.  What business is it of 
any government to so minutely control all my financial decisions 
by having such a high tax rate that the most important decision I 
can make is how to avoid paying taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, through pages and pages and pages of Income Tax 
Act and amendments thereto, controls every minutia of my life and 
the life of taxpayers out there.  They have to decide to do one 
thing instead of another.  If they do not they cannot survive 
because the government confiscates the money. That is a wrong 
basis on which to govern.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that we got some economic freedom. We always talk 
about freedom.  We are economic slaves to the government.  Half 
or more of our income is confiscated by the different levels of 
government which totally takes our freedom away from us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to the point where families have to make decisions against 
their initial will that both parents will enter the workplace to 
provide for their own needs of life and for their family.  People 
are crunched into the corner.  Who looks after the children while 
both parents are working?  The government imposes so many high 
taxes on them that it is a necessity to go to work.  Meanwhile 
they are taxed to death.  Half of what they earn goes to taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the example before.  We have municipal taxes. We 
have provincial taxes.  We have income taxes.  We have excise 
taxes.  We have import taxes.  We have sin taxes.  GST, HST.  It 
goes on and on and on.  Every penny of GST we pay we have already 
paid income tax on and the government takes more of the money 
that has already been taxed and taxes it some more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing is true for my property tax.  In Canada, I cannot 
reduce my taxable income by the amount I use to pay my property 
tax.  I can if I am in business.  Then there is a different rule, 
another minute rule that controls our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a husband with my wife trying to provide a place for my 
family and I have to pay taxes to provide the basic services in 
my community.  I would venture to say I get a much more 
substantial tax kick out of my municipal taxes than I do out of 
my federal taxes in the amount paid and in what I personally 
receive in benefits for myself and my family in terms of 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time I pay those taxes, say they are $2,400 a year, I have 
to earn $4,000.  I earn $4,000.  The federal and provincial 
governments take 40% of it.  I am left with $2,400.  I write a 
cheque to the county where I reside and my $4,000 of earnings is 
gone.  Bingo, just like that.  Zip.  There is not a thing I can 
do about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, we have all the minute details in this budget that 
say “We want you to do this and we want you to do that”.  The 
tax code is arranged so that the government controls to the 
smallest detail how a person spends the money they earn. I do not 
believe it is entitled to do that to the degree it is done in 
this country.  It has gone completely overboard, totally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if we will ever be able to achieve the system we 
had when I was a student.  This bill has some new rules on 
interest payments on student loans. The Liberals in this 
government and the Conservatives before them, have arranged for 
the financing of students by putting a burden of debt on their 
backs that crushes them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They not only have their share of the federal debt and the 
respective provincial debts which is $20,000 or $25,000 per 
person. Students, our pages here, each one of them without having 
lifted a finger already probably owes $20,000 of federal debt and 
at least another $10,000 of provincial debt.  There they are with 
a $30,000 debt on their backs and they have not graduated from 
school yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this government and the government before it do?  They 
arrange for these students to be able to get student loans while 
the costs of education are rising exponentially.  As a result, we 
are told that many students now have student loans of $50,000 or 
$60,000 when they graduate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It sounds so wonderful.  Bill C-72 says “We are going to make 
it nicer for these students.  We are going to allow them maybe 
even to get forgiveness for part of their loan.  We are going to 
allow them to reduce their taxable income by the amount of their 
loan”.  That sounds wonderful, but it is a crock. It is a shame. 
It is a crime that they have that debt load in the first place. 
Why are citizens of this country.  Why can we not provide a means 
of education that students can afford?

would like to ask my colleague about one of the saddest things I 
have seen since being elected to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Unger, a constituent of mine, came into my office.  He had 
trouble with regard to a disability payment.  He was having some 
clawback with regard to his CPP and OAS.  We looked into Mr. 
Unger's case to see if we could help him out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was one of the saddest things.  This man had been married to 
his wife for over 30 years.  He came in with his wife, they sat 
down and told me that they had divorced because there were tax 
advantages in their being two separate entities. They had ended 
over 30 years of wedded bliss just so they could take advantage 
of those tax incentives by being separate on their tax forms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague has referred to some of these rules and 
regulations.  I would like him to speak on the matter of rules, 
regulations, clauses and all the rest of these little details in 
the tax act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ungers are not the only ones to have come into my office. 
The saddest thing about the Unger case and the reason it stands 
out in my mind is that Mr. Unger died before we could rectify his 
case.  It was a crying shame. I have had several people come into 
my office who have divorced after tens of years of marriage to 
take advantage of those tax loopholes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to comment on tax rules that 
advocate and force people into those types of situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is really sad.  If we stop 
to think about it, this is incredibly sad.  I used the quotation 
from Alexis de Tocqueville.  One of the words is “tyranny”. We 
can use these tax rules to tyrannize our population, our 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has obviously brought forward an example that all of 
us have encountered as members of parliament.  People say “If I 
did this or if I did that, if I got divorced instead of staying 
together with my wife or my husband, I would actually gain in the 
tax code”.  If we in this place cannot arrange for a tax code to 
be neutral on those decisions, then we are not doing our jobs 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the government resign over this and call an 
election.  I know that might hit the news tonight but it is so 
serious and that is what should happen.  We should have an 
opportunity as Canadian citizens to say to our government, “You 
do not have the right to put that kind of minute rule into the 
tax code that will affect that very important decision”.  We are 
living in an age when so many decisions are made based on tax 
rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember not long ago I went to a one day seminar on 
retirement planning.  I came out shaking my head.  About 85% or 
90% of the time was spent on how to avoid and defer taxes.  Only 
about 10% was spent on how to make wise decisions and how to set 
up plans, what is the best vehicle to provide for a retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I am interested in this because having opted out of 
the MP pension plan I am looking after myself and my wife. There 
again, I cannot use the RRSP deduction for my wife who is 
dependent on me.  We made that choice.  She does not directly 
earn my income.  She definitely shares in the work of earning the 
money we have as a family but I cannot use it. If we were to make 
another decision on how we run our lifestyle, then this would be 
available.  The tax code ought to stay out of my life.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is always interesting to 
hear the Reform Party.  It is the opposition party so its job is 
to oppose regardless of what provisions come before it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party did provide a prebudget submission.  It called 
for some $25 billion in cuts which essentially would have to be 
paid for through program and service cuts.  We already know the 
Reform Party would cut $3.5 billion out of the CHST.  The hon. 
member talks about a concern for health care.  The CHST goes to 
support provincial governments in their pursuit of funding 
post-secondary education.  Would he cut research and development 
or is it the child tax benefit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to stand up in this House and say everything the 
government is doing is wrong and that they can do it better.  The 
challenge comes— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is what you used to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  The hon. member across the way said that 
is what we used to do.  Canadians expect something more than that 
kind of heckling from the member opposite.  Canadians are looking 
for progress and the ability to enter the next millennium on a 
solid basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have balanced the budget.  I only point to the member for 
Medicine Hat, the Reform Party's finance critic, who commented on 
the 1998 budget which is the bill we are discussing.  Perhaps the 
member opposite could stand up and comment on the comment made by 
the member for Medicine Hat who said “It does make it hard to 
criticize.  It is a significant financial accomplishment”. That 
was said by the member for Medicine Hat, the finance critic for 
the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least the members opposite could stand up and say although 
they may not agree with every measure, there are measures in the 
bill which they feel they can support, and that they can support 
the general direction of the government which is to ensure that 
Canadians have a better future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member cannot question the ability or the intentions that we 
as a government and as members on this side of the House will 
continue to represent constituents in the best possible manner we 
can.  There are elements in this bill that support where 
Canadians want to go and we will make sure they get there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Certainly, Madam Speaker, all my life I have 
been a positive person.  I have always said there is a little bad 
in the best of us and a lot of good in the worst of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there are some things in this bill which are good and which 
are commendable.  If the hon. member opposite requires the ego 
trip of having a Reformer commend him, I would say I commend him. 
I commend him for making some of these changes because they are 
in the right direction but fundamentally the whole philosophy is 
still wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If $1,000 has been taken away from a family every year, why 
should the government be patted on the back because now only $500 
will be taken?  I know it is taxation and it is legitimate.  It 
is legitimate to have a level of taxation but what we have here 
is the government intruding into the minute details of our lives 
and I would like to just get the government out of my face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of financial positions, our overall philosophy is very 
clear.  We believe in leaving more of the money that individual 
taxpayers have earned in their own hands.  That is the overriding 
philosophy.  I believe in that very strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe we should coerce Canadian citizens into an act 
of submission and say to the government that they will give it 
half of their earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may want to check <I>Hansard</I> for one of my previous 
member's statements where I talked about a theft.  A guy came 
into my house and took half of everything I had.  I phoned the 
police but they would not help me because the guy who took half 
of everything I had was the taxman.  I would be the one who would 
get into trouble if I did not help him load.  That is what is 
happening here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxation levels are way too high.  That is why families are 
in financial distress.  Their total family income is adequate but 
the total tax bite is so large that they cannot make ends meet. 
That is a reality.  I think it is time that this government woke 
up to it.  At the same time there are some measures here which 
will slightly lessen that onerous load.  For that I guess we 
ought to get down on our knees and say we are grateful.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate at second reading of Bill 
C-72, an act to amend the Income Tax Act and to implement various 
measures announced in the 1998 Liberal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will remember—and I will be pleased to remind it to those 
who do not—that, in 1998, when the Minister of Finance tabled his 
budget, we strongly criticized it. We particularly condemned the 
unfairness and the injustices contained in that budget, such as 
the fact that the Liberal government was using funds—and I am 
referring to the employment insurance fund—that belonged to 
workers and employers to finance inadequate measures, given what 
the Minister of Finance could do, in 1998 and this year, to help 
improve the well-being of Quebec and Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That basic criticism still applies. What we had against the 1998 
budget still holds true today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the Bloc Quebecois said there were certain 
measures in the budget that represented an improvement, given 
the unfairness and flaws of the tax system. Some of the measures 
announced in the 1998 budget had been promoted by the Bloc 
Quebecois since the 1993 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill to implement the 1998 budget, namely Bill C-72, which is 
before us today, does provide measures that are improvements. 
Take for example the $500 increase for the personal tax credit, 
the reduction in the personal income surtax, the home buyers 
plan, the RRAP for the disabled, and the tax credit for interest 
on student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was one of the first measures the Bloc Quebecois proposed 
to the government as a way to help students in a general reform 
of personal income tax.  It has taken some time coming, but at 
least the government is vindicating the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also measures such as the educational tax credit and 
the child care deductions available to eligible part time 
students.  We also encouraged this sort of measure, and it 
appeared in the 1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also advocated deductions for child care 
costs in general terms.  Although in Quebec, with its 
government's excellent policy on $5 daycare, the importance of 
the deduction will decrease. But Quebeckers and Canadians still 
currently benefit from this measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the maximum $1,000 deduction for volunteer firefighters, we 
supported this measure following representations by volunteer 
fire brigades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of raising the ceiling on investment in labour 
sponsored venture capital firms from $3,500 to $5,000, we would 
have had a hard time opposing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us render unto Caesar what is Caesar's.  The Bloc Quebecois 
had proposed these measures as a step in the right direction. 
In general terms, however, and I will provide reasons later in 
my remarks, we found that the Minister of Finance did not do his 
job well and could have done a lot better had he not so brazenly 
hidden since 1994 the true picture of public finances and 
especially the operations surplus he could have used on measures 
much more consistent than these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, these little measures following one after the 
other were positive and, in our opinion, remain so and therefore 
we are a little hard pressed to reject the whole thing saying it 
is a matter of the past, should be set aside, with the result 
that taxpayers who should be benefiting cannot.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not completely comfortable with the amendment moved by 
the Reform Party, which reads as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-72... since 
the principle of the bill fails to address the federal tax 
system to end discrimination against single income families with 
children. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the Reform Party with respect to the content, but 
not with respect to the political approach they wish to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just because one fundamental unfairness in the tax system has 
not been eliminated does not mean we should toss the whole bill 
out, that we should decline to go to second reading, even though 
the bill contains certain amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to support the Reform Party amendment, we would find 
ourselves in the situation of creating more unfairness than the 
Reform Party claims to be eliminating.  This makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, for instance, we rejected the $500 increase in the basic 
personal tax credit, if we rejected the elimination of the 
surtax for individuals, if we rejected the tax credit for 
interest on student loans, would we be helping people in any 
way?  Would we be helping single income or other families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the content, an overhaul of the tax system is clearly in 
order.  The Bloc Quebecois was among those who supported the 
Reform Party in its efforts to eliminate the astonishing spread 
between the amount of tax paid by a single income family with 
children and the amount paid by a two income family with 
children whose total income was the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also other inequities in the tax system.  We will do 
what we can, as we have since 1993, to improve the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we cannot approve of the Reform Party amendment.  We would 
be shooting ourselves in the foot, and only increasing tax 
inequities by rejecting Bill C-72. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, if this might have seemed to be bouquets for the 
government, now I would like to add some brickbats.  Exactly 
like  the 1999 budget, the 1998 one contained precisely the same 
fundamental defects for which we criticized the Minister of 
Finance when he brought down his latest budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has hidden the true face of public finances.  In so 
doing, he is not presenting the real possibilities there might 
have been for righting the injustices in the taxation system, 
for example by ensuring that the employment insurance surplus 
remains in the hands of employers and workers and goes to 
benefit the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could have done far more for students, for the disabled. 
Where the fault lies with this Minister of Finance, the same one 
we have had since 1994, is that he presents budgets to us that 
contain unreliable figures.  He tells us that he done all he can 
do within the opportunities and the leeway available to him. 
The problem is that the leeway he refers to is false.  He does 
not give us all the possibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the hon. members of what we in the Bloc Quebecois 
said in 1998, before the 1998 budget, and again in 1999.  We 
said it in 1997 and 1996 as well.  Every year, the minister was 
out by about 60% in his predictions, between 60 and 150% in his 
predictions of the deficit and surplus, within six to eight 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We gave him the right figures.  As far back as 1998, we told him 
this, a number of months before the budget “You have the 
opportunity, all throughout fiscal year 1998-99, to solve a lot 
of problems, if you just tell us the truth, if you give us the 
right figures, if you give us the true range of possibilities 
offered by the actual surplus”.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point, members no doubt recall, barely a few months 
previously, we had tabled an analysis by the Bloc Quebecois, 
well received by the Minister of Finance, of ways to reform the 
personal and corporate tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had told him that he could as of that point—in 1998—start 
changing personal taxes over a 12 month fiscal year by fully 
indexing tax tables.  He could have done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998-99, we had set the surplus he would realize in the fiscal 
year at a minimum of $10 billion. 
Here we are in March 1999 and we see that the surplus for this 
fiscal year will indeed surpass $10 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could have corrected these basic injustices, but he did not, 
and this is what we are criticizing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures set out in Bill C-72 represent some improvement, but 
it is minimal compared with what the Minister of Finance could 
have done, this minister who is too lazy and who lacks 
imagination and transparency when he reveals the true picture of 
public finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will simply give the House an example of the unfairness of the 
tax system at the moment because it is not indexed.  Let us 
take, for example, the basic personal exemption in federal 
income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1998 budget, the minister proposed the figure of $6,706. 
The amount that he proposed in 1999, in the last budget, is 
$7,131. If the minister had fully indexed that basic personal 
exemption, it would not be $7,131 but close to $8,100 per 
taxpayer. This is not negligible. The total figure for all 
taxpayers represents a significant shortfall for Quebec and 
Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for the spousal amount. Given the proposed amount 
in the 1998 and 1999 budgets, there is a shortfall of about $700 
in the basic personal exemption. Seven hundred dollars helps 
make ends meet, particularly if you are in the middle or lower 
income category and have made the greatest contribution to help 
this government puts its fiscal house in order. That money would 
be helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is worse. 
The Bloc Quebecois condemned the unfairness resulting from 
having two different tax treatments, depending on whether there 
is one or two incomes in a family, and the amendment proposed by 
the Reform Party seeks to correct that situation. However, that 
unfairness is exacerbated and made worse by the fact that tax 
brackets are not fully indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the case of single income family, which pays more taxes 
than a two income family with the same total income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us assume that a single income family makes $36,500. That 
family pays $1,118 more in taxes than it would if tax brackets 
were fully indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take a two income family earning the same total amount, 
$36,500, but with both spouses paying taxes, this family pays 
$272 more in taxes than it would if there were full indexing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a terrible imbalance here.  Whether we are dealing with 
a single income family or a two income family, the difference in 
the taxes paid for an equivalent income no longer make any 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If only the tax brackets were fully indexed, as we have been 
proposing since 1994, since we first set foot in the House.  We 
went further still in our comprehensive review of personal and 
corporate taxes, but indexing has always been a sort of mantra 
for the Bloc Quebecois.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An examination of the tax rates for the various brackets shows 
how ridiculous this is.  For instance, taxes are 17% on the 
first $29,590.  With full indexing, and not just on the basic 
exemptions, the rate would have been 17% on the first $36,918. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to $36,918, the rate would be 17%, while right now, without 
indexing, it is 17% only up to $29,590. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same for everything up to $29,591, and then up to 
$59,180. This second bracket is taxed at 26%. 
If there had been full indexation on this income level, the 26% 
tax rate would have kicked in at between $36,919 and $73,838, 
before going up another 3% to 29%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes no sense that, even today, with the means available to 
the Minister of Finance and the government, we are still at the 
stage of not having given a minute's thought to satisfying the 
bulk of Canadian taxpayers by fully indexing income tax 
brackets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Merely by fully indexing the $29,590 tax bracket at the 17% tax 
rate, taking it up to $36,918, 70% of Canadian taxpayers would 
be affected.  This general measure would have beneficial 
results. 
All taxpayers would benefit, yet the Minister of Finance has not 
responded to our invitation to correct such an injustice, 
despite our telling him in 1998 that the surplus for the 1998-99 
fiscal year offered him real possibilities for doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later this week we will be addressing 1999, and again he has not 
responded.  He has preferred a few little measures relating to 
taxation rather than any overhaul, any overall planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am beginning to agree with an editorialist at the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>, who said the other day that the Minister of Finance was 
perhaps what it took to bring the deficit to zero with measures 
that were and are totally questionable. However, he may not be 
the right person to manage growth and surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see over the past two years what this man has done, when 
there are huge needs and wide open possibilities, I start 
agreeing with the editorialist at the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the unemployed.  We were saying the same thing 
in 1998.  Things are worse for the unemployed in 1999.  In 1998, 
we rejected the budget of the Minister of Finance for one of the 
basic reasons we gave for the 1999 budget as well, which is that 
the unemployed are the real losers.  Bill C-72 does not resolve 
this issue. 
The unemployed should benefit from the huge surpluses 
accumulating since 1996 in the employment insurance fund.  They 
will total over $25 billion at the end of this fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year, the minister takes $6 billion that should go to help 
those hit by the scourge of unemployment.  As they are hit by 
this scourge it is not the time to make them poorer than they 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what the government said and the figures of the 
Department of Human Resources Development, only 43% of the 
unemployed benefit from the employment assistance plan.  The CLC 
cites 36%.  He preferred to keep these surpluses, set them 
aside, make himself look good, prepare his run for the 
leadership rather than help the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our basic criticisms remain. The basic criticisms of the Reform 
Party remain as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to tell my hon. colleague about a situation that 
happened in my riding.  I held a town hall meeting recently.  A 
fellow who is a long time resident fought for Canada during the 
second world war and, if I remember correctly, Korea. He showed 
up in my town hall meeting.  He waited around until 9 p.m. and 
stayed after just so he could get some of my time. His name is 
Bob McPherson. Bob bought Canada savings bonds for each of 
his grandchildren.  He put them in a trust.  He said “I don't 
trust government.  I have been around long enough and I have seen 
all the problems, complications and everything else. I will get 
you these bonds and that way you will have something for 
yourselves when you get older, go to school and you will have a 
way to be able to pay for it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that Bill C-72 talks about the registered education 
savings plans and lifelong learning plans.  Bob as a dutiful 
taxpayer filled out his tax returns and sent them off.  As it 
turns out he expected to get a refund.  Lo and behold he did not. 
It turns out the government said that he owed money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bob came to my town hall meeting and he was livid.  He said “I 
do not want to send them a single penny”.  I had to tell Bob 
that is not worth fighting RevCan for the amount of money it was. 
It was about $47.  I said “Go ahead and pay the $47 and do what 
you can to fight them because they will hold it against you and 
charge interest”.  It was really sad.  This man who bought bonds 
for his grandchildren for their education was being taxed on that 
even though it was held in trust. The money would never be 
touched by him or his wife or anyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an absolute shame that Bob McPherson was put in a 
situation where he had to pay more tax to the government because 
he was trying to help out his grandchildren.  At the end of it 
all when it was all said and done, Bob McPherson pulled the bonds 
because he thought it was better to give the money to his 
grandchildren directly than to let the government dig into his 
pockets and eat into their education fund. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure the hon. member 
asked a question, but he provided good topics for discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know Bob McPherson's particular situation, what his 
taxable income or his assets were. There are many circumstances 
that may explain why, even while trying to help his 
grandchildren, he ended up having to pay taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I do know is that, generally speaking, the Canadian tax 
system is characterized by obvious unfairness and injustices. 
The hon. member and his party pointed out some of them, and so 
have we. We expect that, some day, the government will take 
action because, since 1994, the Minister of Finance has tabled 
many omnibus bills that were supposed to correct a number of tax 
provisions. 
But when we look at the overall picture, we realize that not 
much has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I intend to soon ask a question on this issue. Members 
will recall the family trusts scandal, where $2 billion were 
transferred to the United States without any taxes being paid. 
At that time, the Minister of Finance promised to table a bill 
in 1999, to eliminate this tax loophole. We are still waiting. 
We do not remember him talking about that issue this year, and 
nor do members from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, there is a lot to do. 
The government could do a lot more about education savings 
plans, so that middle income earners could benefit from them. 
Right now, these plans benefit first and foremost the privileged 
in our society, not the middle class, as should be the case, 
since the objective is to improve access to education.

contributing moneys to a trust and why should they be taxed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should be aware that under the Income Tax Act we have 
income attribution rules where, if a parent gives money to 
children under 21, the income from that transfer of asset must be 
attributed to the parent. If that were not the case, they would 
be splitting their total investment income with their children. 
It is only to ensure that people with children do not get a 
better tax advantage than those without children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised two issues I wanted to deal with.  The last 
point he made was with regard to RESPs.  He stated very clearly 
that RESPs benefit the more affluent.  This is absolutely 
incorrect.  The current grant formula says that every Canadian, 
regardless of income, who contributes to an RESP is eligible for 
20% government grant on the first $2,000.  This is not a 
deduction on the tax return.  It happens to be outside the tax 
system.  The member is absolutely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this member.  He is a member of the finance committee. He 
is an economist by profession and I have heard him speak very 
well on a number of very complicated issues with regard to the 
economic condition in Canada.  He talked about bracket creep and 
he laid out that if we had a situation where the income tax 
brackets had been indexed over the period he was talking about, 
the first bracket would rise from $29,590 up to, I believe, 
$36,000, the member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is absolutely right.  He should recognize that people 
who make under $30,000 a year would not benefit from the bracket 
creep adjustment.  Also, the federal government itself is subject 
to purchasing power erosion by inflation because we pay salaries 
to our employees and we pay increased prices due to inflation for 
our goods and services. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, briefly, what I said was that one 
had to have money to be able to put any in a registered 
education savings plan.  The present ceilings are perhaps too 
high for middle income earners, with the result that they are 
not contributing as much as they should to these plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the other question, the point here is not to worry about 
every little comma and period.  The point is to recognize that 
there are things that need changing in the current tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My eminent colleague admits that there are inequities in the 
federal tax system.  What he should be doing is bringing all his 
energy and intelligence to bear on eliminating these inequities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for taxpayers earning less than $30,000, there is certainly 
work to do here in all categories.  I gave the example of people 
earning around $30,000, between $30,000 and $40,000, which is 
the bracket into which 70% of Canadian taxpayers fall.  That was 
the example I gave, and it is quite a striking one.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, the people who pay the biggest price for the folly of

on reserve, where residents often live far below the poverty

francophone Canadians to cross political and linguistic lines to

drop their anti-French stance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week Reform members said that Canada is not a bilingual 
country.  This is news to me and I suspect it is news to most 
Canadians across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now Reformers are complaining, as quoted in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> today, “The country is being run by francophones.  You 
sigh and you whine and you snivel, and you get the money... and if 
you say anything about it, you're a bigot”.  That is what the 
member for Yellowhead said.  That is just rubbish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers should realize the benefits of being a member of both 
the Commonwealth and la francophonie.  Canada's diversity is its 
strength, not something that should be wiped out as most Reform 
members seem to think.

here in Canada six years ago we inherited a totally desperate

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put this country's finances in order and have revived 
the economy.  Today, Canada's productivity is on the rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition is using statistics that date back 
to before the Liberals were in government, but the reality is 
that 1.6 million jobs have been created since we took office. 
Our budget is a balanced one and we have the lowest interest 
rates that there has been for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all elements which impact heavily on Canada's

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what is so embarrassing for the Prime Minister is that 
while this decline in the standard of living started years ago, 
it has become worse under his administration.  It was falling in 
1987, but according to the International Institute for Management 
Development our overall standard of living was also falling in 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister deny the fact that under his policies 
the gap between the standard of living of Canadians and that of 
Americans has become $7,000 per person and growing? 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it saddens me to hear a serious topic like the issue of 
Canada's productivity challenge distorted by the Leader of the 
Opposition in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish he would read the speech.  I wish he would quote a few 
other parts of it.  For example, the federal deficit stood at $42 
billion in 1993 and now it is the first budgetary surplus in 28 
years.  Our inflation rate has been the lowest in more than a 
generation.  In 1998, 453,000 jobs were created.  Canada 
experienced a bounce back in productivity in 1997.  In 1994 we 
ranked twentieth in the world economic forum's competitiveness 
rankings and now we rank fifth. 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  It 
looks like somebody got to the industry minister, Mr. Speaker.  I 
do not need to quote from the industry minister's speech.  I can 
quote from the government's own Standing Committee on Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December it acknowledged our falling standard of living and 
said it was an indication of a fundamental weakness in our 
system.  We agree.  Seven thousand dollars a year may be nothing 
to the Prime Minister, but it buys a lot of groceries and clothes 
for ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can the Prime Minister not see that his high debt, high tax 
policies are hurting Canadians and hurting them bad? 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in the bizarre, simplistic world in which members of the 
Reform Party live things are never complicated.  I understand 
that.  In this case they need to understand that meeting the 
Canadian productivity challenge is a long term investment. 
It means action on the part of government, action like bringing 
down the deficit, action like bringing down the debt, action like 
keeping interest rates low, action like giving confidence to our 
international investors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time it requires the private sector to invest.  It 
requires the private sector to invest in research and development 
and in labour market training. These are the components of 
productivity.  That is where success lies for Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Oh, to be so 
blessed with such complexity, Mr. Speaker.  Let me quote from the 
Minister of Industry's speech last month.  He said “Our per 
capita income would have been $7,000 a year higher.  For a family 
of four, this is a $28,000 shortfall”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give him a few seconds to find that part in his speech 
because I am sure he would like to refer to it.  I believe the 
Minister of Industry was telling the truth in that report, and he 
knows it.  Does the Prime Minister also think he was? 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, of course I was telling the truth in the speech I gave. 
I was saying exactly the point that the productivity challenge is 
a real one for Canadians to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the simplistic world in which members of the Reform Party 
live the solutions are never complicated.  They recognize that 
productivity is part of the solution, but if we promote a program 
to support research and development in the private sector they 
are prepared to ignore the fact that it is an important component 
of productivity.  They vote against it.  In fact, they do their 
best to undermine programs that support research and development 
in the private sector. 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
now we have seen productivity challenged in the flesh.  This is 
just unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The date of that speech was February 18 and it was using recent 
statistics.  The place was the Empire Club in Toronto.  The topic 
was Canada's falling standard of living.  If it demanded a 
speech, there must be something to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that we were poorer than states like Mississippi.  He 
said that we were $7,000 poorer for each Canadian or $28,000 for 
a family of four.  That is a chunk of change.  Does he stand by 
his speech, or have the finance minister and the Prime Minister— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Minister of Industry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I stand by the speech and I deny categorically that it 
says anything of the sort.  It is astonishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly I compared productivity rates and productivity growth 
but everybody knows that only leads to standards of living in the 
future.  Again last year, for the fifth time in a row, Canada 
topped the United Nations human development index.  That is where 
we measure the quality of life in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the country does not address the issue of productivity, we 
will face problems with standard of living, but to this point we 
have met the real challenges that have been impeding our 
productivity growth for years.

three years now the Bloc Quebecois has been calling for 
employment insurance changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again this week the minister has thumbed his nose at the

responded to our questions with “Your figures are wrong”.

<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

some very important changes with the employment insurance 
reform, a reform that was necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were aware that this reform would have an impact, in some 
cases a difficult one, on some Canadians.  We included the 
requirement of annual reports within our reform in order to 
carry out a proper follow-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to draw the attention of the leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois, who claims to never make mistakes with figures, 
to the fact that he has demonstrated the opposite today, showing 
that in many areas there were major holes in the statements made 
by the Bloc Quebecois, and today's report also demonstrates 
this.

continues to turn a blind eye to the sufferings of people, of 
families, of the poor, of youth, most particularly of young

The opposition has no monopoly on compassion in this country of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member of one thing.  We have the same 
compassion for the unemployed, which is precisely why we want to 
give them the dignity of employment: we want to help them into 
the work force, we have their good at heart and we do not simply 
want to take the easy way out and keep them on employment 
insurance, as the members opposite want to do.

insurance, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that women and young people will benefit from this 
system.  If we see that the results are not in keeping with the 
objectives of our program, we will obviously have to correct 
them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will Doug Young's successor, the current Minister of Human 
Resources Development, honour the word of his predecessor and 
correct the enormous failings of the employment insurance plan, 
which are hard on women and young people? 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, some claim the young should be 
able to draw more employment insurance benefits.  We think young 
Canadians must have the opportunity to get a good education and 
hold good jobs.  That is what we are trying to do on this side 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most young Canadians share these values with us.  In fact, 
143,000 new jobs were created for young people in 1998, the best 
performance in 20 years.  That is what young people expect from 
good government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques,

as guinea pigs for this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister not think that this has gone on long enough, 
that the unemployed have done without long enough and that it is 
high time the minister rolled up his sleeve and set to work on 
improving the employment insurance plan, something the Bloc 
Quebecois has been demanding for the past three years? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat, the best way we can 
serve the unemployed is to give them real help to return to the 
labour market. And that is what we have done: 450,000 new jobs 
were created in the Canadian economy last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are accordingly far fewer unemployed in Canada than there 
were. And if we followed the policy the Bloc Quebecois wants us 
to, we would simply go back to a system that served neither 
Canadians nor the unemployed.

labour market is changing dramatically but the human resources

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the new economy more and more young people are working part 
time.  In the new economy women are faced with fewer available 
hours or many are forced into self-employment, and yet these are 
the very people who are being penalized by the Liberals EI 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government think that attacking women and young 
people helps them to adapt to the new economy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  First of all, Mr. Speaker, part time 
workers were never insured by the employment insurance system. 
We should first look at the reality.  They were not covered 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I can say is that indeed I am concerned about making sure 
that EI treats women in a fair and equitable way.  It is very 
important.   Why is it that fewer women have claimed EI in the 
last year?  Is it because 300,000 more women are working in the 
labour market now, or is it because the system is squeezing them 
out of it?  I am concerned and we will look into it.

grown 1.2% per year faster over 25 years, then the GDP per capita 
would be $7,000 higher.  But that is simple.  Productivity leads 
to economic growth. That in turn relates to output.  Output per 
capita would be higher if we produced more. That is not 
complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is complicated is to determine what the factors are that 
contribute to productivity growth and how can we improve Canada's

Minister of Canadian Heritage launched the Year of the 
Francophonie in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that the minister spent the week telling us that the 
federal government was doing a great job looking after the 
interests of francophones outside Quebec, how does she explain 
that a journalist from Radio-Canada, in Moncton, could only get a 
press kit in English? 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that clerical error was 
made by a subcontractor and was corrected immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disappointing to see that, while Bloc Quebecois members 
have an opportunity to celebrate and to congratulate and 
befriend other francophones in the country, they once again 
choose to nitpick and to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B> In the end, despise us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

this morning. She cannot say that it was conducted in English. 
It was essentially conducted in French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is regrettable in all this is the attitude of the Reform

Francophonie. Reformers say that French Canadians run 
everything, when in fact French and English Canadians share the 
responsibility of managing the affairs of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Government of Quebec, it claims, through its Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs, that “Quebec cannot, within the

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>TRANSITIONAL JOBS FUND 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
transitional jobs fund is beginning to look like a Liberal slush 
fund. First a Liberal bagman named Pierre Corbeil used these 
grants to shake down companies to make donations to the Liberal 
Party. Now we learn that just before the last election, the Prime 
Minister's personal assistant, Denise Tremblay, sat in on a 
meeting where a friend of the Prime Minister was applying for the 
grants.  The bureaucrats certainly got the message.  They came 
across with $164,000 in grant money for this guy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Prime Minister use his influence to milk this fund 
for his friends? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Again, I ask member to be 
very judicious in their questions.  The hon. Minister of Human 
Resources Development. 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the very strength of the 
transitional jobs fund is the local consultations that are 
required to ensure that the community is advised of the 
initiatives being proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My department recommended this project for approval because it 
met all the standard eligibility criteria under the transitional 
jobs fund.  Part of the criteria is to take the input of all MPs 
in the areas that are eligible for the TJF. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project continues to meet its contractual obligations and 
has created the 19 jobs forecasted. 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
sounds like the hon. member is paraphrasing another leader we 
know, “I did not have personal relations with those bureaucrats; 
I had my assistant do it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is this guy that government members went to bat for?  His 
name is Yvon Duhaime.  He is a three time convicted criminal. Not 
just that, but he is the guy who took that money losing property 
off the Prime Minister's hands. It gets worse than that.  The 
Prime Minister's personal assistant actually sat in on the 
steering committee where Duhaime got permission to get this 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message to the bureaucrats was perfectly clear:  This is a 
friend of the Prime Minister's, so let us cough up with the cash. 
That sounds awfully close to influence peddling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last

invited to listen but not to speak.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Pequists are now demanding the right to speak.  When we 
invite them to celebrate the Canadian Francophonie here in

interests them is trying to make political hay at the expense of 
the fundamental rights of all French Canadians in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a large process in which all MPs, including the Reform

looked after job creation in his riding, like all MPs who are 
consulted.  The transitional jobs fund is a very good program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

because of the government's bungling of the growing PSAC strike, 
millions of Canadians have seen their GST rebate cheques and 
their tax refunds delayed and held up at tax centres across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that money that belongs to Canadians, not bureaucrats

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise with respect to a matter that occurred in yesterday's 
question period, which I did not raise yesterday because I did 
not hear the remark due to the noise in the House.  However, I 
see that it is reported in <I>Hansard</I> at page 13014.  The hon. 
Minister for International Trade said in speaking of myself:  “I 
think it rings hollow when the member can be so disloyal.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 481 states in part: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it has been sanctioned by usage that a Member, while speaking, 
must not: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) impute bad motives or motives different from those 
acknowledged by a Member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) make a personal charge against a Member. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 486(1) reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible to lay down any specific rules in regard to 
injurious reflections uttered in debate against particular 
Members, or to declare beforehand what expressions are or are not 
contrary to order; much depends upon the tone and manner, and 
intention, of the person speaking; sometimes upon the person to 
whom the words are addressed, as, whether that person is a public 
officer, or a private Member not in office, or whether the words 
are meant to be applied to public conduct or to private 
character; and sometimes upon the degree of provocation— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many hot words have been exchanged between the opposition and 
that minister in terms of questioning the loyalty of the official 
opposition.  I do not rise on a point of order about ascribing 
motives to the opposition per se, but the record indicates that 
the member did specifically say that I as a member of this place 
was disloyal.  I think that is a rather fundamental attack on my 
integrity as a Canadian and as a member of this place.  I 
therefore rise to ask that the member retract and apologize for 
these unparliamentary remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I have ever heard a case of 
the pot calling the kettle black, this is it.  Today during 
question period we had hon. members in this House accusing other 
members of committing criminal acts, such as influence peddling, 
and yet they rise to talk about imputing motive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the accusations that were made today are perhaps a 
thousand times more severe, and would merit the admonition of the 
Speaker, than something such as questioning whether someone is 
loyal or disloyal to a particular cause.  Language was used today 
in the House by some hon. members accusing other members of 
parliament of influence peddling.  If it cannot be repeated 
outside, it should not have been said at all and it should be 
withdrawn. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Yesterday I heard when the 
word “disloyal” was used in the House.  Members will recall 
that I immediately intervened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No word in itself is unparliamentary.  It depends on how it is 
used.  It depends on the tone.  Yesterday in the course of the 
give and take of question period I thought it was necessary to 
admonish the hon. member.  I did not think at that point that it 
had reached the point of being unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even today when another hon. member stood to make a statement, 
and when we question the loyalty of any one of us, I think it is 
bad for all of us.  I appeal to hon. members.  That is why I 
asked members yesterday to please stay away from terms like 
disloyalty of one person to an idea or to whatever.  All it does 
is incite us as we go along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask you time and again to be very judicious in your choice of 
words.  I hope this will be the case from here on in.  I know 
that things get heated in here.  I understand this place, as you 
do. There are times when these words go back and forth.  It is a 
matter of seeing if we can conduct our business in an atmosphere 
which many times becomes poisonous because of the words we use.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case it was regrettable.  I intervened.  I 
judged then and I judge now that it was not an unparliamentary 
term and that I would let it sit there for that matter.  However, 
I would hope that hon. members would be very reflective on the 
words and on the tone they use when either questioning or 
answering questions and even in debate in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in that same train of thought, I noticed during question 
period today that the hon. member for Ottawa—Vanier accused one 
of my colleagues in the Reform Party of being intolerant.  Since 
he is here in the House, I would ask him to respectfully withdraw 
that statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not know about the word “intolerant” 
in and of itself.  However, the member is here.  He can tell us, 
if he wishes, what he meant by it and hopefully we can put this 
matter behind us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa—Vanier, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I commended the member for Brandon—Souris for his criticism 
which was directed to the member for Yellowhead for that member's 
comments about francophones.  I will quote the member as he is 
quoted in an article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> today.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You sigh and you whine and you snivel, and you get the money... 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I do not retract my statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Now we are getting into a bit of a debate on 
“he said, I said” and we are going to go around in circles. 
Once again I appeal to you to be very judicious in your choice of 
words because words such as “intolerant” and another word that 
was used today in a quotation, but which I did not find it 
unparliamentary, the word “bigot”, in this particular context, 
just serve to inflame us as we go along.  God knows, we have 
enough to be excited about without that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to you not to use these types of words and surely not 
that tone of voice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in order to accommodate the House, instead of waiting 
until eight o'clock this evening to commence the debate, and in 
order to allow more members to participate, I wonder if there 
would be a disposition to commence the debate immediately after 
private members' hour so that members can speak either for or 
against the emergency in question.  It would allow more members 
to speak.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a second issue, 
but perhaps we could agree to defer or to have the late show some 
other day so that members, given the importance of this issue, 
could commence at precisely the end of private members' hour, at 
or around 6.30 p.m., and we would not have the late show today, 
because this is an adjournment debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  All we are dealing with here is a motion 
from one hon. member.  He wants to put a motion on the floor that 
we move up the debate time from 8 p.m. to an earlier time, 6.30

might end earlier.  That is why I am saying “earlier”.

motions will be introduced.  I undertake to have one drafted and 
submitted to the House within minutes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
if I understand correctly, Private Members' Business today will 
not take very long.  I believe it is Bill S-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think in fairness to members who may have lined up their late 
show, and particularly given that Private Members' Business is 
expected not to take very long, we could commence the emergency 
debate immediately after the late show.  Quite a lot of 
scheduling goes into late shows. I do not know who is on the late 
show, but in fairness to people who may have scheduled themselves 
for this, particularly given the fact that Private Members' 
Business is expected to collapse, we could go straight into the 
late show after private members' hour and still begin the 
emergency debate earlier than we normally might have begun it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Let us see what we have here.  Permission is 
being sought by the hon. government House leader to put a motion, 
and the motion is that we will advance the beginning of the 
emergency debate which I have ordered from 8 p.m. to immediately 
after the late show.  That is what the motion is. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reply to the question from our Bloc Quebecois colleague, I 
think there will be something to add so that other motions are 
not included in the motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, for clarification, is it 
also understood then that the late show will be moved up and 
commence when Private Members' Business collapses, rather than 
having the House suspended until such time as the late show would 
regularly commence, so everything will run sequentially without 
time in between. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That is my understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps to assist, I think 
there is an understanding in the House now.  I will write a draft 
order to that effect, bring it back to the House in a few minutes 
and it will have all of that in it.  I think the House has

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise on debate at second reading of Bill C-72, an 
act to amend the Income Tax Act. This bill follows on several 
policy and technical changes made by the government in last 
year's budget, the 1998 budget, and which are now being fully 
implemented in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill covers many different areas, including registered 
education savings plans, provisions with respect to RRSPs, the 
personal tax credit, the child care expense deduction, as well as 
the caregiver tax credit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition will be opposing this bill on several 
grounds. Whenever the government brings before us a tax bill of 
this nature, which adds greater complexity to the tax code, we 
must ask why.  Why is it that this parliament and this government 
cannot understand the fundamental need for root and branch tax 
reform and tax simplification? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have a tax code that is over 1,300 pages long.  It has 
thousands of associated pages of regulations, rulings and 
interpretation bulletins issued by the Department of Finance and 
the Department of National Revenue.  This tax code which we are 
proposing to amend constitutes an enormous, destructive and 
wasteful burden on the productive capacity potential of our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of National Revenue employs over 43,000 full time 
personnel just to interpret, apply and enforce this Byzantine, 
out of control, costly and burdensome tax code.  Untold tens of 
thousands of other Canadians are occupied full time in the 
interpretation and compliance with the Income Tax Act.  That is 
to say that an enormous proportion of our national wealth is 
misdirected into complying with a tax code which no single 
individual can understand and which has grown beyond any 
reasonable level for a tax code in a free and democratic country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power to tax is the power to destroy.  It is an enormous 
power with which we are entrusted in this parliament, the power 
to confiscate legally the fruits of the labour of people who work 
hard day in and day out to do better by themselves and their 
families.  We use this enormous power, this Income Tax Act, to 
tell those families that they must give 10%, 20% or 30% of their 
family or individual incomes to this government to spend on its 
priorities rather than their own priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamentally, I want to make it clear that the official 
opposition opposes the continuing growth in complexity and cost 
of this destructive tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does precisely nothing to alleviate the enormous 
complexity and burden of the Income Tax Act but rather adds to 
it.  I will refer to each of the provisions here that simply add 
additional regulations and legislative language which will make 
the code even more burdensome and more difficult to interpret and 
even more difficult to comply with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer in particular to the proposed increase in the personal 
tax credit of $500 announced in the 1998 budget.  The first half 
of that $500 increase in the basic personal amount for some low 
income taxpayers was implemented in legislation last year.  The 
bill before us today would complete that increase to $500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point to an example of how ridiculously complicated this 
bill and the tax code are.  This bill does not increase the basic 
exemption for all Canadians, treating them equally across the 
income spectrum; rather it will only be increased for incomes 
under a certain amount based on a certain complicated formula, 
all of which unnecessarily complicates what should be the 
simplest part of the tax system, the basic personal exemption. 
Based on any rational principle of taxation, the basic personal 
exemption should be clear, straightforward, and ought not to 
become a complex exemption, as has been done in this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also say with respect to the provisions for RRSPs, this 
bill permits Canadian residents to make tax free withdrawals to 
pay for full time training, as they can for instance under the 
status quo ante to pay for their mortgage on a principal 
residence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to RRSPs, this bill does not address the 
fundamental problem. This parliament has decided to allow 
Canadians to direct a relatively small portion of their annual 
income into a registered retirement savings plan, if they do not 
qualify for a registered pension plan. That is a sensible policy. 
We recognize that millions of Canadians do not and cannot rely on 
government or their private sector employers to provide them with 
retirement security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that with the provision for RRSPs, we impose 
unreasonable regulations, restrictions and limitations on how 
much Canadians can save for the future in a tax sheltered vehicle 
such as an RRSP.  How do we do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we limit the amount of Canadian taxpayers' taxable income 
which can be deferred through the RRSPs to 18% or $13,500, 
whichever is less. This is to say that a self-employed young 
Canadian, with no company pension plan and no real prospect of a 
Canada pension plan benefit because of the actuarial instability 
of the CPP, has to almost exclusively rely on the RRSP as his or 
her source of future retirement income.  Yet the government says 
that it will limit quite severely the portion of the person's 
income which he or she can direct into that RRSP.  That is a 
disincentive for self-employed Canadians to take full 
responsibility for their financial future and for their 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This cap of $13,500 or 18%, whichever is less, has not increased 
over the past several years.  This is a reflection of the 
government's pernicious policy of taxing people on inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this government continue the Mulroney Conservative 
government policy of partial deindexation of the tax code.  We 
have seen taxpayers having to pay about $12 billion in additional 
taxes than they otherwise would have paid were it not for partial 
deindexation and the consequent bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So too we see the limit of $13,500 for maximum allowable RRSP 
contributions not keeping pace with inflation.  In other words, 
had the RRSP maximum amount been held constant with inflation, 
and if the maximum amount for RRSP contributions were equivalent 
to the maximum amount that people can contribute to a registered 
pension plan, then it would be about $15,000 that they could put 
into their RRSP and not $13,500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have seen an increase in the amount that people could 
save and defer taxes on through the RRSP for each of the last 
three or four years.  However the government, through its nickel 
and diming of people and its tax policies, decided to freeze the 
maximum allowable contributions several years ago.  Therefore, 
many hundreds of thousands of Canadians have not been able to 
defer taxation on their one and only source of future retirement 
income, namely their private retirement savings plans. 
For that reason we oppose the bill because it does not include 
the kind of increase in the RRSP allowable contribution amount 
which all people who are serious about their financial future 
would like to see.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that I have not in my time as a member of parliament 
received a single letter, phone call, fax, e-mail, comment at a 
town hall or on an open line show suggesting that Canadians would 
like to see their taxes increased, but I have received dozens 
upon dozens asking that the maximum amount for RRSPs be 
increased, which the bill does not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also received dozens of messages from constituents asking 
that we allow Canadians to invest a larger portion of their RRSPs 
into foreign held equities and investments.  Under the current 
law, which the bill fails to change, Canadian investors can only 
contribute 20% of their tax deferred RRSP savings in foreign 
investments.  That means that at least 80% of their investments 
are stuck in domestic Canadian equities and bonds.  We are again 
forcing Canadians to be irresponsible when it comes to their own 
financial future.  One of the basic fundamental principles of 
sound investment is to diversify, which we do not allow Canadians 
to do because of the restrictive 20% foreign content limit on 
RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet another one of the inadequacies in the Bill C-72 is its 
failure to respond to the outcry among Canadians to allow them to 
protect the value of their retirement savings and to generate 
better returns, which would consequently benefit the Canadian 
economy by raising the maximum allowable foreign content limit in 
the RRSP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address an aspect of the bill which I really find the 
most objectionable, that is the increase which it proposes in the 
child care expense deduction.  The bill completes a change begun 
in legislation from last year's budget which increased the child 
care expense deduction from $5,000 for children under seven to 
$7,000, an increase of $2,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain what the child care tax deduction—

case there is a request for unanimous consent between now and the

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1998 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK213">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-72, an 
act to amend the Income Tax Act, to implement measures that are 
consequential on changes to the Canada-U.S. Tax Convention (1980) 
and to amend the Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act, the 
Old Age Security Act, the War Veterans Allowance Act and certain 
acts related to the Income Tax Act; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was just beginning to address the issue of the proposed 
increase in the bill for the child care tax deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain what it is.  We have had much debate in this 
place over the past two or three weeks about the lack of fairness 
toward single income families with children.  One of the issues I 
wanted to bring to attention of this place was the unfair, 
unjustifiable discrimination against single income families that 
decided to do what they believed was best by their kids and raise 
them at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child care tax deduction says to parents who have two 
incomes that if they pay someone else, a third party, whether a 
day care operator, a babysitter, a hockey summer camp or music 
summer camp, to take care of their kids for a period of time and 
are issued a receipt for the expenses incurred, the government 
will allow the spouse with the lower of the two incomes in those 
double income families to deduct the value of the child care 
receipt from their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This says that families that give up the second income and have 
the father or the mother stay at home full time to raise the 
children and give up tens of thousands of dollars in potential 
income are out of luck.  They assume an enormous opportunity cost 
and in so doing voluntarily reduce their standard of living.  In 
many instances they give up the second car, the larger house or 
the three week vacation.  Those families do not qualify for the 
child care tax deduction, the value of which is increased in Bill 
C-72.  It says to those families that they will be forced through 
the tax system to subsidize the day care choices of one kind of 
family, that is to say the double income family that pays for 
outside child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This deduction is absolutely, fundamentally unfair.  We in the 
official opposition attempted to bring the issue to a head in the 
supply day motion on which we voted Tuesday last. Unfortunately, 
because apparently government members who agreed with us were 
whipped to vote against it, that motion did not pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, at least we succeeded in having the government admit 
there might be some kind of problem.  Virtually every economist 
and social scientist who has studied the matter agrees that there 
is discrimination against single income families with children in 
part due to the child care tax deduction in the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT68"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT68"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1540

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the bill is that it raises the inequity.  It 
increases the unfairness.  It moves the deduction from $5,000 to 
$7,000.  While we are trying to bring single income families in 
line with or in parity with their double income counterparts, the 
government is actually increasing the unfairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's own budget documents demonstrate this quite 
clearly.  The budget documents tabled by the hon. Minister of 
Finance last month indicate that the tax inequity between single 
and double income families ranges between 60% and 115%.  That is 
to say, single income families pay between 60% and 115% more.  In 
some cases they pay twice as much in federal income taxes as do 
their double income counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is for families that are generally on the lower end of the 
income scale.  This is for the single income families that 
according to the Vanier Institute of the Family are 3.8 times 
more likely to be poor.  This is simply inexcusable.  I will 
vigorously oppose the bill because of the increase in the child 
care tax deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One provision in the bill allows for a deduction for children 
between the ages of seven and sixteen.  What does this mean?  It 
means that a double income family, theoretically a wealthy double 
income family, could pay for a 15 or 16 year old child to go to 
an expensive hockey school or music summer camp and claim a full 
$4,000 tax deduction.  At the same time the low income family, 
the single income family on the other side of town that is 
bringing in only $30,000 in income but has dad or mom full time 
at home with the kids, gets no commensurate deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not propose, by objecting to this issue, to remove the 
deduction for child expenses completely.  We propose to convert 
it into a refundable credit that would be available to all 
families regardless of their child care choice.  Single income 
families would have the full advantage of a refundable credit 
equivalent to the maximum amount of the $7,000 deduction.  This 
would amount to $1,200.  Every child under seven, under the 
credit we are proposing, would benefit through their parents to 
the amount of $1,200 a year.  This would be an important step to 
reducing the tax discrimination which was only increased in the 
last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we are disappointed that notwithstanding the debate 
of the last couple of weeks the government is going precisely in 
the wrong direction.  Instead of levelling the playing field, it 
is in fact increasing the inequity between these different kinds 
of families.  That is very disappointing indeed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
find it passing strange that the member for Calgary Southeast 
finds a whole range of issues with the 1998 budget but fails to 
take into account that it was the first balanced budget since 
1969-70, the first time the government had balanced the budget in 
many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the beginning of tax relief for Canadians.  It was $7 
billion of tax relief for Canadians which was also extended in 
the 1999 budget, amounting to a total of $16.5 billion in tax 
relief for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary Southeast spoke about simplifying the 
Income Tax Act.  I am sure all Canadians want to simplify the 
Income Tax Act, but the hon. member failed to indicate how he 
would simplify the Income Tax Act.  I have a suspicion that the 
way to simplify the act in his mind is the Alberta Reform 
solution, the flat tax solution.  A flat tax does not really 
comply with the progressivity of the Canadian Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it simplify things.  It simplifies things very much, but it 
means that the tax is not progressive.  Higher income Canadians 
now pay more income tax in percentage terms than lower income 
Canadians.  This seems to be an equitable way to arrange things. 
A person who makes more income pays more income tax, not only in 
absolute terms but in percentage terms.  That is called a 
progressive tax system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go to this simplified tax, yes, it would clean up a lot 
of messy details in the Income Tax Act, but I am wondering what 
it does to equity.  How fair is it when we move to a tax system 
like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another feature of the 1998 budget which the member conveniently 
forgot to mention was the Canadian opportunities strategy.  It 
provides a number of initiatives that give Canadians greater 
access to the knowledge and skills needed as we move into the 
next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also began the process of paying down the debt which had not 
been done for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite gets into a lot of the details of the Income 
Tax Act but he fails to acknowledge the very positive aspects of 
the 1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one aspect I would like to raise, and perhaps the 
member could comment on it.  He talks about the 20% foreign limit 
for RRSPs.  I think he is implying that it should be 25% or 30%. 
I am wondering why the Canadian taxpaying public should be 
subsidizing Canadians who want to invest more outside Canada. 
Should we not be saying that if Canadians want to diversify their 
portfolio and have 30% of their portfolio outside Canada, that is 
fine, but why should the tax system subsidize that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  I thank the member from Etobicoke for 
his thoughtful questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the last question, perhaps he should ask his 
Liberal colleagues on the House of Commons finance committee who 
voted to recommend that the foreign content limit be raised to 
30%.  This is not simply a Reform idea. Apparently the wisdom of 
allowing Canadians greater flexibility in the management of their 
retirement savings has even struck a chord with his own Liberal 
colleagues.  The answer to his question of why should we allow 
people to do this, it is because it is their money.  That is why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's question reflects the premise that it really 
belongs to the government and we allow Canadians to do what they 
will with their own money.  No, we start from a different premise 
which is that it is their money and they have the prior right to 
decide how to allocate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give further consideration to the private 
member's bill put forward by my colleague from Medicine Hat which 
would in fact eliminate any limit on the foreign content. But I 
would at least go so far as to adopt the recommendation of the 
House of Commons finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the purportedly balanced budget that the member 
boasts about, I remind him that that budget came about because 
75% of the deficit reduction came about because of increases in 
revenue.  Only 3% came about through real program spending cuts 
in Ottawa's own budget.  The balance was cuts to transfers to 
persons and transfers to provinces, cutting health care, raising 
taxes. That was the Liberal solution, not ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, with respect to the brilliant, historic budget 
introduced last week by Stockwell Day, the provincial treasurer 
in Alberta, I was honoured to be in that legislature when that 
budget came down.  It was day one in a common sense revolution to 
change and reform the tax system in Canada. That budget provides 
a generous exemption of $11,500 per person, or $23,000 for a 
family of two. It is not a flat tax because a family that earns 
$23,000 in income will be zero rated. They will not pay a dime in 
provincial income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Single moms are getting taxed by this government even if they 
are below the poverty line because the exemptions are so low and 
have not kept pace with inflation.  But in Alberta a couple who 
earns $23,000 under the brilliant tax reform strategy proposed by 
the Alberta government will pay zero tax.  On earnings of $46,000 
they will pay 5.5% provincial tax, but on earnings of $92,000 
they will pay 11% tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has the advantage of being both progressive and simple.  It 
has the advantage of being family friendly.  It removes the tax 
discrimination against single income families perpetuated by this 
federal government by delinking from the federal system.  At the 
same time it has the advantage of not penalizing people who are 
successful and earn more revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for bringing that to our attention 
because the Alberta tax plan is an ideal model for federal tax

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
happened to read a letter today from a lady who was talking about 
the inequities in the Canadian Income Tax Act. She made the point 
that she wanted the choice to stay at home and care for her 
children during their critical years. She also said, “If I am in 
the home, if I am in the kitchen, it is my own choice.  If I am 
pregnant, the Reform Party most assuredly had nothing to do with 
it.  If I am barefoot, however, the Liberal Party has made a 
major contribution to my condition”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to respond to this whole issue, 
particularly on the matter of the Reform proposal for an 
increased spousal equivalent that would be allowed for a 
dependent child of a single parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
that difficult question.  I have received literally hundreds of 
letters similar to the one to which the member referred which 
appeared in today's Vancouver <I>Sun</I> where she indicated that 
if she is homeless it is the Liberal Party that has made the 
contribution to her condition because of the increases in the tax 
burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill increases the inequity between single and double 
income families.  We see from this year's budget documents in 
very concrete terms how that increase happens.  The average 
differential in the taxes paid by single and double income 
families will go from 60% to 64% under this budget in large part 
because of the provisions of this bill.  It will do that by 
raising the child care expense deduction without any commensurate 
relief for single income families who provide their child care at 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was doing a talk show on a Winnipeg station last week. A lady 
called and said she was a qualified engineer who had given up her 
$70,000 a year salary to stay at home full time and care for her 
children.  She said this was a decision she and her husband had 
made because they felt it was best for their family.  She said 
she did not regret it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went on to say, “Please tell the Secretary of State for 
Multiculturalism that I gave up my entire paycheque for child 
care, not just a portion of it, not just $7,000 or $8,000 which 
is reflected in the child care expense deduction, I gave up my 
whole paycheque to finance our child care at home”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is something we ought to keep in mind.  That is why this 
parliament ought to adopt at least a refundable credit available 
to all parents, that does not discriminate against one family 
model or another, that does not pit single income families 
against double income families, but treats them all as being 
equal under the law.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for some time now 
the House has been addressing income tax, what can be done, and 
what cannot. But I think that in a debate such as this one, a 
retrospective might be necessary, to look at what is already in 
place before making any changes to the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been some years since Canada had the opportunity to have 
a royal commission into its taxation system.  One was struck in 
1962, and dubbed the Carter Commission. 
That commission was chaired by a man named Kenneth Carter. Mr. 
Carter worked for over four and a half years before putting 
forward recommendations to correct our tax system and make it 
fairer and more equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting is what happened when the Carter report was 
released. This truly was a revolutionary document on taxation. 
The recommendations on our tax system were so well thought out 
that Harvard University, in the United States, decided that this 
program could be used in industrialized countries to show how 
tax systems can be reformed so as to make them fairer and more 
equitable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, for reasons that we do not know, it was decided 
not to publish the commission's report. This was rather strange 
but, for the first time in the history of our country, the 
report of a royal commission was not published. Canadians were 
not informed of the recommendations made by these economists. 
People who might have wished to examine these recommendations to 
improve our tax system were not able to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, after the commission completed its Canadian tour, there 
seemed to be a consensus that the report was an important 
discussion paper. But this was completely ignored, until now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the royal commission now dates back more than 30 years, 
consideration was given to a number of the Carter Commission's 
findings in 1992 or 1993, I think.  While the recommendations 
made at the time still hold true today, unfortunately, once 
again, they were ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of which party is in government, the problem has 
never been faced that we need an in-depth reform before examining 
any ideas, whether a single rate of 20% or tax deductions for 
homemakers.  There is a great deal of confusion surrounding the 
Income Tax Act.  The reform must be done in detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to raise a few points to demonstrate the 
distortions that have been introduced into our system over the 
years.  From 1984 to 1988, there was about a 10% increase in the 
income tax paid by people of average income. 
That was a substantial increase. At the same time, between 1984 
and 1988, there was a barely 6% increase in the income tax paid 
by those who were better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The distortion in the income tax system for these two categories 
of taxpayers is immediately obvious.  I am giving just a few 
points.  We are aware that there are many more.  Four or five 
years ago, witnesses appearing before the Finance Committee 
indicated that there were 75 to 80 items needing correction in 
the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the examples they gave was that of people earning in 
excess of $100,000, who benefited most generously from capital 
gains exemptions.  In all, such persons had refunds of over 
$1 billion. 
Fifty one per cent of people with an income over $100,000 
benefited.  However, of those with an income of $50,000 or less, 
only 8% benefited from capital gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That shows that the richest enjoy the greatest benefits.  They 
are more likely to pay less income tax and obviously to become 
ever richer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without going into detail, I wanted just to point out a few 
things.  I have a lot here to show that, first and foremost, and 
it must be repeated, we need an in depth reform, as we had in 
1962, either through a royal commission or some other means, to 
look thoroughly at ways to correct the gaps in our system.  If 
every year only adjustments are made, we will never have a fair 
and equitable system.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over time, our fellow citizens must be convinced to tell their 
representatives that we need a global solution to the problem, 
that it is not enough to correct it one page at a time, given 
that there are over 1,400 pages in the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another matter that does not come directly under the Income Tax 
Act is the fact that we have a money policy that proved to be 
disastrous for us during the period starting in 1985.  For a 
number of years, the Bank of Canada set the interest rates at 
four percentage points, sometimes five percentage points higher 
than those in the United States.  It caused our national debt to 
grow by leaps and bounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984, our national debt was $160 billion; nine years later, 
it had reached $460 billion. The debt was increasing every year 
and the government had to collect more and more taxes to pay the 
interest on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is not simply a matter of amending minor provisions of 
the Income Tax Act. We must consider all the components of our 
national tax system. We need a comprehensive reform of our 
monetary policy, which is a critical tool for the government. 
Very few know how this policy works, or why it is in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, and I conclude on this note, the most important thing we 
can do for our fellow Canadians is to urge this government, and 
I have done it many times, to undertake a comprehensive tax 
reform. We must not merely ask for changes here and there. 
We must look at the overall picture and decide that we need 
another commission such as the one we had in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, at the time, we had followed up on that revolutionary 
document, perhaps we would have a solution to make our tax 
system as fair and equitable as possible for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, with all due respect to my colleague, this country does 
not need more studies, it needs action.  The time for studying is 
over.  We know what the problem is, as my hon. friend articulated 
very well in his short speech.  Many solutions have been brought 
forth not only in the House but by articulate individuals 
from around the country and around the world. Those solutions are 
eminently doable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had a royal commission we know what would happen.  The 
royal commission would drag on for a month of Sundays.  It would 
cost the taxpayers tens of millions of dollars and would only 
force the House to engage in another series of studies to study 
what we have already studied.  That is what we tend to do in this 
place.  Rather than act we study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my hon. colleague has a very big interest in this.  Study 
after study has shown that Canada is lacking in productivity. 
Canada's competitiveness has been dropping for many years.  What 
we need to do is drop our tax rate fairly.  We need to decrease 
the rules and regulations that choke the private sector.  We need 
to invest in those pillars of our economy that are very 
supportive and useful in getting people back to work and in 
improving the lifestyles of Canadians, pillars like research and 
development, education and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are able to do that we will build a secure economy and we 
will have a strong network of social programs to take care of 
those individuals who cannot take care of themselves, a concern 
of this hon. member and all hon. members.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The erosion of our economy does more than hurt the rich. It 
hurts primarily the poor and middle class.  The rich can go 
anywhere they want.  The poor and middle class are stuck here 
doing what they have to do.  They do not have the choice.  The 
rich have a choice, the poor do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my hon. colleague plead with finance minister to bring in 
the suggestions raised here, to lower the tax rate fairly, 
increase the minimum allowance on a personal basis, immediately 
call for rationalization of the rules and regulations, keep what 
we need, eliminate what we do not, and give Canadians the power 
to be the best they can become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we all like to hear that we 
should immediately get into action and take decisions. Most 
Canadians think, and we have repeated it here, that we have had 
enough study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, when we are dealing with something like the tax 
system we cannot do it without having profound knowledge of the 
implications for everybody.  That is why I wanted to bring up the 
idea of a royal commission like we had in the past.  Maybe we can 
go back to the Carter commission of 1967.  There was a review 
some four or five years ago that showed that scholars at Harvard 
recognized the Carter commission as a revolutionary document. 
Scandinavian countries used part of the commission's report to 
make reforms. The only country that never used any of the 
commission's recommendations was our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to what the member asked, I believe we have to 
understand the implications of our tax system.  We can go back to 
the Carter commission but we cannot immediately jump in an cut 
taxes.  Like I pointed out, the whole income tax system is flawed 
and detrimental to the middle class. We do not have to be 
economists to realize this.  That is what we have to look at and 
it requires a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned that we have a lot of people in Canada who 
are very knowledgeable.  I could name a few I have met through 
the years who came to the commission.  Quite often they tell us 
afterwards that their recommendations over the years have been 
ignored.  I believe it is not only the finance department that 
has had a monopoly on brains through the years. We have had some 
very qualified people.  I have come to know individuals like 
Pierre Fortin from Montreal.  He is one of our foremost 
economists and has written extensively.  I have discussed this 
with him on many occasions without going into any details.  I do 
not consider myself an expert, far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overall tax system has to be reformed.  That is what we have 
to realize.  Everybody would like to have lower taxes.  Everybody 
would like to see changes whereby our taxes would go down and 
they would have more disposable income.  That would give us a 
shot in the arm.  Before we can start cutting or doing this we 
have to know what the flaws are in our system.  That will not be 
easy.  There are a lot of people in this country who are very 
satisfied with the tax system.  The richest 1% would rather it 
not be touched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without going into more detail, before we can start one thing or 
another with the tax system, we have to reform it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have a question for my hon. colleague and neighbor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1962, the Carter Commission was set up.  If memory serves, 
the Prime Minister of Canada at the time was Mr. Diefenbaker. 
So the commission was created by the Progressive Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague told me this commission completed its work four 
years later when the Liberals were in power.  Is what I am now 
saying correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes.  The commission report was 
made public in 1967, four and a half years later.  It is true 
that the government changed during that time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Carter Commission made its recommendations public, it 
toured the country.  This is a rather interesting story.  Many 
people in mining and other industries had interests to protect. 
Various sectors of the economy wanted to have their say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minutes of this tour are a real mixed bag.  Everyone came to 
complain, to say what suited them best.  They did not look at 
the bigger picture of how all Canadians could be affected. 
Whether it was the oil industry, the mining industry or others, 
everybody was out to look after their own interests. There were 
a lot of pressures at the time not to do this or that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a democratic system, it is only natural for the government to 
be under pressure to do one thing or another. There were 
pressures from everywhere. The building industry even threatened 
to stop working. It feared the government might impose 
recommendations made by the Carter commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the result of all these pressures, the government more or 
less decided to take its time, let things cool down and 
gradually implement the Carter commission's recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took a number of years, but the first attempt was made by 
Allan MacEachen. In 1980, he made several recommendations. 
There was a very heated debate in the House. When later I raised 
the issue with the Hon. Allan MaEachen, I told him that the 
recommendations put forward would have been beneficial. He 
agreed. However, there were as usual so many outside pressures, 
threats to shut down entire sectors of the economy, that he 
withdrew his proposals. That is unfortunately how it went.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-72 on income 
tax amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we have missed the boat.  Once again the government 
has not dealt in a profound and fundamental way with an issue 
that is affecting Canadians across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has said in the last two weeks that Canada is 
doing fine.  Our productivity is fine.  He says this based on one 
study, the KPMG study, paid for by his government.  This flies in 
the face of every single other study, any other analysis I have 
ever seen in and outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian economy, our productivity and our competitiveness 
are among the lowest in the industrialized world.  Among all G-8 
nations we are the bottom of the barrel.  That is nothing to be 
proud of because it is far less than what we can strive for as a 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is telling the Canadian public, patting us on the 
head, “Smile, be happy.  Don't worry, we have social programs 
that will take care of you”.  What a bunch of nonsense. What a 
pile of tripe.  That is totally unacceptable.  All we need to do 
is speak to Canadians and ask what is bothering them.  Are they 
happy with the economy?  Are they happy with their job 
opportunities?  Are they happy with the opportunities their 
children have?  Most of them are not. This is not a figment of 
their imagination.  This did not appear overnight.  This is not 
something that has been happening over the last few weeks.  This 
has been happening for years and it is not getting better.  It is 
getting worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not lacking in solutions.  My colleague from the other 
side articulated a number of them.  He mentioned the problems. 
Members from the Reform Party and other parties have articulated 
solutions.  There is much that binds us together and there is 
much that is in agreement. 
What we do not have is somebody to take the bull by the horns and 
say that these are the best solutions we can find, these are the 
reasons we are going to this and, by heaven, we are going to do 
this.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This country has seen a lot of studying; it has not seen a lot 
of action.  What Canadians are sick and tired of is the malady of 
studyitis that we have in the House of Commons, an ailment that 
causes intellectual gridlock.  This whole place grinds to a halt. 
It does not function well.  It is a poor use of taxpayers' money 
and does not serve the people of this country, who elect us to do 
a job, to help them help themselves, and indeed to help those who 
cannot help themselves.  We have failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the facts.  Should we be happy with 
unemployment?  No.  Our unemployment rate is much higher than 
that of the country to the south of us.  It is much higher than 
many of the G-8 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our productivity is sliding.  It is the lowest in the G-8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our competitiveness has been dropping too.  Why?  The primary 
reason, and we all sound like broken records, is taxes. To take 
into consideration the concern that members on all sides of the 
House have, we do not want to introduce tax cuts that will 
compromise anybody, particularly the poor and middle classes.  We 
want to make sure that the people of this country, regardless of 
their income, have the power to be the best that they can become 
and the power to take care of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps a fundamental difference between ourselves and the 
traditional Liberal thinking is that we believe most Canadians 
can take care of themselves better than governments can and we 
want to give people the power to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of the coin is to make sure that Canadians who 
cannot take care of themselves have a social network that can 
provide for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank heavens we are not like the United States.  Historically 
we have had good social programs which have been there to take 
care of those who cannot take care of themselves.  However, we do 
not speak about the current threat and future threats to those 
programs.  Pensions, health care, education and welfare programs 
are all in jeopardy.  They are in jeopardy because we do not have 
a healthy economy.  We cannot have strong social programs unless 
we have a healthy economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By maintaining high tax levels, by not rationalizing the rules 
and regulations that choke off the private sector, by not keeping 
the rules that we need and removing those that we do not, we 
compromise the very essence and the ability of our economy to 
perform.  Canadians cannot provide for themselves and pay the 
taxes that will enable the government to provide the social 
programs to provide for those people who cannot provide for 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all intertwined.  The failure of this government to do 
what we and others have been telling it to do for years is an 
abrogation of its responsibility.  It is a violation of its duty, 
primarily to those people who are the most underprivileged 
individuals in our society.  It is an abrogation of its 
responsibility to the beleaguered middle class, which is having 
increasing difficulty being able to acquire the basics for 
themselves and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members like to talk about research and development. 
They want to provide money for it and we applaud that.  What is 
the single most important factor in enabling research and 
development to occur in this country?  The most important thing 
the government can do, and recent studies show this, is to give 
companies the money to do the research and development 
themselves.  They do not necessarily want government handouts, 
but they at least want the ability to do this.  The way they can 
do this is to have tax cuts, which will enable them to reinvest 
in their companies and become more competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the saddest things we often hear about is the brain 
drain.  The brain drain is a complex situation and is linked to 
many factors.  Many Canadians who go south do not want to go 
south necessarily because they will make a little more money. 
They want to go because they have the ability to work in 
companies, work in universities, work in institutions where they 
have the opportunity to put their skills to the best possible 
use.  The U.S. actually enables that to happen.  That is 
something which we in Canada need to take a cold hard look at.

after taxes and compare that to the United States.  A couple 
working in the United States makes 44% more in after tax dollars 
than the same couple in Canada.  How can we justify that?  How 
can we be competitive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Prime Minister's own pollster, Mr. Marzolini, said very 
clearly in the last month that it is the high tax rates in this 
country which choke off the ability of the Canadian economy to 
function properly.

this government which cannot be tolerated, let alone respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments will not provide money for education if they have a 
poor economy.  In my riding there are high schools in which 
students have to write exams on paper that resembles toilet 
paper.  They have had to downgrade to paper that is pathetic. 
Kids, even when they are trying to rub out their answers, rip 
right through it because schools do not have enough money to buy 
reasonable paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia students are sharing textbooks.  They do not 
even have their own textbooks.  The schools do not have the money 
to teach our students who can then become employed in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government may take comfort in saying that we have the 
social programs to provide welfare and employment insurance, but 
that is no comfort to Canadians who want to work.  Most Canadians 
do not want to be on welfare or EI, they want to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment rates we talk about do not take into 
consideration the underemployment rates we have in the country. 
There are legions of university students who come out with good 
training only to find that the job opportunities in their chosen 
fields are few to non-existent.  What kind of message are we 
sending the youth of today?  That after all their hard work they 
will end up slinging hot dogs or burgers at McDonald's?  That is 
what is happening now.  It is a waste to our economy and the 
potential of our country.  It cannot be allowed to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague spoke about the pension issue and how the Reform 
Party has put together constructive solutions to rescue our 
pensions.  The CPP will not be there for the people of my 
generation and subsequent generations because the amount of money 
that will be required to fund the CPP will simply not be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next 20 years the number of people who will be over 65 years 
of age will go from the 12% to 25%.  The number of 
people who will be working to provide the tax base to pay for the 
CPP and other social programs will simply not be there.  What do 
we do?  Will the government do what it recently did and jack up 
CPP rates almost 50%?  It certainly will not be able to do that 
in the future because at some point in time there will be a 
collapse.  We cannot continue to raise taxes and the demands on 
the individual without the system falling apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about solutions.  Let us talk about how to fix this 
system.  There is much we can do.  One thing we talked about is 
productivity.  I have spoken about tax cuts.  Let us increase the 
minimum personal exemption.  There are a number of innovative 
things we have discussed today and in previous times concerning 
education, in terms of enabling schools to have the money to do 
what they have to do to train the kids of today.  We should also 
consider innovative projects like those in Europe which link up 
the educational facilities with the private sector, enabling 
students to get work experience early on.  There are also 
innovative ways of looking at tax credits to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could consider a flat tax or a flattened tax, which has just 
been introduced in Alberta.  Rather than having the complex tax 
system we have now, by flattening it or by having a flat tax we 
could simplify the system. 
It would be a lot simpler and easier to employ.  It would save 
the individual and indeed the economy a lot of money.  The proof 
is in the pudding when we look at other countries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Nordic countries and other European countries people were 
labouring under very, very high tax rates in the 1970s and 1980s. 
For example, in the case of Sweden, its interest rates went up 
to 500% overnight.  There was a huge exodus of capital from the 
country.  Interest rates had to be jacked up to stop that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In England, the tax rates jumped to almost 90%. All the best and 
the brightest, and those with money to invest, create jobs and 
build the companies within England left. There was an economic 
collapse within England.  The people who were hurt the most were 
the poor and the middle class.  They could not get jobs any more. 
The jobs had left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the resources that were required by the government 
to provide social programs were not there.  They saw the collapse 
of their health institutions.  Many people suffered needlessly as 
a result of the high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nordic countries got smart; a lot smarter then we are.  They 
lowered their tax rates and simplified their tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened?  England is a lion in Europe and indeed in 
the world in terms of not only its economic performance, but more 
important, the health and welfare of its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Nordic countries we have seen something similar 
happening.  The socialist mentality that was embedded within 
those countries, which said that the government would be there to 
take care of its people, is gradually being eroded.  People are 
now beginning to provide for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is ending the culture of dependence that was ingrained into 
that society; a culture of dependence that, sadly, is becoming 
more ingrained in our society.  That is lethal for any economy 
and worse for the health and welfare of citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the basic personal income tax exemption, there 
is no reason, as the hon. member opposite mentioned, the 
government could not do that tomorrow.  The government could 
bring a bill to the House.  It could do it by order in council, 
which is what it does 80% of the time on important decisions. 
Cabinet just says “We are going to do this” and it is done.  It 
does not come to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty per cent of the decisions to be made are brought to the 
House.  Unfortunately, most of them are about as essential to the 
workings of this country as a healthy dose of pabulum.  It does a 
huge disservice to the collective ability of members to bring 
what they can to the debate in a meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many people in this House from all political parties 
who have an extraordinary amount of experience, intelligence and 
energy to bring to important debates, if the Prime Minister and 
his friends in the PMO would only allow that to happen.  The 
issue of democracy in this country and the lack thereof is 
perhaps best spoken about in another very interesting debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the child care tax deduction, why do we not 
treat families equally, those who choose to have one parent stay 
at home to care for the children and those who choose to have 
both parents work?  Why do we not have equity in the tax system? 
There is no reason that cannot happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I send this message to the government members who have spoken in 
a disparaging way about parents who choose to stay at home to 
care for their children.  There is no more valuable job in this 
country than a parent who stays at home to care for their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only the most valuable job, I would submit that it is 
the most difficult job.  I would not want to trade places with 
those parents who stay at home to do the very difficult job of 
bringing up children in the society we live in today, but it is 
essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been medical studies and analyses done around the 
world.  The Minister of Labour will attest to this because of the 
hard work which she and her husband have done on the head start 
program in Moncton.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of a parent on the development of a child 
particularly in the first eight years of life is unparalleled. 
The positive and negative impact that can have is unlike anything 
else that can take place in the development of that child toward 
becoming an adolescent and after that an adult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The positive impact of loving, caring parents in the development 
of children through providing a secure environment and the basic 
needs is far more important than any money they may have in their 
pockets.  It is far more important than any material goods that 
can be given to children.  Parents staying home and doing that 
are not only contributing to society in the most valuable way 
possible but they are contributing to the development of children 
in a way that nothing else can compare to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point is on pensions.  Our party has put forth 
constructive solutions to have super RRSPs, to increase the 
amounts Canadians are allowed to invest in their RRSPs. Certainly 
the CPP will not be there for them.  Why the government does not 
give Canadians an opportunity to take care of themselves is 
beyond me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have super RRSPs and increase the amounts Canadians can 
invest in markets outside Canada, if we enable people to invest 
in their own health and welfare and give them the tools to take 
care of themselves, that is the greatest gift we can give to 
Canadians.  By doing that there will be more money to provide for 
those people who are poor and middle class who cannot take care 
of themselves. The solutions are out there.  We do not need more 
studies, we need action.  I challenge the government to take up 
that challenge today and to act now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try to be as brief as 
possible.  I know the hon. member had a number of things to say 
but I draw him back to the 1999 Reform budget plan which talks 
about what the opposition would propose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform plan does not include any economic prudence.  It 
talks about surpluses of $30 billion to $35 billion.  It talks 
about average GDP growth over the next three years of 5.5%, 
almost two times the private sector.  Reformers want to cut taxes 
by $9 billion a year.  They want to reduce the debt by $9 
billion. They want to cut EI premiums by $7 billion for a total 
bill of $25 billion. It is very important that Reformers tell 
Canadians and certainly members of the House how they would 
finance it.  We would go back into deficit.  What would they cut? 
Is it health care?  Is it research?  Is it education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we built budgets the way the Reform Party did we would have— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the proof in the pudding 
is looking at the real world.  If we look at provinces that have 
cut taxes like Alberta and Ontario, we see booming economies.  If 
we look at my province of British Columbia which is running a 
$500 million deficit and has the highest tax rates in the 
country, do we see a good economy?  We see a province that is the 
worst place to do business in North America.  That is not 
success, that is failure.  If we want to listen to success, I 
implore the hon. member to look at the Reform budget, cut taxes 
and enable to our economy to be the best it can become.

that to mean Calgary West.  Calgary is a grand city.  I would be 
proud to be of any of the ridings in the city of Calgary.  My 
seatmate, the hon. member for Crowfoot, had a question.  He has a 
constituent who earns $11,600 a year, not a large sum of money. 
Of that $11,600 this individual pays $700 in taxes, $800 in other 
deductions and $130 on income from interest on an inheritance 
system that constituent will be getting as part of a pension.

thinks that type of Liberal taxation and Liberal fairness is 
justice in taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is called robbing the 
poor to pay the government. That is what that is all about.  How 
anyone lives on $11,600 is beyond me.  All of us in the House 
have constituents who are in the same boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had constituents who are pensioners who come to me with 
their income tax forms and say “Look at this.  I am making 
$20,000 a year and the government is making me pay thousands of 
dollars of income tax.  How can I and my wife survive on this?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not a question for me to answer. That is a question on

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague from the Reform Party said earlier that what we need 
is action, not more studies. I will point out to him that, 
sometimes, a good understanding of what is going on can help us 
be more coherent in our actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Carter commission of 1962 was mentioned earlier. We heard 
that it was an exemplary commission whose recommendations were 
not followed up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be good to see where this is all coming from. It has been 
proven that in some countries, including Canada, the tax system 
is no longer progressive. 
It is no longer true that the poorer you are, the less tax you 
pay, and vice versa. Middle class Canadians do pay a great 
amount of tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a study released in 1994, Mr. Mimoto, an economist, said, 
with regard to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the member, but his time is 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned something that is extremely important. 
He is talking about studies. We need to study something when we 
do not know what the answer is.  There is a warehouse of studies 
somewhere on the Hill collecting dust.  We spend millions and 
millions of dollars on studies.  As the hon. member mentioned, we 
do not use them. They get tossed on a shelf to collect dust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are oodles of studies done by the House, done outside the 
House, done outside the country.  We do not need more studies. 
We need action.  We do not get action

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the opportunity to ask him a 
question and to wish him well in his upcoming leadership 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member completely with respect to the 
importance of a fairer tax system.  I want to ask a very 
straightforward question.  Under the proposed budget changes of 
the Liberal government a millionaire will receive a tax cut of 
$8,000 this year.  A single mother with two children living in 
Metrotown in my community struggling to get by on welfare will 
receive not a penny.  Under Reform taxation policies that same 
millionaire who gets $8,000 from Liberals would get $70,000 in 
Reform Party tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the fairness?  Where is the justice when under Reform 
Party tax proposals a millionaire gets a $70,000 tax cut and a 
single mom in Esquimalt or in Metrotown, Burnaby gets not a 
penny? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is simply not true. 
The Reform Party's budget plan would take over 200,000 of the 
poorest Canadians right off the tax rolls. They would not pay a 
penny of tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are equally appalled by any kind of changes to the tax system 
which preferentially give tax breaks to the rich and not to the 
poor.  What we support is that the poor and middle class in 
particular get the tax breaks they need.  Our proposal explicitly 
states how we would get 200,000 of the poorest people to pay no 
tax at all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to becoming a politician the member was a family 
physician.  Therefore he most definitely knows what he is talking 
about.  When he says something like that I think we should all 
listen and whenever we can we should encourage parents to stay at 
home to raise their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That is a pretty nice comment.  I would say 
thank you and then go to the next person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, these are words of wisdom. 
He is absolutely right.   What we need is a fair tax system that 
enables parents to have the choice to stay home rather than 
penalizing them for staying at home, which is what is happening 
now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
put a little different slant on the last two speakers.  My 
colleague from Prince Albert seems to have bought into what the 
member from Esquimalt said so passionately, that it is far better 
for a parent to look after the children at home and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether that does not have something to do with the 
parent's abilities.  The member did say the positive impact of a 
loving parent, which helps a little.  There are societies that 
believe care given by appropriate caregivers to allow both 
parents to work or do what they like and need to do is a good 
idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer the member to kibbutzim in Israel which do a wonderful 
job of raising children.  I think they have a very simple answer 
to a complex question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, children need a loving and 
caring environment to grow up in.  The best person to provide 
that is a competent parent.  What the Reform Party is trying to 
do is give families the choice and not penalize them for staying 
at home.  Whichever way we cut this, a loving, caring and 
competent parent is the best person to take care of the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at 
the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for 
Acadie—Bathurst, employment insurance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if anybody 
needs any information on kibbutzim, the hon. Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration worked on a kibbutz for a number of 
years before coming to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to focus the debate somewhat.  It would be fair 
for me to say that the biggest cohort in the House is the class 
of 1993.  When the Liberals formed the government at that time it 
is important to remember what our position was as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the previous nine years the debt grew from $208 billion 
to $508 billion under the Progressive Conservatives and we had a 
record annual deficit of $42 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, 11.4% of Canadians were unemployed and we were told by 
the former Tory prime minister that we should not expect anything 
below 10% before the year 2000.  Although it is still much too 
high, the number right now is 7.8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 employment insurance premiums were scheduled to rise to 
$3.30.  Since then we have lowered them each and every year.  We 
are now at $2.55 for every $100 earned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our nation was falling into self-doubt and we were an economic 
basket case among western countries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that we now have back to back balanced budgets 
for the first time in almost half a century.  As we have 
recovered the fiscal integrity of our nation we must thank all 
Canadians for their support in this effort.  We must also 
recognize and commend the leadership of the Minister of Finance 
and the Prime Minister in this effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would have believed that this day would come?  In order to 
complete this first stage of the recovery plan and balancing the 
budget we pursued a balanced program of a reduction in spending, 
reducing transfer payments to the provinces and growing the 
economy.  The decisions made and the actions taken were not easy 
for anyone, but they worked.  We can once again look to the 
future with optimism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governing is about bettering the lives of Canadians and 
improving their standard of living.  It is building today to 
ensure for a better tomorrow.  In order to do this and do it well 
we as a government cannot work alone so we enlist the input of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal concern of Canadians and Ontarians across the 
country is health care.  We are making the largest single 
investment of the government in health care.  Under the budget 
provinces will receive an additional $11.5 billion in transfers 
for health care over the next five years.  My province of Ontario 
gets an additional $4.4 billion of that for a total of 38.2%. 
This investment will bring the health component of the Canada 
health and social transfer to the level it was before the 1990 
cutbacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we are removing the equalization cap on British 
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario and moving to a per capita 
entitlement for equalization payments, Ontario will receive an 
additional $900 million in transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is a priority for Canadians and continues to be for 
the government.  As the Minister of Health has said, and I am 
paraphrasing, we must strive for a people centred system, one 
that stresses transparency, sharing of information and the right 
provider giving the right care at the right time in the right 
place at a reasonable cost to taxpayers.  This increasingly means 
innovative ideas and the use of the newest technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Kitchener—Waterloo is well known for innovation 
and research.  The budget has tremendous gains in this area, both 
in health specific research and research in general.  I have just 
spoken of the health research initiatives as a cornerstone of the 
budget and will now continue to discuss other forms of research, 
an issue near and dear to me and the people of 
Kitchener—Waterloo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to have contributed to this process through the 
post-secondary caucus of the Liberal Party.  I was one of the 
original members, along with the hon. member for Peterborough and 
Dr. John English, the former member for Kitchener who has now 
returned to teaching at the University of Waterloo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our universities are very pleased with the budget.  Bob 
Rosehart, president of Wilfrid Laurier University, stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus on health in Federal Budget '99 was great news for all 
Canadians.  The enhanced health research opportunities presented 
to all universities...and the increased funding to the granting 
councils was great news.  Obviously the federal government has 
been listening to the universities and WLU looks forward to 
participating in these new initiatives. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments from the University of Waterloo were much the same. 
I am very glad to be able to say that the Kitchener—Waterloo 
area is very well served by the budget and by the government. 
Having worked with the post-secondary education and research 
community for a long time I knew that our caucus would help them 
in putting their message across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the consultations before the last budget the post-secondary 
education caucus helped to ensure that the future of 
post-secondary institutions and hundreds of thousands of students 
was given high priority.  As a result, the last budget was good 
news for post-secondary education.  This year it continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the budget works.  The people had an influence on 
its preparation through public opinion polling and through 
different caucuses and committees.  Canadians are working hard to 
better themselves and improve their prospects.  In so doing they 
are enhancing Canada's economic strength and furthering Canada's 
future prospects, enabling us as a nation to compete successfully 
in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research and development are crucial to the economic well-being 
as we compete in the new economy.  It is more imperative now as 
we are undergoing an information technology revolution and has a 
greater impact on jobs than the industrial revolution.

manufacturing community and an insurance centre.  Now its 
manufacturing sector is reduced and it specializes in higher 
education and high tech and is still an insurance centre.  Under 
this new budget there is an increase in funding for research and 
research infrastructure that will be of great benefit to my 
riding, to my province and to my country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This increase in funding includes another $15 million over three 
years for the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy increases our ability to 
achieve our goals by giving every Canadian better access to 
knowledge and skills.  The 1999 budget builds on this strategy by 
investing more than $1.8 billion for this year and the next three 
years.  This funding will go toward knowledge:  creating 
knowledge, disseminating knowledge, commercializing knowledge and 
hence supporting employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy includes Canadian millennium 
scholarships averaging $3,000 a year up to $15,000 in total for 
four years; Canada study grants averaging $2,225 per year to help 
students with the greatest need; support for advanced research as 
detailed earlier; and tax relief for interest on student loans in 
the Canada student loan interest relief.  The strategy also 
encourages families to save for their children's education 
through the Canada education savings grant announced last year. 
The government contributes to RESPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada opportunities strategy helps to disseminate knowledge 
across the country through SchoolNet, a program to connect every 
high school and library to the Internet before the millennium. It 
is due to be completed by March 31, 1999.  The community access 
program will connect 10,000 rural and urban communities in two 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that my community of Kitchener—Waterloo is 
part of the new economy.  As Canada moves forward into the 
knowledge based economy of the present and the future, we will 
have a budget that helps us as a nation to prepare for that.  We 
have many challenges before us as Canadians.  I think the budget 
helps us in that direction.

Speaker, it was a pleasure to be in the member's riding this week 
and to talk to some of his constituents.  They are telling a very 
different story than the picture he just finished painting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke with students at Wilfred Laurier on Tuesday and I spoke 
to others throughout his community.  I can indicate what they are 
saying about the government's actions, its high taxes, its high 
debt, and the slash and burn approach that it has taken to health 
care. It added $11.5 billion to health care, which did not make 
up for the $20 billion that it slashed and burned from health 
care. They are not happy about that situation.  Individuals in 
the member's community are not singing the same praises of the 
government.  In fact, they have hard questions for the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard today in question period the Minister of Industry talk 
about the falling standard of living.  The member was singing the 
praises of the standard of living as though it was improving in 
his riding.  The minister counteracted that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member a very specific question.  How 
can he justify saying that the standard of living is improving in 
his community when his own Minister of Industry is saying that 
there is a fall in the standard of living of up to $7,000 for 
Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is 
welcome any time to come to my riding and see a community that 
actually works. 
If he actually talked to the people and listened to what they had 
to say, the hon. member would understand why Reform support keeps 
dropping and dropping from election to election.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say to the member very specifically how the quality of 
life has improved in my community because of the government. 
First, fewer people are unemployed.  We have one of the lowest 
unemployment rates in the country.  It is below 6%.  If the hon. 
member looked around my community and studied what makes my 
community tick, he would recognize that we made the 
transformation from an old economy to a new economy.  Previous 
governments had the foresight to make the necessary investments 
that are well represented by the University of Waterloo, Sir 
Wilfrid Laurier University and Conestoga College.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to what my hon. colleague had to say, and I really had 
the feeling he was from another planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you some figures: in 1995, the total poverty rate 
reached 17.4%. The number of Canadians living in poverty had 
increased to over 5 million. The poverty rate for Canadian 
families was at 14%, or more than 1 million families. The poverty 
rate for single Canadians was 36%. The poverty rate for single 
mothers under 65, with children under 18, was 57%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague just told us that his riding was heaven on 
earth. Good for him, but he should come to my riding of 
Matapédia—Matane and listen to what my constituents have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him a question. What would he say to my 
constituents? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker, too many Canadians 
are poor.  Certainly nobody in the House takes any joy in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to coming to parliament I used to work with an 
organization called Youth in Conflict with the Law.  Many of the 
people we worked with were before the courts due to poverty and 
lack of opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said in my speech was that the situation is Canada has 
improved greatly since 1993.  All members of the House must work 
together to make sure that trend continues.  Child poverty is 
very much an important concern of the government.  If he examines 
the budgets over the last number of years, he will see we have 
spent $2 billion to fight in that endeavour.  We will continue to 
do more. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know 
the hon. parliamentary secretary across the way has two 
universities in his riding, Waterloo and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visit campuses across the country and talk to students. I know 
his campuses are no different from the others.  Students have a 
problem finding jobs when they get out.  They face high taxes. 
They have student debt loads.  Many of them are reconsidering 
whether or not they want to remain Canadians or go to the United 
States to find work.  I know of computer programmers, doctors and 
nurses who are leaving this country. They get an education here 
but because of tax differentials they go down to the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the member across the way likes to brag about low 
unemployment in his riding, is it because so many of the young 
people out of his universities find employment elsewhere in that 
the tax advantages are so much better in the States than they are 
in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I invite the hon. member 
back to my riding—I know he has been there before—to continue 
his study into what makes a community click. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about nurses leaving the country.  In the case of the 
province of Ontario many nurses have left the country.  It has 
everything to do with the fact that the provincial government, 
with which those members are so pleased, has fired 10,000 nurses. 
The government flips and flops and is trying to hire them back, 
bring them back from the United States.  Poor planning.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be very clear.  For the most part, people who come out of 
Sir Wilfrid Laurier University go to very well paying jobs. Let 
me also inform the member that the Conestoga graduates have the 
highest employment rate of people going to community colleges in 
the province of Ontario.  I am sure the member opposite would 
like to applaud that. The ranking was recently done and I believe 
it is at 94%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When criticizing things, sometimes we hear mention of a glass of

25% empty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for St. Albert.  Is the hon. 
member going to split his time? 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do 
not think so but I will not take up the full amount of my time as 
I have another commitment I have to go to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise on Bill C-72, a bill which makes amendments 
to the Income Tax Act, perhaps not to raise taxes but to ensure 
the Minister of Finance collects all the money he feels he needs. 
I want to give a few highlights that were really not brought out 
clearly in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at the budget plan 1999, page 55.  A table points 
out anticipated revenues for the year 2000-01 are $159.5 billion. 
Back at the time when this government took office, revenues were 
about $123 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time the government has been here and the time I have 
been here, we have seen a $37 billion increase in the amount of 
money the government collects from Canadian taxpayers. There are 
only 30 million people in Canada, including babies and babies are 
not paying tax.  I know the government would like them to pay 
tax, but not yet, give them a few years.  It works out to over 
$1,200 or $1,300 more that the government is collecting from 
every Canadian than it did when it took office five years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the type of thing Canadians do not realize as we hear 
these wonderful statements about a balanced budget and how the 
government has done marvellous things.  I do not think it is a 
marvellous thing that the government has taken all this extra 
money straight out of the pockets of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has told us how much it has brought program 
spending down and kept it under control.  Again, looking at the 
same table on page 55, from 1997-98 to 2000-01 the government is 
projecting a $5 billion increase in program spending.  Away it 
goes.  As soon as the budget is balanced, let the money flow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public debt is paramount in people's minds.  Canadians know we 
are in debt.  It is time the debt was brought down.  Not one 
penny change is being proposed.  By 2001 the debt will remain at 
$580 billion.  Today it is at $580 billion.  The government does 
not have the slightest intention of repaying any of the debt that 
the Liberals and the Tory party accumulated over 30 years and 
hung around the necks of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the things we need to bring out.  We have to let 
Canadians know it was not the government that balanced the 
budget.  Canadians through extra taxes balanced the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the budget plan 1999 and personal income taxes on 
page 61.  What is happening to personal income taxes?  The 
government says it is going to cut them.  Personal income tax for 
1997-98 was $70.8 billion.  For 2001 it is projected to rise to 
$76.2 billion.  That is almost a $6 billion increase in personal 
income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going to happen with the hated GST?  Look at the same 
table.  The goods and services tax at $19.5 billion is going to 
rise to $22.4 billion. 
Another $3 billion squeezed out of the pockets of the taxpayers 
on top of the $6 billion. It is not much wonder the Minister of 
Finance is awash with cash.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else is there?  It says that employment insurance benefits 
will rise.  The announcement I heard today by, I think it was the 
leader of the NDP, suggested the EI benefits were going down, not 
going up.  As the Minister of Finance is awash with cash, he is 
cutting back on the payments to those who most need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there are the public debt charges.  The interest we 
pay on this huge $580 billion debt, is projected to rise from 
almost $41 billion to over $43 billion. The sum of $43 billion a 
year means for example that we could multiply by four the cheques 
we send out to people on employment insurance.  Or we could 
double the amount of Canada pension plan payments.  Or we could 
cut income taxes by more than $1,000 per Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That $40 billion is hanging around our necks.  It is a noose 
strangling the productivity and the standard of living of 
Canadians.  That is the legacy of the government and its 
predecessor.  That is why the Reform Party is here.  That is why 
we are saying lower taxes.  That is why we are saying fairer 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard earlier from the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, a 
medical doctor, a physician who dealt with the sick every day 
before he was elected.  He told us that in his professional 
opinion, stay at home parents provided the most valuable of 
services to Canadians, to our young families and our next 
generation, by providing the nurture, the love and support for 
the most vulnerable of our people. Yet the Minister of Finance 
and the government find that they have to penalize people who 
want to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard it said so often that two income families have to 
work whereas a single income family does not have work, that one 
can provide enough money anyway.  Let me relate a little incident 
which happened when I was going back to my riding. Going through 
the Ottawa airport, the security guard who checks the baggage and 
ensures that our flights are safe noticed my member of parliament 
pin. He stopped me and said, “I only make $23,000 on this job. 
My wife and I have three children but my wife is a stay at home 
parent because it is important for us that my wife raises our 
three kids”.  There he was with a $23,000 family income and 
getting no assistance whatsoever from the Minister of Finance, 
absolutely none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is someone who is absolutely dedicated and committed to 
his family, someone who is obviously making great sacrifices 
financially for his family.  No doubt as a family they are 
providing the nurture and the love to raise their kids to the 
best of their ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the types of things the Minister of Finance does not 
tell us too much about.  Another thing is he is salting some 
money away for the next few years after the millennium.  Right 
after the millennium we might have an election and it seems that 
the two might coincide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Minister of Finance doing? For example, last year he 
took $2.5 billion, charged it against the public accounts and 
said, “I am not going to spend this money now, I am going to 
spend it after the millennium as a millennium scholarship fund. I 
am going to have $2.5 billion to spend on students after the 
millennium”. While students are crying and trying to pay for 
their tuition today, last year the Minister of Finance tucked 
$2.5 billion into a bank account. It is sitting there gathering 
interest and he is not spending a penny of it until after the 
millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget he announced $3.5 billion that he will charge 
to the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999, a couple of weeks from 
now.  The provinces can draw that down over the next few years to 
pay for their health care. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just those two items alone add up to $6 billion which he has 
charged against the public accounts.  And he has not spent a 
penny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, the year before there was $800 million for the 
centre for innovation. The auditor general tripped him up saying 
the finance minister could not do that but he said yes he would 
anyway.  They had a little spat.  The auditor general called him 
to account for it, the same way he called him to account on the 
millennium scholarship fund. There is another $800 million that 
the Minister of Finance tucked away two years ago and the money 
has yet to be spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are up to almost $7 billion that the Minister of Finance has 
prepaid.  He has the money sitting in bank accounts. It will be 
after the millennium before Canadians see the benefit of this. In 
the meantime he says, “All I have got is a balanced budget.  I 
cannot give you tax relief like you expect tax relief.  I cannot 
show a surplus”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does he not show a surplus?  Because he is tucking this 
money away in other bank accounts and not spending it until he 
feels it is appropriate for his particular agenda. We can only 
speculate what his agenda may be.  May be it is for the 
leadership.  It could be for the next election.  Who knows? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is Canadians are paying.  They could have tax relief. 
They could have more money spent on health care this year.  They 
could have more money spent to help young kids with their tuition 
this year, but the Minister of Finance said, “While you have 
paid for it, you are not going to get the benefit until later”, 
until it suits his agenda to give it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the type of smoke and mirrors we are getting from the 
Minister of Finance.  While he makes these wonderful magnanimous 
statements about how well he is doing, let us remember that the 
budget has been balanced on the backs of Canadians. There is a 
surplus that the finance minister has hidden away, $7 billion in 
total so far, that could be spent on Canadians or to provide tax 
relief which we have not seen. People need to know that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the critique of the member for St. Albert.  It 
reminds me of the difficulty the Reform Party seems to have with 
how government revenues are generated. It is a fairly simple 
phenomenon that as the economy grows and expands, which Canada's 
economy has been doing with great strength, and as new jobs are 
created, which has been happening in Canada with more than 1.4 
million new jobs since 1993, there is more income in the economy 
and more income taxes are payable.  It is a sign of a good 
economy.  It is not the sign of a bad economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members opposite seem to be challenged with this very simple 
concept.  I want to remind the House that gross tax revenues are 
up because the economy is growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to briefly comment on one item and perhaps the 
member opposite could answer.  The member for St. Albert was in 
Australia recently attending a conference on budget cutting and 
expenditure reduction.  Given the fact that our expenditure to 
GDP is the lowest in about 30 or 40 years, what new ideas did he 
come away with after his visit to that jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to answer the member's 
first point about lower unemployment, the Minister of Finance in 
budget plan 1999 on page 64 projects that employment insurance 
benefit payments will rise from $11.8 billion to $13.8 billion by 
2000-01, an extra $2 billion for employment insurance payments. 
I do not think the government is looking for reductions in 
unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting to his other point, when I was talking to the senior 
officials in the treasuries of Australia and New Zealand, I found 
that they have a policy of focused program spending.  They are 
into what we call accrual accounting, double entry accounting and 
budgeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government made a commitment in 1989 to get into 
accrual accounting.  It is going to be 2004 before we get there. 
It will have been 15 years before it gets there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, for lack of clear, precise guidelines on how we 
spend the money we have wasted billions.  That is what I learned. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
really want to commend my hon. colleague for the lucid way in 
which he projected forward and indicated clearly on what basis 
the budget was really put into a balanced position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give him the opportunity to correct the hon. 
member opposite who seemed to indicate that the only way revenue 
increased in Canada was simply because the GDP was rising, the 
economy was generally healthy and therefore obviously the 
revenues would increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member earlier forgot to hear my hon. colleague 
say had to do with the income the individual taxpayer in Canada 
had to pay.  It is not as a result of the GDP but simply because 
the tax burden of each individual taxpayer has been increased. 
The accumulated effect of that has been to increase the revenue 
and to say for sure that the balanced budget is as a result of 
payments by Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, he is perfectly correct. 
The increase of $37 billion in tax revenue came from Canadians. 
There was virtually no real increase in our population.  That 
works out to $1,300 to $1,400 per Canadian paid to the Minister 
of Finance and this government.  Canadians balanced the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not care if he says it is because they went to work or 
whatever methodology or rationale he uses, the point is Canadians 
are paying a lot more.  The Minister of Finance is hiding 
surpluses and could provide more tax relief now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague talked about some of the ways the government is raising 
funds now and some of the ways it is spending it. Does he think 
that corporate welfare, waste, patronage, dumb blonde joke books, 
the canoe hall of fame, crown corporations, Senate budget 
increases or section 745 appeals are a good way to spend taxpayer 
dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the member for Calgary 
West just pointed out, there is absolutely no end to the 
innovative ways the government gets to spend money.  It just 
seems to keep on doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in Australia and New Zealand I found that they, 
because New Zealand hit the wall and we almost hit the wall too, 
had to focus their government spending and ensure that every 
penny they spent was productive, focused and provided a benefit 
for their citizens.  On that basis, they created accrual 
accounting, balance sheets, clear results and focused spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis, if we were to apply the same rigour and 
discipline to our spending, I am sure tens of billions of dollars 
could be shaved from the government's spending with no real 
impact on the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has taken 15 years from the time it made the decision in 1989 
to move this way and 2004 before it is to implement phase I.  It 
will be 2025 before it gets it finished perhaps if it is still in 
office.  Of course it will be long gone by then.  The point is 
that every day we waste is money wasted too. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, once 
again that famous question gets asked. Why are we here?  What are 
we doing?  We are here to debate Bill C-72, an act to amend the 
Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right there there has to be a problem.  Every time the 
government has amended the Income Tax Act, take hold of your 
wallet because something funny is about to happen.  It is about 
to get lighter.  I can tell the House about all the ways our 
wallets have become lighter as a result of this government.  It 
is wonderful at finding ways to lighten the Canadian taxpayer's 
wallet.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First it was life insurance premiums the government went after. 
It lightened our wallets to the tune of $210 million last year. 
That is a lot of lightening.  It is not only last year, it 
started off with $120 million in 1994.  Add it all up and there 
has been over $1 billion worth of wallet lightening.  That is a 
lot of lightening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it went after lifetime capital gains exemptions.  It did a 
lot lightening there.  Just this last year it lightened our 
wallets again by $340 million.  Then it did income testing for 
age credits implementation.  That was another $300 million.  Then 
there were the deductions with regard to meals. It got rid of 
that.  It changed the definition of income once again, like it is 
doing today with Bill C-72.  It has lightened our wallets by $275 
million.  Forget calling it lightening of the wallet, it took 
$275 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then corporations' tax rate increased.  It took $160 million and 
killed some jobs in the meantime.  Then it went ahead with a 
corporate surtax and that increased.  That was another $120 
million.  It killed some more jobs.  That is something this 
government is good at.  It is good at lightening the wallet and 
killing a few jobs along the way. Then it came in with a tax on 
gasoline.  It took another $500 million.  Then there was the tax 
on tobacco.  It cannot forget that one.  That was another $65 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the pensions?  The government went after that.  That 
was another $10 million.  That was just on foreign pensions. Then 
it went after RRSP withdrawals and took out $45 million.  It 
changed the time when people could put into it. Then look at EI 
premiums, part time workers, people who cannot collect on EI 
because they are not full time but they are paying in. It is a 
tax.  If they cannot collect on it and they are paying in it is 
called a tax.  In this last year it has been $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at these numbers it is ludicrous.  In 1994 it was 
$370 million.  In 1995 it was $808 million.  The year after that 
it went to $1.15 billion.  Add all these things up cumulatively. 
Then look at the bracket creep.  The Liberals have raised taxes 
by billions upon billions of dollars.  Any time I see Liberals 
talk about amending the Income Tax Act I reach for my wallet and 
I hold it dearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go on to a few other things these Liberals have been up 
to.  Let us talk about priorities.  They are increasing taxes. 
Liberals know how to do that better than anybody.  I do not doubt 
that.  Of any of the parties in the House the Liberals know how 
to whack at taxes better than anybody around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask ourselves what they do with all this money.  They raise 
our taxes, these Liberals, these people with these grand 
priorities, these big government schemes, these tax and spenders. 
What do they spend it on?  They discriminate against single 
income families.  That is what they do.  They give money out in 
corporate welfare, profitable businesses.  They give out 
subsidies.  They give out grants.  They give out tax concessions. 
Shame on them.  None of the competitors for those industries 
want to see them get a break and get subsidized by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the waste.  My goodness, I was in the human 
resources development committee and a departmental official came 
into that committee.  The departmental official said there was 
$200 million they were not going to use in a budgetary envelope. 
All the Liberals across the way got glum.  The Reform Party asked 
if the departmental officials said there was no use for the 
money, why not take it out of the budgetary envelope.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the Liberals lined up like little duckies in a row.  They 
said “It is a ministerial document.  If the minister said this 
was okay, we will not challenge the minister.  The minister is 
all knowing.  The minister is all intelligent.  The minister must 
know what is going on”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $200 million the departmental official said they would not 
use got used.  Wow, the waste.  Then I look at the patronage. 
When I have people come into my riding office and tell me about 
OAS clawbacks, when they tell me about being taxed on the money 
they are setting aside for their children's educations, I have to 
tell them the Liberals have a higher priority on patronage. 
Shame on the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is insulting.  This is above and beyond.  It goes beyond 
the pale, that they would fund a book on dumb blonde jokes.  I 
see a couple of blonde heads across the aisle.  I wonder how they 
feel about that.  I see a couple of female MPs opposite.  I 
wonder what they think about the dumb blonde joke books their 
government funds.  I wonder whether they think that is a good 
expenditure. Shame on them, and they do not even speak up about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I look at the canoe hall of fame in the Prime Minister's 
riding.  By what stretch of the imagination is a canoe hall of 
fame in the Prime Minister's riding more important than seniors 
pensions or more important than health care or more important 
than education?  A person has to stretch pretty darn far to come 
up with that type of Liberal logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the subsidies they give to bad governments.  I am 
talking about some of the things they do with foreign aid around 
this place.  What do they do?  They look at people like Mobutu in 
Zaire.  They gave money to this person who is well known for bad 
government, for corruption and bad policies. They help to fund 
weaponry and genocide and all the rest of these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals love giving money overseas.  I do not know by what 
logic they do that when they have taxpayers at home who are 
crying for tax cuts and crying for services they have been 
cutting back for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are funding roads overseas and yet we have problems with 
roads in Canada.  What a joke in the transportation committee. 
We are studying intelligent transportation systems.  How about 
the cracks in the highways?  Never mind intelligent 
transportation. Get the noodle working on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about crown corporations?  We are giving money to CBC TV. 
Why?  The unions are killing it anyway.  What are we doing?  The 
unions will finish off that company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I look at Canada Post competing in e-mail with the private 
sector, competing in couriers with companies like FedEx and UPS, 
cutting out from competition companies like T2P overnight in 
Calgary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we doing taking taxpayer dollars to subsidize 
businesses to put other people out of the play in the 
marketplace?  Shame on the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are funding Senate budget increases, an unelected, 
unaccountable body with people who do not show up for work, with 
criminal records, violating the law and the Constitution.  Yet 
they are giving them budget increases of 16% over two years. That 
is where our hard earned tax dollars are going, to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at section 745.  Each appeal under section 745 is costing 
us on average $500,000.  Clifford Olson's appeal cost us over $1 
million.  That is where the money is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all those tax increases the Liberals are bringing down, 
every time they feel people's wallets and bring in amendments and 
redefine what income means, watch out because this is the type of 
stuff they are spending it on.  That is a crying shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be better to burn that money than give it to the 
Liberals. They use it against taxpayers. They fund the 
competition.  They put in worse legislation that works against 
people.  That is what they are doing. 
It would be better to take that money and burn it than to give it 
to a government which mismanages it and uses it against the 
taxpayer.  It would be better if it were buried.  That is the 
type of thing we have going on here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order.  I think you would find unanimous 
consent for the following motion.  I move:

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That notwithstanding any standing order and the usual practices

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
S-20, an act to amend the act of incorporation of the Roman 
Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Mackenzie, be read the second 
time and, by unanimous consent, referred to committee of the 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to 
Bill S-20.  By way of background, the corporation of Mackenzie 
was created in 1913 by an act of parliament.  The corporation 
takes in 38 Roman Catholic churches in the Northwest Territories, 
northern Alberta and Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1913 the vicar and eventually the bishop have continued to 
serve the social as well as the spiritual needs of Canada's 
northern peoples.  The presence of the Catholic church in the 
western Arctic for over a century has contributed a visible and 
important presence in the Canadian north that has significantly 
served Canada's Arctic sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1913 when the act of parliament was passed sections 4 and 6 
placed certain restrictions upon the corporation including 
limiting the value of the property and assets of the corporation 
to $50,000 and the length of time the corporation may own land. 
These limitations were no doubt at the time sensible and 
appropriate.  In the decades since that time, however, the 
corporation has invested wisely and has received considerable 
support from various benefactors resulting in holdings in today's 
market which are considerably more than the legislated limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to the continuing work of the corporation and 
the financial well-being of the diocese that the limits upon its 
holdings be removed so it may continue with its worthwhile 
service to the northern community.  I am pleased that Bill S-20 
will bring the act into line with the modern reality of the 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a proposed technical amendment to the French name 
of the corporation.  The amendment to the French name of the 
corporation better translates the intention and context of the English 
name of the corporation and brings the act into line with 
current French drafting terminology. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that this bill will ensure that the Corporation 
of Mackenzie is well managed and ready for the next century. It 
is with great pleasure that I support the bill in the hope that 
it will be passed in an expeditious manner.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on February 3, 
1999, I asked a question to the House. I said that the 
employment insurance system is an insurance scheme and I asked 
the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government trying to cut more people off EI benefits 
and treat them like criminals? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I toured around the country, I saw this is the way people 
feel. It is important that the minister be aware of that. People 
contribute to the employment insurance fund but each time they 
ask for benefits, they are treated like criminals, like people 
who are abusing the system. That is the way people feel all 
around the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I went across the country and met with people they told me 
that when they apply for employment insurance the human resource 
people are looking at them as though they are criminals. Surely 
we do not want the government to treat Canadians that way. That 
is why I raised the question at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the government do about this?  It is not right that 
people across the country should be treated like this at the 
human resources offices. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked a question. But what answers we do get. This is what the 
minister answered: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member treats EI as if it were an industry creating 
employment in the regions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not so. An employment insurance system is not an 
industry to create employment, it is a system which pays 
benefits to people who are out of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to go back to the 1970s. What I am saying is that 
there is a program for which workers and employers are paying. 
People all around the country tell us that this program belongs 
to them, to the workers who lose their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable for the minister to rise in the House and say 
to me that I am going back to the 1970s. That is not true. I 
want to live in 1999, with a program built in such a way that 
when people lose their job, they can receive benefits to support 
their families, their children, get them something to eat and 
send them to school.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are not pleased to get such answers.  On need only 
look at the report by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development which indicates that the percentage of women in 
Canada who no longer qualify for employment insurance has risen 
by 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must face up to reality.  The program is no longer up to 
doing what it was intended for in the beginning.  This is the 
reason I would like the minister to give us some answers in the 
coming days, about what he is going to do with the employment 
insurance program, because the people of Canada, the workers of 
Canada, are not satisfied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Windsor are not satisfied when they fill out their 
income tax returns and find that they have to again pay into 
employment insurance.  They phone us and write us to say so. 
The situation is the same everywhere, not just in the Atlantic 
provinces, but  in Regina and in Edmonton, Alberta, as well.  I 
have said so on numerous occasions here in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I hope the minister can tell us exactly what he is going to 
do with the employment insurance program. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me 
assure the hon. member that the department tries to treat all 
clients with fairness, understanding and compassion.  Each case 
is assessed individually and all circumstances brought to light 
are examined and considered in a compassionate manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition member says that the people he met felt like they 
were being treated as criminals.  Perhaps this is attributable to 
the fact that some people put in a claim for employment insurance 
four or five years ago when the rules were different and received 
benefits.  It is possible they put in one recently with the new 
rules and found they did not qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes when people are told no, they take it very personally. 
No one is trying to treat anyone like a criminal.  However, the 
employees of the Department of Human Resources Development in the 
various Canada employment centres are obligated to implement the 
law as it stands.  It is unfortunate if some people are feeling 
very sensitive and taking it personally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also said that the rate of women who do not qualify 
has risen by 20%.  He is reversing a figure that is in today's 
monitoring and assessment report.  In fact it is not women who do 
not qualify.  It is that the rate of women who have applied for 
employment insurance has dropped by 20%.  That could mean that 
many more women have jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 300,000 more women working in the past year than were 
working prior to that.  That might account for the reason fewer 
are putting in claims.

emergency situation created by the Liberal government's inability

Alliance of Canada union, thereby causing immense financial harm 
to the Canadian economy and to farmers specifically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We gather tonight to engage in one of those historic debates 
that arise in the life of a nation from time to time.  The 
emergency debate tonight will deal with the economic well-being 
of a nation as judged by our collective productivity and

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be so simple to say this debate is directed solely to 
the strike action being taken by members of the Public Service 
Alliance of Canada.  It would be simple to say this debate is 
only about farm incomes hurt by the halted movement of grain to 
our overseas customers. It is about these two issues, but they 
are only the symptoms of a malaise in this country, a malaise 
that includes the following diseases which, while not fatal, 
seriously weaken every Canadian's physical, mental, spiritual and 
cultural well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak of high taxes, low farm commodity prices, high farm 
input costs resulting in low net income, and an agriculture 
sector asking what is the future for their farms, for their 
children in agriculture.  I speak of the thousands of Public 
Service Alliance of Canada union members who have not had a wage 
increase in the last six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before being elected to parliament I was a member of the RCMP. I 
had the same wage freeze these union members are currently 
undergoing.  These union members, farmers, many other workers in 
both the public and private sector and I have made immense 
sacrifices to eliminate our national budget deficit. I currently 
own and operate a cattle ranch.  Combined with my other life 
experiences, I can say that I feel the pain of the farmer, the 
rancher and the union worker in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other diseases that make up this national malaise include a 
monopoly government organization called the Canadian Wheat Board 
and a highly regulated grain transportation system that stifles 
innovation and investment. There are also world trade problems 
including those with our closest neighbours and friends in the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My request for this emergency debate was granted by the Speaker 
of the House and I appreciate his wisdom in doing so.  I 
requested the debate because the ministers responsible for 
solving these national problems have failed in their tasks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent statements by the Treasury Board minister indicate that 
negotiations have reached an impasse.  He has not divulged all of 
the reasons that this situation has arisen, nor the options that 
are available to him and his government to resolve the stalemate. 
The various government ministers have not even explained to the 
Canadian public, to union members, farmers or ranchers the extent 
of the financial harm that is befalling this country and its 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe a full public hearing of the issues I have mentioned 
along with many others I have not touched on will help us as a 
nation to find our way out of this economic and social mess we 
find ourselves in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak on some of the details, the nuts and bolts, of this 
emergency debate.  I sent a letter to parliament dated March 17, 
1999 requesting that an emergency debate pursuant to Standing 
Order 52 be held to address the current labour dispute that has 
terminated grain movement through the port of Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House is well aware, the Public Service Alliance of 
Canada is currently involved in a labour dispute with the 
Government of Canada.  Included in this dispute are approximately 
70 grain weighers employed by the Canadian Grain Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The functions performed by these 70 workers are mandated under 
the Canada Grains Act and cannot be performed by non Canadian 
Grain Commission personnel.  Therefore, the withdrawal of these 
services will prevent the unloading of grain hopper cars and the 
loading of vessels for overseas customers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until March 14, 1999 the Public Service Alliance of Canada had 
structured its rotating strikes in such a way that grain 
movement, while being inconvenienced, had continued near targeted 
levels. However, this changed when the Public Service Alliance of 
Canada grain weighers set up pickets at all five grain terminals 
in Vancouver on March 15.  Not only has this action removed the 
legislated mandated service, other workers such as grain handlers 
and longshoremen have refused to cross the picket lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grain movement has been halted for the past three days.  When I 
speak of halted grain movement, I am talking about on the 
prairies with the railways and off the ships that are heading 
across the seas to our customers in Asia and other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The escalation of action by the grain weighers follows a March 
10 interview by the president of the Public Service Alliance of 
Canada in which he stated that grain will become a primary 
target. At this point, March 10, it would have seemed that the 
urgency would have come home to the government to take the action 
necessary at least to prevent that threat from happening and/or 
to negotiate in good faith and come to a settlement.  As we know, 
this did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we all hope this dispute will be resolved in a timely 
fashion, we cannot allow an ongoing disruption of Canada's grain 
flow as that would constitute a further attack on producers' 
falling incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention a few of the dollar figures surrounding 
this strike.  Of course there are the union workers and their 
wages which affects not only the workers themselves but their 
families who are trying to meet mortgages and make payments to 
their creditors.  It would be easy to tell them to go back to 
work and trust the government, but this government has 
demonstrated through actions and words that it cannot be trusted 
to work out satisfactory solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall about a year and a half ago when this very House dealt 
with the postal union workers.  It is my understanding that after 
having legislated them back to work with the promise of a 
negotiated settlement, in fact that settlement has not been 
achieved to this date. I imagine the grain workers and the other 
public service alliance workers are saying to themselves, “If 
this government simply legislates us back to work or if I simply 
agree to go back to work with no settlement, will I be treated 
the same as the postal workers?” From what we have seen so far, 
they have a justified reason to be concerned and wary of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board announced today that it has lost one 
sale of $9 million. It has also lost several smaller ones to Asia 
and Latin America, in the neighbourhood of $2 million to $10 
million. To a lot of people $2 million is not much of a sale, but 
the world grain trade has changed.  We no longer have the $1 
billion sales to Russia and China. We have a grain industry with 
small sales of $1 million to $2 million. While these dollar 
figures may seem small, their cumulative effect is very large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On grain leaving the port, I will only talk about wheat at this 
time even though many other crops are being exported.  In the 
neighbourhood of $6 million a day in wheat exports are not 
leaving the port. This is the capability of the port and that 
represents actual losses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spring is coming.  We have to take note that this stoppage of 
grain movement on the west coast will soon spread across the 
country if this dispute is not resolved.  We received information 
today that it is expected that the seaway will open up around 
March 22, 1999.  The western grain elevators expect to begin 
operations at that time with one terminal facility in Thunder 
Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, we considered and you agreed that this is a 
national emergency that needs a debate in the House of Commons. 
The fact is that it does affect more than western Canadians and 
it does affect more than dock workers and grain handlers on the 
west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another item that the Canadian Wheat Board brought 
forth in its press release today.  The spokesman said that the 
sales director for the wheat board said that we are forgoing 
sales every day.  What are these sales? Are they simply wheat and 
canola leaving the ports and going to our customers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we get back is foreign currency, hard foreign currency that 
goes to the wealth of this nation.  It is not money we are 
circulating within the country, passing from one to the other, 
all of it eventually being taxed back by the government.  It is 
new money that we are earning from customers and people in other 
lands which goes to make our country a wealthier nation.  These 
are very important considerations when we talk about grain and 
its effect on the well-being of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cumulative effect of this dispute has to be taken in the 
context of other disputes and stoppages to the grain handling and 
grain transportation business over the years.  Since 1993 there 
have been inland strikes involving grain terminal companies, 
railway strikes and longshoremen strikes.  There were the 
terrible snowstorms that stopped grain transportation through the 
Rocky Mountains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This cumulative effect on the reliability of our exports is 
hurting this country.  It is hurting the western provinces in 
particular. It is hurting the very families who live in those 
provinces who eke out a very modest living from their toiling on 
the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all issues that translate into dollar losses for the 
economy of B.C. and for the farmers across the country.  As of 
March 18 there were 21 vessels at the Vancouver port.  For the 
weeks prior to the strike, there were about six vessels in port 
which is a normal coming and going of ships at the port.  We can 
see that the vessels waiting to load are increasing in numbers on 
a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our customers was quoted in this recent dispute.  I 
believe the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food referred to 
this customer.  The Japanese food agency has raised concerns with 
the minister over the reliability of Canadian grain shipments out 
of Vancouver.  Eleven per cent of Canadian agriculture exports go 
to Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this very issue of reliability that is of such importance 
to this debate tonight.  I am sure it will be expanded on by 
other speakers from all parties after I am finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other portion of the grain transportation system that needs 
some mention is the railways. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT96"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT96"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 18 the railways indicated that the allocation of cars 
for the week of March 28 through April 3 is on hold.  Let me 
describe that.  There are hopper cars sitting full of grain out 
in Vancouver or at points in between.  There is grain sitting in 
the elevators and there is grain sitting on the farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grain system also operates on a just in time type scenario 
where the customer's ships arrive, the grain is put in and the 
order from the farmer is placed.  This all has to move in a very 
time sensitive situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this strike and this action stops it will take at least 
three weeks to get the system up and rolling again.  That is 
because the grain handling system operates on a cycle.  It will 
take at least three weeks after the end of the strike to return 
to normal operation.  During this whole time vessels that have 
been ordered by the Canadian Wheat Board and other exporters will 
continue to arrive with no grain to pick up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens when they arrive?  If shippers do not load the 
vessels within the specified times, usually a three to five day 
window, companies are charged what is called demurrage fees. 
These fees are for each extra day the vessel is in port without 
being loaded.  These charges are substantial and can range from 
about $10,000 to $15,000 a day.  Simply multiplying that out, 
$15,000 per day times 21, it can be seen that over the course of 
a week or two weeks, God forbid this should go on that long, we 
are talking of hundreds of millions of dollars in total. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other financial aspect to look at is late contract 
penalties.  In addition to vessel demurrage, exporters are 
charged late fees by importing companies.  In some cases, Japan 
for example, importing companies have moved to a just in time 
inventory management system and have paid a premium for 
reliability.  Built into these premium contracts are severe 
penalties for unreliability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already mentioned it but I would like to re-emphasize 
that all this translates into a loss of confidence.  Countries 
that rely on Canada for a steady supply of grain may choose to go 
elsewhere if this supply is interrupted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what the Canadian Wheat Board has indicated to the 
government today and to the Canadian people, may is not an 
accurate word to use.  It will cause this financial damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is responsible for the solutions.  The government 
is responsible for the negotiations with the labour union.  It 
has more complete information than anyone else in the House, me 
included.  As a result it is difficult to stand here and say 
exactly what the solutions are.  Certainly the President of the 
Treasury Board should declare that the work performed by these 70 
grain weighers is an essential service and he should allow them 
final offer arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I clearly point out that this issue is not a farmer and rancher 
versus a union member, it is not even opposition parties versus 
the government.  It is about public discussion of the facts and 
public discussion of the solutions. The government is in need of 
our help and in that spirit I pray that our deliberations here 
tonight will be fruitful and let all Canadians wake up to a 
brighter future as the sun rises tomorrow morning.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and Minister 
responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
evening, we are holding an important debate, and I would like to 
take this opportunity to review the negotiations between the 
Government of Canada and its employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House will recall that the Government of Canada has already 
bargained in good faith and signed collective agreements with 
over 87% of its employees.  And, in this group, I include over 
100,000 members affiliated with the Public Service Alliance of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, last week, some 10,000 technical employees, 
represented by the Public Service Alliance of Canada, and the 
government reached and ratified a new collective agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always held that it is by bargaining that two parties can 
reach an agreement.  Confrontation of any sort leads nowhere but 
to frustration of both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree we had a long salary freeze.  It began with the 
Conservative government.  We continued it for a number of years 
because it was essential to eliminate the deficit, which was 
undermining our national fiscal and financial health.  We did 
that, and two years ago we reintroduced the right to negotiate 
collective agreements.  That is what we have done in the past 
two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we reached agreements with 26 of the 29 groups. We are 
now at the point where over 85% of our unionized employees have 
signed collective agreements with us, thus allowing both sides, 
as employer and employees, to continue to provide necessary 
services to Canadians, in a manner that reflects the agreements 
reached by unionized employees and the government. We hope to be 
able to continue to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of the negotiations with all these groups, we were 
able to offer, on average, a basic salary increase of about 4.5% 
over a two-year period. It is on that basis that we negotiated 
and that we arrived at agreements with such a large proportion 
of our unionized employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two groups left, including the blue collar workers, 
with whom we have been trying in vain for two years to arrive at 
a solution. At one point, we thought we were very close to an 
agreement with one group, the correctional services people. In 
fact, we did reach an agreement with the union leaders. We 
arrived at an agreement with those who negotiate on behalf of 
correctional services employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only when the time came to ratify the agreement that, 
unfortunately, a small majority of employees refused to ratify 
the agreement that had been reached with their negotiators and 
that had been approved by their union leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all our goodwill and our desire to reach a conclusion, 
we now find ourselves with two cases where the demands of 
unionized workers do not correspond to the percentages offered 
to and accepted by almost 90% of the public service in other 
cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of having basic demands of approximately 2.5% for the 
first year and 2% in the second year, the basic demands are two, 
three and, in one case, four times higher than what was approved 
for the very great majority of other unionized workers.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that, if we said we were ready to accept this kind 
of demand, not only would we be creating an untenable situation 
for the almost 90% of our employees who have already signed 
contracts, but we would also be causing insurmountable problems 
in future contract negotiations due to start up again in a few 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have established a percentage increase that was out of 
line with what we gave most of our other employees and with what 
the private sector got. 
Right now, private sector increases in the last 18 months have 
been approximately 2.1% a year.  And this would also be out of 
line with what Canadians can afford to pay, a salary that is 
current in the market and fair to our employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we find ourselves unable to reach agreement with a 
very small number of our bargaining tables, particularly blue 
collar workers, because of their excessive demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government negotiates, it has a basic goal in mind. 
That goal is to try to find a balance between the interests and 
priorities of Canadians and those of government workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians have made important sacrifices in recent years. 
They recognized the need to put our financial house in order to 
continue moving forward. Poll after poll, Canadians are telling 
us they are proud of their federal government, which is making 
the right decisions, although they are often very difficult 
ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout this process, we have had to compromise. We have made 
offers the government could afford because we have a fiduciary 
responsibility to the citizens of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in group 2, blue collar workers, the government 
made all kinds of compromises. For instance, on the issue of 
regional rates, we have accepted to reduce the number of regions 
from ten to seven in spite of the fact that, in the interest of 
fairness, the rate should not be national, but such that it 
meets the needs of the local market and does not create 
distortion on the local markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, when the cost of living is much higher in 
Vancouver than in Fredericton, it is only fair that workers in 
Vancouver be paid salaries taking into account the cost of 
living there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if, given local market conditions, we offer pay rates 
significantly higher than local rates, we create an upward 
pressure on the salaries of workers in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly this has been justified for years and condoned by all 
kinds of commissions on public finances. Fairness demands 
regional rates. In spite of this we have agreed with the union 
to reduce the number of regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same table, with regard to salary increases, the offer we 
made was higher than what we had offered most public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We raised our offer to a 4.75% base rate increase because we 
wanted to try to solve any problems with this group so we could 
get on with the negotiations, reach a negotiated settlement and 
keep the peace with the union and the employees. To achieve that 
goal, we were convinced Canadians were willing to accept a rate 
of increase that was slightly higher than what we had offered 
most public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, unfortunately, not only were our employees not satisfied 
with that, they are now asking twice the salary increase we gave 
our other employees. 
These demands are excessive, therefore, and we are convinced 
Canadians are not willing to accept that.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still have hope that we will be able to reach a negotiated 
settlement because, even though the right to strike is 
recognized by all at this time, strikes have the effect of 
taking Canadians hostage and cause considerable damage, for 
example to the grain trade. There are also millions of Canadians 
who may have to wait a long time before receiving their tax 
refund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, our employees, our blue collar workers, have 
started using tactics that create problems for many Canadians. 
They have taken Canadians hostage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I remind members that they stopped traffic at 
Dorval airport, which is not even under federal jurisdiction 
anymore. They forced many travellers, some of whom were not even 
Canadians, to walk more than one kilometre to get to the 
airport. Many of them missed their flight and were left 
wondering, and rightly so, what the dispute was all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to strike exists because when employees withdraw the 
offer of work they do, the services are not provided.  But what 
right have the employees to hold farmers hostage in the western 
provinces, taxpayers hostage in the case of Revenue Canada or 
travellers hostage at Dorval airport?  What right have they to 
hold them hostage and thus create such monumental inconvenience 
for third parties that they create an atmosphere they think will 
lead more easily to the conclusion of negotiations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, Canadians are reacting like the farmers in the 
west, saying “Why are our means of livelihood being affected by 
the union's taking third parties hostage, in this case the 
western farmers?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A strike is never easy, but it is even less so when it involves 
the security and the health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to bargain in good faith and sign agreements with our 
blue collar workers.  We especially want Canadians to receive 
the Government of Canada services they are entitled to and they 
pay for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in this strike, we can only conclude that our employees 
at the two tables remaining, which I mentioned—specifically the 
blue collar workers—are making excessive demands.  Their demands 
are not in keeping with the balance we must maintain, as a 
government, between taxpayers and the salaries we pay our 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, we have to consider that our employees, 
unfortunately, in the case of these two tables, are taking 
Canadians hostage and forcing us to consider the various options 
at our disposal to protect Canadians' right to services they 
elected a government for and they have paid for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois and as critic for 
labour issues, to take part in this emergency debate requested 
by the hon. member for Selkirk—Interlake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is the current labour conflict in Vancouver, which 
opposes the Public Service Alliance and 70 of its members who 
work for the Canadian Wheat Board. These people work in the 
elevators that handle grain exports. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employees have been on strike since March 15, which means 
for the past two or three working days. Based on our 
information, this work stoppage has a major impact on the 
region's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, we must put the decision of these 70 employees to go on a 
general strike in its proper context. It seems that, on March 
10, a Public Service Alliance official did warn the employer, 
that is the government and the Canadian Wheat Board, that if 
there were no progress in negotiations, the union's strategy 
would be to target wheat to put pressure on the employer. 
Therefore, the message was rather clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 14, the union began a rotating strike which had the 
merit of continuing wheat operations.  It was not until the 
following day that the unions put up a picket line, which was 
respected by the other unions working near the export elevators. 
Undoubtedly, therefore, the strike had a considerable impact and 
achieved its goal, which was to establish a balance of power 
between the two parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a strong suspicion that the Reform Party's strategy in 
pushing for this emergency debate today is to set the stage for 
the employer—in this case, the government—to introduce special 
back-to-work legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the position of the Bloc Quebecois.  This is not our 
approach, because we think that, if there is a right to strike, 
it should be respected. 
It has to go on for a while at least, there has to be a deadline 
after which, if negotiations have failed to resolve the 
situation, public interest must be taken into account and a 
decision can be made to settle the issue and move to other 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unthinkable that, because negotiations have gone nowhere 
after three days, drastic action is in order.  In the context of 
the public service, it is too easy for the government, as both 
employer and lawmaker, to find the situation too complicated and 
the repercussions too serious and to turn around and use its 
legislative authority to thwart the effects of the strike and 
the strike itself. We find this excessive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we hope that negotiations will go on, there must be a true 
power relationship and we must feel that there is no other way 
to ensure the continuation of operations before bringing in 
special back to work legislation. It must be a measure of last 
resort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see here the philosophy of the Reform Party, which does 
not have much respect for labour legislation and for workers. As 
the President of the Treasury Board said, it is not fun to 
suffer the impacts of a strike. But it is not fun either—and we 
tend to forget that—for those on strike or for their families. It 
is not fun for those who are on the picket lines. These people 
go through a period of serious insecurity and discomfort and, 
may I add, strike action is legal in that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board spoke earlier about security 
and health, two issues that are being ignored here. There is 
some sort of an essential service in Canada, which has been 
provided for in order to protect public health and security. We 
are talking about economic impacts, which are very difficult to 
assess. We should be careful not to go too far in that regard.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of hinting at the quick passage of a special act to put 
an end to that kind of labour dispute, we would prefer to see 
the parties negotiate in good faith, accept negotiation and 
reach an agreement that will be well accepted and honoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to strike, the legal right to strike is a clear sign 
of civilization. Why should a society invent such means to 
provide working conditions? The right to strike was not given by 
the employers, either in the public or private sectors. The 
right to strike is a hard won right in the history of western 
societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A strike always causes inconvenience. 
The fate of farmers is of great concern to us. In Quebec also 
farmers are hurting a lot because of the international economic 
conditions, globalization and its harmful effects. Institutions 
and individuals are paying the price. Western farmers are 
feeling the pinch too, and we sympathize with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be too easy to say, as soon as we are slightly 
inconvenienced, that we are going to pass special back-to-work 
legislation to solve the problem. We are not ready to go along 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the obviously difficult situation the parties have 
arrived at to be settled through negotiations, negotiations 
conducted in good faith recognizing what it means for the 
regional economy. 
One should not fall into the trap nor be tricked into using this 
all too easy approach called back to work legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will sum up my thoughts and those of the Bloc on the matter: 
our position is very clear. Freedom of association exists in 
principle in Canada, and workers, when they have good reason to do 
so, go on strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is part of a fair balance of power, except when the employer, 
which happens to be the government, abuses its legislative 
power. Again, back to work 
legislation should only be a last resort, until the government 
gets back to the negotiating table with an offer acceptable to 
workers and settles the dispute in a democratic and civilized 
manner through negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one speaks of good faith, when one speaks of the federal 
government as employer, one is entitled to a few concerns. 
Contrary to rumour, the federal government is a tough employer. 
We know that it recently rejected a court decision on pay 
equity.  Really now, a judgment is a judgment.  In its wisdom, 
the government in its power and arrogance, has decided to appeal 
the judgment rather than comply with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government that has already obtained orphan clauses, 
at Canada Post in particular, where working conditions vary 
greatly depending on seniority.  I know some postal workers 
personally and I know that their conditions are truly 
precarious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a person works a few hours a week, and cannot be guaranteed 
more than 15 hours of work a month—if memory serves me 
right—working conditions at Canada Post are far from enviable. In 
the past, jobs at Canada Post were highly coveted, but now, 
thanks to the interventionist attitude of this government as 
employer, this is no longer the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government which, in the latest revision of the Canada 
Labour Code, refused to include an anti-scab provision.  In 
Quebec, this matter was settled a long time ago, to everyone's 
satisfaction.  The use of replacement workers during a strike is 
forbidden.  The Canada Labour Code does not contain any such 
provision for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has refused to pass Part III of the Canada 
Labour Code, which would give pregnant women better treatment, 
through preventive leave to safeguard the health of women who 
are soon to give birth by allowing them to stop working.

speak of bargaining in good faith, there is an element of doubt, 
because we know whom we are dealing with.  This is a nitpicking 
government, that denies, for example, its employees in the RCMP— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</B> —the right to bargain, to have a union.  It 
is a company union we regularly get information from. 
Arbitrariness reigns in management.  That is what is promoted: 
people are at the mercy of their immediate supervisors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, you have understood that the government does not want 
special legislation in a labour dispute at this point at least. 
It wants the rules of standard procedure to take the upper hand, 
bargaining in good faith and agreement by the parties in order 
to put a quick end to this labour dispute, with its 
unfortunately rather significant consequences.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a good thing that we are having this debate tonight.  The 
hon. member for Selkirk—Interlake has done the House a service 
by requesting and receiving the opportunity to have an emergency 
debate on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter what our views are, and we may differ on how things 
should be handled or what the origins of the problem are, it 
certainly is a matter of great concern to Canadian farmers and 
producers and is something that the House should be giving its 
attention to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go over some of the history of the dispute which 
has led us to this debate.  The Public Service Alliance of Canada 
has been engaged in rotating strikes across the country for eight 
weeks.  It has been doing this as a result of what it sees and 
what we see and what many other Canadians see as intransigence on 
the part of the government in respect of the bargaining that the 
government has been engaged in with the Public Service Alliance 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday the government walked away from the table and 
therefore the government has to take responsibility for what has 
happened.  If it had the will, the government could find a way 
out of this impasse by going back to the table, by bargaining in 
good faith and by showing respect for the collective bargaining 
process instead of engaging in the sort of coded threats the 
President of the Treasury Board was engaging in earlier when he 
talked about examining all his options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what that means.  It is a code for back to work 
legislation.  Echoing what my colleague from the Bloc said about 
the need to balance the very difficulty won right to strike, in 
this case the right to strike of public servants against what may 
or may not be in the public interest, this is a balance that 
always has to be delicately sought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that we have arrived at any situation which would 
create any kind of moral imperative on the part of the government 
to engage in this kind of threat at this time or to engage in 
more concrete actions such as back to work legislation.  However, 
if it does, we will have to deal with that when it comes and in 
the form in which it comes, because we know that back to work 
legislation can come in many forms.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to what the President of the Treasury Board 
said.  He kept talking about the people who are on strike taking 
Canadians hostage.  I think this is very strong language.  It 
begs a larger debate about who is taking whom hostage and why we 
reserve this kind of language.  The President of the Treasury 
Board used the word hostage three, four or perhaps half a dozen 
time in his speech, so I hope he is not taking umbrage at my 
reminding people what he said when he spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that he should characterize what the striking 
workers are doing in that way.  He may want to disapprove of what 
the striking workers are doing.  That is fine.  However I take 
some exception to using the idea of taking hostages in this very 
selective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take objection to using the concept of taking hostages only 
when workers are withdrawing their labour because in their 
judgment they are not receiving the remuneration for their labour 
that they feel is their just due.  When workers do that, people 
like the President of the Treasury Board say “This is hostage 
taking.  This is not serving the common good.  This is hurting 
the transportation and the delivery of grain”.  All these 
factors which have to do with the common good and the public 
interest are immediately brought in, and perhaps appropriately so 
when we are talking about the effect of a strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we hear this same kind of language when capital withdraws its 
services, when it withdraws from whatever economic activity it 
was in, in order to make a profit, because it is no longer making 
the profit it used to make or because it is not able to make as 
much profit as it would like to make or have the increase in 
profit that it would like to have.  When companies act in this 
way, when corporations act in this way, when capital acts in this 
way, we say they are just being good businessmen.  They are just 
saying “Either we get this or we don't deliver.  We don't do 
what we normally do”.  We say they are being hardnosed, that 
these are people who know how to stick up for themselves, that 
these are people we have to reckon with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when workers do it they are hostage takers.  They are 
people who have no concern for the Canadian economy.  If I had a 
dime for every time there was a corporate decision taken that was 
not in the interest of the Canadian economy but was in the 
interest of a particular corporation, I would be a very rich 
person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that is done I do not hear people, with the possible 
exception of New Democrats, saying in the House of Commons that 
these people are terrible, that they put their own economic 
interest ahead of the country.  It is just regarded as the 
marketplace taking its effect, as people acting like good little 
Adam Smith disciples, acting according to the Zeitgeist, acting 
according to the market ethic.  They are not reprimanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the President of the Treasury Board does not get up 
and call them hostage takers.  He does not go after the railway 
for taking farmers hostage by abandoning rail lines and leaving 
them at the mercy of Cargill, truckers or whatever it is they are 
left to the mercy of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the railway says “We are going to pull that line out of 
there because we are not making enough money on it”, regardless 
of what the consequences are for the local community or farmers I 
do not hear the President of the Treasury Board saying that the 
CNR are hostage takers, that they have no regard for the welfare 
of the Canadian economy or western Canada or farmers.  I do not 
hear that kind of talk from the government when corporations act 
in this way.  Perhaps we should hear that kind of talk but we do 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am counselling here is if we are to be preached at by the 
President of the Treasury Board with respect to the common good, 
with respect to the well-being of the Canadian economy, with 
respect to the well-being of Canadian farmers and their 
communities, I would like to see a little more even-handedness on 
the part of the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see a government that was active in resisting 
the ways in which the railways are hurting farmers.  I would like 
to see a government that was active in resisting the way that 
some of the agribusiness corporations are impinging upon the 
interests of farmers.  I do not hear that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a point that needs to be made because if through 
back to work legislation, if that is what the government has in 
mind, we can conscript labour, why is it still a sin to conscript 
capital? Why do we live with the very idea, which was not always 
regarded as quite as radical as it is today, that capital should 
somehow be answerable to the common good, should be answerable to 
the needs of the national economy, should be answerable to the 
needs of communities?  That idea is completely out of fashion. It 
is not out of fashion as far as I am concerned but it is out of 
fashion.  Let us face it, that is not the prevailing wisdom, that 
is not the conventional wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I am saying to my colleagues is: what is sauce for the goose 
is sauce for the gander.  I object to an ethic which says 
ordinary working people have to be responsible for or take into 
account the effects of their actions on the Canadian economy and 
in this case, with respect to what is happening in Vancouver, 
their effect on farmers on their families.  It is a very serious 
concern.  I am not trying to downplay that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking why we lay this moral imperative on them and yet we 
do not do it when it comes to others, particularly much more 
powerful actors in the Canadian economy than, let us face it, the 
blue collar workers at the Public Service Alliance of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make a plea for some moral symmetry which I do not often see 
in this place.  I see a tremendous moral imperative being laid on 
workers when their actions or their withdrawal of their services 
imperils in some way or another a part or the whole of the 
Canadian economy.  However, when this is done in the name of 
corporate profit, corporate profit strategies, a good investment 
climate or whatever we want to call it, it is just regarded as 
business.  It is just regarded as the way things are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we can have it both ways.  I encourage the 
President of the Treasury Board to go back to the table, to stop 
talking about hostage takers, unless he is interested in a little 
Stockholm syndrome, and get down to business with the strikers. I 
am sure that they are not anxious to be on strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been on many picket lines in my time as an MP and even 
before that when members of my family were on strike.  I can tell 
the House that people who are on strike do not want to be on 
strike.  People who are on strike, especially if they have been 
on strike for any length of time, are always looking for an 
honourable way back to their jobs because they do not like being 
without work.  They do not like being without a regular pay 
cheque.  They do not enjoy being on the picket line.  Whatever 
excitement there is fades very quickly.  To imagine that somehow 
the alleged intransigence of the union comes from any desire to 
have the strike prolonged in any way is very mistaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board was listening to me at the 
beginning, but I guess I must have either bothered him or 
something because he is really involved now in talking to his 
Liberal seatmate over there.  Over here, President of the 
Treasury Board; earth to the President of the Treasury Board. 
There he is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying to the President of the Treasury Board through the 
Chair, as I always do, that it is time for the President of the 
Treasury Board to go back to the table.  He knows what he has to 
do to arrive at a settlement.  He should stop using this 
inappropriate language and do what he has to do, not just for the 
sake of the strikers but for the sake of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has a responsibility, not just to the people who are on the 
picket lines, to show leadership in this regard.  I am sure he 
could apply himself.  He is no dummy.  He is no slouch.  He knows 
how to get out of the mess he got himself and the rest of the 
country into, if he wants to get out of it, and I encourage him 
to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to preface my comments on a few remarks on the comments by 
the member for Winnipeg Transcona.  As always, his comments are 
enlightening and intelligent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would maybe beg to differ that there is a slightly different 
angle we should be looking at here and it is not questioning 
whether PSAC members have a right to vote.  I would put the 
emphasis on the shoulders of the government where it rightly 
belongs because it has not settled this prolonged strike and has 
allowed it to fester to the point where they are using and 
threatening the livelihoods of other Canadians because they are 
desperate and there has been no chance to arbitrate this dispute. 
That blame lies solely on the shoulders of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to rise today on behalf of my hon. colleague, 
the member for Brandon—Souris, to speak on the very important 
issue facing Canadian grain farmers as a result of the current 
public service strike.  The both of us would like to congratulate 
the member for Selkirk—Interlake for bringing this issue forward 
in tonight's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue that all parties in the House of Commons should 
be concerned about, not only those from western Canada because it 
has implications on Canada's reputation as an exporter of grain 
and surely that would have implications on all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Service Alliance of Canada is currently involved in a 
labour dispute with the Government of Canada.  Included in this 
dispute are approximately 70 grain weighers employed by the 
Canadian Grain Commission.  The functions performed by these 70 
workers are mandated under the Canadian Grains Act and cannot be 
performed by non-Canadian grain corporation staff.  The 
withdrawal of these services has prevented the unloading of grain 
hopper cars and the loading of vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 15, when PSAC grain weighers set up picket lines at 
five grain terminals in Vancouver, it halted grain movement, 
preventing 700 unionized grain handlers from going to work, 
costing not only our producers but our international reputation 
as a supplier of high quality grain capable of meeting important 
and time sensitive delivery dates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and most important, this work stoppage has also hurt 
Canadians through delays in income tax refunds.  Almost one 
million income tax returns are stuck in the system.  Because of 
grain delays, Canadian farmers and Canada's reputation as one of 
the world's best suppliers of high quality grain are being hurt. 
It needs to be mentioned that Canada exports around $18 billion 
to $20 billion worth of food products every year and about 
one-half of these grain exports are grains, oilseeds and related 
products. These stoppages cause serious damage to the Canadian 
grain export industry and the prairie economy they are based out 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will illustrate how the failure of leadership on this issue is 
part of a pattern of this government that is failing to serve 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to contrast the government's lack of effectiveness on 
this issue and how an earlier Conservative government dealt 
competently with a potential strike situation back in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no doubt by anyone who has read a newspaper, 
listened to the radio or watched television in the last few weeks 
that the public service strike has hurt not just the public 
service but other sectors of the Canadian economy and, in the 
area of concern tonight, Canadian grain transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time Canadian farmers have been affected 
by grain delays.  Delayed 1997 shipments to contracted 
international customers, primarily in wheat, have resulted in 
demurrage charges of $65 million paid for primarily by producers. 
It has been estimated that an additional $35 million was lost in 
potential sales because of Canada's inability to deliver. This 
reflected poorly not only on western Canadian farmers but 
Canadians as a whole in the international marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again Canadian farmers are faced with these disruptions, this 
time as a result of PSAC strike.  Fortunately, farmers will not 
face huge demurrage charges as they did back in 1997 because the 
Vancouver Grain Exchange has declared the shutdown an event of 
delay.  This move by the industry body gives exporters 14 days 
after the situation is cleared up before they face charges.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very time sensitive issue and it is timely to bring it 
up in an emergency debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is indirect costs to farmers.  That could cost 
millions and the damage to Canada's reputation is immeasurable. 
In the last 48 hours alone the Canadian Wheat Board stated that 
it has lost $9 million in sales because of the reliability of our 
delivery system.  The government has dragged its feet on this 
issue for over two years.  It has failed to reach a settlement 
with table two PSAC workers.  I question what the government has 
done over the past two years.  Obviously very little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the federal government has put our farmers in this situation 
where they are being held hostage. I will use those words. Our 
farmers are being held hostage because the strike has dragged on, 
without resolution, at the negotiating table. Our farmers are not 
being held hostage by PSAC workers, they are being held hostage 
by the government.  This could not have come at a worse time with 
Canadian farmers suffering one of the most financial crunches 
since the Great Depression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 10 my hon. colleague, the member for Brandon—Souris 
who is unfortunately unable to participate in tonight's debate, 
wrote the President of the Treasury Board urging this government 
to quickly resolve negotiations with PSAC members.  He has yet to 
hear a reply.  The member for Brandon—Souris got up in the House 
on February 17 and again urged the government to resolve the 
dispute with the PSAC workers.  Still no word from the minister 
other than “do not worry, we are working on it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ask ourselves why this government chooses through its 
own neglect to allow this strike to cause so much damage to the 
Canadian economy, to agri-businesses and Canada's international 
reputation.   This is not an isolated incident but a pattern 
within this government that shows a leadership vacuum beginning 
at the top and a contempt for the legislative and democratic 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it be the federal government dragging its heels on the 
farm income crisis, Canada's delayed position on the Kyoto 
environmental conference or the defence department's decision to 
purchase EH-101 helicopters only after years delays and after 
cancelling a previous which cost taxpayers $.5 billion, and the 
list goes on, everywhere we turn the government chooses to 
procrastination over leadership, the same kind of failed policy 
that hurt so many Canadians with the PSAC strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where can we look to for an example of real leadership?  In 
October 1991 there was a Progressive Conservative government in 
power faced with a labour situation not much different from that 
faced by the current government.  Back then Canada Post was 
negotiating to bring a number of unions, each with its own 
collective agreements with CUPW, under one agreement.  A series 
of rotating strikes in August urged the government to do whatever 
necessary to allow the two parties to come to successful 
negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the President of the Treasury Board to seek a quick and 
speedy resolution to this strike.  In the event that it appears 
to be futile the Progressive Conservative Party would urge, but 
only as a last resort, to legislate public service employees back 
to work.  If this is not resolved soon all Canadians stand to 
lose, both PSAC members and farmers.  It is time for the 
government to stand up and show leadership which has obviously 
been lacking for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a double responsibility here.  It has a 
responsibility with PSAC to settle this in an equitable and 
timely manner.  The government has a timely and important 
responsibility to western Canadian farmers to enable them to meet 
export commitments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate. I thank my colleague from

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To dispel a few myths before I really get into the text of what 
I have to say tonight, I would like to reply to some accusations 
by my friend from Trois-Rivières who said this is a veiled threat 
for the Reform Party to try to get the government to bring in 
back to work legislation.  Nothing could be further from the 
truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to work legislation does not do anything. All it does is 
get the parties back on the job.  It still does not do anything 
to settle the labour dispute.  The labour dispute will still be 
there.  That animosity will still be there.  That intransigence 
will still be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe for a minute that any union will strike on a 
whim.  It needs a pretty good reason. I am quite sure those 
people on strike at the moment are wishing they could be at work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a loss of pay. Everybody knows that when there is a 
strike for any duration, they will never work long enough to make 
up for the money they have lost. Those people have made that 
decision and it has not been taken lightly, rest assured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Trois-Rivières' allegations are absolutely false. 
We do not advocate back to work legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year or so ago we had part I of the Canada Labour Code opened, 
the industrial relations part.  We made some changes in that 
code.  One of the things the government kept telling us was that 
it wanted to put in a clause that applies to grain, clause 87.7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even some of my friends from the Liberal Party thought this 
would be an excellent clause because it would ensure the flow of 
grain from the farm gate to the port.  Why is that so important? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important certainly for farm families.  It is also 
important to the Canadian economy.  Every person in this place, 
regardless of their party, would like to have close to complete 
employment in this country.  They would like to see the 
unemployment rate near zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is no way to go about it.  This is no way to attain those 
goals.  The very fact that we have the spinoff effect from grain 
sales, from agriculture, is a huge item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an excellent thing.  It is a very good thing that I am 
not the kind of guy who would say I told you this would not work, 
I told you so.  If I were, right now I would be saying I told you 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even my friends including some in the Liberal caucus thought 
clause 87.7 would move grain right through to port.  It will not 
and the reason it will not is that there are still unions the 
government refuses to come to agreement with that go on strike 
out of frustration or out of necessity or for some reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the other unions will respect their picket lines and not 
cross them.  What happens then?  There are granaries full of 
grain on the farm.  There are elevators full of grain in the 
towns.  There are trains loaded, sitting on the sidings at ports 
and not moving. Instant constipation.  Nothing moves.  This is 
certainly not a good picture.  This has great detrimental spinoff 
to the Canadian economy and this simply cannot be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great interest to some of the strong language 
the President of the Treasury Board used when he spoke about the 
problem.  He talked a lot about the history.  What was missing 
was talk about the solution. 
I also listened to my friend from Winnipeg—Transcona talk about 
the strong language used by the President of the Treasury Board. 
Like the President of the Treasury Board, my friend from 
Winnipeg—Transcona did not talk about the solution.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have pretty well covered the problem.  We know the farmers 
have the grain in the bins.  We know they cannot move this grain 
after breakup starts.  After the frost starts to come out of the 
ground, the municipalities put bans or load restrictions on their 
roads. It is very important that this grain gets to port.  The 
people at the ports and the unions know this.  The government 
knows this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as though this were the first time this has happened. 
This happens over and over again, and the government out of 
desperation and political pressure brought to bear by the farming 
community and others brings in back to work legislation, which 
does not serve Canada well at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of scale are we talking about here?  My colleague said 
about the movement of grain at the west coast port that there are 
approximately 20 to 21 ships waiting out there.  That represents 
an awful lot of grain.  It represents a lot of jobs and a lot of 
transfer payments for this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also represents an erosion of our reliable good name when it 
comes to supplying grain.  As everybody in this place knows, a 
good reputation takes a long time to build but it can be lost in 
a very short time. That is the danger we run every time we go 
through what I call these futile exercises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike some of the previous speeches, I am going to talk about 
what I think the solutions are.  My friend from 
Selkirk—Interlake spoke about what he thought was the solution. 
By some strange coincidence I have the same feelings about the 
possibility of a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stable labour relations are absolutely vital to the country.  If 
we have stable labour relations and we can be a reliable shipper 
of goods, then we have a leg up on our competitors.  That is very 
important.  Agriculture is still a very important and significant 
employer of people in this country.  This is not from the more or 
less narrow viewpoint of strictly the farm community.  We are 
talking about a much broader spinoff area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Final offer selection arbitration is a tool that can be used by 
labour and by management equally well.  I say that because I 
think the very fact of making final offer selection arbitration 
available to these parties will make them bargain very earnestly. 
It is an incentive for them to come to an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could even say that used to its ultimate, final offer 
selection arbitration would not be used at all.  In case that is 
too much of a leap for some people to follow, the reason I say 
that is that final offer selection arbitration does not meld the 
final positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour presents its position and management presents its 
position. 
The arbitrator takes all of one position or all of the other 
position.  It is not a negotiated in between settlement at all. 
It is all of one or all of the other.  Both parties know that 
when they go in, and therefore both parties come to their 
absolute bottom line.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oftentimes when bottom lines are compared, there is no decision 
for the arbitrator to make because they have come to a 
conclusion. Oftentimes it never comes to presenting a final 
position to the arbitrator because lo and beyond the sides sat 
down, hammered things out and negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say this again lest there still be somebody in 
this House who would like to accuse us of supporting back to work 
legislation and removing the right to strike.  Absolutely false 
on both counts. We support the right to strike and the right to 
organize.  We also think the very best solution is a negotiated 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw it in this House in the not too distant past when we had 
a postal disruption.  The government saw fit to legislate them 
back to work.  Lo and behold that was 16 months ago and still 
there is no agreement in the post office.  What is the point? Why 
legislate them back to work if we are not going to come to an 
agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should use final offer selection arbitration, get an 
agreement, get everybody back to work on an amicable footing and 
we will not have to face these situations again and again.  Until 
we do that, we are going to be back here in an emergency debate 
again and again because of a situation where the national economy 
is suffering or there is some kind of crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we are here is that all parties have agreed that 
this is an emergency. It is testament to the fact that this is an 
emergency situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people will say that we Reform guys want to have final 
offer selection for everything.  That too is rubbish. Anybody 
that would care to read the things I have said about final offer 
selection need only go back to the debates on Bill C-19. We 
explained it time and time again.  As a matter of fact, I reached 
the point where I thought I might be boring some people in the 
House with my explanations of final offer selection.  I know Mr. 
Speaker would not be one of them because he listens intently to 
virtually every word I say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think final offer selection is one of the tools that should 
be used in cases where there is a monopoly situation, where there 
is no alternative to the services provided or withdrawn and in a 
situation where the national economy is going to suffer directly 
and significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly do hope that clarifies the situation.  I really hope 
my friend from Trois-Rivières is listening.  I am sure he is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want a fair and permanent resolution process.  We think it 
must be in place and it must be removed from the whims of 
government.  Back to work legislation is becoming so predictable 
that the unions and management have come to rely on it.  I do not 
know why they would do that.  It is a painful exercise for 
everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some kind of permanent legislation that would provide for final 
offer selection would provide both sides with something 
predictable that has rules and a timetable for which to 
negotiate.  It would give a lot of incentive to negotiate and to 
do so in earnest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we should minimize the importance of the effect 
on Canadian jobs and keeping Canadians employed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our reputation as a reliable supplier of products is worth 
defending and maintaining.  As I said, it takes a long time to 
develop a good reputation and a very short time to lose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect we have to be very aware of is that there are 
ports in the United States that are not all that far from 
Vancouver.  They are probably just as good, ice free and 
accessible to western Canada. Western Canada cannot afford to 
lose any business to U.S. west coast ports.  The jobs in British 
Columbia as a result of that port and the vessel traffic coming 
in from the sea are definitely worth defending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also about individual farmers, about their towns and 
their families.  At this time of year their bins are full of 
grain and they have to move it.  They are already suffering from 
low commodity prices. My friend from Selkirk—Interlake touched 
on the fact that they have no control over their input costs. 
Their costs for fuel, fertilizer, machinery, land rent, land 
taxes and purchase price of land are escalating.  It is getting 
more and more difficult to get into the farming business.  Indeed 
it is getting more and more difficult to stay in the farming 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case I had not mentioned it before, I have some knowledge 
whereof I speak because I have spent the last 31 years in the 
farming business.  I still live in a farming community.  I have 
many neighbours who although they are primarily in the livestock 
business, they still do ship canola, wheat, malting barley and 
feed barley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area where I live the vast majority of the grain is fed 
to livestock. Having stated that, I am in no way trying to 
minimize the importance of the grain shipment because we 
certainly do have farmers in our area who grow grain and oilseeds 
for export.  It is absolutely vital to them in order to keep 
their operations going that they have a reliable and affordable 
transportation system that will get their product to the port and 
out on to the high seas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever there is a work stoppage that has occurred in as far as 
the national transportation of grain is concerned the government 
of the day, and it does not seem to matter which government it 
is, begins to wring its hands and worry.  The first thing it 
seems to think is the solution is to bring in back to work 
legislation.  That is no solution at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at innovative ways to come up with a solution 
that will bring us a negotiated resolution to this problem.  We 
have to make sure that our grain travels to the port, on to the 
seas and to our customers in a timely fashion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too welcome the 
opportunity to enter into this debate and outline the seriousness 
of this situation, in particular for western Canadian farmers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1915"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT111"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT111"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1915

<A HREF="#LINKT110"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be splitting my time with my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I would like to outline a bit of my own background 
because I have had some involvement in this area.  In fact I was 
a farm leader for a decade and a half in the west.  I have 
marched in the streets with the Public Service Alliance of Canada 
because I believe so strenuously in collective bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the word “hostage”.  Farmers on the prairies are 
third party victims and have been held hostage by the Public 
Service Alliance of Canada and the leadership of the Public 
Service Alliance of Canada knows that.  There were other options 
open to them which they did not choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the member for Winnipeg—Transcona talking about using 
the word “hostage”, I would use the same word against a 
capitalist or a corporation if they were using these kinds of 
tactics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the cash flow and the kind of year that farmers have had 
in western Canada, and in northwestern Saskatchewan for four 
years, they do not need this kind of problem, which is caused by 
events beyond their control.  With the cash crunch and the 
disaster relief program we have had to put in place, it will be 
difficult to attain the targets to actually get the amount of 
money required to the farm community, which they do indeed need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actions of the Public Service Alliance of Canada, causing 
disruptions to delivery times, can and will affect future sales. 
I will quote what the minister of agriculture had to say today. 
He said “Grain prices are low enough that Canadian farmers do 
not need anything else reducing their incomes. Unfortunately, the 
Canadian Wheat Board has informed us that in the last 48 hours it 
has lost a $9 million sale because the reliability of our 
delivery system is in question”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say again, the leadership of the Public Service Alliance of 
Canada knows that.  They knew it before they took these actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, there was a press release from the Canadian Wheat Board 
itself, which stated:  “The CWB lost a CDN $9 million sale to an 
Asian buyer in the past 48 hours.  It has also had to forgo sales 
to several customers in other areas because timely delivery for 
nearby shipment positions could not be guaranteed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This indeed is a serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we balance this with the collective bargaining process? 
Were there other options available to the Public Service Alliance 
of Canada?  In fact the kind of action they took previously, 
which we were able to work around, was putting pressure on the 
government and was putting pressure on industry to come to a 
negotiated settlement.  There certainly were options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question the leadership.  In fact I believe members of the 
Public Service Alliance of Canada should be questioning the 
leadership of that organization as a result of these actions 
because they have put the government, which has a desire to 
believe strongly in collective bargaining, in the position of 
perhaps having to implement back to work legislation.  I think 
the leadership of that organization should be questioned for 
these kinds of tactics which hold Canadian farmers hostage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying that the actions that were taken by PSAC in 
Vancouver were unnecessary.  They hurt the farm community and 
they hurt the ability of the membership of PSAC to achieve a 
settlement through negotiation.  They have erred.  They have 
erred in targeting Vancouver as the pressure point for a complete 
shutdown and have caused serious damage to our ability and our 
reputation as a country to serve and supply grains to 
international markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands, there are 17 ships idle or waiting to load grain 
and that number will grow.  If these pickets continue for three 
weeks or so there could be 35 ships in port waiting for grain, 
grain worth $230 million. 
That is a large sum of money in any context, but to Canadian 
grain farmers it is more than a figure, it is their livelihood.

<A HREF="#LINKT111"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand what some members have said in terms of income tax 
returns being slowed down and, yes, that is serious.  Those kinds 
of actions are taking place in my own riding.  However, that is a 
slowdown in which income will eventually come.  The situation in 
Vancouver is specifically targeted at terminal elevators and is 
jeopardizing livelihoods.  It is not a delay in terms of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In ordinary times the work of the Canadian Grain Commission in 
keeping the safe and orderly movement of grain across Canada is 
easily recognized as important.  The commission plays a very 
vital role in support of the grain industry, in setting grain 
standards, performing grain quality research, serving as official 
inspectors and weighers, and regulating the system to ensure safe 
and dependable grain delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current difficult conditions we have to congratulate 
these people.  The efforts of the commission to keep grain moving 
despite the PSAC strike and other job actions are even more 
important.  The grain commission has monitored the situation and 
responded with direct action to keep the grain moving as best it 
can.  That effort continues and I think all hon. members should 
appreciate the work being done to make sure that Canadian farmers 
will see their grain reach the markets that the markets so 
clearly want to buy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been rotating strikes affecting the movement of grain 
since January 18.  The first in the port of Vancouver occurred on 
January 25.  I think it is worth noting that the system was never 
entirely shut down and, indeed, was operating thanks to grain 
commission management which kept grain shipments moving as best 
they could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a cross-country effort because some of 
these Canadian Grain Commission managers are experienced 
weighers.  There are only seven of them in the country and they 
manoeuvre to try to keep the flow of grain moving as best they 
can under very difficult circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pressure was on by the Public Service Alliance of Canada. 
The grain was moving.  Livelihoods were not seriously 
jeopardized.  That was a tactic that could have moved to 
settlement by negotiation instead of, potentially down the road, 
settlement by back to work legislation because of this action by 
the leadership of PSAC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today my office in Prince Edward Island was occupied by about 25 
PSAC workers who are on a rotating strike action.  They outlined 
their concerns in a very serious, deliberate and I think very 
legitimate way.  They brought their concerns forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of their big concerns is regional rates of pay.  I can 
understand that.  I speak to the President of the Treasury Board 
when I say this.  I believe the government, in and of itself, has 
to seriously get back to the bargaining table and seriously 
consider the regional rates of pay issue.  I think it has been 
doing a reasonable job in terms of those issues, but it takes two 
to tango, and the government also might have to make a little 
stronger effort in terms of settling this issue on the basis of 
fairness and equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the near future I will be raising with the President of the 
Treasury Board the fact that PSAC workers have said to me in my 
riding that 97% do have regional pay rates.  I am not sure if 
that is correct or not.  If we are only dealing with 3%, why deny 
those three?  I will be raising that with the President of the 
Treasury Board in a letter at a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue indeed has to be solved.  The bottom line is that the 
actions which have led to this emergency debate tonight were 
actions taken by the Public Service Alliance of Canada in 
targeting and shutting down grain movement in the port of 
Vancouver.  There were other options available.  The leadership 
has jeopardized the ability to get a settlement at the 
negotiating table. 
I encourage the membership of the Public Service Alliance of 
Canada to tell its leadership that we have to go back to the 
table, that we have to negotiate in good faith and that we should 
not take action that will jeopardize the livelihood of third 
party victims.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to 
participate this evening in this important debate on grain 
movements and current disruptions at the port of Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the members opposite, government members too recognize the 
importance of bringing a speedy resolution to the labour dispute 
because of the impact it is having on the grain movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country is a trading nation.  This is particularly true of 
the grain sector.  Buyers around the world prefer Canadian grains 
over those from most other countries because of the quality of 
the product we have to offer.  Those buyers trust us to provide a 
quality product and they want assurance of supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years this government has worked closely with the 
entire Canadian grain industry to improve export performance and 
to institute measures to limit disruptions in the export of 
grains.  We made amendments to the Canada Labour Code to ensure 
that longshoremen continue to provide services during a strike or 
lockout.  More recently we received the Estey Report on grain 
handling and transportation.  Working with former Justice Estey's 
report the government will continue to take steps to improve the 
grain handling and transportation systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We take these initiatives to ensure that we can provide buyers 
with a reliable source and supply of Canadian grain.  We do not 
want to jeopardize the gains that we have made.  That is why, as 
a government, we are deeply committed to bringing about an end to 
the current disruptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recognize that our grain producers and others in the 
grain industry are innocent third parties who are caught in this 
dispute.  We recognize the financial implications of lost sales 
both now and in the long term.  We previously heard about a 
contract that we have already lost in the last 48 hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Canadians as a whole may not recognize is the incredible 
importance of the grains and the oilseed industry to the Canadian 
economy.  The sale of grains and oilseeds and related products 
injects about $12 billion a year into our national finances.  The 
impact of this strike will be felt from sea to sea to sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of exports, the value of Canada's sales in those 
products was estimated at more than $6 billion in 1998.  These 
products are shipped around the world.  The United Kingdom was 
once our chief customer for exporting grain, but today it is 
Asia.  At the same time, we have developed products for very 
specialized markets in countries such as France and Brazil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure members of this House that as we work our way 
through this disruption and beyond we will be there working hand 
in hand with the industry to maintain the confidence of grain 
buyers.  We will be reminding buyers that Canada's agriculture 
and agri-food sector is a reliable supplier of safe and quality 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has often said, our 
red maple leaf is recognized around the world as a symbol of 
quality.  I am sure we are all proud of that maple leaf and we 
want to do everything we can to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our annual exports of all agriculture and agri-food products 
have been at $20 billion plus for the past two years.  The 
industry is keen to see this figure grow year after year.  We 
have set a goal of capturing 4% of the world's agriculture and 
agri-food trade by the year 2005.  This would be great for all 
Canadians.  This government is committed to helping industry meet 
that goal.  We are working hard to improve our export market 
access and to help industry promote its products around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going into the next round of World Trade Organization 
negotiations at the end of this year, we will be pursuing a more 
open, fair and market oriented agricultural trading system.  A 
successful outcome at the WTO is a prime goal of the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food.  As recently as last week the minister 
was in Japan and made that point to industry organizations, 
governments and representatives alike.  I know my hon. colleagues 
from the PC Party and the Bloc will concur in the efforts made by 
our minister last week because they were there to accompany the 
minister and to see the great work that Canada is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our minister also met with several grain and oilseed buyers. 
These buyers were aware of the current situation in Canada and 
they sought our assurance with respect to reliability of supply.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the minister's return to Canada he has been in contact 
with the grain industry and his provincial counterparts. The 
minister is fully aware of the impact of disruptions at the port 
of Vancouver and no one is more anxious than he that this 
situation be resolved quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament I urge a speedy end to this picketing 
and the disruptions affecting grain shipments through the port of 
Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize there is a lot at stake not only for the grains and 
oilseed industries but for the Canadian economy as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight we are talking about one of the world's two most 
important commodities.  I am sure that someone would say water is 
our most important commodity, and we are blessed with an ample 
supply, but certainly number two in importance is food. What we 
are discussing here tonight is the shipment of food. There are 
people around the world waiting and counting on this food so they 
can survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona would concur, I 
believe, that grain movement is for the common good of all 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The HRD committee heard many witnesses when we were changing the 
labour code so that grain would move on the prairies across this 
great country and through the Rockies to the west coast.  Many of 
the witnesses said we could not treat grain any different from 
any other commodity.  However, grain is food and we have to treat 
it a bit different than we do coal or sulphur or potash.  It is 
food and there is nothing more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad, as I am sure the opposition is, to see our government 
supporting our western farmers because no one works harder than 
the producers of grain.  On a daily basis our farmers are 
confronted with various risks such as weather, pests, disease, 
market fluctuations and cut throat competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am ashamed when I see the prices our farmers are receiving for 
this wonderful product, the best grain in the world.  However, 
this is not a local situation.  It is a Canadian challenge but it 
is not just here.  Around the world grain prices are lower than 
at any time during the dirty thirties and we have to work 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food announced 
last month the details of the agricultural income disaster 
assistance program.  Our government is proud to support our 
producers.  We are proud to have the support of the other parties 
here this evening.  I know they have made a few comments about 
what we have to do with the labour code in the future, but 
tonight and tomorrow we have to work together to ensure this 
grain gets moving so we can help feed the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the purpose of 
the emergency debate requested by the hon. member for 
Selkirk—Interlake is to put pressure on the government to force a 
return to work by the federal government blue collar workers 
responsible for loading grain at the port of Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 70 employees in question are members of the Public Service 
Alliance of Canada, which is currently in conflict with the 
federal government in connection with the renewal of collective 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duties of these employees are performed within the framework 
of the Canada Grain Act, and the use of replacement workers is 
banned in such cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up until March 14, the PSAC members were striking on a rotating 
basis and so the grain was still able to move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation changed, however, when the grain export silo 
workers set up picket lines around the five Vancouver grain 
terminals on March 15.  This led to the other terminal workers 
refusing to cross the picket line, so now the grain can no 
longer be loaded onto the ships.  In other words, it can no 
longer be moved, hence the crisis we are faced with at the 
present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is involved little if at all in this local conflict 
between the Canadian Wheat Board and the Public Service Alliance 
of Canada.  But we cannot be insensitive to the situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This strike results in major costs to western farmers who, like 
their Quebec and eastern counterparts, are going through a 
serious income crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could repeat what the previous speaker said, namely that it is 
a shame, given the quality of the grain and products that we 
market in this country, to have such low prices right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strike results in huge financial losses to the Canadian 
Wheat Board, which said yesterday that it lost a $9 million 
contract and had to cancel several other ones, because it could 
not guarantee that the product would be available at the 
specified location and in the required amounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reputation of the Canadian Wheat Board and, indirectly, that 
of western farmers suffer from that situation. In the case of 
export sales, grain quality is not questioned, but our ability 
to deliver the product with consistency is. The delivery date of 
our sales contracts must be respected; our customers demand 
reliability with regard to shipments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the recent trip made to Japan by the Minister of 
Agriculture, one of the primary requirements mentioned by the 
Japanese was the reliability of the shipments of wheat, barley 
and any other product exported to their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation of western farmers is so tragic that the Minister 
of Agriculture is introducing a special program to help them. 
Could it be that his Treasury Board colleague is less sensitive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current crisis in Vancouver and in western Canada in general 
might be less serious if Quebec, Ontario and the maritimes had 
their fair share in the grain transportation sector. Indeed, in 
his recent report based on a thorough review of the grain 
industry, justice Estey shows that Quebec, Ontario and the 
maritimes are discriminated against by the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, the Estey report states, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is recommended that the federal government, in conjunction 
with the Seaway authority, work to encourage the utilization of 
the Seaway by two-way freight traffic into the North and South 
Atlantic region and the central regions of Canada and the United 
States. It is further recommended that the Board continue to 
make every effort to promote sales of Board grains to markets 
which can be economically served by the Seaway. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diversifying means of transportation and routes lessens the 
risks of tension and crisis. People in Quebec, Ontario and 
eastern Canada would be more concerned about the grain issue if 
they had their share of the transportation market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to work legislation should only be a last recourse. 
Have all the other options been exhausted? We believe they have 
not. Striking is a worker's fundamental right and back to work 
legislation would abolish this right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than demanding back to work legislation we must demand 
that the government negotiate in good faith. Freedom of 
association exists in principle in Canada and workers, when they 
have good reason to do so, may go on strike. This is part of a 
fair balance of power, except when the employer, which happens 
to be the government, abuses its legislative power. Again, back 
to work legislation should only be a last resort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to hear today that this was not necessarily the 
purpose of the debate which was rather aimed at highlighting the 
economic impact of the crisis, I would even say psychological 
impact since both workers and farmers are feeling the 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the opinion of our party, it is unacceptable for these 
workers to be deprived of their right to express dissent by this 
last resort solution of special legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, therefore, opposed to special legislation and call upon 
the government to negotiate in good faith and as promptly as 
possible with its blue collar workers, who are on legal strike, 
taking into account the negative impact of the present 
situation, in which the farmers are once again the fall guys, 
the hostages of a lethargic government with little concern for 
the rights and interests of its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The negotiations must be carried to a conclusion, they must be 
continued, before any use of the last resort solution of special 
legislation.  We all acknowledge that there is a crisis, and we 
therefore want to see an agreement to end this strike reached as 
quickly as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are back on your favourite topic again, agriculture. 
It is very important to me as well.  It is very good to see you 
hanging on every word being said tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as Reformers are raising this issue in this emergency debate. 
The whole point of my speech is that innocent third parties such 
as the farmers are being hurt by the strike that they have no 
control over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers on the prairies are hurting already.  Now they are being 
hurt terribly by this.  The government must accept responsibility 
for allowing this situation to develop time after time.  We have 
done this before, déjà vu. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation must not continue.  We have proposed solutions 
for several years such as final offer arbitration.  We cannot 
blame any one party or person for all the problems.  Some blame 
the problems farmers are experiencing on the railways, the 
Canadian Wheat Board, the grain companies or the unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The buck stops with government.  It could have put in place a 
solution.  It did not do this.  Government has the power to bring 
all the players in the game together to solve our grain handling 
and transportation problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may not look like it on the outside but on the inside I am 
jumping up and down and screaming.  We have done this over and 
over.  There is a solution and we are not solving the problem. 
Something must be done to solve the grain handling and 
transportation problems we are experiencing on the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have trouble hearing me when I get too excited therefore 
I will remain calm in my speech.  Really I cannot emphasize 
enough how important this is to my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be dropping a bombshell a little later in my speech, so 
members can be waiting for that.  The minister responsible for 
the Treasury Board said that this strike will begin to cause 
problems for the grain trade on the prairies. I could hardly 
believe my ears.  They have been feeling the impact for a month. 
I made some phone calls in my constituency today.  My staff in 
Yorkton contacted various people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what is happening today.  In Foam Lake, the Saskatchewan 
Wheat Pool says the calls for the Canadian Wheat Board grains 
have been completely stopped.  For the last two weeks they have 
not accepted any board grains.  Their elevator is full. The 
result is that producers are taking their grain to other 
elevators like the ConAgra in Yorkton.  He estimates this west 
coast strike is costing his elevator 100 tonnes a day.  They 
cannot move it.  That is happening already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool in Sturgis has not loaded a single 
rail car since the start of January.  He says the strike means 
there is no way this elevator will be able to receive any grain 
cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They move most of their grain out of the elevator by truck now. 
However, with the road restrictions coming up very shortly they 
will not have this option.  The big trucks will not be able to 
haul grain on the grid roads.  This means a complete shutdown of 
the operation unless they can get some rail cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Kelvington the United Grain Growers said its contract calls 
and car allocations slowly declined over the last couple of 
weeks.  Canadian Wheat Board grains have basically ground to a 
halt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not moving any canola.  It goes to the west coast and 
the strike has stopped sales altogether.  He adds that they have 
only 19 rail cars filled from their elevator since January. They 
have moved 6,000 tonnes less grain than they did at this time 
last year.  This is all in relation to the slowdown in the 
movement of grain and the strike that is occurring right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people listening across Canada do not realize the 
ramifications of this strike, how far down the line the impact 
goes when this occurs at the west coast.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a story of a trucker from Invermay in my riding who had 
a week's worth of hauling grain lined up.  Everything from oats, 
barley, wheat and canola were all picked up at farmers' yards and 
shipped to local elevators.  The elevators have now called the 
farmers and this trucker has been told to cancel his week's worth 
of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The elevators do not have the room to take all the grain he has 
to haul.  This, however, has more than just the implication of a 
lost work week.  This trucker uses a large Super-Bee truck and 
will soon not be able to haul this unit on secondary and grid 
roads as a result of the road restrictions which come on every 
spring.  This means the farmers who want to get rid of their 
grain will have to do so through smaller tandem trucks and 
probably with half loads.  It costs producers a fortune to truck 
small amounts of grain back and forth from the farm to the 
elevator.  The large trucking companies have lost more than a 
week's worth of work because they will be off the road soon and 
will have no income for the next couple of weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This grain strike is not just affecting farmers.  It is 
affecting transportation and many other people.  I hope the 
government is listening and will act immediately.  I am very 
upset the government does not resolve the problem of grain 
movement stoppages.  There are no ministers here right now— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Order, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  I am sorry, Madam Speaker.  I 
listened to the minister's speech and there were no solutions 
offered in that speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is perfectly aware.  It quoted from a Canadian 
Wheat Board news release that said the wheat board had lost $9 
million in sales to Asian buyers in the last 48 hours.  It has to 
forgo sales to several more customers in other areas because 
timely delivery for nearby shipment positions could not be 
guaranteed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board goes on to say either the two direct parties in 
this dispute must find a solution or the government needs to take 
action immediately.  The strike action is affecting Canada's 
reputation as a reliable supplier.  As of today there are 11 
ships waiting at the port for wheat from the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  That is a lot of grain, just for the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head of the wheat board also says the loss of customers is 
costing not only western farmers but the Canadian economy as a 
whole through direct revenue losses, uncertainty in the ocean 
freight market, loss of shipping capacity and loss of customer 
confidence.  These things cannot be recovered easily.  This is 
serious.  This affects all Canadians and they may not even be 
aware of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some confidential sources.  I will reveal some of the 
things they have said regarding this matter.  The first 
withdrawal of services commenced at 11 p.m. on Sunday, January 
24.  I remind members that today is March 18.  On January 24 
there was already a withdrawal of services.  On January 28, 1999, 
the grain companies appeared before a Canada Industrial Relations 
Board with Paul Lordon in the chair for a ruling on subclause 
87(7) of part I of the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been given the impression that this is just happening 
now.  The government had lots of notice about this a month and a 
half ago.  Also this source says that the Canadian Grain 
Commission weighmen are on strike and picketing all five 
terminals.  These are just some facts.  There are five vessels at 
berth and eleven are waiting.  The 16 vessels represent some 
370,000 tonnes of grain that could be shipped.  Of these boats, 
two are at berth belonging to the wheat board and five are 
waiting, belonging to the wheat board, and seven additional 
vessels are due this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CP Rail will not spot empties in the country as of today and I 
have given some examples already.  It has cancelled all car 
allocations for the next week.  CN advises that it is only 
spotting empties today in locations that do not already have cars 
and CN will not be spotting empty cars next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CN has 19 trains built and staged in Vancouver that cannot be 
moved forward.  CN also has 3,400 cars under load near Vancouver 
while CP has 2,300 cars waiting with grain.  In Vancouver CN has 
700 cars.  CP has 850 loaded rail cars sitting in Vancouver at 
the moment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither railway is lifting cars for Vancouver.  To date 2,935 
rail car unloads have been lost at Vancouver.  The industry 
expects to lose 4,200 rail car loadings this week and next if the 
strike and picketing continue.  Each week after that 2,750 cars 
per week will be lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The losses are in the millions and most Canadians cannot 
comprehend how much this affects prairie farmers.  The 
accumulated lost tonnes at this time equal some 642,150. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the ramifications?  Canada's reputation as a reliable 
supplier of grain will suffer immensely.  The results of such 
reputation loss may be lost sales in the future.  That is very 
serious.  We will not just be affected for the short term.  This 
will affect us well into the future.  This statement is made as a 
result of conclusions drawn in a number of government reviews and 
statistics.  It is not just us or this source saying so.  The 
Sims task force, the Industrial Inquiry Commission and the 
Western Grain Marketing Panel all made that very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently grain companies are experiencing operational costs 
considerably above normal in order to handle less tonnes.  Some 
50% of productivity was lost during rotating strikes.  Some 700 
third party employees, that is grain workers, stevedores and ship 
pilots, are unable to earn a living at this time.  This backup in 
the rail system will plug primary elevators costing producers the 
opportunity to deliver grain, which will adversely affect their 
cash flows at a time of year when they need it to prepare for 
spring seeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unreasonable for 70 employees as part of a much larger 
group to be allowed to provide such a large negative impact on 
100,000 grain producers, in excess of 700 company employees and 
hundreds of rail employees.  Seventy grain commission employees 
should not be allowed to put third party grain producers, 
farmers, sales contracts at risk well into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board has to be asked to consider 
options that would allow or direct these employees to continue 
working.  The minister also needs to consider amending the Public 
Service Act with regard to part 1, subclause 87(7). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said I would drop a bombshell and here it is.  Back in January 
the minister knew in advance the result of these work stoppages, 
that they would happen, and he could have done something six 
weeks ago.  In a letter dated January 27, 1999, he was informed, 
as was the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, the Minister of 
Transport, the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board 
and the Minister of International Trade.  They were given in a 
letter clear indications of this problem, and they did nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Grain Commission has provided six supervisory 
personnel who are doing their best to cover a regular contingent 
in excess of 70 weighmen.  Even if no picketing action is taken 
by weighmen, numbers this small have effectively closed port 
operations.  That was told to the ministers.  The results of such 
work stoppages have stopped the unloading of over 700 rail cars 
per day, eliminating the loading of approximately 275,000 tonnes 
of grain.  The backup caused by not unloading rail cars will cost 
Canadian grain producers millions of dollars and impact our 
critical trading relationships with foreign buyers.  This is all 
from a letter that was sent on January 27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian grain industry and in particular western farmers 
are at the mercy of the weighmen.  The minister was told this. 
We are not suggesting that back to work legislation is the only 
alternative. We are asking for the co-operation of all parties, 
including the federal government, in ensuring that the impact on 
western farmers is minimized during this time.  To this end 
members are committed to finding solutions to the present 
situation. 
The government knew well in advance and could have acted, and it 
did nothing for six weeks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Indirect costs to farmers could mount to millions of dollars, 
while the cost of the damage to Canada's competitive position is 
really hard to determine.  AgriCorp agreed several months ago to 
send canola to China at prices that are $60 per tonne higher than 
current values.  The buyer might use this stoppage to break the 
contract.  Who will suffer?  It will be farmers.  Sixty dollars a 
tonne is big bucks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may see a couple of million dollars loss on just one vessel. 
One ship means several hundred million dollars.  The customer 
would be happy to break the contract that he had made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deanna Allen, spokeswoman for the Canadian Wheat Board, says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the dispute prevents the board from filling an order for high 
protein wheat that fetches a premium, the cereal will go to lower 
price contracts and reduce the netbacks to growers.  We could be 
looking at a direct revenue loss because of our inability to 
execute our sales program. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments to the labour code last year designated grain 
shipments as an essential service, preventing most dock workers 
from going on strike or being locked out.  However, the changes 
did not apply to the PSAC members who are in a legal strike 
position and the 700 unionized employees who work at Vancouver's 
five terminals refused to cross the picket lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members need more examples and more facts to back up the 
extent of this problem, Japanese buyers of canola have already 
expressed concern about the build-up of ships in Vancouver. 
Deanna Allen from the wheat board said that nine million sales 
was only part of the picture.  They are regularly losing sales in 
the $2 million to $10 million range in Latin America and Asia. 
These are very real dollars which are not making it to western 
Canada or Canada as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is obviously something wrong with our negotiating system. 
“We are not part of that system but we pay the price.  If the 
people who do the negotiating were affected in their pockets they 
would feel it differently”.  Those are the words of a farmer 
from Manitoba.  He goes on to say:  “The shutdown definitely 
affects our reliability as suppliers.  We could lose customers 
forever”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deanna Allen from the Wheat Board said that there would not be 
late shipment penalties known as demurrage.  That will not apply 
because the Vancouver Grain Exchange issued a declaration that 
freezes the whole process because of the strike.  “This means 
demurrage cannot be levied until 14 days after a strike has ended 
and no customer can cancel a contract”, she said, adding that 
many people assume automatically it will be levied because that 
happened a couple of years ago when there was a cause for delay 
and it was not identified immediately.  Just because demurrage 
cannot be charged does not mean our customers will come back.  We 
will be losing grain sales and it will affect us greatly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Reformers we have proposed final offer selection arbitration 
as a mechanism for settling outstanding issues in sectors where 
continued service is essential to the national economy.  We would 
like to ensure that there is a continuous flow of grain to 
market.  There have been estimates that the grain handling and 
transportation system in western Canada is at a disadvantage of 
about $500 million in my province alone.  This is one of the 
problems which illustrates that something must be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very appreciative of the fact that I was able to address 
this problem this evening.  I am speaking on behalf of the 
farmers in my area.  We would like the government to do 
something, not just solve this in the short term, not just do 
something to get these workers back to work.  We have to address 
this in the long term so that we are not back here every few 
months dealing with another aspect of the problem.  We need to 
solve the grain handling and transportation problems in the long 
term.  I urge the government to do that immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  This is very unfortunate.  It certainly would be nice if 
there were some ministers here to hear this important debate.

Speaker, I am delighted to join the debate.  I will share my time 
with my colleague, the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to discuss the impact of the strike on grain shipment. 
It is very unfortunate that a very small number of PSAC members 
can hold the Canadian grain industry hostage and cause economic 
hardship to Canadian grain producers who are already feeling the 
effects of reduced grain prices on the world market. We are 
nearing the end of the ninth week of the strike by the federal 
blue collar workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first few weeks the grain weighers in British Columbia 
and the lower St. Lawrence River in Quebec exercised their right 
to strike by withdrawing their services.  They have from time to 
time stopped grain shipments out of Vancouver, but this was on a 
rotational basis and they did not prevent longshoremen and 
private grain elevator employees from reporting for work. This 
caused some delays but allowed the loading of ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has only been in the last week that they have escalated their 
activities by resorting to around the clock picketing.  Because 
of union solidarity, longshoremen and grain elevator employees 
have refused to cross the picket lines and have paralyzed grain 
shipments out of Vancouver.  I am from Vancouver and it has 
caused a lot of concern for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of the strike by about 70 grain weighers is being 
felt throughout the whole system.  An increasing number of ships 
are anchored in Vancouver.  This weekend we will have over 20 
ships waiting to load grain to transport to Asia.  Thousands of 
loaded grain cars are backed up on the railway all the way to 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are not getting paid for grain that cannot be delivered. 
Our clients are starting to express concerns about the 
reputation of Canadian grain exports. Grain shipments out of the 
port of Vancouver are worth about $60 million per week.  The cost 
keeps mounting for every day the system is shut down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are having this emergency debate tonight because of the 
action of the Public Service Alliance of Canada and its members. 
They have turned down all the offers made to them by the 
government.  Just this morning it was announced that Ontario 
public servants have accepted a deal that provides for a salary 
increase of 4.2% over three years. In comparison, the last offer 
made by the federal government when the talks ended Friday, March 
12 was for salary increases of just less than 5% over two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might not be appropriate to compare the salary offer made 
last week to federal blue collar workers to that of the Ontario 
government because the working conditions and other benefits 
might not be the same.  On the other hand, the offer turned down 
by the PSAC bargaining team was very similar to what has already 
been offered and accepted by 87% of unionized federal public 
servants, but the bargaining team for blue collar workers 
maintains that it is not enough. 
I find it very difficult to understand why the union would turn 
down a fair wage offer.

financial disaster.  I urge the PSAC members to reach a 
settlement soon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, this is not the 1980s.  This is not the 1970s.  This is 
not the 1960s.  This is the 1990s.  In those other decades, it 
was expected in the labour movement to seek the highest wages 
possible that the company could afford to pay.  Indeed, we saw in 
those days some very high wages in the industrial sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that same period, the federal government and provincial 
governments negotiated very high rate with the public service 
unions. In those days, it was felt that rather than have a 
confrontation with the union, a government could dig deeply into 
the pocket of the taxpayer and literally pay off the union to 
avoid labour strife. This caused a lot of damage in the economy. 
We know some of the examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario Hydro Nuclear is a classic example.  Because the Ontario 
government was so unwilling to negotiate realistic settlements 
with the union, we got an organization that ultimately came to a 
point where it could no longer function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, VIA Rail had the difficulty that the packages for the 
employees were so beautiful, so perfect that it became impossible 
to run passenger trains across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time, I had a vision that we could have a cross Canada 
train like the Orient Express.  I was told that it was impossible 
to do because even though we had the rolling stock, we did not 
have the ability to deal with a union that had the opportunity to 
charge double time, triple time and all kinds of things on a 
train that was going across the country for two or three days. 
What should have been a wonderful idea was impractical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous governments had given away to public service unions the 
right to give reasonable wages.  Instead, they gave very high 
wages to avoid labour strife.  Those were the times when 
governments had money to burn it would seem.  The previous Tory 
government ran up a deficit of $42 billion.  Times have changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1990s in my riding and anywhere in the country where 
unions are a part of businesses that are in global competition, 
the unions have had to face the reality that the wages they seek 
have to be in line with the company's ability to survive 
competitively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, in my immediate region there was a very lengthy 
strike involving meat packers.  It was ultimately settled.  The 
situation was very simple.  There were changes in the global 
economy and changes with respect to free trade with the United 
States. The union could no longer enjoy the very high wages that 
it had.  There was a choice of either taking a rollback or not 
having a job at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the same situation now in steel and in every sector of 
the competitive industry.  Things have changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, there is very little sympathy for unions that are 
in a position to negotiate with a government that has unlimited 
money behind it, taxpayers' money.  People do not have much 
sympathy any more for governments that would cave in to the 
unions, rather than stand up to the unions' demands that are no 
longer reasonable in the context of the 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the Treasury Board president say that he wants to 
settle with these unions but they are asking for twice the going 
rate, twice the reasonable rate. 
I think I can speak for most people in my riding when I say that 
those people are behind the President of the Treasury Board.  We 
have passed the time, thank heavens, when governments should just 
dig deeply in their pockets and give whatever the union demands.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am entirely in agreement with the President of the Treasury 
Board.  He must hold the line here because we can no longer 
return to the past as governments and give whatever is demanded 
of us.  We have a responsibility to the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the other issue.  The other issue is the fact that a 
very small portion of the Public Service Alliance of Canada union 
is holding at ransom the lives, the fortunes and the prospects of 
other Canadians.  I refer especially to the grain farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall two years ago we had before this parliament 
Bill C-66, which was to amend the Canada Labour Code.  There were 
many provisions in that bill but one key provision was that it 
attempted to restrict the ability of third party unions to 
interfere with the transportation of grain in the context of 
labour strife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to that bill way back in 1996, which eventually became 
law.  It was given royal assent just two months ago. I spoke, 
though, in November 1996.  I said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add one other remark about a very positive aspect 
of the legislation.  It addresses a past problem involving grain 
handling at our ports.  Situations have arisen in the past where 
the country was literally held to ransom when our ports were shut 
down, not by the transportation unions alone, but by affiliated 
unions, some very small unions on occasion, that have set up 
picket lines.  Of course, other union organizations respect these 
picket lines and on occasion it led to the paralysis of our 
ability to move our commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision in the bill which limits the right to strike, to 
paralyze ports, to those unions directly engaged in that form of 
activity is a very positive one. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I said.  I regret those remarks because that 
provision was only applicable to outside unions, third party 
unions.  We did not make it applicable to small public service 
unions within the industry.  So we have a situation where some 70 
employees are holding to ransom tens, hundreds of millions of 
dollars of the fortune of other Canadians, of their future, their 
prospects.  Seventy public service alliance union members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Times have very much changed.  We have to reconsider as 
parliamentarians what exactly is the right to strike of union 
employees who are paid by the taxpayer.  What exactly is the 
right that they have to interfere with the lives of other 
Canadians when they are paid by the taxpayer?  The taxpayer is 
their employer.  They are employed by the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be considering very seriously taking 
immediate measures to resolve this situation.  I am a little bit 
more direct than some of the Reform speakers are because I think 
that in the interests of the Canadians who are very adversely 
affected, we should move very quickly in this case. I see no 
problem with back to work legislation.  But we need to take it 
one step further.  We need to review the Canada Labour Code again 
and consider whether that code needs another amendment that will 
close the loophole that enables 70 unionized PSAC employees to 
hold to ransom an entire nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
want to congratulate my colleague from Selkirk—Interlake, the 
Reform critic for international trade—for agriculture, I am 
sorry, although I know he has a keen interest in international 
trade—to have sponsored this debate and raised the matter of 
this severe emergency for western Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I rise to debate I usually say how happy I am to engage in 
the debate, but unfortunately I cannot say that today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not happy at all.  I am very disturbed.  I am very 
frustrated because we have seen this cycle over and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important that we have some historical background 
in order to put this into some kind of perspective. My background 
is agriculture.  We have a farm in Alberta.  I have been farming 
for over 30 years.  In my other life I also was the chairman of a 
canola crushing plant that had international sales, especially to 
Japan.  We faced this issue of labour management problems and the 
fact that we could not deliver our product on time on a number of 
occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a matter of debate with the Chinese and Japanese buyers 
of our product when we were in the crushing business.  It has 
hurt us very severely in the past.  It has hurt us because Canada 
has not been able to get our product to port on time.  It has 
hurt our international reputation and it hurt us financially in 
the canola crushing industry when I was there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first started farming in 1968.  This issue has been with us 
for a long time, labour-management problems at the ports.  There 
is something like 20 labour management units that have the 
ability to shut us down at any one time and we have seen all 
kinds of disruption in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell a story about going to Vancouver with a group of 
farmers to tour the Alberta Wheat Pool terminal. That was back in 
the early 1970s.  We flew to Vancouver and we were to have a look 
at the terminal in operation, our terminal. We owned it.  It was 
a co-op.  What happened?  There was a strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the exact same situation we have today.  Guess who was on 
strike?  It was the official weighers and samplers.  There were 
only five at the Alberta Wheat Pool terminal.  They shut that 
terminal down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was raining, as it often does in Vancouver in the winter. 
The five people were sitting in a car with their pickets leaning 
up against the car.  They shut down the terminal and backed up 
grain right back to the farm gate. The reason?  Other unions 
would not cross that picket line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes on and on.  What government was in power at the time? 
The same government.  The same problems we see today. Nothing has 
changed.  Yet it has had a lot of opportunities to do that.  Does 
it really care at all about what happens to farmers in Western 
Canada?  I have to think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding agriculture is the biggest industry. We have oil 
and gas industries.  We have a very strong forestry sector.  The 
bottom line is that agriculture is there day in and day out.  It 
pays the bills.  When we get disruptions in the grain handling 
system we pay very dearly because over 80% of what we produce is 
shipped out of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of it is shipped out of the port of Vancouver and when 
that goes down, we all go down and we pay very dearly.  There was 
over $60 million last year in demurrage charges.  Who pays it? 
It backs up to the farmers.  They pay it.  Ye, it is beyond their 
control to do anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are looking for leadership from government.  It is one of 
the reasons I got involved in running for parliament.  We are 
simply not getting it.  It is a problem I am very concerned 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My role is the critic for the Reform Party for international 
trade. The international trade committee is doing a study now 
about what we should be trying to negotiate for Canada at the 
upcoming round of the World Trade Organization, the hearings in 
the so-called millennium round. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What good does it do getting market access for our products if 
we cannot deliver them?  It is frustrating beyond belief. We are 
there trying to open up access into other markets, and here we 
are stymied time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1970s we had the second worst labour record to Italy. 
Maybe it has improved in some areas but not in the area of grain 
handling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had this problem before us last year.  We were debating Bill 
C-19.  The Liberals told us all would be well and good.  They 
were to put in a provision in the labour bill that would allow 
the terminals to keep on operating if there was a strike for 72 
hours to load the ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We faced a great deal of pressure.  I know I did in my riding 
from some of the grain companies and farmers who were saying why 
not support that bill.  We said it is a half baked measure which 
will come back to bite us.  That is exactly what has happened.

<A HREF="#LINKT123"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said “Unless you address the whole issue of labour 
management problems and some new process for handling that, you 
have not solved anything.  So you have loaded that one ship out 
on the 72 hours.  Unless you address the whole 20-some labour 
management units that are involved with some kind of process to 
resolve the longstanding situation we have had in this area of 
strife and crisis, we really have not done anything at all”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we were at that port in Vancouver, the Alberta Wheat Pool 
terminal at the time, I talked to a couple of workers from the 
grain handlers who were sitting in the terminal doing nothing 
except for providing security.  That was in the early 1970s.  The 
same weighers and samplers were on strike at that time.  The 
grain handlers have a union of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to a grain handler and said that when we got past the 
situation with the weighers, everything would be running smoothly 
and we would be able to load out the grain.  He said:  “I am not 
so sure.  We have a two year contract.  We were not able to 
settle it until just a couple of months ago.  Now there is only 
about a year left and we will probably be going on strike 
again”.  It is not just them.  It is the railway system workers, 
the labour management units for the stevedores, and on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply have to move to a better system.  What is the use of 
trying to get market access?  What is the use of trying to put 
$1.4 billion into emergency aid for farmers in the prairies if 
all we really need to do is leave some money in their pockets by 
lower taxes and allow for a system that is effective to get our 
product to market on time so we can continue to have a good 
reputation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest there has been a lot of distress in the farm industry 
in the last several years.  The Asian flu was just the last part 
of that. We know commodity prices are off very badly.  Farmers 
are hurting.  Western Canadian farmers are hurting.  We also have 
the severe subsidy-tariff situation, especially in the European 
Union which spent $72 billion on agriculture subsidies last year, 
effectively freezing us out of those markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets even worse.  It freezes us out of the European Union 
markets but it overproduces because it is getting $10 a bushel 
for wheat. What does it do with that overproduction?  It dumps it 
on the world market at fire sale prices. Not only can we not 
access the markets in the 15 countries that are members of the 
European Union but we are frozen out of markets in third 
countries because we face this unfair competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this government doing about it?  What are its 
priorities?  It does not seem to be much in the area of 
agriculture in terms of trade to try to open up those markets. 
It tells us it has to have this so-called balanced position in 
Canadian agriculture. We cannot ask for market access for grain, 
oilseed and beef, those very industries that are essentially 
subsidy and tariff free, because we have to be careful on the 
other side.  We might get hit on our supply-management, the same 
supply-management that enjoys 300% tariffs on lots of our 
products, butter for example, against products coming into 
Canada. The so-called manage position is where the Liberals are. 
They want to ride the fence on everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the Liberals' priorities?  Where are their priorities 
these days on solving this strike?  I do not see them.  I see 
them concentrating on things like gun registration with some $200 
million already in that situation, blowing it out their ears. 
Twenty years from now what will we have from gun registration? 
People will say what a useless exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are their other priorities?  Subsidizing Bombardier with 
$1.2 billion over the last 10 years, and it goes on and on.  Bill 
C-55 is on protecting magazine publishers.  Rogers cable, one of 
the biggest importers of American culture into Canada, has a 
division called Maclean Hunter which cannot function without that 
protection.  That is a real top priority for the Liberal 
government, protecting the subsidized protected industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when it comes to fighting for our farmers for market 
access, we cannot touch that, it is too hot.  When it comes to 
trying to solve some labour-management problems that have been 
with us for over 30 years, we will leave that alone. We cannot do 
anything there.  We would not want to put in final offer 
arbitration such as has been suggested by our member for 
Wetaskiwin.  It is a very good suggestion in order to move along 
a process that is stagnated very badly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I see some movement coming.  The President of the Treasury Board 
tonight telegraphed his position, back to work legislation. Part 
of the reason was in what he said.  There were some real 
difficulties at the Dorval airport the other day.  PSAC workers 
blocked the Dorval airport.  Some people had to walk a whole 
kilometre.  They had to walk around and go a whole kilometre on 
the tarmac to get to their plane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not worry about the farmers who are losing millions and 
millions of dollars in demurrage and lost sales, disrupting a $6 
billion industry.  That is not that important but when it comes 
to disrupting travel at Dorval airport, that is pretty important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we see the writing on the wall.  We will see back to 
work legislation but what has that solved?  Yes, there is a 
band-aid that will order these people back to work but why can 
they not engage in some new thinking about the whole labour 
management process?  We have to move beyond this.  We cannot 
afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that until the government is prepared to do that we 
will see a whole series of band-aids into the future and I do not 
think that is good enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank all my fellow members for the 
opportunity to speak to them about the significant impact that 
rotational strikes being waged by the Public Service Alliance are 
having across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, I will speak about how we arrived at the 
serious issue we have before us today.  Since this government 
returned to the negotiating table with the public service union 
nearly two years ago, I am pleased to report we have reached new 
collective agreements with more than 87% of the unionized 
workforce in the public service of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This includes reaching agreements with some 100,000 employees 
represented by the Public Service Alliance of Canada without work 
stoppages.  Our settlements have been fair and reasonable and now 
thousands of our employees are seeing salary increases as a 
result of reaching these new agreements as well as other 
non-monetary benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately during these same two years and with the same 
Public Service Alliance of Canada we have not been able to reach 
a negotiated settlement for the 14,000 blue collar workers or 9% 
of the government employees they represent.  However, this has 
not been for lack of effort on the government's part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not been for a lack of willingness to be flexible at the 
bargaining table.  This has not been for our lack of capacity to 
move from our original bargaining position.  We have done all the 
above and yet we are still without a settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that the union's inflexibility at the bargaining 
table is beginning to affect many innocent, unrelated parties. 
After nine weeks Canadians across the country and the government 
that serves them continue to be subjected to disruptions, 
inconveniences, significant losses of revenues and in some 
instances acts of civil disobedience and violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the issue of regional pay rates that has led us to the 
bargaining table to a position of not being able to deliver 
important grain shipments, not being able to board airplanes, not 
being able to file our income taxes, not being able to receive 
our income tax refunds and not being able to receive a variety of 
other government services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should know that because of the union's position on 
regional rates federal departments and agencies have been 
subjected to rotating strikes week in and week out.  These 
strikes have closed federal buildings for periods of a day or 
more in cities from Vancouver to Halifax.  The results have been 
temporary disruptions in the operations of the affected 
departments and agencies, an inconvenience to Canadians who want 
to do business with those institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The picket lines are evident to all.  Less clear, at least to 
most people, is what this strike is all about. 
It is in fact about regional rates of pay.  To understand this 
strike one must understand what regional rates of pay are, why 
the government wants to maintain them and what would be the 
implications of accepting the union's demand for uniform national 
rates of pay.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The short answer is that the government pays different rates in 
different parts of the country because living costs and wages 
vary across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the largest employer in Canada we have a responsibility not 
to act in a way that would distort the labour market, especially 
the local market.  Among other things, this means we should not 
create conditions of employment so favourable for our own 
employees that the private sector employees are unable to fill 
their jobs in their enterprises.  By the same token, if we want 
people with the necessary skill and experience we know we must 
pay wages high enough to be competitive in the local market. 
This in a nutshell is why we have regional rates of pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means we must pay a dock worker in Victoria more than one in 
Halifax because living costs are higher on the west coast than on 
the east coast and labour costs in the two regions reflect this. 
Similar differences exist for other occupational groups, mostly 
trades people such as carpenters and plumbers, but also for some 
professionals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not pay more in the high cost areas we will not be able 
to compete for the skills we need.  If we pay too much in the low 
cost areas we put pressure on the local employers to pay more for 
the manpower they need, thus distorting the local labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government we believe this approach is fair to our 
employees, to employers and to workers in different parts of the 
country, and to people in Canada who ultimately pay the 
government's wage bill or have to pay for the professional 
services they need from the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of the House we just heard someone say “Who 
cares?”  But many small business people across this country 
cannot afford to pay the higher labour costs that the Government 
of Canada might be able to afford, which at that point would 
create undue hardships for many of those small business people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see a Reform member on the other side who I know is very 
responsive to small business. I hope he has the opportunity to 
communicate with the rest of his colleagues to express how 
important small business is to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of paying wages that are determined in part by local 
labour market conditions goes back many years in Canada.  The 
1962 Glassco royal commission, whose recommendations underpin 
much of our modern public service, stated the issue very clearly. 
The commission said:  “We do not see why the most important 
employer in the country should take no account of the local 
labour market. If it refuses to take account, it will find itself 
paying more or less than it should.  This”, the commission 
argued, “would serve neither economic growth nor 
competitiveness”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the other side of the House, the Reform Party especially, has 
been talking the last couple of days about competitiveness, I am 
sure they understand the difference of the regional rates of pay 
issue that we are dealing with today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than 30 years the principle has been clear.  The 
government should pay regional rates for employee groups where 
the labour market varies significantly across Canada.  We should 
pay the national rates where there is a national labour market. 
That is what we do and we are not alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider the United States.  Like Canada it is a country with 
major regional economic differences.  The American government 
pays different rates to its blue collar workers that reflect 
regional market conditions.  The variations can run as high as 
39% above local wage levels in the best paid zones to 16% below 
them in the lowest paid zones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out this evening to all members who are 
here because of their concern over the impact that this strike is 
having on Canadians, on government operations and on farmers that 
the system is not perfect.  In any effort to define a regional 
labour market specific local circumstances can vary to the 
benefit or disadvantage of workers and/or the employer. 
That is why in the recent rounds of collective bargaining, which 
this government believes in, we have worked with the unions to 
try to arrive at a system that is fair and effective for both 
sides so that we can look at things on a long term basis and 
continue supporting the collective bargaining rights of workers 
with the employer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have, for example, reduced the number of pay zones, to 
simplify comparisons and to make pay administration easier, from 
10 to 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there an alternative to regional rates of pay?  The union 
argues that there is.  They are striking today because they are 
seeking a single national rate for the affected occupational 
groups, irrespective of regional circumstances.  We do not think 
such an approach would be fair or in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paying the same rate across the board would mean paying some 
people too much and others too little.  Neither is desirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind members of the House that as an elected government 
responsible and accountable to Canadians we must balance and 
abide by the rules of both the national and local markets.  We 
must pay wages high enough to attract and retain the quality of 
labour that we require and are proud of, and not so high that we 
cannot afford to maintain our operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, at the end of the day the government, as the employer, 
is not an employer like any other.  Our obligation to act in the 
public interest colours our approach to every issue, including 
matters raised at the bargaining table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not like strikes any more than Canadians 
who are prevented by picket lines from making a payment, 
collecting a benefit or searching a job board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have been more than tolerant for the past nine 
weeks.  We are prepared to maintain a system of pay rates for 
public servants that is fair to all concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying that as a government we are prepared 
to examine all of the options.  We must look at every possibility 
to resolve this issue in an expedient manner.  We must put an end 
to the impasse that these rotational strikes are having on 
Canadians who deserve to receive responsive service at a 
reasonable cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We respect the collective bargaining process, as is shown by the 
87% of workforce agreements that we have negotiated with the 
unions.  We have offered 9%, which is even more than the other 
unions have received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is our ultimate commitment to the people of Canada 
that a solution is needed at once so that the innocent parties 
that continue to do trade and commerce are not affected, such as 
the farmers of western Canada.

Speaker, I cannot say that it is a pleasure to stand in this 
House tonight to speak to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate my colleague from Selkirk—Interlake for 
bringing this debate to the House to try and impress upon this 
government that there is an emergency in the farm community. 
What bothers me even more is that when I look at the government 
today, there is not just an emergency, there is a crisis, a real 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government was elected in 1993 to run the affairs of the 
country, to govern 28 million inhabitants, and it is not capable 
of addressing the problems of 70 weighmen who look after grain 
weighing in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand how it even considers that it should be 
sitting on that side of the House when a little crisis like this 
emergency cannot be addressed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These people have been in a legal strike position for 90 days. I 
would like to see what these members of parliament would do if 
for 90 days nobody sent them their cheques, put food on their 
table or kept things the way they should be.  The crisis is on 
that side.  The emergency is in Vancouver.  Something has to 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember back almost five years ago when we were debating the 
railway strike.  I happened to go through <I>Hansard</I> and I 
picked up a question that was put to the government by my 
colleague on this side of the House, the hon. member for 
Wetaskiwin.  This is what the member asked of the international 
trade minister: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the week long rail stoppage has cost Canada dearly. 
Canada has lost over $5 billion, of which farmers have lost $100 
million, exporters have lost $1 billion and $2 billion has been 
added to the public debt.  These are just the short term costs. 
The total will climb even higher because our clients have lost 
confidence in our transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister for International Trade.  What 
plan does this minister have to address these long term costs? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the reply:  “Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I understood 
the question”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years later I do not think they understand the question.  I 
was astounded when my colleague from Yorkton—Melville read the 
letter and expected government members to understand what it 
meant.  When they cannot understand a verbal question, how could 
they read a letter and decipher what it means?  That is the 
problem.  It astounds me that these things can continue.  This is 
a prime example of why other countries have lost confidence in 
the affairs of this country.  That is why we have a 65 cent 
dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I started farming in 1957 through 1972 I remember that the 
dollar was always pretty well par with the U.S. dollar.  In 1976 
it started falling.  It had climbed to a height of 110 cents to 
the U.S. dollar.  It was 10% over par.  The assets that I gained 
up to 1976 are now only worth 65 cents of that value.  How can a 
country remain stable?  How can a country be productive?  How can 
we protect the living standards of future generations if this is 
what we are experiencing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 26 years that I farmed we had at least 16 or 17 work 
stoppages in the grain handling system.  Every time we farmers 
thought of harvesting a crop to get compensation for the input 
costs we had for our labour, somebody along the line knew that we 
were held hostage and they could force government or industry to 
increase wages or do less work.  We were supposed to become more 
competitive and more productive.  We were supposed to keep on 
surviving.  It has reached the point today that it is impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just happened to pick up one of the householders that my staff 
was preparing.  It says “Foreclosure”.  I wondered what they 
were talking about.  I saw the costs that this government spent 
on golf balls and tees during the last year.  I looked down the 
line and I saw that foreign affairs spent $2,500 on golf balls 
and tees.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Go to the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, zero for 
balls and $192 for tees.  How can we can have a golf game when we 
only have tees?  That is the attitude the government takes toward 
agriculture.  It is astounding.  That is the fact. How can we 
deal and maintain an industry with that type of attitude? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear my hon. colleague from Peace River saying he wonders 
what has happened to the government and what it is doing, I 
cannot help but think it is sleeping tonight.  What else could it 
be doing? Is there nobody here?  The House should be full, should 
it not?  I think the spirits are there.  We awoke one from the 
dead.  Isn't that a friendly disposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear of 2,700 rail cars not being unloaded every day it 
does not mean that it is just those workers at the port who are 
not working. It means there are another couple of thousand 
workers down the line, on the railroad, on the elevator, in the 
trucking company who also are not working.  Who will pay those 
wages?  Businesses have to keep these people on staff because 
they are under contract.  It all comes finally out of the 
farmers' pockets.  They are killing the industry completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For five years we have been in the House and we have seen it 
continue year after year.  We have come to the point now where it 
is almost a sin to produce food because somebody will be in 
trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young farmers today cannot survive.  Even with either the 
husband or the wife working outside the farm, they continue to 
pay input costs.  Taxes on farms have gone up on average from 8%, 
9% to 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Regina two weeks ago at a farm rally and I started 
talking to some of the Saskatchewan farmers. It is sad.  It is 
disastrous.  Saskatchewan farmers have not paid at least 50% of 
their property taxes for last year.  We talked to one fuel dealer 
who had 10 bankruptcies since Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are waiting for the aid promised by the Liberal 
government.  For almost a year we warned this government there 
was a crisis. Maybe in June they will get some money.  Maybe 
there will not be any money because many people have had losses 
over three years and will not qualify for that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the fuel dealers told me he had a fuel bill of $350,000 
from one of the big operators.  We have come to the point where a 
10,000 acre farm is not big anymore.  One of the farmers just 
west of Regina was telling me that he put in 11,000 acres last 
spring.  He could have had another 7,000 acres from neighbours if 
he had picked it up to farm it.  He said “We have worked hard. 
We have been entrepreneurs.  We have a trucking company that my 
daughter manages”.  They run 17 Peterbilt trucks on the highway. 
They have two private fertilizer companies.  One of them is run 
by the wife and the other one is run by the daughter-in-law. 
This is a multimillion dollar operation.  The gentleman told me 
“If we do not get out of farming in the next year or two, we 
will have lost all the assets that we worked for all our life”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a disaster.  That is not just an emergency. It is a 
crime when people who produce the most important product in the 
world cannot have a viable operation.  This reminds me of a 
country I was in in 1981; 20,000 hectares in a communal farm and 
people are starving.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One third of their food was produced on the little quarter acre 
plots where the workers lived, not on the farms.  We are becoming 
a country with huge corporate farms that are so inefficient but 
so productive that they are killing themselves.  That has to 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has to start realizing that if we are supposed 
to import our food instead of producing it ourselves, we will not 
have a 65 cent dollar.  We will probably have a Mexican peso.  I 
do not want to see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back about four years when I rose in the House on one of my 
first speeches.  I compared this government to the first 
self-propelled red combine that I bought.  I do not know how many 
people remember that combine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I see a big semi-truck sitting on that side, a government 
that should be able to govern this country like nobody's 
business.  For some reason I see that semi-truck sitting there 
and it is not moving.  It is not doing what it was built for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has gone wrong with that truck?  It ran out of gas.  I have 
seen it sitting for five years.  The motor has ceased. It cannot 
move.  It cannot even be dragged out of there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see grass over the wheels. There are tires on that big semi 
but they are all rotten.  There is no rubber at the bottom.  It 
could not roll even if it were pulled.  That is what I see across 
the aisle today as far as the government is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look a little further.  There should be some value in that big 
semi-truck.  There is some value.  The rats and the mice are in 
it.  They have been using the cushion seat for housing.  If 
someone wanted to get into that truck and drive it, those springs 
would be very hard in some places, not to mention the smell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The combine was a bad example but this truck really scares me. 
If we have to get rid of that animal, there is sure going to be 
some smell around this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will we handle it?  Will we have enough gas masks? Will we 
have enough equipment to remove it?  The job will have to be 
done.  It cannot continue like this. It may be comical but there 
is a lot of truth to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have one of the greatest countries in the world.  We have 
gone from zero debt to $600 billion.  Tell me why. In 30 years, 
three decades, this debt has built up not because this country 
was not great but because the management by previous governments 
during those three decades did not do their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They let the future generations of this country down.  Someday 
they will have to pay for it.  They will have to give account of 
what has happened.  The pay day is coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see in the 21st century a change where we will forget what 
type of politics was performed in the House for three decades. 
We will try to bury it and start all over again.  We will give 
future generations hope, something to trust in, something they 
can build on, a place where they can raise their families and be 
proud of where they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today when I see 70 workers shutting down the whole country and 
a government sitting on that side not doing its job, it is 
disastrous.  It is criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how this change will come but I can guarantee it 
will come.  It has come in every other country where this type of 
situation has developed.  I know we will not like it when it 
comes. 
If we are not prepared to tackle a little problem where 70 people 
can stop a whole nation, what will we ever do if we have a 
problem that is huge, a problem that needs courage and a problem 
like our past generation had to deal with when foreign nations 
attacked their freedom and their democracy?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, that is a tough act to follow from an hon. gentlemen I 
regard as one of the most effective speakers of this place and a 
true quintessential prairie gentlemen, the member for 
Portage—Lisgar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise in debate on this emergency motion with 
respect to the strikes we are facing in the ports in Vancouver. 
I would like to broaden my comments to address the impact of the 
strike on the delivery of services by Revenue Canada at tax 
centres across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard plenty of evidence and testimony this evening 
about the kind of debilitating impact this strike action is 
having on the tens of thousands of Canadian grain farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It truly amazes me, as somebody who grew up in a small prairie 
farming town, to see that the more than 120,000 grain farms 
across western Canada should be held hostage by 70 individuals 
picketing the terminals at the ports of Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is beyond belief that we have allowed a system to continue 
year after year and decade after decade which can see an entire 
industry, hundreds of communities, tens of thousands of families 
and an entire way of life, an entire regional economy, put at 
risk and damaged by the irresponsible actions of a few and the 
inaction of an irresponsible government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just by delaying the delivery of this grain to the ships waiting 
in port by even a few days incurs an enormous cost that gets 
passed on to prairie grain farmers, perhaps the people least 
equipped to deal with this kind of economic difficulty at this 
time.  Prairie grain farmers are already suffering from the 
losing end of an international grain war and historic lows in 
commodity prices.  Prairie grain farmers are suffering from 
historic highs in input costs and who are suffering from historic 
highs in government taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the beautiful prairie provinces a sad story is unfolding 
as we see once proud and vibrant farm communities shrinking 
slowly and the lifeblood being sucked out of them as the 
agricultural economy suffers year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that in one area where government could make a 
difference, by ensuring an unimpeded flow of goods to port and 
abroad, it does not take responsibility to ensure that happens? 
We clearly are limited in the authority we have to address the 
depression in commodity prices caused by European and American 
subsidies.  There is one thing at least that we in parliament can 
clearly do to prevent this from happening, to end the imminent 
threat which is the cause of this motion tonight by whatever 
means legally necessary but, more important, to remove from a 
handful of union organizers the sword of Damocles which hangs 
permanently over the entire western grain industry.  That 
solution would be to declare the jobs at these ports part of an 
essential service and to require binding arbitration if 
settlements cannot be reached so that we can never return to the 
economic pain being caused day by day as this strike drags out.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other members of my caucus have remarked, this is not the 
first time we have seen a strike of this nature.  Unless the 
government finds a more fundamental solution it will not be the 
last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this is an emergency debate, it ought not to be a debate 
just for the situation we face now.  The solution the government 
seems to be headed for of back to work legislation ought not to 
be seen as a long term solution.  It is a short term, knee-jerk 
response to a short term problem.  We need to fundamentally 
change the nature of government labour relations when it comes to 
critical government regulated industries of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hearken back to 1980-81 when then President Ronald Reagan had 
just assumed the office of the American presidency.  He was faced 
with a strike of air traffic controllers across that country who 
refused to arbitrate or negotiate and who were clearly an 
essential service.  They had shut down the entire American 
transportation infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Reagan made it very clear that they were in his view 
an essential service and if they did not go back to work within 
48 hours they would be let go.  The union organizers called his 
bluff, but ultimately President Reagan did what was best for 
Americans, their economy and their transportation infrastructure. 
He laid down the law and demonstrated what an essential service 
really means by taking drastic action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not see that kind of strike action happening now in the 
United States because it has been declared an essential service. 
We ought to do the same thing in Canada where we are talking 
about small handfuls of people who can literally stop the 
momentum of an entire regional economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want now to turn my attention to another problem which is 
growing in proportion.  As we speak this evening there are 
probably PSAC organizers across the country planning pickets 
tomorrow for yet another day around regional tax centres operated 
by the Department of National Revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they do this, what happens?  The processing of tax returns, 
tax rebates, the child tax benefit and all taxes and transfers 
administered by Revenue Canada simply shut down.  This is a 
function that is absolutely essential to the operation of 
government.  We are talking today about nearly a million tax 
returns being frozen in the system at Revenue Canada.  This means 
delays of days and probably weeks.  If this carries on, who knows 
how long the delays will be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy for us as parliamentarians to bemoan the frustration 
felt by Canadians and the inconvenience of all this, but we ought 
not to lose sight of the fact that hundreds of thousands of 
Canadians rely on the cheques that are being held hostage in 
those tax centres tonight.  That is money that does not belong to 
the government, to the union bosses or to the bureaucrats.  It 
belongs to the people to whom those cheques should have been 
issued days ago, and should be issued tomorrow, but will not be 
because this government refuses to act to ensure that those 
Canadians have the financial resources that belong to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about low income people, among others, who quite 
literally depend on the timely delivery of GST rebate cheques, 
their income tax refund, the child tax benefit or any other 
number of programs administered by the Department of National 
Revenue. They depend on those cheques not as discretionary income 
but as essential income.  They depend on those cheques to pay the 
rent and to buy groceries.  We are talking about money that is 
absolutely essential to the livelihood of many Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot allow this to continue unanswered.  We cannot allow 
rogue action by a certain handful of union organizers to threaten 
the financial livelihood of vulnerable Canadians.  I appeal to 
the government not to continue to delay, to prevaricate and to 
hope for a negotiated solution that apparently has not happened 
and will not happen in the bargaining units we are talking about, 
but to act with speed and with absolute dispatch.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the government that on behalf of my constituents I will 
support any legal action to get those cheques moving out of those 
tax centres where they are today held hostage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply not good enough to solve the problem with back to 
work legislation and to find ourselves reliving this, repeating 
history yet again three or four or five years down the road.  It 
is not good enough for the grain farmers who are hurting today. 
It is not good enough for the low income people and the seniors 
waiting for their cheques from Revenue Canada. We need a 
fundamental top to bottom change in the relationship of 
government to the essential services which we guarantee to 
Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We stand here as parliamentarians in a position of enormous 
responsibility and authority.  We have a fiduciary obligation to 
ensure that the basic essential services necessary to the 
peaceful conduct of the lives of private citizens are carried out 
by the departments, by the apparatus of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It simply is not good enough to let these things happen over and 
over again.  A great thinker once said that history repeats 
itself the first time as tragedy and the second time as farce.  I 
think we are well beyond the stage of farce.  This is the fourth 
or fifth time in my political lifetime that I recall points of 
crisis in labour-government negotiations of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I simply reiterate on behalf of my constituents and 
my colleagues in the opposition that it is time to get on the 
ball.  It is time to stop prevaricating on the part of the 
government.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of National Revenue about the problem at the tax centres today 
and she said “We are concerned and we are looking at it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to see that they are concerned and they are looking, 
but that is not good enough for vulnerable Canadians.  What they 
need is not concern.  What they need is not 
looking. They need action, and we are here tonight demanding that 
the government act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, there 
are two people I would like to recognize tonight before I get 
into my remarks.  The first is the Speaker who agreed when he 
received the letter from the hon. member for Selkirk-Interlake 
that indeed there was an emergency, a crisis in Canada today.  He 
had sense enough to recognize that this was an important issue. I 
congratulate him for allowing the emergency debate to take place 
tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other person whom I would like to recognize is the 
parliamentary secretary who is sitting here on behalf of the 
President of the Treasury Board and who is listening to the 
debate.  I hope he listens very carefully to some of the things 
that have been said and that will be said in the next few 
minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have all the answers but I do have a couple of basic 
fundamental principles that I have found to be true wherever I 
go.  As a businessman this gentleman knows only too well that 
what I will say is exactly what he has practised and what has 
made him a successful business person.  I challenge him to apply 
the same criteria that made his business succeed to what the 
government is supposed to be doing in terms of its labour 
relations and in terms of the management of the economy and the 
finances of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus my remarks on two concepts.  The first one is 
leadership.  The second one is management.  I propose to the 
Liberal government that at the present time the incidence before 
us that has given rise to this debate is merely a symptom of a 
lack of leadership in the government.  It is an example.  It is 
symptomatic of a lack of management or the application of 
management principles and the understanding of the operation of 
those principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move into those two areas to try to show clearly how the 
government is lacking vision.  The number one characteristic of 
good vision a leader must have is a vision about where we are 
going as a nation, where we are going as a corporation, where we 
are going as a business, what will benefit this business, what 
will make it profitable, what will make us succeed as a 
corporation in the environment within which we have decided to 
set up business, what will serve our customers well, what will 
give us the satisfaction, and what will give us a profitable 
organization. 
For that a leader needs a goal and a vision and a clear 
articulation of that vision and of that goal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the vision in terms of reviewing the issue today? There 
is none.  If there was one he would know that labour-management 
principles must be exercised.  We should have smooth and 
co-operative labour-management relations.  Do we have them?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a post office strike two years ago.  It still has not 
been resolved.  The Minister of Labour has extended the deadlines 
for the arbitrator again and again.  I wonder if the hon. 
parliamentary secretary will go to the Minister of Labour and ask 
him to extend the deadline once again.  March 31 is the deadline 
for the arbitrator.  Will it be extended once more? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only vision that is lacking.  A leader is also a 
decision maker.  He knows how to make decisions and does so.  We 
have had decisions made by the Prime Minister.  We have had a 
canoe museum built.  We have had all kinds of interesting 
diversionary tactics to focus attention on everything except the 
solution of the things that we demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will we come to the point where we recognize that we need 
to attack a problem, look at the alternatives, examine the 
implication of those alternatives, choose one, act and go down 
that road?  Have we seen that?  No.  We are lacking on two 
counts: no vision and no decision making apparatus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine how crises have been resolved?  There was back to 
work legislation in the most recent strike at Canada Post.  Has 
it resolved the crisis?  The people are back at work, but what 
has the result been?  It has stymied the negotiations with other 
unions that Canada Post is engaged with.  It has brought about 
the situation that is existing in Vancouver right now.  It is 
affecting all other negotiations.  My hon. colleague from Calgary 
just indicated that it is affecting national revenue and the 
refunds that people are supposed to get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all little crises.  They are not of the proportion of 
the one with the grain handlers, but they show that the 
government is incapable of dealing effectively with its 
labour-management problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Incompetent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  That is the word.  I was going to 
leave that word until later but it is true.  I am happy the hon. 
member is so accurate in his perception.  He recognizes that all 
this is leading to incompetent management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fourth area in which we have no leadership.  A good 
leader anticipates problems.  If there was ever an indication 
there would be problems that could have been anticipated, this is 
one.  It was no secret.  The hon. member for Yorkton—Melville 
referred to a letter.  The problem was laid out in black and 
white.  What did they do?  Nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the only thing.  Did they know that the contract was 
coming up with grain weighers?  Of course they knew.  Notice had 
been given a long time ago.  Did they know that there could be a 
development and an escalation to the point where a strike could 
occur?  Of course they knew.  Did they anticipate what would 
happen if a strike took place?  Did they anticipate what would 
happen if it would shut down the whole system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only answer we received was the one this afternoon in 
question period.  On the eve of the emergency debate, what did 
the President of the Treasury Board say?  He said they had the 
right to associate, the right to organize, and that means the 
right to strike.  Is that handling the problem?  It is anything 
but.  Did they anticipate the problem?  If they did, they 
certainly did not do anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leadership is lacking on at least those four dimensions.  Let us 
look at management.  Management is the ability to apply scarce 
resources—and we always have scarce resources—in such a way 
that we get the desired results.  Let us look at the way in which 
the government has managed its scarce resources.  We have a 
balanced budget.  Guess what?

<A HREF="#LINKT134"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With great pride and pompous arrogance the Minister of Finance 
says “We have balanced the budget.  We have managed the 
expenditures of the government.  We have controlled and done all 
these things and now we have a balanced budget”.  Did he tell 
the Canadian taxpayers that they are each paying $1,300 more so 
the budget could be balanced?  It is the increase in revenue that 
made the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who balanced the budget?  The Canadian taxpayer balanced the 
budget.  That is who balanced the budget.  The government is 
spending more money today than it did before.  The management 
here is on the part of the Canadian taxpayer who is paying more 
dollars into the federal treasury and somehow still is able to 
manage.  That is where the good management is.  It is not on the 
part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of managing effectively, the government and the 
preceding government created at least four examples of intrusion 
by crown corporations.  We can talk about the Business 
Development Bank of Canada, the Canada Post Corporation, the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and the Canadian mint. 
There is a direct intervention into the marketplace, in direct 
competition with other businesses. The government takes money out 
of a successful businesses and brings it over to these 
businesses. This government, which has unlimited resources 
compared to corporations, pits its resources against them and 
expects them to compete successfully.  It does not work too well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how the government intrudes.  I will never forget the 
day.  I was a kid at the time.  Our utilities bill was put in our 
mailbox by a high school or university student who delivered the 
bills on behalf of the utilities company.  It was done at a very 
low cost to the utilities company. All of a sudden this big 
dictum came down that this was illegal.  Canada Post must deliver 
those and the company would have to pay 45 cents, or 50 cents, 
whatever the rate was at that time in order to get those bills 
delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an immediate increase in the cost to the utilities 
company to deliver its bills.  The utilities company had to go to 
the utilities commission to say that it would have to increase 
its rates.  The government had it worked out beautifully. Who 
paid?  The consumer paid.  What kind of management is this?  We 
could get into all kinds of other examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other area, which I think is the most fundamental of all of 
these, is good labour-management relations.  A good manager has 
good labour-management relations.  What seems to have happened 
here is there is labour on one side and management on the other. 
There seems to be this irony that surrounds these negotiations. 
On the one hand management says it wants to run the corporation 
at a profit.  It wants to run the business efficiently.  It wants 
to deliver the services and goods in a timely fashion, in an 
effective way and to do it smoothly and with a profit.  On the 
other hand those on the labour side want to frustrate management 
in whatever way they can so that they can get the maximum out of 
it for them, for their way of living and things of that sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After they have fought they come together and say that now they 
have solved their problems they are going to work together. 
Before that they fought like crazy.  How is it possible that we 
can have a situation where there should be co-operation and 
smoothness when the system we use to determine salary levels and 
working conditions is one of confrontation and antagonism?  It is 
a system that is not working very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a beautiful example of it right now.  It broke down. 
When it breaks down it hurts everybody.  It hurts management.  It 
hurts the supplier.  It hurts the workers.  Those workers are not 
going to recover what they are losing right now.  It is to their 
own detriment that they get into these situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder sometimes where the logic is.  I want to ask a couple 
of questions of the Liberal backbenchers.  Many people over 
there, and I know a number of them personally, are good business 
people.  They have succeeded.  They know what leadership is. 
They know what good management is.  They know what good 
labour-management relations are.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What in the world happened?  What did they do to their business 
sense?  Did they dump it at the door when they walked in here? 
What did they do with the good sound leadership and the vision 
they had?  Did they leave it somewhere?  I do not understand how 
it is possible for these highly professional, highly skilled, 
well educated individuals, these highly successful business 
people in a number of seats across the way.  Somehow that ability 
is not made part of the cabinet.  It is not made part of the 
Prime Minister's leadership in this House.  How can it be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It defies anything within me that they suddenly turn off 
everything they know, everything they have experienced, 
everything they know to be wrong, to simply turn that all off and 
say, “Let us do whatever he says”. It is false, it is 
misleading and it is an insult to the Canadian people.  They 
deserve better.  We have leaders in this country.  I do not 
believe for a minute that there is not leadership on that side of 
the House, but for some reason or another it is not being allowed 
to surface. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can it be that a solid strong professional and a strong 
business person can allow himself to vote against compensating 
the victims of hepatitis C from tainted blood?  How can that 
possibly be?  How can it be when the logic of solid family 
relations is defeated by saying that it is okay to have an 
unequal situation with regard to those who work inside the home 
and those who work outside the home?  How can that be?  But it 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of a leader could not foresee the situation in 
Vancouver?  I do not believe he did not foresee it.  I do not 
believe the minister in charge of the Treasury Board did not 
foresee it.  I do not believe the parliamentary secretary did not 
foresee it.  They chose not to do anything.  That is serious. 
That makes them responsible for the situation we are in.  It also 
means they are responsible to solve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it possible to solve it?  Absolutely.  It can be done in a 
number of ways.  The government can use a patchwork approach as 
it did before and legislate these people back to work, only to 
defer the problem to rise again some other day.  That is not a 
solution. There are solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government going to choose the real solutions, or is it 
going to choose again to do something so we can go through all 
this rigmarole again and in the process hurt farmers, consumers, 
the other people who are employed, the managers, the 
transportation systems and the businesses involved?  Does the 
government want to do that all again?  Why?  Why can we not have 
a Prime Minister, a cabinet and Liberal backbenchers who say that 
it is time to use some common sense and manage the affairs of 
this country in a manner that helps everybody?  Why can we not do 
that?  I am sure we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead what we have from time to time is an absolute standoff 
caused by the arrogance and pomposity that comes from 
self-imposed self-sufficiency. It is a delusion of grandeur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be done.  I challenge the parliamentary secretary who led 
his caucus on the banks so well.  He did a wonderful job.  He 
knew how to work with the people.  He showed leadership.  We have 
not seen that kind of leadership anywhere on the front bench of 
that side of the House.  Yet he is not the leader in that party 
and he never will be the way things are going now because he has 
too much common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we going to do?  I challenge us to apply common sense, 
apply what we know to be true and get serious about the things 
that really matter to us as people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is no great big, heavy duty secret.  It does not take a 
rocket scientist to figure out what the mathematical formula is. 
We have to simply do what is right, help people to work together 
and make the conditions such that they can resolve their conflict 
in such a way that everybody is helped, instead of confrontation 
and an antagonism that builds which then takes years to heal and 
in some instances never heals.  Why can we not do that?  We can. 
All we have to is want to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the parliamentary secretary, the President of the 
Treasury Board and the Prime Minister.  Do they want to solve the 
problem in a permanent way or do they simply want to do another 
piecemeal operation which will only arise again in a different 
fashion and on another day?
