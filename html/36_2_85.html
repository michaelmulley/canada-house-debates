the honour to present, in both official languages, the second 
report, “Ensuring Accountability: An Interim Report on the 1999 
Internal Audit Report on Human Resources Development Canada 
Grants and Contributions”. I would like to point out that this 
is an interim report.  It is the result of many weeks of hard and 
serious work by members from all parties on the committee. The 
standing committee will be presenting its final report by June 1.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in view of the gravity and the serious situation with 
HRDC, the opposition parties together felt there was no way we 
could accept that report.  We are tabling a dissenting report 
unanimously.  It is rather mind-boggling some of the things that 
were alleged to have happened, such as the misappropriation of 
funds, multiple criminal investigations, grants being approved 
after payments made, withholding of information, allegations of 
falsification of documents, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We felt that the majority report was simply glossing it over and 
not taking the situation seriously.  As a result we want to get 
to the bottom of it for the good of the Canadian public and the 
better use of tax dollars.  We oppose the report and we are 
tabling a dissenting report.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  In my opinion the

there unanimous consent for the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques to present 
a dissenting report?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> I thank hon. members for their support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important point is that the dissenting report is a unanimous 
report by all opposition parties, who noted that the 
parliamentary majority in the committee was following the 
government party line, that is downplaying the HRDC scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our report points out that action must be taken urgently, that 
it is urgent for the past situation to be remedied, not just to 
have a six point plan for the future.  In this connection, the 
interim report will have to influence what is done in future in 
committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance)</B>  moved

evaluations of statutory programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to table this private 
member's bill which I think can provide a great benefit to 
Canadians and the Government of Canada.  Basically it asks that 
all programs provided by the government and all services the 
government provides through its programs be evaluated on a 
periodic cyclical basis by asking four fundamental questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question would be what is the public policy the 
program is designed to address?  Once that is known, the second 
question can be asked, how well are we achieving what we intend 
to achieve?  The third question would be is it being done 
efficiently?  The fourth question would be, can the same results 
be achieved in a better and more efficient way?  The bill says 
all programs should be evaluated on a cyclical basis by asking 
those four fundamental questions.

exhausted all appeals and ask the minister and the House of 
Commons to please allow them to stay in Canada.  Many people in

individuals draw attention to the significant empirical evidence 
for the value of marriage as the cornerstone of public policy 
producing real, tangible public policy benefits. They ask for the 
withdrawal of Bill C-23 which has extended marriage-like benefits 
to same sex couples.  They ask that parliament, and it would be 
the upper house at this point, withdraw Bill C-23 and instead 
affirm the opposite sex definition of marriage in legislation and 
ensure that marriage is recognized as a unique institution and 
the cornerstone of public policy.

provision, for the protection of our children.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 2000 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK42">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 12 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-32, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in parliament on February 28, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great pleasure that I rise today to speak on Bill 
C-32, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled 
in parliament on February 28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with important measures, such as increasing the 
Canada health and social transfers, reinstating full indexation 
of the personal tax system, increasing the Canada child tax 
benefit amounts, increasing the foreign content amount for RRSPs 
and amending the Employment Insurance Act, among other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today our high corporate and personal tax rates create a 
competitive disadvantage between Canada and our trading partners 
in today's global economy.  It is clear that competitive tax 
rates are essential.  Meaningful tax reductions combined with tax 
reform will increase both economic growth and opportunities for 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Prime Minister has suggested that young Canadians 
should leave the country if they are unhappy with Canada's taxes. 
This kind of thinking reflects a sixties or seventies view of the 
world.  This option, unfortunately, is becoming increasingly 
appealing to many young Canadians, particularly those in the high 
tech sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canada loses its best and its brightest young people, it 
loses both the capital and the talent essential to generate a 
higher level of productivity and innovation.  The Conference 
Board of Canada states that the number of skilled Canadians 
moving to the U.S. has increased from 17,000 in 1986 to 98,000 in 
1997.  This is a staggering sixfold increase in just 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last five years there have been 50 different tax 
increases.  Canadians now pay on average about 47% of their 
income in taxes.  Government revenue has increased by $40 billion 
since 1993, including a hike of $24 billion in personal income 
tax revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 2000 budget was the tax cutting budget.  Before this budget, 
Canada had the highest personal income tax in the G-7 and the 
second highest corporate tax in the OECD.  Surprise, surprise, 
after these measures were implemented, due to more innovative and 
aggressive tax cutting strategies by other countries, we will 
still have one of the highest tax burdens in the industrialized 
world, yet the government claims that it has put Canada on the 
right track for the 21st century.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to look inward when it should be 
looking outward.  Our trading partners have pursued policies of 
lower taxes, less regulation and lower debt and their levels of 
growth have been striking.  For example, Ireland's real GDP per 
capita growth has been 92% from 1988 to 1999.   GDP per capita 
increased 18% in the U.S. during the same period and in the U.K. 
and Germany by 14%.  In Canada our GDP per capita growth was only 
5% during this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, since 1990 American net disposable income per 
capita has climbed over 10%, while Canadian real disposable 
income has fallen by 8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the government has had at least $115 billion 
available to provide all Canadians with broad based, meaningful 
tax relief.  The finance minister pretends to be listening to the 
call for tax relief and for meaningful action on the health care 
front but he is not listening hard enough.  The 2000 budget falls 
short of its potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case for deep and immediate tax cuts is real.  Canadians now 
pay about 47% of what they earn in taxes to all three levels of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party of Canada firmly believes that Canadians have 
suffered long enough.  They should not have to wait until after 
the next election for tax relief that falls far short of what 
could have been delivered.  The government has a surplus because 
taxes are too high.  That surplus ought to be returned to the 
Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasing the basic personal income amount by only $100 this 
year, as the government has proposed, works out to be about 33 
cents a week, or only $17 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister's poor plan means that lower income 
Canadians will still pay taxes on earnings as little as $8,200. 
When we add on provincial taxes and payroll taxes, governments 
are taking away as much as 30 cents on the dollar from people 
with virtually no income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government fails to mention is that since 1993, due to 
bracket creep, the government has actually dragged 1.4 million 
low income Canadians under the tax roll for the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party would raise the basic personal amount from its 
current level of $7,131 to $12,000.  Increasing the personal 
amount to $12,000 would remove 2.5 million Canadians from the tax 
rolls and could save an individual taxpayer up to $1,200 
annually.  This tax cutting measure would benefit all Canadians 
but particularly those in the low and middle income classes.  I 
feel it is indefensible that right now in Canada someone making 
as little as $7,131 is paying income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest single disappointment in the bill is its failure to 
address the real needs of Canada health care.  At one time the 
federal government shared the cost of health care 50:50 with the 
provinces.  In recent years that share has been reduced so that 
now only 13 cents of every dollar spent on health care in Canada 
comes from the federal government.  Meanwhile, inflation, 
population growth and the aging population are increasing health 
care costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brian Tobin, premier of Newfoundland, has said that the 
government missed the boat by not reinvesting in health care. The 
Canadian Health Care Association has said that the budget does 
not recognize the severity of the current health care crisis in 
Canada.  They are right.  However, the government has again 
refused to restore cash payments under the Canada health and 
social transfers to 1993 levels.  A one time payment out of 
lapsing year funds of $2.5 billion does not provide the kind of 
long term stability that our health care system needs.  It is 
essential that the CHST funding be restored to the 1993-94 
levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no long term plan to save health care. 
Instead, it has chosen simply to put a band-aid over an arterial 
wound.  Further, there is no serious intent on the part of the 
federal government to sit down with the provinces and at least 
attempt to fix the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 amends the Employment Insurance Act and the Canadian 
Labour Code to double the duration of maternity and parental 
leave to one year.  However, the government has continued to 
refuse to reduce the ridiculously high EI premiums.  This year 
the government expects to collect over $18 billion in EI premiums 
but only pay out $12 billion in benefits.  That is a surplus of 
$6 billion.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada proposes that EI 
premiums be reduced immediately to $2 per $100 of insurable 
earnings from the current level of $2.40. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI premiums are a regressive tax on the poorest of Canadians. 
Somebody making $39,000 per year in Canada pays the same amount 
in EI premiums as somebody making $300,000 per year.  It does not 
seem like a fair system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is making it harder and harder to qualify 
for benefits.  Currently only 30% of applicants who pay into the 
system actually qualify for assistance when they need it. Changes 
are needed to the EI system so that people can make proper use of 
what the system was designed for:  help those who paid into it. 
It is not to be used as a fund to pad government books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax grab from the EI fund of $19 billion that the government 
has taken from workers and employers is disgraceful and shows the 
true intentions of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current arbitrary 20% limit for foreign content penalizes 
investors when returns from foreign investments are higher than 
returns on investments made in Canada.  Bill C-32 increases the 
current limit of 20% to 25% for the year 2000 and to 30% in the 
following year.  The PC party proposes that we increase this to 
50% over the next two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget was called the education budget and the 
following year 12,000 graduates in Canada were forced to declare 
bankruptcy.  The 1999 budget was called the health care budget, 
but over the last year hospital waiting lists have grown longer 
and the crisis in health care has become even bigger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 2000 budget has been dubbed the tax cutting budget, yet 
after these measures in Bill C-32 are implemented, we will still 
have the highest personal taxes in the G-7 and the second highest 
corporate taxes in the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain measures within Bill C-32 that the Progressive 
Conservative Party support, such as the restoration of full 
indexation to the personal tax system.  However, with the 
majority of the other initiatives, it is yet another case of the 
government lacking vision and taking baby steps forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have lower taxes and better spending on health care and 
social programs if the government had the courage to ensure that 
Canadian taxpayer money would be invested carefully instead of 
wasted rampantly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before I get into my half of the speech, I have a 
question for my colleague from Ontario.  I want to ask him what 
effect these draconian cuts in health care have had on his home 
province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the health minister, who is with us this morning, will 
probably want to hear the answer to that as well being a native 
of Ontario.  Would the member to go through some of the 
difficulties the Harris government has had in dealing with these 
cutbacks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning we heard the health minister from Ontario basically 
admit—and I guess that honesty is refreshing—that the goal in 
terms of the waiting list for cancer patients will not be as 
radically diminished as she thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As health care critic, I want to hear some reflections from my 
colleague on what he perceives as the biggest single problem in 
Ontario with regard to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as we are all aware, since 
1993 the federal Liberal government has cut billions of dollars 
from the health care system.  What we are seeing now is a 
struggle of not only my province but other provinces as they try 
to address this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the long term, if this is a priority, the government will 
have to restore investments to the 1993-94 level.  The population 
is aging in all areas of the country and this issue has to be 
addressed.  There are long waiting lists.  Cancer patients are 
going to the U.S. for treatment.  If the federal government is 
going to be a partner in health care it also has to come to the 
table with cash dollars.

<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the comments of 
the hon. member.  We in the Canadian Alliance Party have proposed 
some solutions to the present unfair taxation system. One of 
those solutions, solution 17, moves towards a single tax. 
Included in that is a move toward equality for spouses with 
regard to the deduction they are allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proposing a $10,000 deduction for either spouse.  It does 
not matter who is earning the income.  We are also proposing a 
$3,000 deduction for each child.  I wonder if the hon. member has 
some reaction to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that it would support the family and children.  It would 
not reduce the incentive for one of the parents to stay at home 
if he or she so chooses.  What reaction would the member have to 
the proposal of moving to a single tax, increasing the deductible 
to $10,000 for both husband and wife and increasing the child 
care deduction to $3,000? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not have any problem 
with increasing the deductions for spouses so that they are 
equal.  The family is the future of Canada.  It should be 
encouraged to raise kids and perhaps parents should stay at home. 
I think that is fair and equitable.  I am not sure if if the 
increase in the child tax is the right amount, but I think it is 
heading in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the flat tax, I agree that taxes are too high. If 
we are to be a player in the global economy we have to 
acknowledge that our neighbour to the south, the United States, 
has a tax regime considerably different from ours.  Its system is 
based on entrepreneurship, innovation and encouraging people to 
do what they can do.  Somehow the tax system has to get flatter. 
I am not sure flat tax is 100% correct but definitely tax rates 
have to come down at all levels. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in this very important 
debate on the budget.  I echo the words of my colleague from 
Markham.  We can take lessons from the past in terms of what the 
Liberal government has done.  The member made reference to the 
education budget of couple of years ago.  Promptly after the 
announcement of that budget over 12,000 young Canadians declared 
bankruptcy.  I believe this is considered the budget of tax 
reduction, so we can expect the same in terms of taxpayers filing 
bankruptcy if its record is consistent with the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the debate on the finances of the nation we have to move 
beyond some of what we said in the House in the past.  I would 
like to go back a bit in history and talk about a budget 
introduced in this place in 1979 which spelled the defeat of the 
Conservative Party under the leadership of Joe Clark at that 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Clark has been unfairly criticized as not being fiscally 
conservative.  The record back in 1979 will show that.  It is 
probably too long for some members of the House to remember.  It 
was the first Conservative budget to be introduced in this place 
following World War II.  The budget at that time, just to remind 
Canadians, was considered an 18 cent per gallon budget.  The 
finance minister at that time, Mr. Crosbie, made a commitment 
that gasoline would be taxed at 18 cents a gallon and that the 18 
cents were to be used to reduce the deficit and in the long term 
eliminate our debt. 
We would have been free of debt within a period of four to five 
years. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT8"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT8"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035
<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to that budget?  History tells us that it was 
defeated on the floor of the House of Commons and was never 
enacted.  Since then our level of debt reached the point of 
strangulation.  We have basically killed ourselves with the debt 
load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that there is no sense in pointing fingers 
back and forth because we are all responsible.  Every government 
in the western world following World War II went on the bent of 
deficit financing, assuming we would grow out of it and as the 
economy grew we would pay down the debt.   That did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we predicated the elimination of the debt on world oil 
prices.  The prime minister who succeeded Joe Clark and was prime 
minister for 17 years, Mr. Trudeau, admitted that he had made a 
mistake.  We had predicated our finances based on oil prices 
rising to something in the vicinity of $65 a barrel and thought 
that would lead us out of the debt problem, simply because of the 
revenues the federal government at that time would bring in from 
oil production from western Canada.  That was basically an insult 
to western Canadians as well.  That did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime our debt level has reached proportions that made 
it very difficult for every government to deal with.  I remind 
the House that we missed the opportunity almost 20 years ago to 
deal with it.  In fact, it was 20 years ago because in February 
1980 when Mr. Clark was campaigning on an 18 cent a gallon tax, 
he was roundly defeated by the government that then went on a 
spending spree for the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we finally regained office in 1984, the Liberal government 
bragged that it left the cupboard bare.  There was no money to 
spend.  Therefore we could not do what Canadian people wanted us 
to do.  They had been conditioned to seeing the government spend 
its way into prosperity.  That is self-defeating.  It is like an 
individual who takes his credit card out of his pocket every time 
he wants to make a purchase, assuming at the end of the day that 
the bills do not have to be paid.  We know they have to be paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The net result is that today we are strangled with a net debt of 
approximately $600 billion.  I remind members of the interest on 
that.  Without going through detailed charts and analyses, the 
calculation is very fundamental.   If we take $600 billion at an 
average rate of 8% on the bonds holding that debt, it is costing 
the Canadian taxpayer somewhere between $40 billion and $50 
billion in interest charges per year.  Again this is arithmetic 
that a grade school student could understand.  It is 
approximately $1 billion per week in interest payments for the 
Government of Canada.  What could we do with $1 billion a week if 
we were debt free as a nation?  In about a month's time we would 
cure our health care ills from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member next to me from Markham who has a great deal of 
authority on what works and does not work in the economy is on 
the right path.  He has been saying, as has our leader, that 
reduction in taxes is the key.  We have to get the economy 
moving.  We have to take off the restraints in the tax system 
that are holding back economic development vis-à-vis our 
neighbours, particularly the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today money has no boundaries.  One can move money around in the 
blink of an eye.  Money will seek the jurisdictions where it can 
do the best, work the hardest and the most efficiently.  It 
cannot do it in a country being strangled with taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government in the last seven years has missed a golden 
opportunity.  It brags about what it has done in the last seven 
years.  Indeed there is some room for boasting. 
We have to give it credit for some of what it has done, but it 
could have done more.  It did not have to do it at the expense of 
the provinces.  The easy way out for the federal government, 
which we can see in this budget as well, was simply to download 
on the backs of the provinces. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not yet figured out that there is only one taxpayer.  He 
is the same person, municipally speaking, provincially speaking 
and federally speaking.  We all pay those taxes, so when it 
downloads on the provinces it has not accomplished anything.  It 
has simply hidden under its own mistakes.  That is what the 
federal government has done, and it has done it effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go through some of the reasons the government has 
achieved something in the last number of years.  Let us look at 
some of its successes.  Let us look at the deficit and why it was 
reduced.  Three letters will explain it, GST.  Suddenly, after 
seven years, it is admitting for the first time that it cannot 
eliminate the GST.  Why?   Because it is bringing in 
approximately $25 billion a year in revenue, almost the exact 
figure in terms of its surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if the government eliminated the $25 
billion-plus a year from the GST, we would be back into a debt 
position.  Because of the initiatives the Conservatives took on 
free trade, deregulation and privatization, the government has a 
little bit of bragging room.  It is not because of initiatives it 
took but hard decisions that we took when we were on that side of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude, I simply remind the Canadian people that the 
government did not invent debt reduction.  It did not invent free 
trade.  It did not invent the GST.  It conveniently railed 
against those issues when political opportunity dictated that it 
was a wise thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never once between 1988 and 1993 did the finance minister, who 
does a lot of boasting, stand in the House to vote for anything 
that meant a reduction in taxes or a reduction in the size of the 
growth of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this magic transformation after 1993?  It was because 
reality set in.  After 10 years of education between the 
seventies and the eighties the Canadian people suddenly realized, 
as Mr. Clark did in 1979 when he took office, that the debt 
problem was a real problem that would not go away, unless we want 
the IMF coming in here, knocking on our doors and running the 
country as it did in other jurisdictions such as Argentia. The 
government had no choice.  It had to act and it did act.  The 
question is how did it do it.  It did not do it with any pain to 
itself.  It downloaded on the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to continuing this debate.  Hopefully I will have 
a chance to respond to some questions and comments from members 
on both sides of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member from the Progressive 
Conservative Party was wondering if any of us were old enough to 
remember back to 1979.  I certainly assure the House that I am 
old enough to remember.  I remember the years of Brian Mulroney 
and Joe Clark handling the finances of the nation and driving us 
deeply, by hundreds of billions of dollars, into debt through 
their fiscal management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate today deals with the budget and budgetary matters. 
Certainly modernizing the tax regime is an essential element in 
Canada today so that we can be prepared for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area is the medical provisions of the Income Tax Act.  I 
have a little story to tell about the Boonstra family in my 
riding who has a two year old child with a serious case of 
diabetes which requires four injections every day. This is 
putting mammoth costs on the Boonstras but they do not qualify 
under the income tax provisions for a disabled child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the member think if there could be some changes to 
the provisions of the Income Tax Act to broaden the definition of 
disability to include people like this two year old child in 
Manitoba?

on a day to day basis a balance sheet, and that is factual.  What 
strangled that government was that it did not lay a nickel on the 
debt.  It was the compound interest on the debt that strangled 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know in western Canada it has ridden the hobby horse for the 
last 10 years, but that hobby horse's legs are just about ready 
to collapse.  History will record that it was the compounded 
interest on the debt.  That is why I used the analogy of the 
individual and his or her credit.  When it reaches a point where 
the compound interest cannot be paid on the debt, we are in 
trouble.  That is the position the Government of Canada was in in 
the 1980s right into the 1990s.  We are barely getting out of 
that.  There is more the government can do in terms of tax relief 
to grow the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is absolutely right about the medication.  The 
definition of illness or what qualifies us for Canada pension and 
medications, in terms of the families ability to wipe that off 
and receive compensation from the government, has to be 
considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member that in 1997 the present government, in 
fact, the Prime Minister and his team, campaigned on a promise of 
bringing in a pharmacare program.  Talk about irresponsibility. 
They cannot even pay the bills in the health care system today or 
support the health care system to the level we as Canadians would 
expect.  At the same time, they campaigned on the promise of a 
pharmacare program that they had no intention of fulfilling nor 
had the capacity to fulfil.  The health minister is still on that 
same bent and talks about designer programs.  The health minister 
has his pet projects but knows full well that the system is 
broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think they have to get the fundamentals right and working 
before they start talking about new programs.  Canadians want 
health care.  In fact, they want a good health care system and 
are willing to pay for it.  They do not want the minister 
tinkering with a system that would work given the chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remind the member as well that primary health care is 
the responsibility of the provinces.  Under the Canada Health 
Act, all the health minister can do is secure funding for the 
provinces and hope that they live by the five principles of the 
act.  This was an act that the government introduced about 20 
years ago.  Now, in terms of its responsibilities, it is 
attempting to unravel and climb out from underneath it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more the government can do.  Health care is the number 
one issue on the mind of every Canadian.  They are looking for 
leadership on that side of House but there has been an absence of 
that on this issue.  We do not want to get off this point, but 
when this budget was introduced, I knew it was not an election 
budget.  Why?  The money that has been dedicated to health care 
and education in this budget would keep our system running from 
coast to coast for three days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not addressed that need but we are looking for some 
leadership on that side of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am privileged today to stand in the House of Commons and speak, 
not only on behalf of the taxpayers of Elk Island, but also, I 
believe, on behalf of the taxpayers of the whole country on the 
implementation of the latest budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that we have not yet fully implemented the 
previous budget.  We still have some bills to pass.  Today we are 
talking about the current budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think of the implications of the budget, I immediately 
think about families.  Some time ago I read that one of the most 
important factors leading to marriage breakups and family stress 
are financial factors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read somewhere that husbands and wives argue more about money 
than about anything else.  There is no doubt in my mind that our 
tax regime and the government intrusion into our economy and 
governments, of which the federal is only one of the three levels 
of government in this country, but the combined levels of 
government confiscate from the average taxpayer approximately 
half of the earnings of that taxpayer.  Psychologically, that is 
very discouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that as we earn money in order to provide for our 
families that we actually get to use only half of it.  The rest 
of it is taken from us.  Consequently, it makes it very difficult 
for people to make ends meet and, as I have just said, this is 
what adds to stresses in families because there is an argument as 
to where the limited resources of the family should go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to preface my statements today on the budget simply 
by emphasizing again that this is an anti-family government.  The 
Liberals do not do what is good for families.  They do not do 
what is good for children.  They tax families to death and then 
somehow they try to get out that they are doing all these 
wonderful things by giving families money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no money.  The money that it has is what is 
confiscated from taxpayers and all it does is redistribute it. It 
takes it from the pocket of one taxpayer and puts it into someone 
else's pocket.  The degree to which this government does it is 
excessive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to also say that there is no implication here that 
I do not believe in helping those who are less well off.  I 
believe their taxes payable should be even less and that benefits 
for people who are in dire straits should be there.  How they are 
delivered is a matter of great debate.  I, frankly, think that a 
distant federal government in Ottawa trying to figure out how to 
distribute the taxpayer's money and to identify people who need 
it is just wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have noticed in the last couple of days that the government 
has transferred a lot of money through Bill C-23 to a group which 
statistics show are above average in income.  The government's 
anti-family agenda continues.  I think it is time that we replace 
this government and that we start having some policies and 
principles in Canada which are pro-family and which allow 
families to keep more of their earnings to pay for the things 
that they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker from the Progressive Conservative Party 
spoke about the debt.  This has been one of my chief complaints 
about the management of the government.  The message from the PR 
department of the government is that everything is fine.  The 
Prime Minister likes to have people think everything is okay, 
“don't worry, be happy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the facts belie the situation.  The government gets the 
people to feel better by giving messaging that puts it in a very 
good light.  As a matter of fact the documents, the actual facts, 
the numbers in the book, show a completely different picture. 
They emphasize that the facts are not that rosy and what the 
government, the finance minister and the Prime Minister do is to 
simply try to persuade the people that things are really good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to have here a copy of the 2000 budget plan which is 
the basis of the bill today.  The bill we are debating is the 
implementation of parts of this budget.  I happen to have a copy 
of the budget here.  It is a fairly big document.  It has about 
350 pages in it.  I think it would be wonderful if Canadians 
would take the time to actually get on the Internet site and look 
at these budget documents and see what it is that they really 
say.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am on page 52 of the budget plan 2000.  With respect to the 
debt, it says “Net public debt”.  We see in 1998-99 it was 
$576.8 billion.  In 1999-2000, the year for which the books are 
not yet quite completed, although the fiscal year has ended it 
will take a while for all of the government accountants to check 
up, the number for the debt is exactly the same, $576.8 billion. 
We look at the current budget.  What is the government's plan to 
reduce the debt?  It's plan to reduce the debt is zero since it 
has budgeted for a net public debt at the end of the year of 
$576.8 billion.  Then we have the projection for the next budget 
for planning purposes.  This is not part of the bill we are 
discussing today, but it is what is expected to happen the year 
following this budget.  What is the number?  It is $576.8 
billion.  The plan this government has to reduce our indebtedness 
is zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first ran in the 1993 election, one of the things that I 
did shortly after the election was make a number of visits to 
schools.  I still do a number of these, but for some reason or 
other the number of calls that I get to come into the schools has 
diminished a bit in the last couple of years, but at first I had 
many visits.  I used to begin my little talks to those students 
by apologizing from my generation to the young people of that 
generation.  I used to say to them “I am so sorry that people in 
my generation somehow did not exercise our political clout to 
turf the people out who were putting this generation into debt”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have young pages in this place.  Earlier today we had a 
number of young people in the visitors' gallery.  All of the 
young people across the country are asked to pay the bills that 
we in our generation have rung up.  I take partial responsibility 
for that because I sat on my hands.  Yes, I always voted.  I 
voted for the PCs most of the time who were at that time the 
least of all of the bad options.  We were hopeful in 1984 when we 
finally elected a Conservative government that it would do 
something about the debt which was increasing continuously under 
the Liberals.  We had a great amount of hope that when the PCs 
took power in 1984, that would be the end of the spiralling 
growth of debt, the end of deficit spending.  Did that happen? It 
surely did not.  As we well know, we had record deficits under 
the PCs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard my colleague from the PC Party speak a little while ago 
and he addressed the debt question.  He said, “As a matter of 
fact that debt was simply the compound interest on what the 
Liberals left them”.  Mathematically he is correct.  Let us take 
the debt that the Conservatives inherited in 1984 and simply 
apply an interest of around 9%.  I did the calculation one time. 
If we use an interest rate of around 9% or 10% it does bring us 
to the level of debt that the Conservatives had when they were 
brutally kicked out of office in 1993.  That was because it took 
us about nine years to discover that the debt that the Liberals 
had built was not going to be eliminated by the Progressive 
Conservatives since in that same time they allowed it to continue 
to grow.  Program spending was not greater than the amount of 
their revenues, but every year they borrowed.  The numbers are 
obvious.  The interest payments on the debt were around $35 
billion, the deficits were around $35 billion.  In the last year 
it was over $40 billion.  It is simply true that they did not 
look at the debt.  They pretended it did not exist.  They did not 
address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we any better off under the Liberals?  The answer is no.  As 
a matter of fact, I happen to have the numbers here right at my 
fingertips because I looked them up in preparation for this 
speech today. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1100"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT13"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT13"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1100

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993-94 the debt was $508.2 billion.  Under the Liberals it 
grew approximately $37 billion in the next year, $32 billion in 
the next year, and $24 billion in the year after.  My numbers are 
a little too high because those are the projected numbers. The 
debt grew to its present number which, as I have already 
indicated several times in my speech, is around $576 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is atrocious. While the Liberals communicate to Canadians 
that they are wonderful, that they have beaten the deficit 
dragon, the fact is that the deficits of some $40 billion a year 
have been overcome simply by the fact that the government is 
taking that much more in income tax revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals say they did not increase taxes but they did.  The 
tax revenues are up.  It is right in the budget document.  This 
is not political messaging; it is simply what we read in the 
document. If we look at the income tax revenue in previous years 
and compare it to income tax revenue now, it has steadily 
increased to the point where now the government is taking about 
$40 billion a year more out of the economy than it did when it 
first took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hence the deficit has been eliminated but not because of good 
financial management by the government, but because it has 
allowed bracket creep to continue over the last number of years. 
Therefore the income tax revenue has gone up and it caused the 
deficit to disappear because the taxpayers were putting in more 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amount of actual program spending the government has cut is 
minuscule.  It is essentially zero once we cut out what it has 
downloaded to the provinces through its reduction in transfer 
payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not at all attributable to the Liberal government that we 
are in better shape now.  We are in better shape because the debt 
is no longer increasing.  It has not been because of the Liberal 
government; it has been in spite of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Added to that is all the wasteful spending which has been 
brought to light by the auditor general.  The auditor general is 
a non-partisan officer of the House.  His task is simply to 
report to Canadians on the management of the money.  Over and 
over and over the auditor general reports that there are big 
problems.  He does not use the word boondoggle, we do.  The 
simple definition of that word is where money is being spent in 
great amounts without proper accounting and without proper 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a surprise for a lot of people who do not know this. Many 
people think that we are now in a surplus situation, that we have 
money to spend and therefore we are really looking pretty good. I 
found something that the finance minister never mentioned in his 
budget speech.  No one on the Liberal side has brought this to 
the attention of the Canadian people, but here it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I am looking at the actual budget document printed by 
the Minister of Finance and delivered to the House of Commons on 
February 28. It says on page 76, “For 1999-2000, a financial 
surplus of $8 billion is expected”. The finance minister said 
this lower surplus reflects the assumptions of a balanced budget 
and lower sources of funds from the pension accounts, et cetera. 
In 1999-2000, the year just ended, the government expects a 
financial surplus of $8 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that was in the fiscal year in which we 
passed a bill in the House which allowed the government to do a 
bookkeeping entry by taking $30 billion from the pension fund of 
the civil servants of our country. Our party believes that 
probably the government was entitled to part of that, because 
clearly there were overpayments and there is a surplus in the 
fund. Undoubtedly the Canadian taxpayers via the government are 
entitled to a part of it, but a part of it at least is due to the 
employees of the government.  The Liberal government defeated any 
amendments we had to correct that and took $30 billion from them.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also as a result of the fact that there are huge surpluses 
in the EI fund.  Have the Liberals corrected it according to the 
actuarial standards?  No, they have not.  They have made some 
little mediocre changes.  The actuary said that the rate of 
premiums for EI should be around $2 per $100 of earnings, but the 
government continued to take $2.40 per $100 of earnings. The 
Liberals brag that they have cut it, but they are still enjoying 
huge surpluses in that form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next paragraph is the one which will shock members.  It will 
probably shock most Liberal members because the finance minister 
has not brought this to our attention and he was mum about it in 
his speech.  It says on page 76, “For 2000-01”, the year this 
budget covers, “a financial requirement of $5 billion is 
expected, the first requirement in three years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are back to borrowing money in order to run the operation of 
the government.  This is in the cash flow part.  These are the 
budgetary balances and the government is projecting for this 
year's budget that there be a requirement of some $5 billion 
worth of borrowing and it is keeping it a secret from us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have exposed the secret.  It is in the book in a little 
paragraph on page 76.  I am sure that everybody was instructed 
carefully, “If you see it, do not mention it, because we do not 
want people to get the impression that we are not perfect 
managers of the taxpayers' money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lid has been blown off that one.  We have seen all of the 
wasteful spending, the spending not accounted for, all the grants 
and contributions, the political slush funds.  We have seen all 
of that.  The government is not responsible.  Now we see it 
communicating that everything is hunky-dory when in fact with 
this budget it is bringing us once again into borrowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shameful thing that the government simply cannot get its 
act together.  We live in a country which is rich in resources. 
We have minerals.  We have mines.  We have oil. We have gas.  We 
have diamonds.  We have forestry products.  We have a 
tremendously valuable agriculture resource, probably the best in 
the world.  Our farmers are the most efficient in the world. We 
have a hardworking energetic population.  Certainly living in our 
climate we are a very hardy population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no excuse in the world for this country not to be the 
very best in the world.  It should be debt free.  If the 
governments over the last 30 years had been dealing properly with 
our money, we would not have debt.  We would not have some $40 
billion a year in interest payments which siphon off from 
Canadian taxpayers the money that should be spent for programs 
like health care and education.  Those are programs Canadians are 
demanding but which they cannot have because governments, both 
past and present, the Liberal government and the Conservative 
government, all of them in the last 30 years, have done this to 
our young people, to our families, to our country.  They should 
hang their heads in shame because they have failed utterly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought to get some people running the government who act like 
business people, whose objectives and primary goals are to do 
what is right for the people, to manage the economic affairs of 
the country properly.  They have to forget that the primary goal 
is simply to get re-elected, which is what too often clouds the 
financial decisions in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish I had another 20 minutes to speak but 
unfortunately the speeches of 40 minutes are gone from this 
section.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak this morning to this bill on the budget. 
Not that I support it.  We in the Bloc Quebecois voted against 
the budget.  In this case, we are studying Bill C-32, an act to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in parliament 
on February 28, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has seven parts to it.  As I have only ten minutes, 
you will understand my limiting myself to only some of the 
aspects of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part talks of amending the Employment Insurance Act to 
increase the number of weeks of parental benefits to 35.  The 
number of hours of insurable employment to qualify for 
employment insurance benefits is also reduced from 700 to 600. 
None of this takes effect until December 30, 2000, at the end of 
the year, in other words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance, the desire to help parents assume their 
responsibilities may seem a good thing.  It is hard to oppose 
the principle of parental benefits.  However, this is another 
example of federal meddling in a field usually reserved for the 
provinces.  In the case of employment insurance, there was 
agreement at one point by all provinces—in 1948, I believe—to pass 
the Unemployment Insurance Act.  The government is putting 
certain social measures in place, such as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I think is needed is a real family policy.  That is what 
Quebec is aiming for and it has laid down some important 
groundwork.  For there to be real assistance, there needs to be 
consistency.  That would best be achieved by one level of 
government looking after things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Quebec wants to do.  It would like to see the 
federal government put more into the Canada social transfer or 
other programs so that the provinces can, if they wish—as Quebec 
is doing and wants to keep on doing—implement a real family 
policy.  That would be the ideal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oddly though, the number of hours to qualify for this benefit 
has been reduced from 700 to 600 in certain regions, but 420 in 
others.  I am referring here to high unemployment regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How inconsistent that regional disparity is not taken into 
account with respect to parental benefits.  As a result, if a 
woman loses her job for whatever reason and is not expecting, 
420 hours would be enough.  But in this case, when she leaves 
work to take up her responsibilities as a mother, she needs 600 
hours.  This is not consistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And there is another thing.  Since 1991, we have been after the 
government constantly because it is no longer contributing to 
the EI fund.  This fund consists of the premiums from employers 
and employees.   The government uses this money to enhance its 
visibility but the money is not its to use.  Once again, it is 
money that belongs to employers and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the while, to reduce the deficit, when the government was in 
deficit, the Minister of Finance was dipping into the EI fund. 
Now that there is no longer a deficit, the government continues 
to help itself in order to give itself as much scope for action 
as possible.  To what end?  In general, to interfere in 
provincial jurisdictions.  It is completely ridiculous.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to the second part of the bill, which also 
has to do with the $2.5 billion Canada social transfer for 
health and social programs, to which the government has made 
drastic cuts since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Mercier will remember the days when we both 
sat on the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development. 
The committee went on a tour and there were protests everywhere. 
Except for the witnesses called by the Liberal Party, at least 
75% to 80% of the witnesses came to say “No, no, do not make 
cuts, especially not in social programs”. But the government 
went ahead anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, a leaders' debate was held. 
The current Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, 
asked a question to Ms. Campbell, the then Prime Minister, about 
a reply she had given to a journalist. The then Leader of the 
Opposition asked her “Is it true that you intend to make cuts in 
social programs?” Mrs. Campbell replied “I do not want to make 
that commitment. It is one of the options being considered by 
the Conservative Party”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal leader took advantage of the situation and scored 
political points by condemning what Mrs. Campbell might do. But 
it is strange to see that when the Liberal Party took office, it 
made more cuts in social programs than the Conservatives had made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall the letter written by the present Prime Minister to 
minister Valcourt protesting the way he had begun to make cuts 
to employment insurance and to tighten up the eligibility 
requirements.  At the time he found this terrible, but now that 
he is in power he is continuing with the same policy and has 
gone even further than what was envisaged in 1993, and we are 
not supposed to react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing goes for the GST.  He talked of abolishing it, 
but what has he done?  Nothing is changed.  At one point, the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage was forced to run in a by-election 
as a sort of validation of the change of direction, but the 
Prime Minister carries on as before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is going to be voting against this bill 
because its purpose is to implement a bad budget, one which 
continues to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction and 
does not properly serve the interests of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When questions are asked of the Minister of Finance or the 
Minister of Health, or others in this House, the responses often 
suggest that Quebec is, or was, receiving its fair share.  We do 
not have the latest statistics, but it is true in some ways 
that, until 1997, Quebec did receive more employment insurance. 
This is normal, however.  Historically, the average extra 
payments to Quebec have long stood at 2%.  The gap is now less 
than before, because the Government of Quebec has adopted good 
job creation measures, a fund to remedy poverty, and so on.  It 
is normal for more employment insurance to be paid out when 
there is less work or more unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also been told that Quebec got more than its fair share 
of the Canada social transfer two years ago.  That too was 
normal, because there were more poor people in certain regions. 
It is paid out based on need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill again repeats what the minister did last year, which 
is to have the Canada social transfer no longer based on need 
but rather on population figures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At a meeting the other day, people in my riding asked “We know 
you are a sovereignist, Mr. Dubé, but how does the Canada social 
transfer work?”  I told them that it was now based on 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone then said “So why are we in the federal system?  What is 
the advantage?  If it is on the basis of population, it should 
be transferred to Quebec, to the provinces, and income tax 
adjusted”.  Sometimes the explanation is that there are tax 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax points are the same thing. 
However, this is not real income from the federal government. 
Negotiations were held in the 1960s to have the tax points given 
to the provinces.  Quebec has its own department of revenue and 
collects its own taxes.  The other provinces do not.  The 
federal government talks about tax points, but this is a 
transfer of money to these provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to demands by Quebec, the Minister of Finance is 
trying through calculations to include the famous tax points. 
He says “Quebec gets this amount of money, which is generous”. 
But in the case of federal spending, the issue is not so much 
quantity, but quality too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money coming in as transfer payments for social programs, such 
as employment insurance, for example—although I know this is 
workers' and employers' money—is not constructive money.  It is 
not constructive spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at Quebec's share in various areas, we can see that 
we get only 21% of spending on goods and services, 15% of 
current transfers to business and 18% of federal investments 
between 1992 and 1997.  Specifically, that means 19.5% of the 
jobs in the public service and 19.1% of the jobs in the armed 
forces, although we represent 24% of the population. The annual 
shortfall in the federal procurement of goods and services, that 
is, the difference between Quebec's demographic weight and its 
share of federal receipts amounts to $1.2 billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of current transfers to business, the shortfall is 
$339 million in investments.  There is another $219 million that 
Quebec does not receive.  In these areas alone, the figure is 
$1.7 billion annually between 1992 and 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the research and development sector, Quebec only gets one 
quarter of the jobs in the national capital region, while 
Ontario gets three quarters. Overall, Quebec receives less than 
22% of the jobs in the federal public service, compared to 42% 
for Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at these statistics, I come to the conclusion that 
we cannot blame Ontarians. The federal system serves them well. 
Ontario is the province best served by the federal government, 
in every respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals currently hold just about every seat in Ontario. I 
can understand Ontarians, because they have always had the 
largest piece of the pie, not to mention the auto pact, which 
promotes southern Ontario's economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some researchers told the Standing Committee on Industry that, 
if it were not for the federal presence, through public service 
jobs, and for the auto pact, Ontario would be at the same level 
as Quebec. These are the two major factors that put Ontario 
ahead. This has to be said. This is great for Ontarians, but MPs 
from Quebec are entitled to point out these facts, and so are 
MPs from the other provinces, because the statistics for their 
provinces are similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am greatly concerned about shipbuilding. Unfortunately, I did 
not see any additional moneys for shipbuilding. There is no new 
program, no new measure for the shipbuilding industry. Nor did I 
see much for small and medium size businesses. It is the small 
businesses that create jobs, but I did not see any new incentive 
for them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exports are often mentioned.  Large corporations are the best 
placed for this sort of activity, but exports are not always 
within the reach of SMBs.  The government talks about 
globalization and the Internet.  Yes, small businesses, like all 
other businesses, need to get connected, but we see that this is 
not happening in the more traditional areas.  The perishable 
goods sector, for example, requires a different approach.  The 
regional factor, the fact of being distant from large centres 
and large markets plays a large role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the federal Liberal government cut transportation 
subsidies. 
Now, for a business in a so-called remote area, it is more 
difficult because transportation has to be taken into account. 
We see the debate that took place over current gas prices.  In 
regions such as Lac-Saint-Jean everything costs more because the 
cost of transportation has to be factored in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is not listening to what the regions are saying. 
It is not listening to low-income families.  The minister 
announced so-called tax cuts but, on closer inspection, these 
cuts are truly minimal compared to what he could have done with 
the surplus, which may top $100 billion in three years.  The 
Minister of Finance is cautious, if nothing else. 
It is all very fine and well for the federal government to want 
to save money, but not to pay more attention to what citizens, 
companies and regions are asking for is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my colleagues will address other aspects of this 
budget bill.  I think that people are entitled to all the 
necessary information. They should talk to their member of 
parliament.  I tell my constituents that, if they wish to have a 
copy of the budget, detailed explanations, they should not 
hesitate to get in touch with their MP.  They are entitled to 
objective information.  They must see it for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those listening will conclude for themselves that this budget 
walks all over the provinces.  It ignores provincial 
jurisdiction.  That is the main thing wrong with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, the Minister of 
Finance is trying to crush Quebec, but he is using money to do it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to begin by congratulating my colleague for his work on the 
shipbuilding situation.  He has shown that assistance from the 
Government of Canada in this area is necessary, and not in the 
form of grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear more on his disappointment with the budget, 
in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Mercier has 
provided me with the opportunity to say a little more on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget was a disappointment to me because there is not one 
cent for shipbuilding.  Positive things should be mentioned when 
they come up, and there has been an interesting event in the 
industry committee on which I sit.  In its report, which was 
tabled in the House on Tuesday, the committee made two 
recommendations to the government.  For once, it admits that 
there are particular problems in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One recommendation asks the government, via the various 
departments concerned, to adopt new measures to help the 
shipbuilding industry.  Another is aimed at negotiations with 
the American government in order to gain an exemption from its 
Jones Act for Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipping and shipbuilding are not exempt.  If there were an 
exemption from the cost—people have studied the potential 
impact of this measure—there would be a return of full 
employment or of the level of employment existing prior to 1993. 
An increase in demand is expected for the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the budget was a disappointment, but things do look better 
than they did a few months ago in shipbuilding, since Bill C-213 
was passed at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that remains is committee work, which is scheduled for May 30. 
We would have preferred it sooner, but there is a chance it may 
be passed before the end of the session.  It has to be or it 
will be an incredible stratagem.  The Liberals would pretend to 
support it—in case there is an election in the fall—with the 
bill before the election, but if it is not passed at third 
reading, it would make no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for Mercier for giving me the opportunity to 
explain this matter and to explain to my colleagues the 
importance of acting on agreements in principle reached on a 
bill.  We must go further and pass it at third reading. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate what the member said, but I would ask him 
to elaborate on the effects that EI premiums and Canada pension 
plan premiums have on businesses in his community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my community those payments are certainly one of the big 
concerns.  The government brags about lowering EI premiums, but 
then it raises CPP premiums.  That adds to the costs of 
businesses.  It means they cannot hire the extra worker they 
might otherwise have hired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member elaborate on how those premiums might affect 
businesses in his community? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I cannot of course provide figures, because I do not 
have them for my riding. But the member is definitely right. If 
there is a reduction on the one hand, but on the other hand an 
increase is imposed by the Minister of Finance on employers and 
workers, then the first measure is offset by the second one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since he brought this up, I can tell the hon. member that in my 
riding, until this year, the unemployment rate did not allow us 
to benefit from the transitional jobs fund, which was strongly 
criticized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents often ask me “Yes, but are there cases like this 
everywhere?” We saw that these cases are predominantly in the 
Prime Minister's riding. There are also some in Montreal, but 
not in my riding. 
The reason for that is simple: my riding was not eligible for 
the funds, supposedly because the unemployment rate was too low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But later on—and the hon. member must have noticed the same 
thing in his own riding—we saw that the current minister had 
another way of implementing the act. She applied it where there 
were pockets of poverty. We all have pockets of poverty in our 
ridings, but the minister made sure not to mention that rule. 
Therefore, people did not know about it, and no projects were 
implemented under that rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new fund and the new standards, my riding is now 
entitled, like the others, to money, but at a lower level. Over 
the past year, about two businesses in my riding were able to 
benefit from the new fund. Therefore, it still does not have a 
significant impact on my riding.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the budget 
implementation act because, as we know, a budget is a very 
important issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A budget is really about more than money.  It should never be 
seen as just being about money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the budget sets the priorities for a government.  It 
sets a sense of direction.  It says a lot about the attitude of 
government and what government is all about.  As we look at how 
we apportion our funding and the kinds of things we do with the 
money of Canadians, we are defining the kind of country we want 
for ourselves, our children and our children's children.  It is a 
very important topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually a budget attempts to be good news.  It tries to present 
things in a very positive way so that people will come onside and 
support it.  However, I am afraid this budget was not good news. 
It was not something which we could stand and be really proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has ignored in this budget the 
requirements to provide a long term plan to re-establish and 
guarantee its commitment to the stewardship of Canada's social 
programs.  We know that social programs are very fundamental to 
our country and need our support.  Yet, when we look around the 
country, the gap between the rich and poor is getting 
increasingly wider as the days go by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the government listen to Canadians when it fashioned the 
budget?  Did it listen to Canadians to get a pulse of what they 
were saying and what was important to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give members a flavour of what people have said 
in my constituency of Halifax West.  I have held a lot of 
meetings over the past number of weeks and months.  I have talked 
to people and listened to what they said.  I will read a few 
quotes which come directly from them.  The words I will put forth 
on the budget are not mine, they are the words of Canadians.  When 
members first hear some of these comments they may not sound as 
if they are related to the budget.  However, if they stop to think 
about them they will see that they touch upon things that are of 
importance to Canadians.  They touch upon the attitudes, 
priorities and the sense of direction that this country should 
display. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing which came out loud and clear from many people was 
that the price of gasoline was too high.  We are talking about an 
issue that affects people daily.  Many people across this country 
need their automobiles.  Automobiles are no longer a luxury, they 
are a necessity.  The cost of gasoline is too high.  That is an 
issue that was not addressed by the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another comment was “You are the only politician who sends me 
information, Gordon.  Thank you”.  People are concerned about 
what is happening.  They are very pleased when we communicate 
with them.  However, I am afraid the government did not 
communicate with the public when it designed the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another comment was “How can the QE II hospital”, a hospital 
in the Halifax area, “afford landscaping when it is $20 million 
in debt?”  Why are these hospitals in debt?  Why is our health 
care system suffering?  It comes back to the lack of support by 
the federal government in making health care a priority, which 
Canadians said was their number one priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another comment was “Everything has to go through the U.S. in 
order to be sold.  When they snap their fingers, we jump.  We are 
Americans.  The signs just say it is Nova Scotia”.  The attitude 
of a lot of people is that we are slowly being caught up in 
Americanization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this is very true when it comes to our health care 
system.  Look at what has happened.  The government has started 
to move toward allowing a two tier health care system.  Only 
those who can afford certain services will be able to get them. 
Everybody else will wait in line.  Health care in our country is 
a very serious issue.   What has the government done for health 
care in the budget?  Nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another comment was  “The federal budget was not really a good 
one for the average person.  It did not address any of the 
problems that students have.  It was dressed up to look good”. 
When we look at what was in the budget for education, we realize 
that the income tax deduction was increased from $500 to $3,000 
for scholarships.  However, not all students receive 
scholarships.  Not all students are in a position to benefit from 
that little change in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to look at are those high tuition costs that are 
causing great debt among our students. 
Many of our university students are coming out of university with 
a debt load of anywhere from $25,000 upward.  That is an awful 
way for them to commence a working career, with that kind of debt 
load hanging over their heads.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comment from my constituent was very real and valid, that 
this budget did not address the problems of students, but that it 
was dressed up to look good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another comment was “The federal government is not listening 
to the people.  Why did it wait until just before the recent 
byelection in Cape Breton to announce 900 McJobs?”  The jobs are 
classified as McJobs.  It is true that the problems in Cape 
Breton did not crop up overnight.  They have been around for 
quite some time.  Any government with any foresight would have 
been working to try to develop the means of making that part of 
our province productive and meaningful, rather than waiting for a 
crisis and then flying into the area and talking about patronage 
at its very best, because we are getting close to an election, 
and throwing out some jobs.  This is not what people want. 
People see through this.  They realize that this is not 
sincerity.  It is not setting a true attitude of caring and 
understanding for the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cape Breton is a wonderful part of our province.  It has all 
kinds of potential.  There are many opportunities for the tourism 
industry and home businesses, with new technology and so forth. 
A forward thinking government would certainly be moving in the 
direction to try to promote some of those things, rather than 
waiting for a crisis, waiting for an election and tossing out a 
few tidbits around election time.  People see through that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another comment was “What kind of influence would Paul Martin 
have on whether or not we have a shipbuilding policy?”  These 
are the words of my constituent, they are not my words.  “Canada 
Steamship Lines has an aging fleet which will have to be replaced 
by double hulls and it will be cheaper to build the ships outside 
Canada”.  In other words, people are starting to look at things 
and they are saying “Why is it that the government is not 
supporting a good shipbuilding policy for Canadians?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that recently the industry committee submitted a report 
in which one of the recommendations was for the government to 
encourage the U.S. to repeal the Jones Act.  I think that we all 
know that the U.S. will not repeal something that is in its 
favour to appease Canada and to try to help us.  We need to look 
at establishing our own legislation, our own policies that will 
support and assist our workers here in Canada.  We can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt, but I was not paying strict attention earlier.  Was it 
the hon. member's intention to split his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  No, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  All right, then the 
hon. member for Halifax West has 12 minutes left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am on my feet, you cannot bring in the back door what 
you cannot bring in the front door.  It is not appropriate to 
refer to members by their given names, even if it is in a letter 
from someone else, just as a point of interest for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I had forgotten that for 
the moment, and I thank you for reminding me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another comment which was made during the meetings I held was 
“Will there be any infrastructure money for us?”  We note that 
the government announced in its budget that there will be an 
infrastructure program, probably similar to the one that was 
carried on previously, and we applaud that move as a very 
positive move.  However, our concern is that the details have not 
yet been worked out.  We understand that it may not be until 2001 
before some agreements are worked out with the provinces to get 
this in motion.  We need the infrastructure now.  We need these 
programs to move in favour of the communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many small communities in my riding which would 
benefit immensely from a good infrastructure program.  We hope 
that these programs will not be focused only on major 
infrastructure projects like highways, but that the programs will 
reach into the communities to assist them with the goals and 
objectives which are meaningful to them, such as community 
centres and structures to assist our young people and our 
children, the real heartthrob of our country, to give them the 
recreational and educational opportunities that are 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to watch that infrastructure very closely.  The question 
from the constituent, “Will there be any infrastructure money 
for us?”, is very valid because sometimes we know that these 
programs are administered in a way in which, far too often, there 
is much political manoeuvring around who gets what and how it 
takes place, and that should not be the case. 
We see the very result of that in the House today with the many 
questions regarding the administration of the HRDC grants and how 
they went to various ridings.  We hope this will not become an 
issue with the infrastructure program.  With regard to the 
budget, we certainly feel that the infrastructure program is 
important and we hope it will be carried out prudently.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The health care system is a mess.  I have spoken about this 
already.  This issue was raised time and time again by many 
people in my constituency who were concerned about the health 
care system.  I am glad to see that the government is now looking 
at discussions with the provinces on how to move forward on some 
of the very vital issues.  We know that this must be more than 
window dressing.  It has to be sincere and it has to show that 
the government is putting forth the kind of support that is 
needed.  Unfortunately, the fact that the federal government is 
contributing so little to the health care system compared with 
what it contributed years back is indeed something that has 
caused a lot of problems, long waiting lines, a lot of 
difficulties with our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget did not really address two very important aspects of 
the health care system, home care and pharmacare.  These are very 
important issues.  Many elderly people in my riding   say to me 
“On my fixed income I cannot afford the cost of the drugs that I 
have to buy”.  This is a very real problem for many people, 
particularly seniors.  We in the NDP feel the government has 
strongly ignored aid and assistance to our senior citizens in its 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our seniors have contributed a lot to their communities and when 
they get to their golden years, they should not have to be 
concerned or worried about their next meal.  They should not be 
concerned or worried about needing medication and balancing their 
budgets and doing without some necessity in order to get their 
medicine.  I know of many senior citizens who are going without 
their medication because it is not available to them with our 
present health care system.  I have many comments I can make 
about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One comment that came up time and time again was the fact that 
the government does not listen.  There is a feeling among the 
public that when politicians campaign at election time, they will 
say anything and everything to get elected.  Once elected, they 
become obsessed with power and do not listen to those who elected 
them.  In some cases, constituents never see their elected 
representatives.  The feeling is that government does not listen 
to people.  It does what it wants when it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue was the announcement by the government that it was 
going to provide assistance to professional hockey teams.  In 
this case, perhaps the government did listen when people spoke 
out loud and clear and said “We don't want it”.  The government 
backed off rather quickly because there was quite an outcry from 
the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quite often tell people in my constituency that they have 
power in their voices.  If they combine their voices with that of 
others they can get some change.  I have told them not to be 
afraid to speak out on issues.  I encourage people to make sure 
they direct their concerns to the government or their MP when 
they have these kinds of concerns.  We have to make the 
government listen.  It is our future.  It is our country.  It is 
our destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who can live on a $575 per month CPP disability pension?  Over 
and above the issue of the amount that is available for this 
pension, people also find they have difficulties when they apply 
for this.  Many people in my riding come to me with obvious 
disabilities and will never be able to work again.  Yet, they 
have trouble getting the disability pension.  When they do get 
it, it is only  $575 per month.  There is very little one can do 
with $575 per month with the cost of housing and food.  There is 
not much left over.  This issue was sadly lacking in the budget. 
There was nothing to address the concerns of our senior citizens, 
those who are living on disability pensions or those with limited 
or fixed incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to the debt?  Is the government not worried about 
it?  I am afraid of what we will be leaving our children with in 
terms of the debt.  That is a very important comment.  What will 
we be leaving our children?  What will our legacy be to our 
children?  Will we just be passing on to them a system of 
two-tier privatized health care where if they are not fortunate 
enough to be earning enough money, they are not going to be able 
to get access to the best medical treatment or will we be leaving 
them a system which is universally accessible to all, one that we 
can be proud of?

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we in the NDP are fighting for.  This is what we 
feel the government should maintain.  Unfortunately, we see the 
government moving in an opposite direction. The government is 
tolerating the setting up of private clinics and the operation of 
“private hospitals”.  I put it in quotes because people will 
say they are not hospitals.  The reality is when persons are sick 
or their leg is broken and they go for service, they are not 
questioning whether it is a clinic or hospital.  They look at 
whether or not that service is available to them.  What kind of 
system are we leaving to our children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will share another comment with the House because I like this 
one in particular.  It states “I don't understand why people 
will not give the NDP a chance”.  I think that is a good one. I 
think it is time for people to start looking at their options and 
realize that there is a voice out there speaking for them which 
is concerned about many of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will keep your admonition in mind, Mr. Speaker, about calling 
people by names.  I will leave out the name but another comment 
states “It took Mr. X more than one year to answer my letter 
regarding CPP”.  This person was writing to a minister of the 
government about her CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Was it the Minister of Finance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Yes, it was, Mr. Speaker.  It was the 
minister of— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We do not want to 
get carried away here.  We can refer to the minister by the 
minister's riding or the minister's responsibility.  We just 
cannot use the name.  So feel free.  The hon. member for Halifax 
West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  In any event, it took this individual 
one year to answer a letter.  I know we all sometimes have 
problems getting back on time with our correspondence.  However, 
the key is this.  When people are looking to governments and 
their leaders, they want to feel that there is some sense of 
responsibility on these issues because these issues are very 
crucial to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of comments that are coming forward.  I 
raise these in good faith to give an understanding as to why 
people are concerned about the budget and why they are concerned 
about the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure how much time I have left, but I want to bring 
this to a conclusion on a positive note.  I think it is very 
important for each and every one of us in the House to examine 
very closely the budget from the point of view, as I said before, 
as to what it says in terms of priorities for people, priorities 
for Canadians.  What are we saying to the public about the 
direction in which we want the country to go?  We have to get 
past the bottom line being just the dollar. By that I do not mean 
that the dollar is not important.  Of course it is important. 
However, there is much more importance in having a sense of 
decency about the way we conduct our business, about having a 
sense of obligation and responsibility to seniors, students, the 
ill and those who are afflicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much more to the budget than just the dollars 
themselves.  We notice that the budget did not really touch upon 
many issues that would affect aboriginal people, our first 
citizens of this country.  These kinds of things determine what 
attitude we have about our country, about where we are as a 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would say that we certainly were disappointed 
with the budget.  We hope that the comments of Canadians, such as 
the comments that I read earlier, will be taken to heart and the 
government will look at those things in a meaningful way and try 
to do what is best for our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the member from Nova Scotia talk about the 
inadequacies of the Canada pension plan as far as disability 
pensions are concerned.  The member will know that the government 
has arranged for the Canada pension plan premiums to be raised to 
9.9% of earnings and that will take place over the next two or 
three years.  Along with that increase in the premium rate, we 
are seeing a decline in the number of people in the workforce and 
an increase in the number of people who are retired.  Therefore, 
we have more and more people retiring and fewer and fewer people 
actually paying the premiums. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would enlighten us as to how he sees 
curing that problem.  More and more people are retiring and going 
on disability on the Canada pension plan, fewer and fewer people 
are paying into it and the rates are increasing and increasing. 
Where does he see the rates stopping? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think I am really 
qualified to say where I think the rates should stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member has raised a valid point with respect to 
the increase in premiums and so forth because far too often what 
is happening is that the government is constantly increasing 
premiums and taking more money from people when in reality what 
we need to do is readjust our priorities so that the money that 
is there can be utilized in a more positive way to alleviate some 
of the difficulties that people who must go on disability 
encounter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look, for example, at what happened with the EI premiums 
and a program designed to help the unemployed, the government 
took that money and threw it into its pot so that it could come 
up with a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at superannuation, the money is taken there and put 
into a pot so the government can claim a surplus.  When we look 
at the pay equity struggle that workers had for years and years 
and years, again, it comes back to priorities.  If the government 
will reorganize its priorities and think in terms of people, then 
that issue that the member raised will come to a natural 
resolution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, thank you again for the opportunity to speak on Bill 
C-32, the budget implementation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance the bill tries to pass itself off as legislation 
that will bring about tax relief and the elimination of bracket 
creep.  The bill attempts to appear to be beneficial to our 
health care and our education systems.  It has the appearance 
that there is a claim that there will be increases to the 
transfer payments to the provinces.  The government would like us 
to believe that the bill will make major breakthroughs for 
families with the national child benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I actually go through the bill and really analyse this, I 
can summarize the bill or the budget in two words.  This budget 
is about tinkering and tokenism and nothing more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are getting less.  Polls across this country indicate 
that nine out of ten Canadians want substantive tax relief.  We 
have seen the Liberals take, take, take since 1993 when they 
formed government.  We have seen our disposable income 
continually fall.  We have become worse off.  They take a dollar 
and they claim they will give us back a dime, and I emphasize the 
word claim as I am not convinced that that will happen, and we 
are supposed to thank them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something desperately wrong with this.  This all comes 
back to the Minister of Finance.  Unfortunately, he does not 
understand that this is not his money.  This money belongs to the 
people of Canada.  Until we change this institution, until we 
change how we spend taxpayers' money and until we bring back 
accountability, this country will be worse off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I chatted with my colleague, the member for St. Albert.  He 
introduced Bill C-477, which I found very fascinating.  There is 
something that is quite startling in that bill.  The title alone, 
an act to provide for evaluations of statutory programs, really 
goes to the heart of what I am talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read one little section of what he is trying to do. 
Again, the member for St. Albert tabled four criteria this 
morning.  This bill is about the evaluation of government 
programs and it is basically to replace a sunset clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, what are the public policy objectives that the program is 
designed to achieve; two, its effectiveness in meeting its 
objectives; three, the efficiency by which it is delivered; and 
four, whether its purpose could be better fulfilled by different 
means. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that those are four very important fundamental 
principles we should be thinking about every time this 
institution spends taxpayer dollars, but that has not happened. 
Time and again we see that there is no accountability.  These 
programs create a life of their own.  They grow and completely 
lose their objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that we do not need to look at investing in 
this country but, as we have seen in the billion dollar 
boondoggle in the HRDC program, the job creation funds and many 
more, these programs often fail every single one of these tests. 
This comes back to accountability and whether taxpayers are 
getting value for their money.  The member for St. Albert pointed 
something out to me that really struck me.  He said that we need 
to show accountability with every single dollar going out of this 
institution.  Unfortunately, that is not happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael Mendelson, an economist from the Caledon Institute, said 
“Fiscal doom does not await us if we decide to tax substantively 
less than Ottawa is likely to do—even in this slower economy, 
reduced taxes would turn that around”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sherry Cooper, from Nesbitt Burns Inc., said  “It is precisely 
because of economic uncertainty that tax relief to support 
businesses and consumers is needed now.  The Canadian tax burden 
today is excessive, dramatically reducing our economic 
well-being.  Furthermore, substantive tax cuts will not 
jeopardize the hard-won gains on the fiscal front”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guy who is holding the purse strings is the Minister of 
Finance.  We have to start holding him personally accountable for 
a lot of these decisions, such as on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example from my riding.  In the province of 
British Columbia we have two level two intensive care units for 
children in all of B.C.  One is in Vancouver and the other one is 
in Victoria.  They have been there for a long time and have saved 
hundreds of children's lives.  One of those institutions is about 
to be closed.  I spoke to the hospital administrator, the CEO of 
the Victoria Regional Health Board.  He looked at whether they 
could be more efficient or whether they could do a better job by 
centralizing but, he said “I have to acknowledge that this whole 
debate started for one reason:  money.  There is not enough 
money.  The pie is not big enough.  It gets smaller and smaller. 
We have to shut it down”.  This will have a dramatic effect on 
how we deliver health care on Vancouver Island.  It is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guy who is cutting the pie and handing it out, but not back 
to the taxpayers, is the Minister of Finance.  We often hear that 
it is the entire government but it is the Minister of Finance who 
has the most influence on what is happening.  It really perturbs 
me that they take a dollar, give us back a dime and we are 
supposed to thank them.  Health care in this country is in a 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some specific things that this budget does or 
does not do.  It talks about bracket creep.  Bracket creep is 
something that has already put one million low income workers on 
the tax rolls and pushed another 2.5 million taxpayers into 
higher tax brackets.  Between 1986 and 1999 bracket creep created 
an extra $10 billion in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the government for eliminating bracket creep.  Let us 
call a spade a spade.  It eliminated bracket creep, which was one 
of the most significant things in the budget, but it is calling 
it tax relief.  It is absolutely amazing. 
It cancels future tax increases and that is supposed to be tax 
relief.  It is beyond comprehension.  I do not know if we need to 
send members back to school to take economics 101 or send them to 
an economist.  However, to cancel tax increases for future years 
and then say that they are giving us tax relief is wrong.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to put a solution on the table.  I am extremely proud of 
what the Canadian Alliance has put out there.  The member for 
Medicine Hat has worked extensively on what we refer to as 
solution 17, which is a single tax rate of 17% for everyone. What 
that will do is create an environment where the private sector 
will help the economy flourish and create meaningful, 
long-lasting, permanent jobs where people's lives will become 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While speaking to the member for St. Albert this morning, we 
discussed his private member's bill that would bring back 
accountability to how we spend money.  An example that comes to 
mind is the TAGS program.  The government spent almost $2.8 
billion paying fishermen to sit at home and wait for the fish to 
return.  We all agreed that something needed to be done for these 
people but the people were worse off after the program ended than 
they were when it began.  It did not help them.  All the money 
was for naught.  We gave them no hope and no future.  They were 
extremely frustrated five years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have situations that happen at various times for different 
reasons and we need to address them as a government. 
Unfortunately, the strategies we have seen coming from the 
government have not helped Canadians.  They have put them in a 
much worse situation.  Our health care system is crumbling before 
our eyes.  People are dying while on waiting lists.  There is 
less money in our health care and in the transfer payments today 
than when this government took office in 1993.  That is an 
absolute disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the billion dollar boondoggle.  The government 
will of course say that it was not a billion dollars.  We know 
there was no paperwork for 15% of the applicants.  No one could 
even tell us if the people had applied.  There were numerous 
other grants where people had asked for $60,000 and received 
$100,000 and told to keep the change.   I know how long any 
experienced private business person would stay in business if he 
or she operated in that manner.  It is absolutely mind-boggling 
that the government actually tries to defend these actions.  It 
takes the government so long to react on anything that when it 
does, one wonders just what will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the billion dollar boondoggle, how did the 
government respond to that situation?  The budget was tabled in 
the House in February.  How did the government respond?  It 
responded by giving more money to grants and contributions this 
year.  In this year's budget alone it increased grants and 
contributions to $1.5 billion.  I do not know the exact number 
but I think it gave $200 million or $300 million to HRDC alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did health care get after years and years of cuts?   It 
received $1 billion.  Our national health care is very sacred. It 
is the cornerstone on which we should be focusing but the 
government is dropping the ball and doing nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has a better plan.  Solution 17 is a 
single tax rate that will put money back into the hands of 
taxpayers and families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House about the government's six point plan.  I 
do not have it in front of me so I will try to do this from 
memory.   I actually had a copy of the previous six point plan 
before the government had its first six point plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point is, there is no plan. The second rule in the six 
point plan is, if there are any rules, do not follow the rules. 
The third rule is, locate Shawinigan on the map, memorize it and 
send lots of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  That is not in the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  A member has said that is not in the plan. 
Of course that is not in the plan and is not the fact but that is 
exactly what happened and how it ended up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read from page 46 of the Minister of Finance's budget 
plan 2000 dated February 28, 2000.   By the minister's own 
numbers, it says that by the end of this year we will have a 
deficit.  If the members on the other side want to follow along, 
they should open the budget at page 46. Chart 3.1, Federal 
Government Budgetary Balance.  Throughout the 1980s and up until 
1997 we see that we have gone up to about a $40 billion deficit. 
We then have a little spike up over the line.  Guess what happens 
at the end of this year?  It goes back to below zero.  The 
government will spend more money than it will take in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the Minister of Finance's definition of what this 
chart means.   It is called “Financial Requirements/Surplus”. 
It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important measure of the Government's finances is the 
financial requirements/surplus—the difference between cash 
coming into the Government and cash payments made for programs 
and public debt charges during the year. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government spending more money than it is taking in? 
It is because we are one year before an election. Interestingly 
enough—and I found this quite fascinating because this chart 
goes back to 1961—if we look at the year before every federal 
election we can see that government spending goes through the 
roof.  The election machine kicks in, the goodies come out and it 
is time to buy more votes.  What do members think the billion 
dollar boondoggle was all about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's riding received more money than two or 
three prairie provinces combined, money that was completely 
unaccounted for.  The Prime Minister announced grants before 
there was even any paperwork and before the department even knew 
about it. People were backpedaling so fast to make it happen it 
was not even funny.  That is is so wrong.   It is a culture that 
has permeated this institution that we have to change.  We have 
to bring back accountability and respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask hon. members to get a copy of Bill C-477, which the 
member for St. Albert tabled this morning.  He wants to bring 
back an evaluation of statutory programs so that Canadian 
taxpayers will get some value for their money.  He wants to make 
sure that the programs will do what they were intended to do. 
Imagine that, somebody is actually suggesting we make sure that 
programs are effective, that they meet the stated goals and that 
they are run in an efficient manner and, if not, that they are 
run in a better way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not interested in anything like that.  It will 
not let something like that see the light of day.  It will shovel 
the money out the back door faster than any of us could.  It is 
incredible.  We see it day after day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is holding the chequebook?   It is none other than the 
Minister of Finance.  We saw the sort of unofficial leadership 
race on that side of the House and we heard people talking about 
the Minister of Finance.  This is the man who has been in that 
position since 1993. 
He is the guy who has slashed and burned health care, who has not 
put money in.  He is the man who cut back transfer payments to 
the provinces so much that officials are cutting one of two 
intensive care units in Victoria where I am from.  Children's 
lives will be put at risk.  People will die.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  No, that is factual.  It will be very 
tragic.  They will have to be airlifted to Vancouver.  It is a 
level two intensive care unit for children.  It is a very high 
level of care that has been there for some 15 years and all of a 
sudden it is being shut down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CEO of the Victoria health board in his own words said that 
the debate started because they do not have enough money.  It is 
wrong.  It is time that the government did something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go on and on but let us stick to the facts.  Let us 
talk about the standard of living since the government came in. 
We live in a great country but we cannot take it for granted. The 
standard of living since the government came to power has 
dropped.  The savings of Canadians have dropped.  Young families 
are struggling.  Health care is in an absolute, complete crisis. 
There is no accountability of how money is spent. We see such 
things as the billion dollar boondoggle going on.  It is a 
disgrace.  What is the government's six point plan?  It is to 
give it more money next year and give health care less. That is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding migrants were the big issue.  The government is 
more concerned about building more beds at provincial jail 
institutions than it is for health care.  I hope the members on 
the other side have taken note.  It is time to bring back 
accountability to this institution and bring back respect.  It is 
long overdue.

for bringing to light the information in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting as I listened to him to reflect on some of 
the promises the finance minister has made.  He will increase 
federal spending by something over $86 billion over the next five 
years.  It is amazing he would put that expense on Canadians.  It 
is almost $3,000 per Canadian, to increase spending to that 
level.  At the same time I hear my colleague talking about the 
tragedy in Victoria with the closing of the children's intensive 
care unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would my colleague rectify this situation?  It is impossible 
to imagine that expenditures can be raised and still cut services 
at the same time and at the level that the Liberals are doing it. 
I ask my colleague to describe a situation which he sees would 
not only improve the situation for Canadians but would provide 
the services they need as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague has touched upon 
the very important point about the massive increase in government 
spending.  If the government put more money into health care, 
that is one area which would get my support.  However, where is 
the $86 billion increase in spending going? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen, the biggest beneficiaries are programs such as 
grants and contributions.  Some of the grants are absolutely 
mind-boggling.  They are almost insulting to repeat. 
It is important that we remind Canadians how the money is being 
spent.

only did it send it, it supported it.  It defends those types of 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made a very important point.  There was an $86 
billion spending increase.  It is time to put money back into the 
pockets of Canadians for them to spend.  It would help stimulate 
the economy and they would spend the money a lot better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some things we need to spend money on such as health 
care.  We need to debate how to deliver health care in this 
country.  Our national health care needs to become stronger. 
Whether Canadians get sick in St. John's or they have a heart 
attack in Winnipeg or Vancouver, they want to know that they will 
be treated without having to wait. Unfortunately that is not 
where the money is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was asked what could help turn the situation around and bring 
back some credibility and respect.  Our solution 17 would see a 
single tax rate of 17%.  It would increase the basic exemption 
for people to $10,000.  It would not discriminate against people 
whether they were working or not and both people in the household 
could get that.  That would take one million Canadians off the 
tax roll. People with lower incomes would be the biggest 
beneficiaries.  A family of four would have to earn in the 
neighbourhood of $26,000 before paying one dime in tax.  There 
are people in the country right now who are below the poverty 
line and who pay taxes.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does the money go?  It goes to political patronage and to 
the cronies of the people over there.  That is so frustrating to 
me.  There is example after example.  It goes out one door and 
comes in another door called the Liberal Party of Canada. There 
are lots of examples.  It is corrupt and it is wrong.  It is time 
we changed that and brought back respect to this institution. I 
am not going to quit until we do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member knows that I am from a 
rural area in southern Saskatchewan.  I would like to inform the 
hon. member that I asked for and received some documents from the 
Farm Credit Corporation about the number of farm closures that 
would take place because of the situation that had developed 
because of flooding and the poor commodity prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the government seen fit to take just a small portion of some 
of the expenditures the member just mentioned, we could have left 
many of those young families, if not all of them, on the farm 
with the hope of survival.  At least we would have done something 
for them and their families.  I would like him to comment on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has raised an 
excellent point.  We have seen the farm crisis. I brought that up 
when we talked about the TAGS program for the fisher people in 
Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to help these people but we need stated objectives.  We 
want to make sure that when we help people that the money we 
invest in these programs actually reaches them.  Unfortunately, 
it goes down sinkholes and to government patronage programs. 
Look at the TAGS program in Atlantic Canada; $2.8 billion later 
and those people are worse off when the program was shut down 
than they were when it started.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House we in the Canadian Alliance believe 
there are situations where we are going to invest and help 
people.  We are going to have stated objectives.  That is what 
private member's Bill C-477 by the member for St. Albert 
proposes: what is our objective, is it going to be effective, is 
it being delivered efficiently and can we do it better? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this is all about.  For the people that need it in 
circumstances like the farm crisis, yes we will invest in these 
programs.  That money will reach the people.  It will not get 
gobbled up in a bureaucracy.  It will not get gobbled up in 
administration.  We will evaluate it and make sure that it is 
doing what it is supposed to be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the government talk about all the money it is 
giving to the farm crisis over and over again.  Many of my 
colleagues are from that part of the country and they have told 
me time and time again that it is not reaching anyone.  These 
programs are delivered inefficiently and ineffectively.  That 
goes to the core of the problem of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started off my speech by saying that this is a budget of 
tinkering and tokenism.  The government takes a dollar, gives us 
back a dime and we are supposed to thank it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members in the Canadian Alliance are united more than ever 
right now about making a difference in the country.  They are not 
going to stop until they do.  It is time we brought change to 
this institution, accountability and credibility.  We are going 
to fight for this to the bitter end and we are not going to give 
up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill C-32, an act to 
implement certain provisions of the budget that was tabled in the 
House on February 28, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like to split my time with my colleague 
from Cumberland—Colchester.  He will be taking half of the 
speaking time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate there was not more substance in Bill C-32 with 
more need to implement more of the provisions that should have 
been identified in the budget that was tabled in the House on 
February 28.  With budgets, government and governance, the 
Canadian public is looking for something that is not terribly out 
of the ordinary and it is not something that is terribly 
difficult to understand.  It seems the government has not had the 
opportunity to talk to the people in places where they have a 
tendency to be, the hockey games, the coffee shops in our 
constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we asked the small business owners and other people working 
in those businesses, it is not difficult to understand what 
Canadians want.  They simply want to have and to hold a job, to 
earn a living, to educate their children, to buy a house, to have 
some luxuries, an automobile, and certainly food on their table. 
They want to be able to earn dollars and to keep and control the 
dollars they earn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the budget does not speak to that.  The budget 
still says that if you are a Canadian and you work and you earn 
money, then the government is going to take that money away from 
you, because the government knows full well what is better for 
you as a Canadian citizen and how those dollars should be 
expended and spent on your behalf.  The budget says please do not 
think that you as a thinking Canadian who can raise that family, 
keep that job and earn that dollar, know better how to spend 
those dollars.  The government does not believe Canadians are 
capable of doing that. That philosophy is embraced in the budget 
that was tabled in the House on February 28.  I will speak to 
that in certain areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also a budget is not simply a financial blueprint; it is a 
blueprint for the way our society and our country is to grow.  It 
is called vision.  I know that word is sometimes overused but 
certainly it has not gotten through to the members on the 
government side of the House.  They have absolutely no vision. 
It was mentioned earlier by the hon. member who just spoke that 
there was a tinkering in the way they do business.  It is true. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I use the term caretaker government.  It is a caretaker 
government with a caretaker prime minister who is simply waiting 
out his days.  He is saying that we should do business the way we 
have always done business, not rock the boat or do anything new 
and innovative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we live in a new and innovative society.  We do not live 
in the 1950s any longer like perhaps the Canadian Alliance would 
like us to do.  We live in a world now which demands that we 
compete in a globalized world.  It demands that our children be 
educated to a level and standard that they can compete with other 
nations in the world, not just simply with provinces or the 
cities adjacent to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not recognize that.  It has no vision.  It 
has no vision on education.  It has no vision on agriculture.  We 
have talked about that.  The budget does not speak a word about 
agriculture.  Agriculture, the food on our tables that we eat, is 
important to Canadian citizens.  People who have families, who 
have jobs and want to educate their children like to put food on 
their tables, and that comes from agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has absolutely no understanding or idea where the 
agricultural sector of society is going.  There is no vision. The 
government puts out false hopes, false statements and false 
programs.  Yet the dollars do not get to where they are supposed 
to go.  My constituents have a real feeling of depression because 
they do not know what kind of future they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the lack of vision in health care.  The 
government stands in the House, pats itself on the back and says 
that it put $2.5 billion into health care in the last budget over 
four years.  The $2.5 billion do not bring us back to a 1993-94 
level of expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two things are wrong with that.  It is not simply the money.  It 
is the vision with respect to health care.  The government will 
not even sit down to work with the provinces, let alone listen to 
the way it could possibly change the system for the better.  It 
is not prepared to do that because it has no vision and no 
understanding of where Canadians want to go with that aspect of 
their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no vision on transportation.  Our country was 
built on transportation, by the rail links, by air and by road. 
The government does not even know where it is heading with 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about Bill C-32 specifically.  I mentioned the lack 
of vision.  The government has tried to deal with a couple of 
areas.  One of them was the basic personal deduction.  Canadians 
want to keep their money so they can spend it the best way they 
see fit.  One way to do that is for the government to take less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Progressive Conservative position that we should have 
basic personal deductions of $12,000 per year.  That is not much 
money in today's society but it would be a step in the right 
direction.  However the government takes great pride in 
increasing it by about $100 so that under this government 
Canadian citizens are not given the right to spend their own 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about CHST.  It is not simply a matter of the health 
dollars that are being transferred.  As I said earlier, the 
health dollars are abysmal. The government should be held 
accountable for what it did to our health care system.  The Prime 
Minister will be known in history as the man who destroyed our 
health care system.  He did it almost single-handedly, although 
his backbenchers and his government gave him full rein to do so. 
They too will have to wear that in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would we do with health care?  We would do something that 
is really foreign to the government, co-operative federalism.  It 
used to be that 50% of health care dollars were contributed by 
the federal government.  That has been reduced.  In fact there is 
a provincial government now that is suggesting it could be as low 
as 11 cents or 11% of health care dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  That is wrong and the member knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, they like to dispute 
that.  Let us say that it is 25 cents on the dollar, which it is 
not, even with the tax points. 
Let us assume they can put that forward.  I do not think 
Canadians are gullible enough to believe that, but they will try 
to put it forward and will try to get Canadians to believe 
something that is not in fact true.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three issues in health care.  The first is that we 
have an aging population.  The government does not seem to 
recognize it, because we are now back to 1993-94 levels of 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked about the new global economy.  We live in a 
globalized world.  We have technology that we never considered 
possible.  We have it but we cannot afford it because the 
government is not prepared to work with the provinces and is not 
prepared to work on the health care system to make it available 
to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we have an aging population.  There is also 
technology and inflation.  We need money in the system but we 
also need to work with the provinces and we need co-operation. We 
will not get any of those with this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 also deals with employment insurance.  Employment 
insurance is an insurance program for which Canadians pay a 
premium so that they are entitled to a benefit from the program 
when required.  By law, the employment insurance program is a 
flow-through, break even program, an insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government collects $18 billion a year in insurance 
premiums and pays out $12 billion a year in benefits.  It pockets 
$6 billion of our money.  Members of the government do it and say 
that they are wonderful.  They pat themselves on the back because 
they can use the $6 billion to spend the way they would like to 
spend it, as has been done perhaps in Shawinigan and in some 
other mismanaged programs for which they are so famous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry Bill C-32 does not contain more substance.  Yes, we 
live in a great country, but Canadians must recognize that we 
have to protect our standard of living.  We cannot protect our 
standard of living and our quality of life with the mismanagement 
of this government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to address one specific point.  The member announced that 
the Progressive Conservative Party, as part of its platform, 
would like to increase a tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to it as the basic personal deduction.  For 
the member's edification, it is a basic personal amount, a 
non-refundable tax credit at a rate of 17%.  If we assume a 50% 
provincial tax rate of the federal tax rate, the equivalent in 
the pocket for a Canadian would be at a rate of about 25%.  The 
$5,000 increase in the tax credit the member is proposing would 
generate $1,250 in the pocket of every Canadian taxpayer.  That 
is federal and provincial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will probably know that in 1997, the last year 
Revenue Canada reported on it, 14 million Canadian taxpayers 
filed income tax returns and actually paid income taxes. 
Therefore, if what the member is proposing were to be done, it 
would mean that 14 million taxpayers times $100 would generate 
$1.4 billion of cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member is proposing would cost the federal government 
$12 billion.  This is not something to be taken lightly.  The 
member also went on to speak about EI and $6 billion.  Now we are 
up to $18 billion. 
I could deal with some of the other points, but in a very few 
moments the hon. member had summarily eliminated about $20 
billion of revenue each and every year to the federal treasury to 
support programs and services. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is simple.  I understand clearly what the member 
would like to cut in terms of the revenue base the government 
uses to support health care and all other supports it provides to 
Canadians.  If he is to cut $20 billion-plus a year out of the 
federal treasury, what is he prepared to cut each and every year 
to ensure that we do not go back into the deficit that his party 
put us into to start off this mess? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would just like to 
touch on that last comment.  The reason we are in this mess is 
because of a government led by a prime minister by the name of 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau.  That is where this mess started with 
respect to social expenditures which, by the way, were funded out 
of my son's future and my grandson's future.  Let us get that 
straight right now.  The whole mess we are in right now is 
because of a Liberal government and Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we went to $12,000 on the basic personal exemption, we would 
be— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  It is very difficult 
for the Chair to hear the hon. member for Brandon—Souris who has 
the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We do not want to hear him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair wants to hear him and to 
make sure that the debate is conducted fairly so that all hon. 
members can be heard.  I know that members will want to hear the 
answer the hon. member for Brandon—Souris is giving to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to the lack of substance 
in the question from the hon. member for Mississauga South, based 
on a basic personal exemption of $12,000 as has been suggested, 
2.5 million Canadians would be removed from the tax rolls.  It is 
about $1,200 annually, which works out to about $2.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's philosophy is that it can do it better than 
individual Canadians.  We are saying that individual Canadians 
should be the masters of their own destiny.  The money should be 
given back to them.  Something else the government cannot get 
through its head is that when money is given back to Canadians it 
generates the economy.  It generates more dollars that can then 
be collected by the tax creatures on that side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are anywhere from $6 billion to $10 billion a year, but we 
cannot get a real handle on the numbers because the finance 
minister and the government will not tell us what is the real 
surplus.  The reason they do not want to tell us the real number 
is that they hide it and squirrel it away so that they can spend 
in places where it should not be spent.  Those dollars should be 
invested back into the pockets of Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is pleasure to speak to Bill C-32.  I want to focus my remarks 
on the transportation components of the bill and on how it will 
impact Nova Scotia.  After reviewing certain aspects and terms of 
the bill and the budget, my conclusion is the bill is tokenism. 
It is inconsistency and it is backfilling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the finance minister completed his budget presentation, it 
is interesting that he conducted a poll to find out what people 
thought of it.  He found that the majority of Canadians felt that 
he did not put enough money into health care, the number one 
issue on everyone's mind.  He did not have to take that poll. All 
he had to do was to ask me.  I did the same thing two years ago 
in my own riding, and the number one issue was health care by a 
long margin.  Education was second.  I was surprised that the 
finance minister did not have that information and had to take a 
poll even after he presented his budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget he promised $2.5 billion over five years for 
health care, education and infrastructure.  The provinces have 
been saying very loudly and consistently in unison that they need 
$6 billion a year to maintain the system as it is. The government 
has let the number one issue for Canadians, health care, 
deteriorate to such an extent that it is hard to get a doctor in 
a lot of places.  It is hard to get nursing care. It is hard to 
get into hospital.  It is hard to get a hospital bed. 
In return the finance minister brings this token amount of money, 
and it is a token amount of money, to the provinces each year. In 
the case of Nova Scotia, it amounts to about $15 million or $20 
million a year for extra money for health care, and that is truly 
a token.  One hospital in our province is projected to cost 
approximately $40 million or $50 million.  That is one hospital. 
This budget will give $15 million to $20 million a year to the 
entire province.  It is truly a token.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the infrastructure in the bill that the Liberals have 
touted so much is for highway work.  I will read what the 
transportation minister in Nova Scotia said.  He said that the 
infrastructure program has a highway component to it.  Ottawa 
will provide less than $5 million per year for improvements to 
Nova Scotia highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a real serious issue in Nova Scotia.  There is a highway 
in Nova Scotia called Highway 101.  It has more fatal accidents 
on it per mile driven than any highway in Canada.  There is no 
money to fix this highway.  Yet the federal government allots $5 
million a year to Nova Scotia for highway work.  Again, in my 
first remarks I mentioned that this is about tokenism and this is 
a token amount of money for highway work for our Province of Nova 
Scotia and all the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transportation ministers of every province have called on 
Ottawa for a $17 billion highways program.  What does the 
government come up with?  Five million dollars a year for Nova 
Scotia.  It is just a token and it is just literally a joke. Even 
though revenues from fuel taxes and gas taxes have increased by 
hundreds of millions of dollars over the last few years, the last 
decade, this is the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also mentioned inconsistency in this budget.  Again, I come 
back to Nova Scotia and its highway situation where there is one 
of the most dangerous highways in Canada.  Not only is it the 
subject of fatalities regularly, but unfortunately the fatalities 
are mostly young people.  There have been 50 fatalities in the 
last seven years and most of them were young people.  All lives 
are precious, but young lives are even more precious.  For this 
situation to be allowed to continue is unheard of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inconsistency part comes in when we consider that in the 
next two years, under the federal budget and federal funding 
programs, Newfoundland, the province on one side of Nova Scotia, 
will get $105 million in highway funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Brunswick, on the other side of us, will get $102 million in 
highway funding.  Nova Scotia in the middle will get zero 
funding.  It is Nova Scotia that has the dangerous highways, the 
highways that are causing the fatalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, it is totally inconsistent.  How can a government say 
it will give this province $100 million and that one $100 
million?  I read in the paper yesterday that it may give the city 
of Montreal $300 million to $100 million because it has traffic 
jams.  Nova Scotia is saddled with the most dangerous highway in 
Canada and it cannot get one cent in infrastructure money for 
that highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, if we look at the money injected into the provinces on 
either side of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick got $465 million 
between 1987 and 1998 and Newfoundland got $405 million.  Yet 
Nova Scotia gets zero dollars in the next two years.  It is just 
completely unfair and, again, it is inconsistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amount allotted in the infrastructure program is 
approximately $5 million a year and will hardly do any work, and 
certainly will do nothing to solve the fatal deficiencies in 
Highway 101 in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem with the budget and the past practices of the 
Liberal government, its practice now and its inconsistency in 
transferring money and sharing the cost of highways, in Atlantic 
Canada we have ended up with the only two unique toll highways in 
Canada on the Trans-Canada Highway.  We are the only region that 
has toll highways, one in Nova Scotia and one in New Brunswick. 
Why were these toll highways built?  Because there was no choice. 
The federal government had no consistent program of cost sharing 
these highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, in the case of Nova Scotia, in the next two years there 
is no money at all for highway construction.  The provinces of 
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick came up with these innovative plans 
which have proven extremely unpopular, so much so that both 
governments which implemented them, the Liberal government in New 
Brunswick and the Liberal government in Nova Scotia, are now 
defeated and replaced by Conservative governments in both 
provinces, much to the credit of their plan to put in the toll 
highways.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the New Brunswick government eliminated the toll 
highways.  Hopefully the province of Nova Scotia will follow 
suit, but at the moment Nova Scotia is the only province in 
Canada to have a toll highway on the Trans-Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is because of inconsistent programs with the federal 
government with respect to highway funding.  If Nova Scotia 
received the same highway funding in the next two years that 
Newfoundland or New Brunswick received, it could not only build 
Highway 101, but it could probably take the tolls off the old 
Highway 104. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The root causes are inconsistent funding, poor planning, and 
little control.  The auditor general said there is no 
accountability of money given to the provinces.  There is nothing 
in the budget which will address any of these issues.  They are 
going to stay the same.  Nova Scotia will continue to be saddled 
with the toll highway until it has its finances in order so that 
it can either take care of the highway or the federal government 
finally comes around and deals with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned backfilling in my opening remarks.  I see much of 
this budget as backfilling.  By that I mean it is replacing the 
vast amounts of money withdrawn from infrastructure, withdrawn 
from highways, withdrawn from education, and withdrawn from 
health care, with tokens to try and help soothe the nerves of 
Canadians.  However, in particular with health care, it is not 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the provincial health ministers band together in 
perhaps an unprecedented fashion.  They have united, taken a 
stand and forced the federal government into a corner.   I think 
we probably will see some movement now in health care funding 
because the provinces are unanimous in their opposition to this 
budget we are talking about today, they are unanimous in their 
opposition to the tokenism provided to health care, and they are 
unanimous in their opposition to the attitude of the Liberal 
government which allowed our once famous health care system to 
deteriorate and be reduced to just a shadow of what it used to be 
when it was the envy of the whole world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with Bill C-32, yesterday the Minister of Transport made 
an announcement regarding VIA Rail.  He has spent years pondering 
a plan for VIA Rail.  VIA Rail is a special interest of his and 
in the past it has seemed to be even a passion.  I really 
expected that he was going to come out with an innovative plan, 
at least along the lines of the recommendations made by the 
standing committee on transport, which made several 
recommendations.  One would think that the minister would follow 
these and try to resolve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The underlying root problem of VIA Rail is that is loses about 
$200 million a year.  There are ways to address that, and one 
would think the minister would attempt something innovative, 
something imaginative.  What did he do?  Yesterday he announced 
an increased subsidy of $400 million.  That is an increased 
subsidy of 47% in the subsidies to VIA Rail, but there is no 
vision.  That is just to fix the equipment and infrastructure of 
the VIA Rail system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing new.  There is nothing additional.  There are 
no additional services, no additional facilities, no additional 
equipment.  It is to maintain and upgrade the equipment which has 
been allowed to deteriorate for so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The incredible thing about the minister's announcement is that 
the government is going to give $401.9 million to VIA Rail and 
then the government is going to ask VIA Rail for a business plan 
with regard to how it is going to spend the money.  Can we 
imagine anyone in the private sector going to the bank and saying 
“If you lend me $400 million, I will write you a business plan 
after you approve it and I will explain how I am going to spend 
the money”.  It would not work and we all know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32, from a transport point of view and from the point of 
view of Nova Scotia is a budget of tokenism, inconsistency and 
unfairness.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to add my remarks to 
those of my colleague, who serves on the transport committee and 
who is very definitely concerned with highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot talk about highways and highway infrastructure without 
someone from my area adding something to the debate.  It is a 
national disgrace across Canada and no one from any party on any 
side of the House will deny that.  Our highway system is 
deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make this point to my hon. colleague. 
The province of Saskatchewan has more miles of highway per capita 
than any other province.  I would like to inform the member that 
if we extract what Saskatchewan will probably get, it is about 
$150 million this year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to explain to the hon. member that if we were to 
sand-seal only number 13 highway that runs across just my 
constituency, the $150 million would be gone.  That is the end of 
federal subsidies to highways in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member that the amount of money that the 
province of Nova Scotia is getting is comparable to the pitiful 
amount that we are getting.  There will not be any improvement in 
highway construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain for his remarks.  We discuss this issue 
constantly in the transport committee, both officially and 
unofficially.  The fact of the matter is it is a national 
disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has really gone on in Canada is that highways have not been 
maintained properly for the last five to ten years.  Highways do 
not deteriorate on a straight line basis, surviving for a long 
time and then suddenly starting to break up very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is actually a highway deficit in this country.  It is not 
on the books of the government, but it is a very real debt and a 
very real deficit.  We owe money to our national highway system. 
It is going to get a lot worse as these highways continue to 
deteriorate.  Once they break up, the moisture goes down, the 
frost gets in, heaves them, breaks them more, more moisture and 
more frost and so on.  We are in for a tremendous requirement for 
money for both our main and infrastructure highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My numbers for Saskatchewan are even less optimistic than the 
member's numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  I was being generous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is being very 
generous, as he always is.  Saskatchewan has truly not fared well 
in the highway casino. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the provinces on either side of Nova Scotia will 
each get more than $100 million in the next two years.  Nova 
Scotia gets zip.  I have Saskatchewan down here in my information 
for a big zip, too.  Saskatchewan is going to suffer from the 
same problem as Nova Scotia. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak on Bill C-32, an act to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in parliament 
on February 28, 2000.  I do not want to go over in detail the 
whole bill, but there are a couple of areas on which I would like 
to comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Finance stands in this House and tables a 
budget about how he is going to raise or lower taxes, how he is 
going to spend on new programs and how he is going to eliminate 
other programs that are obsolete, one would think as the chief 
financial officer of the organization that he would have his 
figures down pat and would know what he was talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 4 of the budget implementation act deals with enabling 13 
first nations identified in the schedule to impose a 7% value 
added tax.  The rest of the country has the equivalent tax called 
the GST on fuel, cigarettes and alcohol.  Now certain first 
nations are being given the responsibility to collect 7% as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out a couple of things.  The 7% GST goes to the 
federal government.  The 7% that is going to be collected under 
this act is going to the first nations that will be collecting 
the money.  There are no regulations about how this tax is to be 
administered.  It only stipulates the right to collect it, no 
doubt because under this Liberal government the first nations 
have been given in essence sovereign powers to pass legislation 
in their own right.  We have to concern ourselves about the 
regulations and how this money is going to be split between the 
federal government collecting GST and the first nations tax.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an occasion to stop at a gas station on a first nations 
reserve.  My gas bill was approximately $31.  It was before gas 
prices peaked in the last few weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guy in front of me paid for his tank of gas, which cost him 
$12 because he did not have to pay tax.  After he had paid his 
$12 to fill his tank with gas, he bought cigarettes.  Lots of 
people buy cigarettes, but it seemed to me that the typical 
purchase of cigarettes on the reserve was $130. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Behind the counter they had these little plastic shopping bags 
full of the standard purchase of cigarettes, so that when 
somebody was buying cigarettes they would get their $130 worth, 
which to you and me, Mr. Speaker, or anybody else who would have 
been buying the cigarettes, might have been worth $300. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said to myself, other Canadians do not normally buy $130 worth 
of cigarettes at a time, any time I have seen people buying 
cigarettes in a store, so why would it be that the standard 
cigarette purchase would be $130, tax free?  I wonder, because I 
have no proof of this, if it is because it was next to a large 
city and perhaps these people had a ready market for these 
cigarettes. Maybe not, but perhaps.  It is worth thinking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As these cigarettes are purchased on the reserve by status 
natives, the transaction is legal, according to our laws, but the 
second transaction, if they sell them on the street at more or 
less the going price for others, then that is illegal and the 
Minister of Finance is losing out on his tax collection, if that 
is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have instituted this tax we will have the same store 
collecting 7% in GST from Canadians and 7% on the alternative tax 
from the natives who have the card which they can produce.  It is 
the exact same amount of tax.  How will the Minister of Finance 
be able to determine whether that tax should be remitted to the 
Department of Finance or whether it should be kept by the band 
for its own use?  There are no regulations attached to this bill. 
As I mentioned earlier, because they are largely sovereign, I 
think they could tell the minister that they will write their own 
rules as to how they will collect the tax.  I am fairly sure we 
will not see very much GST money.  I gave the example of the 
cigarettes.  That disturbs me, because I spend, as chairman of 
the public accounts committee, a lot of time focused on the area 
of bribery and corruption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there are loose rules that are open to interpretation, open 
to management, open to subtle bookkeeping and other 
opportunities, it then starts to dribble down through the holes 
in the floor and we lose sight of it.  That concerns me because 
it allows people to develop bad attitudes toward paying taxes, 
being honest, having high morals and ensuring that everything is 
honest and above board.  I am seriously concerned that we are 
providing these opportunities and challenges.  It bothers me 
immensely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continuing in the same vein, with respect to the Minister of 
Finance collecting the taxes and ensuring that Canadians get 
value for their money, the auditor general tabled a report this 
week which had nine chapters.  One of them dealt with elementary 
and secondary education by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada.  I 
really want to put the emphasis on the question:  Are we getting 
value for our money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is a good point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  It is an excellent point, as my 
colleague says.  The auditor general said that the department 
does not know how much money is being spent by the first nations 
on education because it gives block funding to the first nations, 
who then provide education.  The department has the 
responsibility to provide that education money, but it does not 
know how much money is ending up in education. 
It may be ending up in welfare.  It may be ending up in someone's 
pockets.  It may be ending up somewhere else because the 
department does not know how much money is being spent on 
education.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report covers a number of horrifying things.  In paragraph 
4.72 the auditor general writes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We further observed in one departmental region that a master 
tuition agreement between the Department and the provincial 
Ministry of Education had expired in 1992— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the year 2000.  That was eight years ago.  The agreement 
had expired.  No one had really bothered to do anything about it. 
They just wrote the cheques and carried on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about things such as special needs?  We are concerned about 
special needs.  However, the department does not know whether 
special needs students are being appropriately identified or 
assisted.  Special needs students are those who are 
psychologically disadvantaged or who have learning disabilities. 
We agree with that, but because of the reported lack of 
diagnostic expertise on the reserves, the auditor general 
believes that the potential for under and over identification of 
these students is high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the department does not know whether all funding 
provided for diagnostic and remedial services is actually used 
for this purpose.  The department does not know.  In one region 
this amounts to $581 per student.  Take note of the $581, per 
student year, for all students.  Furthermore, the department does 
not know the length of time the students are maintained in 
special needs status.  This makes it more difficult to identify 
opportunities for improved services in another region, where 
costs range from $2,047—remember that I said it was $581 in one 
region, and now it is up to $2,047 in another region—to $65,650 
per special needs student, and there is no process or mechanism 
to ensure that the students' needs are being served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a problem with these kinds of numbers.  In one region 
special needs students are getting $581 and in another region 
they are getting $65,650 per student.  Should we not be asking 
the question, what is going on?  There was no process or 
mechanism to ensure that the students' needs were being served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance collects taxes and he gives the money to 
the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, and the 
minister does not have a clue about what is going on in his 
department.  We know what happens with the minister of HRDC.  We 
have said many times in the House that she does not have a clue, 
and now the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
obviously does not have a clue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the lack of education funding agreements?  I 
mentioned one region that did not even have one.  In one region 
they noted 244 instances where they expected to find agreements 
between first nations or the department and provincial 
educational authorities to cover student enrolment in provincial 
schools.  However, the department was able to identify agreements 
in only 58 cases.  There were 244 instances where they expected 
to find them, but they only found them in 58 cases.  Further, the 
department did not know whether any agreement was in force in 128 
cases, and determined that no agreements existed for the 
remaining 58. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going on, Mr. Speaker?  Do you not think we are entitled 
to ask legitimate questions about what is going on?  Does the 
department know what is going on?  Or, should it just admit that 
it does not know what is going on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first nations are at the bottom of the economic and social 
ladder in the country. 
We surely have some obligation to help them take their place in 
the economic society we have built and to provide some prosperity 
for them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Native people watch the television ads which sell everything 
from soup to nuts, cars, TVs, television programs and so on, but 
they cannot have those things.  All they have is a welfare cheque 
that we hand out because they do not have the education required 
to take a job, which would provide meaning in their life, which 
would provide purpose in their life, which would motivate them 
and give them the ability to understand this complex world.  If 
they could acquire that education they could work with computers, 
such as we have in front of us.  Native people cannot do that. 
The department does not even know if they are going to school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 4.2 of the auditor general's report indicates that the 
percentage of natives who are not enrolled in elementary or 
secondary schools is 20%.  The figure is not available for all 
Canadians.  The dropout rate before completion of grade 9 in 
native schools is 18%.  The figure for all Canadians is 3%.  The 
percentage of youth between the ages of 18 and 20 who left school 
totals 40% for natives, 16% for all Canadians.  Of youth between 
the ages of 18 and 20, only 30% of natives graduated from school, 
compared to 63% for all Canadians.  The population with the least 
high school education amounts to 37% on reserve and 65% for all 
Canadians.  Only 30% of the native population graduates from high 
school and it costs taxpayers $1 billion a year.  Only 30% 
succeed in meeting the basic fundamental requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister does not have agreements with the school boards. 
The minister gives block funding to the bands and does not ask 
them to account for the money.  Agreements expire and he does not 
follow up on them.  Kids are dropping out of school and he does 
not know how many.  The department is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance stood in the House on February 28 and 
said that the government was going to tax Canadians.  The 
government continues to tax Canadians so that money can be given 
to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, who 
in turn does not know what he does with it.  He has no clue. 
Unfortunately, he is not the only one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the news the last couple of days we have heard much about the 
scientific research tax credit.  The idea was to motivate 
Canadian companies to do research and development, and a tax 
credit would be provided to them because this was good for 
Canada.  It was good for Canada.  We got an extra $50 million 
punch out of it.  The bad news is, it cost $2 billion to get the 
$50 million punch.  For every $40 spent, we received $1 back. 
Where is the logic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know where the logic is, but I do know that in 1997 the 
Minister of Finance had an evaluation in front of him, telling 
him that for every $40 spent the government would receive $1 in 
return.  The minister kept the study under wraps.  In 1997, 1998, 
1999 and again in 2000 he stood in the House and said “We are 
providing value for money for Canadians”.  In the meantime, for 
every $40 the taxpayers put into this program, they got $1 back. 
I cannot understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How bad is it?  Let us take one particular claim as an example. 
It was a complex claim.  Why?  The taxpayer did not provide a lot 
of documentation to say what he was trying to do. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada sent in the auditors who spent 10,000 hours 
looking at this claim.  The average person works about 1,700 or 
1,800 hours a year; throw in some overtime and call it 2,000 
hours a year. That was five years of auditors' time on one claim. 
There are 16,000 to approve.  When are they going to finish? 
They spent 10,000 hours on one claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They had to get some scientific expert advice.  They spent 
$300,000 of taxpayers' money to get a professional opinion on 
this claim because it was not well justified.  The claim finally 
went through process.  They said that the particular claim was 
entitled to tens of millions of dollars.  We are not sure how 
many tens there were.  Presumably somewhere between $20 million 
and $100 million is what was paid out.  In the final review they 
scratched out the millions and doubled it for no particular 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the rationale. This is how crazy the rules are 
and how the taxpayer gets taken to the cleaners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subcontractor did the research and development.  He put in 
his claim and got his refund of tens of millions of dollars. It 
was in the bank.  He sold the R and D to the main contractor who 
said “This is research and development done in Canada, send in 
the claim”.  He got it again.  The rules allowed him to get it 
again.  The reason it was doubled was it had to approximate the 
claim by the general contractor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the subcontractor was audited and all the 
information in its own files said that the subcontractor was 
entitled to so much money, the main contractor had approximated 
and exaggerated the claim. It was “unable” to verify that 
because the main contractor did not have the files.  They were in 
the subcontractor's office which had been audited by Revenue 
Canada but Revenue Canada said it could not look at the file a 
second time. Knowing full well it was paying out too much, it had 
to go with the main contractor's estimate and exaggeration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxpayer paid and the Minister of Finance did not even blush 
when he stood in the House and said he needed $165 billion to run 
this country.  I know and members know he could do it with a lot 
less.

in private schools that I supervised or in the public schools, 
whenever a claim was made for a special needs student, solid 
proof was needed that the money was being expended on that 
particular student.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation that exists within my province and across Canada 
is a sin against geography and the nature of government. These 
children who are just as important as any child I ever had in 
front of me or supervised are not getting funds spent on them for 
education.  What will we do?  One word can sum up the last 20 
years: nothing.  Nothing has changed and it is getting worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my colleague for drawing attention to this 
situation.  With the billions of dollars going out on these 
expenditures, what does the hon. member recommend that the 
government re-examine during the current fiscal year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that 
question because it allows me to wax on my private member's bill 
that I tabled this morning.  It deals with program evaluation. 
Providing education to our young kids on the reserves is another 
program provided by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My private member's bill says that on every program provided by 
the government, including education to our natives on reserves, 
we should ask four questions.  The first question is what is the 
program designed to do?  The goal is to provide educated children 
on reserves.  The second question is how well are we achieving 
that?  We will have to move further through the alphabet than 
<I>F</I> to find out how the government is doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  <I>F</I> minus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it would be <I>F</I> minus 
half a billion dollars I would think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third question is, is it being done efficiently?  I pointed 
out that agreements had expired in 1992 and it never bothered to 
get them renewed.  The government does not have a clue. There is 
no efficiency.  There is no productivity.  The department's mind 
is in a fog.  The minister's mind is in a fog.  Nobody seems to 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the student who is not getting an education?  He or 
she should care and we should care.  We care and the government 
should care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth question is can we achieve the same or better results 
in a different fashion?  We must always be creative in seeing if 
we can improve ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four fundamental questions: what is it we are trying 
to do, how well are we doing it, are we doing it efficiently, and 
can we achieve better results in a different way?  If we asked 
these simple four questions for native education and everything 
else, we could provide many more services for much less cash.

Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on behalf of the Calgary East 
constituency.  This is my second speech on the budget.  I have 
chosen to speak on this topic again because I would like to tell 
the House what my constituents and other Canadians have been 
saying. My remarks are based on two concepts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is what constituents are saying are their two major 
concerns.  Time after time the phone calls I receive have one 
theme, that people's take home pay is dwindling.  People are 
having a hard time making ends meet.  One of my constituents 
wrote, “We love our work but we are always in a financial bind 
due to low wages and no recognition of our qualifications and 
college degrees”.  Despite having a college degree all she earns 
is $7.50 per hour.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand it is quite difficult to tell a business to raise 
wages.  But a lot of our money disappears into the government 
coffers. It is interesting the way the whole taxation system is 
designed.  We take it at one end and then we go around in circles 
and try to send it back in another way, and either we tax them or 
we say that we do not tax them and that we are taking care of the 
lower income workers. At the end of the day, at the time when 
people need the money which is when they get their weekly 
paycheque, the money is gone.  It takes months for the money to 
come back to them at the other end.  In between what are they 
supposed to do?  How are they supposed to live? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is made up of blue collar workers, single mothers and 
parents trying to send their children to school.  When I go 
knocking on doors I hear time after time, “I am earning $30,000 
and I cannot make ends meet.  I am paying so much in taxes”. 
Many government members have said to me “No, no, we are taking 
care of all these things”.  True, it comes back through social 
outlets such as cheques for family allowance, child care, GST 
refunds and all those things.  The GST refund can take four 
months. What are they supposed to do until then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can the government not address the issue for single parents, 
growing families and those who are earning low wages? Why not 
give it to them up front so they have more take home pay? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter from another individual in my riding.  He asked 
for a T-1 slip.  He had to go through a huge bureaucracy. Revenue 
Canada said he had to fill out so many forms and the guy just 
said to forget it, that he was not interested.  The paperwork 
burden in the taxation system is so humongous that people are fed 
up.  I have heard time and again “I am not going to respond to 
Revenue Canada.  I am not going to fill out all the paperwork”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A constituent phoned me, a pensioner, who said on the one hand 
the government gives money to pensioners and then, bingo, Revenue 
Canada needs $248 back right away. For what?  He got phone call 
after phone call and letter after letter until he was fed up.  We 
intervened and the matter was resolved, but why did it not get 
resolved in the first place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has said that we have not been asking 
questions about the budget because he thinks the budget is great. 
Perhaps the poll which came out today indicates why the 
opposition has not been asking the finance minister questions on 
the budget. There is nothing to ask. He will talk about budget 
cuts and all those things but we know, Canadians on the street 
know, and students know that when they look at their paycheques 
and when they look in their pockets, their take home pay is less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not agree with what the finance minister is saying. It 
is better to tune out what the finance minister is saying than to 
listen and ask where is the tax break he is talking about.   He 
gives a tax break, but at the same time CPP premiums are hiked 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at EI.  Surplus after surplus is going into the EI fund 
that the government is using to spend in other areas.   It will 
not even reduce the EI premiums. 
How will Canadians feel?  Will Canadians actually get the feeling 
from their take home pay that taxes are going down when the 
government is set on spending?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have people in the government who have their own agendae. Our 
heritage minister wants to be recognized as the Canadian cultural 
protection person.  She keeps writing out cheques, cheque after 
cheque, and doing her best, but what do we hear on the streets? 
We hear on the streets from Canadians that their take home pay is 
shrinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go to the issue of the economy.  I am critic for 
international trade, so what happens in the economy is quite 
important and of concern to me.  I have been on many trips to see 
how Canadian trade officials have been working hard to promote 
trade in Canada.  That is one of the areas of prosperity for the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time after time the Minister for International Trade boasted in 
committee and everywhere that 43% of our GDP is in the export 
market.  That is great.  I applaud him for that.  I hope it goes 
higher and higher.  After all, it helps the Canadian consumer and 
it brings prosperity to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give credit to our trade officials, those who are in the field 
and have been working very hard to ensure that Canadian companies 
are out there seeking the opportunities that globalization has 
opened for them.  I commend them.  I have seen them hard at work. 
I have seen Canadian companies working hand in hand with these 
people, promoting the goods and technology that Canadians have 
developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subcommittee on international trade is now studying how to 
improve trade with Europe.  As we know, trade with Europe has 
been gradually declining.  It is improving but not to the level 
that we thought it should have improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this points to the fact that there are people who recognize 
the need for Canadians to be taking advantage of globalization. 
If there are problems at home with Canadian companies which we 
have not fixed, how will we market ourselves outside the country? 
If the foundation at home is not strong, what is the point of 
trading outside?  Somewhere down the line it will crack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have free trade agreements through NAFTA with Mexico and 
Chile.  We are trying to get agreements with Costa Rica and other 
countries.  We have seen the demand coming in for Britain to join 
NAFTA.  These are all good things.  They are great things, but we 
need to address the issues at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time after time new cries are being heard that there is a need 
to address the issues at home and the need for productivity.  The 
biggest one is taxation, the way we are taxing our companies. The 
way our economy is being overtaxed leaves little room for 
companies to aggressively seek foreign markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote here for a second an editorial in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>.  Where it says country, I will substitute that by saying 
the past government was too dumb to understand that 25 years of 
high deficits would lead to a debt and tax crisis and maybe too 
dumb to understand that another 10 years of uncompetitive taxes 
and regulations would lead to a permanently reduced standard of 
living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read from the Calgary <I>Herald</I> of today, written by 
one of the CEOs of Alberta Energy Company Ltd. 
He said that Canada looked good but was moving too slowly. 
Perhaps the finance minister should read the article which 
contains that warning from an executive of a very important 
company in Alberta.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of them have one simple straightforward message: taxes are 
too high.  If the government does not address that issue and take 
it seriously, 43% of GDP in exports will start going down. 
Canadians will be unable to take advantage of the globalization 
of economies that is taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our ambassadors, including the minister of trade and I, travel 
around the world pushing to expand trade.  We sign agreements but 
if at the end of the day there is no competitive advantage for 
Canadian companies, what is the point?  They must be able to take 
advantage of market opportunities.  The government is not selling 
the products.  It is the Canadian companies that are selling 
them.  They are the ones who are out there selling their 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the greatness of Bombardier, SNC-Lavalin and other 
big companies.  At the end of the day we look at the companies 
that do the majority of the exports.  We could name 10 of them. 
That is all.  Big companies like Bombardier, SNC-Lavalin and 
mining giants are the few that are on the international market. 
If we want to have prosperity we need small and medium size 
businesses.  Everyone knows that.  I do not have to repeat it. 
Everyone talks about it.  Everyone says they are the vehicles of 
growth and that is what should happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time after time when we talk to them they express concerns. They 
do not have the infrastructure or the competitive advantage to go 
out and grab these opportunities.  The Americans are doing it and 
now we have the European Union with its $500 billion market. 
They take advantage.  Canadian companies need to be aggressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that Canada should be the route for European 
companies into NAFTA, into the U.S. market.  That is a great 
idea.  It is fantastic if we can do it.  At the end of the day, 
if taxes in Canada are not reduced, competitiveness will not be 
there.  How will we become the conduits that we aspire to be and 
our trade officials want us to be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the Minister for International Trade had a talk with 
the Minister of Finance and said that something should be done. 
There is no point in each one going in different directions. Then 
the industry minister, who recognizes what is happening, tries to 
speak out but his chain is pulled back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are worried.  Today's polls indicate the priorities of 
Canadians.  Health care is a priority of Canadians.  Irrespective 
of what the government wants to say, every Canadian knows that it 
is the federal government that cut the money.  This is creating 
the crisis in the health care system across the country.  It is 
the number one concern, and rightly so.  Why should it not be? 
The population is getting older and is looking down the road to 
see that health care will not be there when it will be needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government run by polls.  Everything it does is by 
polls.  Maybe it will wake up and address this issue.  I am sure 
it will.  Today's poll said that Canadians want the federal 
government to put more money into health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what happened when the industry minister tried to give 
money to professional hockey.  I am glad that Canadians spoke up 
about it.  That is what Canadians should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about health care for a moment.  There is a hue and 
cry about bill 11 in Alberta, saying that it is an attack on 
health care.  We listen to the grandiose statements of the 
Minister of Health.  He is a lawyer, after all, so he can use the 
flowery words he loves, but at the end of the day the point is 
that the government cut money for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has created a crisis for the provinces.  They are trying to 
address the needs of their constituents.  The federal government 
is saying that this is the money the provinces will get and that 
is about it.  There are millions of dollars sitting in Toronto 
which have not been used, but we are asking for long term 
solutions.  We are asking for stable funding on which the 
provinces can count so they can address their health care needs 
and not deal with the business of either a reduction in the 
budget or little more than crumbs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no stable funding for the provinces so they cannot 
address long term health care needs and issues.  When they come 
up with a solution we hear the government screaming.  I would 
like to state that it is very important for the government to 
address what the economy is demanding.  The budget has not 
addressed it.  We all know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance, with the proposal it is putting forward 
in the 17% solution, addresses many issues.  Why do we propose 
the 17% solution?  It is because we have heard from the 
grassroots.  We have heard from businesses.  We have heard from 
Canadians who have told us their priorities.  The 17% solution we 
are talking about is something Canadians want.  Hopefully when we 
form the next government that will be the solution.

positive.

Canada made in the granting councils, the Canadian Foundation for 
Innovation, the millennium scholarship and the 2,000 chairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did my colleague not talk about the elimination of the $42 
billion deficit left by the Conservatives, the very party that 
his wants to join in order to make it stronger?  Why did they not 
talk about the $58 billion tax reduction or the tax reductions 
for businesses?  Why did they not talk about the UN naming Canada 
seven times in a row as the best country in the world in which to 
live? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did they not talk about the low inflation rate, the low 
interest rate, the employment rates which are the highest in 
decades, and the first series of surpluses we have had in years? 
Why?  Can they not stand positive news?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at today's poll and ask the people who want health

health care budget.  I am sure those people will tell him why 
nobody is so excited about the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to reducing the deficit, that was done on the backs 
of Canadians and not on the government's back.  It did not come 
up with any innovative ideas.  Instead it has set us back.  It is 
just flying straight.  Nothing great has come out of this.  The 
budget deficit was killed on the backs of Canadians.  Ask them 
about their take home pay.  They have seen it go down and down. 
That is how the budget deficit was killed.  There is nothing to 
be very excited about there.  Let us listen to what Canadians are 
saying and address the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, 43% of our GDP is now in export.  Great, but it will 
not last very long if you do not address the issues.  Now you sit

will not last too long.

from the load that is placed upon them by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
stating that absolutely correctly.  Solution 17 addresses that 
point.  Let me just read what solution 17 is going to do for 
families.

increase the basic personal and spousal credit to $10,000.  It

EI rate to $2 from $2.40.  I see every member on the other side 
has disappeared.  I guess they do not like good news either.

has said is just one example of the waste of money that has been 
going on.  The government has the wrong priorities. 
We need officers on the street.  The auditor general has talked 
about tools not being available to the RCMP.  We are now taking 
the RCMP away from the job of keeping our streets safe and

it is an honour to have an opportunity to speak to Bill C-32, the 
budget implementation act, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians expect budget 2000 to be a highlight and a major 
departure from where Canada has been with regard to fiscal 
restraints in this country.  However, there has been a major 
oversight by the government regarding health, education and 
social transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years the provinces time and time again have been 
backfilling the many cutbacks and program reviews that the 
Liberal government has so steadily and efficiently deployed, all 
in the name of fiscal restraint, debt reduction.  Health care is 
a major social structure component of Canadian livelihood. 
Education in Canada is a major challenge for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a vast country.  Major changes have happened in our 
lifestyles, such as the role of families on family farms and the 
small remote communities in northern Canada.  People want jobs 
with higher incomes such as can be found in the high tech 
environment, but these may only exist in large urban centres. 
With the evolution and revolution of technology through the 
Internet and so on, these jobs could inevitably exist in remote 
communities.  One does not necessarily have to be a major stock 
market player in downtown Calgary.  This may eventually be done 
in Cumberland House.

restructuring Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students visit Parliament Hill from many different high schools 
from all corners of Canada.  This has been a major highlight for

communities in Canada.  We must provide them with the resources.

they take their rightful place in society.  They may be in this

place than in Canada.  We must keep from dismantling our social 
structures, things like medicare, health care and affordable 
drugs.  With regard to education, there is the high cost of 
student loans, deteriorating universities, infrastructures, and 
first nations education on which a report was released this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A previous government put on post-secondary caps, limits on 
first nations accessibility to post-secondary education.  What 
dreams do the high school students and the junior high school 
students have when they see that only a selected few will be able 
to continue their journey to higher education?  We need to 
motivate them and give them an opportunity to dream for a better 
future.  This requires strategic financial investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program reviews—I must applaud the government—are now 
history.  We must acknowledge that are no more cutbacks like the 
$104 million cutback in the national parks.  Not a cent of that 
cutback has yet been returned to the national parks system in the 
country.  None has been announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a major initiative for our young people when they 
graduate.  A program exists for them if they are uncertain where 
their careers are going or where their journey of education is 
going.  The program is called Katimavik.  It is a very worthwhile 
program for youth in the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, National 
Volunteer Week is an opportunity for all Canadians to pay 
tribute to the millions of volunteers who improve the lives of 
their fellow citizens every day.  The contribution they make 
helps our communities to remain strong and is important in 
maintaining the quality of life of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now actively working on developing a community program to 
provide direct assistance to all volunteer organizations.  Their 
needs remain great, and we must do more to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I will have the unanimous support of all political 
parties here in the House for my private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us thank all these volunteers from the bottom of our hearts. 
I take this opportunity to invite all parliamentarians to 
attend the opening reception of the Volunteer Canada exhibit 
tomorrow at 9.30, in Room 200 of the West Block.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Transport 
predicted the revival of passenger rail in Canada when he 
announced an additional $400 million in funding for VIA Rail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us look a little closer at the announcement.  The 
Liberals have to put the money into VIA.  After all, the 
government provided a billion dollar loan to the American 
passenger rail system Amtrak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says the loan will get commuters out of their cars 
and on to the train.  The only problem with this is that VIA Rail 
does not operate commuter rail.  The regional transit authorities 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says that privatization would not work.  Can he 
explain why the Rocky Mountaineer, a profitable private company 
that has never received a penny in government subsidy, would like 
to buy VIA Rail's transcontinental route? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the minister is correct in stating that trains helped 
build the country, we need to remind him that train travel has 
changed over the last 120 years.  It is too bad that the 
government's thinking has not.

organization in my riding that runs on volunteers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>West Hill Community Services was incorporated in 1977 by a 
caring and committed group of volunteers with a common goal:  to 
improve the quality of life for all persons within Scarborough 
East.  They did not choose to focus on any disadvantaged group, 
but rather to choose a holistic approach and encourage volunteers 
to help all social groups and all ages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today over 800 volunteers deliver 64,000 volunteer hours 
annually to the West Hill Community Services.  Churches, schools, 
Boy Scout and Girl Guide groups and service clubs facilitate 
drives that provide services for 9,000 families on an annual 
basis with food hampers and great toys for kids.  On an annual 
basis 1,800 meals, prepared by volunteers, are delivered to 
homebound people. Volunteers transport frail elderly—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this government has received a failing grade on its health care 
spending.  The finance department conducted a survey that found 
nearly 70% of all Canadians feel that not enough money was put 
into health care funding in the last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have pleaded with Ottawa to restore funding 
levels.  The federal government countered with a lame tax point 
strategy that is deliberately confusing and causing irreparable 
damage in federal-provincial co-operative relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government talks about solving the problems of 
health care but no plan has been put forth.  The provinces have 
programs in development.  The provinces have programs in effect. 
What they need now is a funding commitment which will allow them 
to proceed with assurances that health care funding will be 
stable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's actions have done little to assure Canadians 
that this is something they can count on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I ask hon. members to stay away from the 
word deliberately.  It always causes a reaction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To meet this need, the Canadian Bankers Association spearheaded 
the development of YourMoney Network, an integrated network of 
websites that contains neutral information for Canada's youth. 
This initiative was developed in a partnership among the Canadian 
Bankers Association, the Bank of Canada, the Royal Canadian Mint, 
the Investment Funds Institute of Canada, the Ontario Securities 
Commission and the Toronto Stock Exchange and was launched last 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of this year's Investor Education Week, the YourMoney 
Network is introducing a new online resource guide with over 800 
financial topic resources and five new partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an outstanding initiative of Canada's banking industry 
that will ensure Canada's youth are well prepared to make wise 
decisions about their own financial futures.

a non-profit organization whose main mission is to improve the 
quality of life of those with cancer, and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation has developed a comprehensive approach to the

families with information, support, documentation, and 
accommodation while they are receiving treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation has been in existence for 20 years now and has 
taken on a lead role in the battle against cancer, with decision

public statements and make its position known on any matter 
relating to the fight against cancer.  My greetings to the

$400 million to revitalize VIA Rail over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By offering a transportation option that is stable, safe and 
environmentally friendly, the enhanced passenger service will 
contribute to lessening highway congestion and greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, VIA has the largest rail maintenance shop in Canada, 
providing employment to more than 400 people in my riding of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is shocking that the Prime Minister would place the 
safety and security of Canadians at risk to cover up his own 
diplomatic foul-ups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's recent report makes it clear that the 
government is currently incapable of dealing with 15,000 refugees 
from Palestine without seriously compromising the safety and 
security of Canadians.   He says “We noted serious deficiencies 
in the way it applies admissibility criteria related to health, 
criminality and security”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current mismanagement of the immigration department 
virtually guarantees that serious criminals, terrorists and people 
with dangerous health conditions will continue to enter Canada. 
Decisions to help refugees must be based on the capability of the 
immigration department, firm recommendations from the United 
Nations and sound CSIS information, not on the whim of a bungling 
Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to help genuine refugees but they are tired of 
having their generosity abused by queue jumpers, by people 
smugglers and, now, by our very own Prime Minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, having 
committed a blunder in Jerusalem offending the Palestinians, our 
Prime Minister, ever eager for balance, was careful to commit 
one in Gaza, a second one, which, this time, offended the 
Israelis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject, the next day, of the lake of Tiberias where 
Christ walked on the waters, this tireless blunderer, tiptoeing 
on the eggs of an ultra sensitive matter, went in up to his 
neck, this time offending Syria before the dumbfounded gaze of 
international opinion, which did not really consider him capable 
of such a singular hat trick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the world waits with bated breath to see how Egypt will 
inspire our Prime Minister. 
Will he, like Moses, who descended Mount Sinai bearing the 
tablets with commandments, before a hundred journalists, descend 
the steps of his hotel brandishing a peace plan for the Middle 
East that will cause everyone distress?  Or, as is his wont, 
will he deliver his plan B in order to revive the conflict? 
Anything is possible with this man.  But one thing is sure.  He 
will oblige us to drink the cup of ridicule before world opinion 
to the lees.

irritating.  In two weeks, my riding will host the national

come home.  When he travels within Canada he does things like go 
to Alberta and tell Premier Klein that everything is okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that respect, I would like to ask a question of the Minister 
of Health.  Yesterday, in response to a question from my leader, 
he referenced his own letter to the Minister of Health of Alberta 
in relation to the whole NAFTA question, but he simply asked the 
minister of Alberta whether he had any strategies to deal with 
this potential problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the minister's government which signed NAFTA.  It is the

have for dealing with this possible problem? 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first, when the Prime Minister was in Calgary three weeks ago he 
made it very clear that the Alberta government, like all 
provincial governments, must respect the principles of the Canada 
Health Act or the Government of Canada will act accordingly.  He 
made that very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in relation to NAFTA, I did raise the concern in my 
correspondence with Minister Jonson.  Frankly, I did not get from 
Minister Jonson a satisfactory response.  We have been examining 
the implications of this bill under NAFTA.  Yesterday we received 
the opinion from Mr. Appleton, which is under study.  Together 
with the experts at justice and foreign affairs we are looking at 
those implications now.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He has the opinion from Mr. Appleton.  He now has a letter from 
a former premier of Saskatchewan, Allan Blakeney, on this matter. 
It is not something that can be left for a long time.  If the

is vulnerable to NAFTA, it will not be able to be undone.

that if he went into a bank and said “Would you lend me $400 
million?  I will tell you what I am going to use it for later”, 
he would be thrown out of the bank.  There are special rules on 
that side.  They identify money and explain it after. 
The standing committee said in recommendation 3 that the

a new twist on the misuse of the minister's grant money.  How 
about using grant money to buy a motorhome?  That is what someone 
did from the Strathroy Community Resource Centre, an organization 
that is supposed to be “a proactive support system for 
adolescents”.  We cannot find out how this motorhome generated 
jobs because our access request is past the legal due date.

months after we first heard of the scandalous situation at HRDC,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK219">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-32, an 
act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
parliament on February 28, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to reiterate what I said before question period.  I was 
highlighting some of the program reviews that have taken place in 
the country which brought us to budget 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When budget 2000 was released, there was no mention of national 
parks in it.  National parks have been a great part of our summer 
activities.  When students take their summer break, they and 
their families flock to our many national parks in the beautiful 
regions of our country.  The huge demands on our parks by our 
growing population and by international visitors have put a great 
burden on the ecological integrity of these parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Finance has any obligations toward seeing 
environmental integrity take place, he must review his financial 
and fiscal responsibilities in budget 2000.  There is nothing in 
the budget that mentions anything about improving the 
opportunities for the National Parks Agency to increase the 
resources for the management and wardens who care for these 
parks.  They require the human resources, seasonal resources, 
technical and capital resources to make the parks a better place 
to be and to protect them for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A part of our national parks heritage is to increase the 
allocation of our parks in this country.  We are going very 
slowly. 
There was an increase in designated parks in years past but 
nothing was mentioned in the budget for the year 2000.  There was 
nothing planned for increased park allocations.  There was 
nothing from the government.  I would like to highlight this as a 
major oversight by the finance minister this year.  We hope that 
he will announce as soon as possible some initiative toward our 
national parks and enhancing this issue in next year's budget.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to highlight the fact that national parks in 
Canada have been overlooked in this year's budget.  There has 
been zero increase in their budgets.  A greater demand on more 
user fees has been coming from the parks.  The revenue sources 
that are being created at our national parks are not necessarily 
a good thing for the ecological integrity of our parks.  The 
balance of restricting use and advertising for more use for the 
sake of further revenue is not necessarily a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another great oversight not only in this budget but in 
government policy is in respect of northern development.  The 
issue of northern development in Canada is of great interest. 
Many people will look at the north and see its vast natural 
resources.  The north has a sparse population.  It is the final 
frontier, as one opposition member mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just returned from Europe where I looked at how development 
has taken place there.  Two concepts come to mind which I would 
like to share with the House.  One of them deals with the issue 
of banking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows the banks of this country, CIBC, Royal Bank, Bank 
of Montreal, are all making great profits and doubling their 
profits every year.  That is the investment banking side.  But 
regional development banking is lacking in this country.  I am 
not just talking about business development for businesses in 
downtown Toronto, for example, or Halifax, Montreal or Vancouver. 
We need regional development banking so we can look at the 
economically deprived regions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at the north as a vast region where communities and 
populations have sustained a livelihood through many generations 
of sustainable development.  Sustainable development is the key. 
But now because of a lack of financial resources, capital 
finances that can be invested strategically to create jobs, to 
create investments, to create resource management that reflects 
the needs of communities, that is not happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me speak about investment banking.  If a forestry operation 
is to be developed in northern Canada, the investment banking 
would take place in Toronto or in some stock market in New York, 
Calgary or Vancouver.  The company would usually be southern 
based and in this case they would be looking at getting resources 
from the north and bringing them south for development and 
profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we call colonization.  Colonization is what brought 
these vast institutions here.  I am talking about the British, 
the French, the Spaniards and Portuguese who wanted more 
resources and further riches for their countries.  They came to 
Canada looking for new found land.  But now we are a country and 
as Canadians we have to protect our resources.  Let us hold on 
tight to our resources.  The resources in Canada and the world 
are dwindling.  If we hold on to our resources, their market 
value will increase.  We must treasure our resources not only for 
our immediate profit making, but to sustain them for future 
generations so they have a means of livelihood in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of northern development was very much overlooked 
in this budget, not only the developmental issue but also the 
infrastructure issue and the high cost of delivering services to 
the north. 
Most people take for granted having a litre of milk and, in most 
cases, two litres of milk.  In southern Saskatchewan one can 
easily buy a two litre carton of milk for $2.  In northern 
Canada, it costs $8 for a two-litre carton of milk, which is four 
times the price of milk in other parts of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a report about the sad situation of first nations 
education.  We cannot compare the education system in northern 
Canada to that of southern Canada.  There are school divisions 
within and around the city of Ottawa where schools have a 
population of between 500 and 1000 students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Villages in northern Canada with a population of 500 may have 20 
students in a high school.  The student-teacher ratio might 
diminish to 10:1.  There is a high cost to having one teacher 
teaching only 10 students but that is the reality of living in a 
small community.  Not everyone can be moved to an urban centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must continue to support rural and remote communities.  This 
is the reality of being Canadian.  We cannot pretend to be 
England or Germany, or small countries that are the size of the 
smallest provinces in this country.  We are a huge country.  We 
must think big but we must also think of what is fair for 
everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Housing development is another issue I have mentioned.  Our 
communities are in the middle of the boreal forest region and we 
lack housing.  Why can we not build log or timber frame homes 
that are community based instead of real estate or development 
based?   That is a challenge for the government.  We should have 
research projects that will foster the development of community 
housing and create family initiatives to keep housing viable.  We 
should not have a housing problem in the middle of a boreal 
forest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need research institutes to give us the best decisions on 
designing a house.  We do not have research institutes in the 
north dedicated to the livelihood, resource management or the 
economic viability of the north.  I challenge any of the research 
chairs that have been duly announced by this budget to 
consciously choose northern initiatives.  I doubt if they will 
even look at the issues, aside from the genetically altered 
subject on which we have spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biotechnology is a major initiative that the Department of 
Industry has been working on.  The moral and ethical issues 
dealing with biotechnology have to be addressed as well.  There 
has to be a balance between what the consumers need to know about 
genetically modified foods and the need to protect the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We mentioned the environmental aspects of the Kyoto protocol and 
keeping greenhouse gases in check with emission controls.  I am 
aware of no initiative by this government that tells Canadians 
what decisions we should be making on our automobiles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest initiative we saw was yesterday regarding VIA Rail. 
The government has finally woken up to the fact that trains are a 
viable option for this country.  We can travel from Halifax to 
Vancouver on a train, and by making an investment, maybe that 
train will be on time.  There are trains in Europe that go 300 
kilometres an hour and trains in Japan that are being tested at 
500 kilometres an hour.  I would rather be travelling on a train, 
seeing the beautiful landscapes of this country than flying above 
the clouds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a diminished opportunity to fly above the clouds 
right now because Air Canada is the only airline.  We have no 
alternatives. 
The schedules connecting western Canada with eastern Canada are 
being dismantled.  The schedules that were there before are not 
there today.  Flight schedules are being dismantled all for the 
sake and success of the lobbyists who have successfully told the 
government that one company cannot compete against another.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A train is probably the cheapest form of transporting freight in 
this country.  In the land-locked provinces, where there are no 
shores touching the Atlantic or the Pacific, we rely on trains to 
take our agricultural products to market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a young person I travelled on the highways of northern Canada 
and a train on a railroad track would have been a better 
alternative.  Rather than exercising the option of increasing our 
rail access to other places in Canada, we have been dismantling 
our railroad tracks, especially in western Canada.  Railroad 
tracks that existed fifty years ago have now disappeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must reinvest in and reconnect our communities with a 
railroad system and a transportation system that is reliable, not 
just an Internet and information highway system.  We need a real 
highway system to connect real people with real places and real 
people with other real people, not just virtual connections or a 
connection on a TV screen.  We must connect the French people 
with the English people, the Dene people with the Inuit and the 
Inuit with the Mi'kmaq.   All these people have get to know each 
other because we are all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, it is time we looked at restructuring our 
system of governance.  It is time to reinvest in education and in 
opportunities for our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is certainly a spark in the right direction to no 
more program reviews and no more cutbacks.  It is time to 
reinvest.  However, let us invest in the right way and let us 
invest with our hearts in the right place where it will be fair 
and equal for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, hundreds of millions of dollars will 
be poured into VIA Rail and a lot of that passenger service is in 
eastern Canada.  It was only a few years ago that the government 
withdrew all support for the grain transportation network on the 
prairies, known as the Crow rate.  Does the member feel that 
there is some political interference here in the rail 
transportation system in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is economically more important to the country, grain 
transportation on the prairies or serving the passengers who 
travel between Quebec City and Windsor?   I realize VIA crosses 
the country but that service is primarily in eastern Canada.  Is 
this fair?  Does this seem like a good economic decision, or were 
politics involved in this decision to spend hundreds of millions 
on VIA Rail and leave the farmers on the prairies to basically 
fend for themselves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>   Mr. Speaker, having great faith in 
our political system, of course it was politics.  This whole 
place is built on politics.  A majority of the members are from 
the Ontario region.  We have a party reflective of the west. Then 
we have a whole governance structure and bureaucratic structure 
that seems to want to dismantle the whole issue of a 
connectedness with the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers have had opportunities to reflect on the political 
wills.  Governments have changed time and time again and the 
whole issue of the farm family has been diminished. The complex 
area of grain transportation, the technical changes, the 
international trade in farming and the whole issue of the future 
of farms should be documented once and for all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My solution would be to set up a royal commission on the family 
farm, which would take the politics right out of it.  The 
commission would look at the family farm and document it once and 
for all so that the next generation who will be able to make wise 
investment decisions for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politics is politics.  Maybe the VIA Rail decision is right.  It 
may be one example of a good investment the government is making 
with its newfound surpluses.  Maybe something will come for grain 
transportation in the future but that is a big hope.  Hopefully 
we can work together to make that possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers need help in grain transportation but young farmers need 
direction.  They need to know what kinds of decisions they will 
have to make.  Maybe a royal commission could wrap it all up in 
one big package for them to really look at and study. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member talked quite a bit about 
national parks and the national parks scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very clear in the past that our national parks were 
designed for people and families to have general access. However, 
the mandate for the parks has changed and many of the practices 
have changed so that now our national parks system is much less 
available to the general public and families.  At times some of 
the existing available parks have implemented a user fee 
schedule, to which the member made reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My analysis of those parks, which have put in a user fee 
schedule, is that the national budget is still the same as what 
it was before the implementation of user fees.  There is a lot 
more spending going on but no more facilities really present. The 
user fee schedule has not really given the general taxpayer 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member could comment on those two things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also talked about rural infrastructure.  We are very 
concerned about what is happening in our rural communities. On 
things like the universality and availability of health care, if 
individuals cannot get to where health care is available it is 
hardly universal.  If the member would like to comment on that as 
well it would be most welcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be more than 
happy to highlight some of the political aspirations of certain 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not so long ago I knew a party called the Reform Party which 
leaned a bit to the right.  Some of its aspirations were cost 
recovery.  A major right wing agenda is to look at cost recovery 
in health and for-profit health care.  Cost recovery in national 
parks is a reality.  It is a dream come true for a right wing 
government.  Unfortunately we have a Liberal government that 
seems to be listening to this right wing rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to consider the social conscience of the country.  We 
have to consider the needs of our communities, our single parents 
and our students who cannot afford to use the parks, as the 
member said.  We do have to raise these issues but we have to 
make it a Canadian initiative.  We cannot talk from both sides of 
our mouth.  If we care about our young people we have to invest 
our tax dollars in areas that will help them.   We cannot talk 
about tax cuts and then diminish our services and programs.  I am 
talking about program and service enhancement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice that the hon. member has raised this issue.  Maybe we 
can get the government's assurance that it will keep the program 
and services enhancement, especially in budgets to come. 
As I said there has been a swing away from cutbacks and more 
expending surpluses into the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In some areas the infrastructure development is very unfair.  I 
tried to drive to Ottawa on the Trans Canada Highway.  It is a 
minefield coming here through northern Ontario.   It is a single 
lane highway that barely has any shoulders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an intercontinental highway system just to the south of 
us.  Maybe that should be looked at in terms of infrastructure 
development and job creation.  There are highways needed in 
western Canada.  Grain trucks have been pounding our highways 
because grain is no longer being hauled by train. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the sad facts and sad results.  We have to look at 
investments, which I call regional development investments. If 
the infrastructure program is a possible avenue to make this 
happen, I would very much welcome it, but it was not evident in 
the finance minister's release.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I think we could agree with a number of the items the 
member mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area which he did not talk about in his presentation was 
regarding the government's talk about showing this huge surplus 
at the same time that there is a $580 billion debt with a $43 
billion interest payment on it every year.  One of the big 
concerns I had certainly before coming to this place in 1993 was 
the fact that no government seemed to be dealing with that.  I 
was rather shocked that the present budget did not deal with that 
item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With $14.5 billion for health care and $43 billion for interest 
payments, does the hon. member not think that by dealing with 
that debt we could in fact help our social programs which all of 
us are concerned about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I suppose we have to 
have a balanced approach.  Certainly our party has taken the 
approach of looking at the deficit, the debt and program and 
service enhancement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By creating more wage earners through the opportunities that we 
talked about, investment into infrastructure development, instead 
of recipients of social services, we would see an increase in 
national revenues. We would see a better economic cycle within 
the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People talk about the fear of globalization.  The hon. member 
should live in northern Canada and see the remnants of what our 
globalization was.  The Hudson's Bay Company and its stores still 
monopolize our groceries after it tapped the sceptre here and 
said “This is now Rupert's Land and part of England”.  We still 
live over there, yet we live here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  That is not true.  The North West 
Company runs all that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  The North West Company and the 
Hudson's Bay Company, under the same guise, under the same name, 
still have the same colonizing effect today.  Colonization and 
globalization are in a similar realm.  Let us invest in our 
people and the people will get us out of our troubles.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is certainly my pleasure to speak in the debate on the budget 
that was set down on February 28, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people looked forward to that budget.  They thought we 
would get a millennium surprise, that we would get a forward 
looking 21st century type of budget.  Instead, I think we got a 
shell game where money was transferred from one place to another 
place to another place.  A lot of people, not able to follow the 
movement, said at least it was better than what we have had 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about some of the failures of that budget. Mr. 
Speaker, I know you are most interested in pinpointing those 
because obviously within your caucus you would have been told all 
of the good points.  Let me try to highlight some of the less 
than good points in the budget.  I know you are looking forward 
to this and will take accurate notes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First there is the total failure to even recognize the fact that 
we have a debt.  There is talk of this great surplus and what 
will be done with the money, how the government can create more 
programs. There is program spending. Certainly Liberals love 
program spending.  They have always loved to create programs 
because programs lead to bureaucracy.  Bureaucracy leads to 
boondoggles. Boondoggles lead to ways to patronize friends.  It 
is a wonderful scene, except for the taxpayer and all those 
people who are deprived of that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about that debt?  What about that $588 billion?  Let us go 
back and see where that came from.  In 1969 we had no debt.  By 
1972 we had $18 billion in debt.  As we went along through the 
spending years we ended up coming to about $160 billion in debt 
by 1983-84.  At that point everybody said we must stop the growth 
of that debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new party came into power and said it was going to stop it and 
it would not let it grow any more.  Of course we know that by 
1987 we had a debt somewhere in the neighbourhood of just under 
$300 billion. At that point of course a new party, the forerunner 
to the Canadian Alliance, was born as a response to that huge 
debt.  But that same government carried on.  By the time it 
finished, the debt was $490 billion with a deficit of some $42 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then we now have a debt of roughly $580 billion.  We have 
an interest payment of about $43 billion, depending on how the 
economy goes and so on.  Let us look at where that places us.  We 
spend somewhere around $12 billion on education, $14 billion on 
health care and $22 billion on pensions.  There is Indian affairs 
at $7 billion and defence at $9 billion.  The critical thing in 
these numbers is the fact that we have $43 billion in interest 
payments.  That is what we are passing on to future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the budget deal with that?  It says that as long as 
everything is going fine, we may be able to put $3 billion on 
that debt.  Let us figure out the mathematics of that one.  If 
there is $580 billion and we add $3 billion a year while paying 
$43 billion a year in interest, then we are not getting ahead.  A 
home could not be run that way.  A business could not be run that 
way.  A farm could not be run that way.  They would be bankrupt. 
They would be taken over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously it is a great disappointment for Canadian taxpayers. 
Future citizens and taxpayers, our children, our grandchildren 
and our great-grandchildren are going to be burdened by that 
debt.  This budget did not even address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could put one's head in the sand and not recognize that as a 
serious problem for our country.  That is why some economists are 
predicting that within 50 years this country will have a standard 
of living at 50% that of the Americans.  Right now the quality of 
life, the standard of living is somewhere around 70% that of the 
Americans.  Is that acceptable?  Is that what we want to leave 
for our children and our grandchildren?  I do not and I think I 
can speak for my colleagues in saying that they do not either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the first failure, Mr. Speaker.  I know you are looking 
forward to hearing some more so I will satisfy your curiosity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the business community and employment benefits 
and the shell game that is played. The government trumpets the 
fact that it has been able to cut EI premiums and that has saved 
business and individual workers a great amount of money. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT69"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT69"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1540

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 38% of people can actually be eligible for employment 
insurance but we do not talk about that figure.  We also do not 
talk about the fact that for the last five years and into the 
next couple of years, CPP increases totally wipe out the EI 
premium decreases.  There is a net loss to individuals and 
businesses.  That means that small businesses, and remember that 
is most businesses in Canada, are going to employ fewer people, 
are going to have more overhead costs and are going to have a 
greater chance of failure.  This may not affect the big guys but 
it sure does affect the 90% of Canadian small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the 11% increase in HRDC grants?  I know it is in the 
right phase of the cycle to be increasing because if we look at 
HRDC grants and contributions, they go with elections.  The year 
after an election they are at their lowest point.  As we get 
closer to an election, grants and contributions increase. One 
could say it is natural that in the 2000 budget there would be an 
11% increase in grants.  What about those grants?  We have heard 
much in the House about the boondoggles.  Where it gets right 
down to the nitty-gritty would be something I experienced last 
Sunday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A band in my community is leaving this coming Sunday for 
Australia.  It is going to be accompanied by a number of teachers 
and parents. This band is doing a cultural exchange and wanted to 
leave something in Australia that was a celebration of the 
millennium from the town of Innisfail in Canada to the town of 
Innisfail in Australia where it would be spending three weeks. 
The cost was under $1,000 for a plaque.  The government chose to 
say in a letter to the band that this was not a very good 
millennium project, that it does not really help Canadians to be 
good Canadians, to be proud Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I wished them well at the band concert on Sunday, I felt 
sorry for the government for the letter that was read to the 
parents and the students.  Many people said to me after, “What 
about the $250,000 for a fountain in the river?  How about the 
canoe museum?  How about the armouries with a good view of the 
fountain?”  They asked about the $7 million spent on golf 
courses and sock factories.  They asked how it was possible to be 
ineligible for any funding for a project that was truly, I 
believe, a millennium project. The only answer I had was that 
perhaps they had voted the wrong way. That is a sorry commentary 
in a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another example in my riding and I should have brought 
the letter to read but I can paraphrase it. The letter was from 
the Deputy Prime Minister.  The Alberta Sports Hall of Fame is 
celebrating 100 years of sports in the province of Alberta, 
Canada.  It wanted to do a special display for all Albertans who 
had been on Olympic teams representing their country over the 
last 100 years.  If that is not a millennium project, then I do 
not know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter from the Deputy Prime Minister indicated that this 
project did not qualify because it was asking for 100% funding. 
The community raised $3 million to build the building which is 
finished and opens next month.  The cost of the celebration of 
the Alberta athletes who were in the Olympics for Canada was 
going to be $750,000 of which $500,000 has been raised.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were asking for funding from the Government of Canada for a 
millennium project to celebrate 100 years of Canadian athletes 
coming from Alberta on Olympic teams.  The answer from the 
government was that it did not fund projects 100%, so it denied 
their request for the millennium project.  There was $3 million 
raised in the community of which $500,000 was for that particular 
project.  That is not 100% funding coming from the federal 
government.  That is the kind of stuff that happens with these 
grants.  We have to be from the right place and not a safe seat 
or something like that in order to get that.  People in my 
community do not find that very appealing and are not pleased 
with the budget raising the grants by 11%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about health care.  How did this budget deal with 
health care?  It gave $2.5 billion over four years for the 
subject that all Canadians are concerned about.  Seventy-five per 
cent of Canadians polled say that they are worried about their 
health care.  A poll done by the department which was released 
yesterday said that 70% of Canadians felt this budget did not 
give enough money to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it has returned all the money.  How does it 
figure that?  It is difficult to explain but let me attempt to. 
It says that there are tax credits that make up half of its 
donation to the provinces.  Where did that come from?  In 1977 
the provinces and the federal government agreed on these tax 
point transfers.  Immediately upon doing that, the federal 
government raised its taxes.  The provinces were to have room to 
raise their taxes.   But they could not do it because the federal 
government had already filled the space for that tax.  They would 
have had to raise taxes and take the blame for raising them for 
health care.  The tax credit is really a figment of the 
government's mind.  The money is really not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about actual transfers of cash.  What has the 
government done with that?  In 1993 the cash transfers were $18.8 
billion for health care.  In 1994 they were $18.7 billion.  In 
1995 they were $18.4 billion.  In 1996 there were $14.8 billion. 
In 1997 they were $12.5 billion.  In 1998 they were $12.5 
billion.  In 1999 they were $14.5 billion.  Guess what?  Over the 
the next four years they will be $15.5 billion.  Remember, they 
were $18.5 billion in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened in between besides inflation?  There has been 
improvement in technology.  Increased costs in our health care 
system and medication have gone up by 17% per year.  These have 
not been accounted for in the cash transfers to the provinces. 
Why does the health care system have a real crunch right now? 
Because of the lack of funding.  Who is to blame?  It is not just 
the provinces.  The federal government can be blamed for it as 
much as the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not have a vision for health care in the 
21st century.  We have a 1960s state run socialized health care 
system that would compare to North Korea and Cuba.  We do not 
have a health care system that would compare to any of the 
industrialized countries.  We are rated 23rd out of 29 in terms 
of health care in the industrialized world.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in fifth place in spending on health care.  We have fifth 
place spending with 23rd place ranking in our health care 
delivery.  There is certainly something wrong there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should state that we are opposed to two tier, U.S. style, 
for-profit health care.  I am sorry that the hon. member who 
alluded to that earlier has left the Chamber.  We are opposed to 
that.  We can clearly state that we do not believe in that.  That 
is not what Canadians want.  Canadians would like to be in the 
top third of OECD countries in the delivery of health care.  That 
is what they would like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget did not deliver that.  Last year it was $11 billion 
over five years.  This year it was $2.5 billion over four years. 
That is after taking out $26 billion.  That is just not good 
enough.  The responsibility stops right here and it stops with 
this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other fact concerning health care that we should be 
emphasizing is co-operation with the provinces.  We need to 
co-operate with them to solve a problem that is a Canadian 
problem.  The people in my constituency and in the Ontario 
constituencies I have visited are not interested in who does it, 
what is happening, or all of these facts and figures.  They want 
to have a better health care system.  They do not particularly 
care whether it is federal, provincial or whatever.  They just 
know that there is something wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go through all the problems, but I do not believe we 
need to do that.  I think we can simply say that we must fix that 
system.  How do we do it?  We have to do it by co-operation with 
the provinces.  What do we do to the provinces?  We have our 
drive-by smear that occurs.  We have the taunting and the 
constant attacks on the Government of Ontario.  We have Mr. 
Romanow and even Mr. Tobin asking for things and the government 
treats them the same.  One cannot even say it selects the people 
it picks on.  This government bullies the provinces.  It does not 
worry about co-operating with the provinces and, of course, that 
is why the health care system of this country continues to 
deteriorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want that fixed and they expected that in the budget. 
Certainly our health minister was the big loser at the budget 
table this year when one considers that grants and boondoggles 
got as much money as health care.  That is a disgrace, Mr. 
Speaker, just as not touching that debt is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about taxes?  There was tampering with the tax system 
again, but it was not adequate and not what people really needed. 
We need to have a level playing field if we are going to compete. 
We have 85% of our trade with the U.S.  We need a level playing 
field and that certainly has to be in the area of taxation.  It 
was disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to agriculture, what did we do for our farmers?  We 
did nothing.  We showed no interest in agriculture whatsoever in 
this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in terms of Canadian influence around the world, the 
international perspective of the government, our position in the 
world, was probably at its peak in 1945.   Mr. Pearson did a lot 
to maintain that, but where have we gone since then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed to say that in all the travelling I have done, 
I have seen a decline. I have seen our peacekeepers, great men 
and women, working hard in counties with 40 year old equipment. 
You have seen them, too, Mr. Speaker.  What are we doing to our 
NATO and NORAD partners? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not happy with this budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the arguments of 
the hon. member for Red Deer.  The alliance party has had a 
number of different names, but I think we could safely call it 
the party of hypocrisy.  I do not know if it is a movement or a 
party.  Someone suggested it is a movement, but I think it is a 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many different flaws in the hon. member's argument.  I 
would like to focus on just a couple of them, if I may, Mr. 
Speaker. 
First, I find it very hypocritical when the member stands up in 
the House and talks about the debt whereas in fact their 
proposition when they ran with their platform would have meant 
that the government would have been out of deficit two years 
later than what this government did, which would have meant of 
course that the debt would have increased even more quickly.  I 
find it quite irrational for this member to get up in the House 
and make those comments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians must be confused with this issue about tax points. 
Let me explain if I might for the member opposite how it works. 
In 1977 the federal government vacated 13.5 percentage points of 
its personal income tax and 1 percentage point of its corporate 
income tax.  In other words the government said “We are not 
going to charge citizens and corporate Canada as much federal 
income tax, so we invite you, the provinces, to move into that 
area.  You charge citizens and corporations more tax”.  Do you 
know what, Mr. Speaker?  That is exactly what they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument that the federal government later increased taxes 
and the provinces did this and the provinces did that is totally 
irrelevant.  When the federal government vacated that tax room, 
the provinces immediately filled it.  Since 1977 the world has 
changed.  There have been a lot of things happening up and down, 
back and forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member talks about expenditures, the level of 
expenditure for direct program delivery of the federal government 
is down $4 billion from 1993 while at the same time our transfers 
to the provinces have been totally restored.  Surely that says 
something about the priorities of this government.  Our direct 
program expenditure is down $4 billion and the transfers to 
provinces have been completely restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I find the member's arguments spurious in the least. 
The members talks about the grants and contributions going up in 
this budget.  I am wondering if he understands the fact that the 
grants and contributions in the year 2000 budget are composed of 
$900 million to the Canada Foundation for Innovation so that 
Canadians can be more innovative and have a more innovative 
economy.  It also includes the research chairs to establish us as 
a pre-eminent research nation with our universities, our students 
and our professors.  Those are just two.  I could go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member could clarify his understanding of the 
debt and tax points because clearly he was muddled when he first 
started out.  I wonder with these comments if perhaps he has 
absorbed that and he could rethink what he proposed before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is just amazing after one 
has been here for a while to see someone with their head in the 
sand.  Someone who believes his own propaganda is even more 
amazing.  The member does not even have a questioning mind for 
some of that information and obviously cannot even get the name 
of our party correct.  That has to be another slur on that 
member's mental ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal propaganda says yes, in 1977 they transferred the 
tax room.  Then they immediately started to raise taxes and by 
1986 all of that tax room was used up by the federal government. 
From then on there is not a dollar left in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the government continues to say that of the $81 
billion that is spent on health care in this country, provincial 
and federal, it transfers $14.5 billion this year, that is not 
33% as it claims.  It would have been in 1977 but if it goes that 
far back in terms of its propaganda, it obviously needs some 
research assistance as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is $4 billion less in spending.  Is that not something 
when $43 billion is spent on interest payments?  Is that not 
something to stand up in the House and crow about, that the 
government has actually cut spending by $4 billion when it is 
paying $43 billion in interest, getting nothing, no services for 
it and the government is proud of that?

</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the research grants which were mentioned, we are in 
the bottom third of OECD countries when it comes to technology 
and health care.  That is nothing to stand and brag about.  We 
are losing half our graduate doctors.  Of the 16 universities 
training doctors, the number of specialist courses has been cut 
on a yearly basis.  That is something to talk about.  Funding 
should be returned to those programs so that we can fix our 
health care system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member indicated that Canada pension plan premiums were going 
up and would offset some of the amounts that were decreased with 
regard to EI premiums and taxes.  He is quite right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member agree that historically we have had five 
workers for every one pensioner and that current pensioners are 
getting about $8 for every $1 they put in?  Forward planning and 
the actuarial numbers show that there will only be three workers 
for every one pensioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree that it was necessary for the premiums to go up 
to sustain the plan?  Those premiums do not go into the 
government general revenue but are over on the side.  Would the 
member agree that the role played by the federal and provincial 
governments to sustain the Canada pension plan for all Canadians 
was the right thing to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that they were not in favour of a two tier 
health care system.   He was emphatic, very emphatic.  He is 
nodding his head.  This is something they could not possibly 
tolerate, at all.  He is still nodding his head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that fact, could the member for Red Deer explain to the 
House and to all Canadians why they have not drummed the member 
for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca out of their party?  He is currently 
running for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance on a platform 
of establishing a two tier health care system, one for the rich 
and one for everybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first I will deal with the 
CPP.  That plan is flawed.  It was first introduced in 1966.  Two 
years later the people who built the plan said that it would not 
work.  From there on, governments ignored that advice and 
continued to build up the debt and the liability on that plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we fix that plan?  We would have to charge, as most 
actuaries say, somewhere around 15% to fix it.  If we start 
charging 15%, obviously young workers will be on the picket 
lines.  What can we do about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did an interesting project.  I went to Santiago, Chile, which 
has had a program for 26 years.  I went door to door.  I went to 
the poor communities.  I went to the middle class communities.  I 
went to the wealthy communities.  I asked them to tell me about 
their plan.  They came out their doors with a card showing the 
pension plan they invested in, plan A, plan B, and plan C.  It is 
government run.  It is compulsory.  It is 10%.  It is there. They 
can watch it.  They buy their groceries at the stores in which 
they have shares.  They buy their cars from companies in which 
they have shares.  They are proud of it.  It is sustainable.  The 
money is there in the country to invest.  They do not have any 
foreign debt because of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  You said scrap it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  The member will not try anything new.  He 
is not prepared to try anything new.  Some members across have 
their heads in the sand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point is that we are not Liberals.  We are the 
Canadian Alliance Party.  We believe in democracy.  If somebody 
running for the leadership wants to talk about something, he or 
she has a right to do it.  We do not throw people out like the 
party on the other side.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to enter the debate on the budget 
implementation act.  I commend my colleague from Red Deer on his 
response to that ridiculous question from the Liberal member 
opposite.  He pointed out that the Canada pension plan is flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons I got involved in politics was that I 
resented the Liberal way of mortgaging the present on the future, 
making future generations pay for its excesses in the present. 
That is irresponsible and morally corrupt.  On behalf of my 
children and all other children in Canada, I got involved in 
politics so that we could stop that type of destructive, 
irresponsible behaviour by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three parts of the budget implementation act I would 
like to specifically address.  One is the portion of the act that 
amends the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act to 
implement a $2.5 billion increase in the Canada health and social 
transfer over four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that transfers from the federal 
government to the provinces were $18.5 billion per year when the 
Liberals came to power in 1993.  They were reduced to $11.5 
billion and now they have been increased to somewhere in the 
neighbourhood of $14 billion, still about $4.5 billion a year 
short of the funding that was in place six and a half years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worthwhile to note that if we add up the cost to the 
health care system over the years of Liberal government there has 
actually been a shortfall or deficiency of $25 billion compared 
to the funding levels we had in 1993.  That does not even account 
for inflation or population growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care has been terribly underfunded by the government in 
favour of spending the money on wasteful government programs and 
not in favour of tax cuts.  The billion dollar boondoggle in the 
human resources department, the misappropriation or misallocation 
of grant money, is a good illustration of irresponsible behaviour 
and skewed priorities where the Liberals refuse to fund social 
programs that Canadians care about, such as our health care 
system, in favour of handing money to their political friends. 
That is tax money, I might add, paid by hard working Canadian 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to address the amendment to the Excise Tax Act 
to allow the Minister of National Revenue to obtain judicial 
authorization to immediately assess and take action to collect 
from a person GST-HST deemed remittable by the minister.  Suffice 
to say, I am opposed to that because it broadens the already 
coercive tax power of the government by granting even further 
powers to the Minister of National Revenue.  When the Canadian 
Alliance forms the government we will be looking at measures to 
protect taxpayers and at having fairer methods of assessment and 
collection instead of a heavy handed, uncaring and unfeeling 
Liberal minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Income Tax Act will be amended as of January 1 of this year 
to reinstate full indexation of the tax code.   That is a move we 
have been urging the government to take ever since it took power 
in 1993 because of the insidious, sneaky way our taxes were going 
up year by year as a result of bracket creep.  Tax brackets and 
personal deductions were not indexed to inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government has finally corrected this and finally 
listened to us after six years, it did not do so in any 
retroactive fashion.  In order to reintroduce indexation it 
should have calculated the loss to taxpayers over the years by 
the fact that there was no indexation and then implement 
provisions whereby taxpayers would be able to receive the benefit 
of that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous parts of the budget which I want to address, 
but in consideration of some of the debate which took place 
earlier in the day I will start by covering a brief history to 
where we are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring in particular to a speech made by a Progressive 
Conservative member.  It might have been the House leader.  He 
was trying to justify the massive increase in our national debt 
that occurred during the Mulroney government, the nine year reign 
of error by the Conservatives.  He was addressing the deficit 
which grew to enormous levels under their leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Conservatives came to power in 1984 the national debt 
stood somewhere around the $200 billion mark.  It was increasing 
as a result of deficit budgets by the previous Liberal 
government.  The Tories at that time were in a unique position to 
reverse that trend and bring responsible fiscal management to 
government.  They could have eliminated the deficit very quickly 
and very easily and began paying down the $200 billion debt. 
Instead, they embarked on the largest expansion of government in 
the history of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over a nine year period they increased taxes 71 times, but 
government spending far outpaced their tax increases to the point 
that annual deficits, by the time they left power nine years 
later, were over $40 billion a year.  They added $300 billion to 
our national debt, more than doubling it.  The fact that party is 
now on the brink of elimination is fitting, considering the 
fiscal mess it left our country in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I will discuss the legislative agenda of the 
Liberal government.  The budget implementation act is full of 
flaws which we are illustrating for the benefit of the House.  I 
want to put that in the context of the legislative agenda of the 
government.  Not only is the budget deficient in many ways, but 
instead of addressing the areas of concern the government is on a 
very hollow agenda which lacks vision and is irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to the fact that two days ago we debated in the 
House an act to extend marital benefits to gay couples.  We have 
a $600 billion national debt.  We have unreasonable levels of 
taxation.  Yet the government is preoccupied with redefining 
marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have pressured the government for the last six years to 
reform the Young Offenders Act, to introduce a victims bill of 
rights into our criminal justice system and to address the 
problems in our prisons and the problems with parole.  Many 
reforms are needed to the justice system and there was no 
response from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another illustration of its lack of vision and lack of 
responsibility is the child pornography issue.  The government 
refuses to act.  Last June the official opposition put forward a 
supply day motion on that topic urging the government to 
intervene, invoke the notwithstanding clause and enforce the law 
which made child pornography illegal, but it refused to do so.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The HRDC billion dollar boondoggle is very telling.  We have a 
taxation system that is in dire need of repair and reform.  The 
government in the budget has increased funding to HRDC.  We are 
going to see more grants, more patronage, more suspicious payoffs 
and transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will illustrate a few examples.  It is my understanding that 
the president of the Liberal constituency association in the 
riding of the minister of Indian affairs received a grant of 
about $150,000, which actually exceeded the legal limit of grants 
under the program from which he received it.  Not only was there 
a patronage payoff for his political activity on behalf of the 
Liberal Party, but under the grant program that it used to 
administer the patronage payoff the law was even broken with 
respect to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
With due respect, I believe that an allegation of some payoff in 
any form attributed to a minister is an inappropriate allegation 
for this place and perhaps you could rule it not parliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair is more concerned that the 
hon. member concluded by saying that it appeared that the law had 
been broken.  I am sure that he would not want to suggest that 
any member of the House had broken the law, unless he chooses to 
take the appropriate steps, which of course have serious 
consequences.  I know he would not want to say that and I hope he 
would retract those words and continue with his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify 
that.  What I was referring to was the fact that the guidelines 
for that grant program were not adhered to.  That is what I 
meant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather ironic that the member for Mississauga South would 
raise this point of order with you, Mr. Speaker, given the fact 
that he is remarkably silent when it comes to advocating and 
demonstrating any support for families, despite the fact that he 
pretends to be an advocate of family values.  However, when the 
measure of that is put to the test, he fails repeatedly.  I am 
referring to the fact that he continues to support the Liberal 
agenda, the anti-family agenda of overtaxing families, of unfair 
taxation, of refusing to defend the definition of marriage, and 
the list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area of concern has to do with employment insurance 
premiums. They are about 18% in excess of the break-even point of 
the EI fund.  The government is taking this excess money, which 
is in the neighbourhood of $7 billion a year, diverting it to the 
consolidated revenue fund and spending it on HRDC grants and 
other scandalous programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very offensive to hard-working Canadians who pay these 
employment insurance premiums for the purpose of receiving 
benefits if they become unemployed.  The government is violating 
the intent and the spirit of the employment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally important, I would like to point to an issue that really 
needs to be addressed.  Not only is the overpayment unfair in 
that respect, but municipalities are public employers and, as 
such, municipalities across Canada pay EI premiums, as well as 
their workers.  All of that money comes from property taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of property taxes is supposed to be to provide 
services to properties and projects in the local municipalities. 
However, by virtue of the fact that there is an overpayment of EI 
premiums, in effect what is happening is that the property taxes 
being paid to local municipalities to provide services to those 
communities are being funnelled into the consolidated revenue 
fund of the federal government.  Property taxes are ending up 
being spent to support aerospace companies in Montreal, instead 
of the communities for which they were intended and where they 
belong.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a good illustration of why the EI overpayment is unfair. 
It is an excessive tax on workers and employers.  When the 
Canadian Alliance forms the government we will immediately lower 
EI premiums to the break-even point and stop that unfair taxation 
on property owners and hard-working Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is spending hundreds of millions of 
dollars on gun registration.  That has to be the absolute height 
of stupidity, making law-abiding, responsible firearms owners 
register their firearms.  What possible benefit do taxpayers get 
for this massive expenditure of money?  Need I remind the 
government that criminals do not register their guns?  Whether a 
gun is registered will not determine whether it was used in a 
crime.  In fact, it places responsible firearms owners at the 
risk of potentially being implicated if their firearms are stolen 
and used in the perpetration of a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relevance of this is that taxpayers are being forced to 
shell out very sizeable amounts of money.  I think that at last 
count the cost of the gun registration program was over $300 
million, but I stand to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It was $316 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  It was $316 million, and it is projected 
to exceed $1 billion.  Just imagine the benefits taxpayers could 
reap if that money was left in their own pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very insulting for hard-working Canadian families to pay 
such high levels of tax and then to see that type of waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a riding in Saskatchewan.  Last Friday the Prime 
Minister appointed a person from Saskatchewan to the Senate 
because there was a Senate vacancy.  The Senate is another 
example of waste and patronage.  I have been advocating an 
elected Senate for several years, as has our party since its 
beginning.  The Prime Minister also appointed someone from 
Alberta that same day.  I would like to point out to the House 
that not only is the Senate in its current form useless and a 
waste of money, but when the Prime Minister appoints senators— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I hesitate to interrupt the hon. 
member, but I know that he has read the rules of the House 
repeatedly and he knows that it is wrong to speak disrespectfully 
of the other place.  I would ask him to be very careful in his 
choice of adjectives.  “Unelected”, of course, is fair game, 
but I think he wants to be careful about the words he just used 
that might have been disrespectful of the other place.  I know he 
would not want to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  In fact, we 
could have great respect for the Senate if it was elected and if 
we had an equal number of senators from each province, which 
would balance the problems we have in the country. 
Representation by population with regional concerns could very 
effectively be addressed and balanced by having an efficiently 
functioning Senate, with equal numbers from each province elected 
and, therefore, democratically chosen by the people, as opposed 
to being appointed, which only adds to that feeling of western 
alienation when an Ottawa-based Prime Minister appoints someone 
to represent us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the people of Alberta feel the same way.  They have a 
senatorial election act and they have elected two senators in 
waiting.  They are asking the Prime Minister to respect their 
democratically chosen people, but the Prime Minister continues to 
excite western alienation feelings by ignoring the expressed will 
of the Alberta people and appointing his own people to the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been urging the Premier of Saskatchewan to enact a 
similar act so that we could elect our senators.  We could have 
senators elect, or senators in waiting, so that the next time 
there is a vacancy we could plead with the Prime Minister to 
appoint our choice for Senate representation.  I hope that the 
Premier of Saskatchewan will eventually come around to my way of 
thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that there is an agriculture crisis on 
the prairies.  It is a very severe situation, due to factors for 
which the government is responsible, such as an inefficient grain 
transportation system.  The Canadian Wheat Board is an Ottawa 
controlled marketing system for our grain in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal priorities are skewed.  Instead of lowering taxes for 
farmers and helping them through this crisis, instead of 
reforming our grain marketing and transportation systems and 
bringing forward responsible legislation, the government brought 
forward this budget which will continue to gouge Canadians, 
making us continue to pay excessive levels of taxation, and our 
money will be wasted. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think the House, and probably all Canadians, would take note that 
the member was admonished at least twice during his speech for 
inappropriate, unparliamentary remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, there were many others, but I took personal offence to 
his comment about me and my commitment to the family, to 
children, and to the institution of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I became a member of parliament I made a commitment as a 
private member to do some things which I felt very strongly 
about.  I would like to list a few for the member's edification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first bill I introduced was Bill C-237, which had to do with 
income splitting between spouses, so that one spouse could stay 
at home to care for pre-school children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I introduced the conversion of the child care expense 
deduction to a credit so that there would be fairness and equity 
in terms of the tax benefit to the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I became a member of parliament I have written five books. 
I wrote a book called <I>Divorce:  The Bold Facts</I>.  I wrote a 
book called <I>Strong Families Make a Strong Country</I>.  I 
wrote a book called <I>Tragic Tolerance of Domestic Violence</I>. 
I wrote a book called <I>The Child Poverty Solution</I>.  I have 
just issued, last month, a book called <I>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: 
The Real Brain Drain</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member would like to see those, he could look them up on 
my website.  They are all available on paulszabo.com. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member wants to know about my commitment to the 
definition of marriage as being the lawful union of one man and 
one woman to the exclusion of all others, he should check the 
transcript of the justice committee when the amendment from the 
justice minister came forward.  He would see that there was one 
person who spoke up to make sure that the motion was relevant and 
acceptable to the chair of the committee.  That person was me.  I 
spoke on behalf of the government to make sure that the motion 
was there and that the definition of marriage was incorporated 
into that statute of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could look at Motion No. 30, which deals with the caregiver 
benefit for those who provide care in the home for pre-school 
children, the chronically ill, the aged or the disabled.  It is 
my motion.  It passed in this place by a vote of 163 to 29.  In 
the following election it was in the platform of this party.  In 
fact, it is in the Income Tax Act now.  There are caregiver 
benefits for those who provide care for an aged parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could look at the increases in the child tax benefit.  If he 
looked at the report called “Investing in Children and Valuing 
our Caregivers”, he would see that recommendation and he would see 
that I was the author of that report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he were to look at Bill C-204, he would see a bill on 
extending parental leave to a full year—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am poised with 
bated breath waiting for the question.  I would expect that we 
would get to the relevance of the long diatribe and get to a 
question with respect to the member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is questions and comments.  The 
hon. member for Mississauga South indicated at the outset that he 
was provoked, so I guess we are getting the result of the 
provocation in spades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me just conclude with 
Bill C-204, a private member's bill.  The member knows how 
difficult it is to get private member's bills acted upon in this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will also know that in the budget that we are debating here 
today there is a provision to extend parental leave under the EI 
plan to a full year, and that is my bill.  So that the member 
will know very clearly now and for all time, my commitment to the 
family is clear.  I hope that he restrains himself in the future 
from ever casting aspersions on me or any other member in this 
place when he does not know what he is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the first thing the hon. 
member said when he got up to make his comments was that he felt 
I had said something inappropriate.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, 
while I was speaking, that member made a bodily gesture to me 
that was very inappropriate and which you saw.  I believe that is 
somewhat hypocritical of him to say that.  He talks a mean talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support family values.  He mentioned some book he had written 
on income splitting but guess what, he voted for the government 
budget.  He supports the government which does not allow that. 
Although he says he opposes the tax discrimination against 
families, he supports it.  How does he justify the fact that he 
voted as he did on Tuesday night to change the definition of 
marriage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also mentioned a book that he said was a child poverty 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
With due respect, the information the member just gave is 
incorrect.  In fact it is exactly the opposite of what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid we are on a point of 
debate here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, he mentioned child poverty 
solutions.  I submit to that member and to the House that the 
best solution for our children is to lower the tax burden on 
parents so that they have more money in their pockets instead of 
shipping it off to Ottawa to be wasted on Liberal patronage 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the member tried to suggest that he is a defender of 
families, his actions in the House in support of the government 
budget, in support of changing the definition of marriage and in 
support of the other anti-family measures the government insists 
upon embarking on, to that I say actions speak louder than words 
and his actions in attacking the family by the way that he votes 
is deafening. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on some points that the hon. member mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Words like “representation by population” are nice words. 
Another honourable aspect of that would be to see a collective 
effort in the country to try to correct our whole correction 
system.  This budget highlights an increased budget for the RCMP. 
Representation by population is very interesting to me because I 
believe the correction institutes have a high population of 
aboriginal people.  We have communities that have many run-ins 
with the law.  If we look at the court dockets, many aboriginal 
people have been lined up on these dockets in many communities 
and in many court situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the relationship between the law abiding citizens and the 
law keepers, the peace officers and the aboriginal community 
would be much better served if there were measures to involve and 
recruit aboriginal people to the policing institutions and the 
corrections institutions on an equal basis to have racial 
tolerance amongst our population as we work together.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of things 
here.  First of all, the hon. member referred to the high 
percentage of aboriginals in prisons.  When we look at the crime 
statistics in the province that I come from, in Regina the ratio 
of crimes committed by aboriginals to crimes committed by 
non-aboriginals is 10 to 1 and in Saskatoon it is 12 to 1, so we 
would naturally expect that the higher percentage of the prison 
population would be aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say that a lot of social problems that plague 
the aboriginal community are caused by the failed policies of the 
Liberal government.  Until we make all of our aboriginal people 
in Canada full and equal participants of society, we will not 
have racial tolerance or racial harmony, but instead, continued 
discriminatory views and the continued cycle of poverty and 
dependence among the aboriginal community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that hon. member realizes that and that he will support 
the Canadian Alliance efforts when we form the government to help 
aboriginals become full and equal participants of our society.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 2000 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK236">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-32, an 
act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 28, 2000, be now read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at 
the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville, Human Resources Development. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also advise the House that we are now commencing a 
period of 10 minutes speeches in this debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
apologize to the House.  I was a little outrageous with my tirade 
about the family.  I feel kind of strongly about the issue.  I do 
respect the rule of law.  We will live to fight another day and 
defend the sanctity of the institution of marriage, if that is 
what the member is referring to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to spend my ten minutes talking about some of the 
issues that have been raised by the opposition with regard to 
this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some talk about our national debt.  I take a great 
deal of interest in this, being a chartered accountant.  People 
tell us about the size of the numbers and that it concerns them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember not too long ago the Fraser Institute did a research 
study in which they tried to assess the valuation of Canada. 
Excluding the land value of Canada, they found that the assets of 
Canada exceeded some $3 trillion.  To put that in perspective, we 
would probably be in a better position to be able to respond to 
people who would somehow suggest that Canada would be bankrupt in 
view of the fact that there was a $577 billion national debt. 
It is not the case.  In fact members have said “There is only $3 
billion going into paying down the national debt”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT81"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT81"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640
<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this last budget there was that provision for the pay down of 
debt, but that is not to be extrapolated out for all time to say 
that it is only going to be $3 billion.  In fact the economy 
continues to grow.  Interest rates remain at relatively low 
levels. Our unemployment rates are lower than in the last 25 
years. Canadians are working again and the economy continues to 
be very strong in Canada.  That is good for people to be working 
and for our economy to be growing.  It means that as we move 
forward and as we address the needs of our health care system as 
well as the other needs to stimulate and to innovate in Canada 
that we will be paying down the debt in an accelerated fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government took office in 1993, the annual deficit was 
some $42 billion each year.  That was another $42 billion being 
added to the national debt.  We do not just wipe out $42 billion 
of deficit in one year.  The government had a platform of the day 
to reduce that amount to 3% of GDP during its mandate and it 
exceeded that.  The facts are that the government managed to 
balance the books of the country to get our fiscal house in order 
two years earlier than the Reform Party itself had said it would 
during that election and in its election material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debt levels that we see in Canada today would actually have 
been worse under the Reform Party simply because of its 
commitments that it made in their own platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we took office the debt to GDP ratio was some 70%. 
According to the budget documents that the members have and 
Canadians have that debt to GDP ratio will be below 50% and a 
full 10 percentage points lower than the recommended level of the 
auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the members talked about quality of life issues between 
Canada and the U.S.  It is an issue that I would really like to 
have the House debate and perhaps study.  When we consider the 
differences in the whole mix of the environment in the U.S. 
compared to Canada, we just cannot compare it and say “The tax 
level is different than it is over there”.  It is not just 
taxes.  Quality of life issues are very expensive.  If we are 
going to have the quality of life that we have in Canada, if we 
are going to earn the recognition of the United Nations for six 
years in a row of being the best country in the world in which to 
live and to work, it takes investment in our people.  It takes 
investment in the country to make sure that we continue to 
sustain that standard which is recognized around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that the members will know that health care is 
included in our taxes.  We pay for it in our taxes, but in the 
United States they do not.  They have to pay extra taxes. The 
last time I was in the United States I remember asking a taxi 
driver about his family.  He said, “I have two children. There 
are four of us”.  He said he was paying $7,000 U.S. per year for 
his health care costs.  That is a very significant amount that 
Canadians do not incur because it is part of our tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that taxes have to come down and we know that they have 
started to come down.  We also know that the finance minister has 
made two important commitments and that is the money for health 
care will be there once we get the plan right on how to fix 
health care.  It is not just a matter of throwing more money at 
the same way of doing health care.  We have to fix the system and 
make sure it is meeting the needs of Canadians.  I think that is 
a responsible thing to do.  That is why the provinces and the 
federal government are talking today about how are we going to 
address our health care requirements and also ensure that we have 
sustainable funding for a secure health care system for all time. 
That is a responsible way to do it, and not simply throw money at 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of employment insurance came up in a couple of the 
members' speeches. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT82"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT82"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 when the Reform Party came to this place EI premiums 
were scheduled to go up to $3.10.  Today, as a result of the 
changes made just before the budget and reaffirmed in the budget, 
the EI rate is now down at about $2.40.  That is a very 
substantial decrease.  Hon. members are quite right that there 
continues to be more premium revenue than there is payouts under 
EI.  It is approximately $6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be easy to say that we should reduce the premiums, but 
if we were to enter a recession as deeply as we did in the early 
eighties, in one year alone the deficit under the old rates would 
be about $12 million.  We have already lowered the rate 
substantially from the levels they were, which means that the 
deficit on an annual basis within the EI plan could be much more 
than $12 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very fortunate to have continuous growth in the economy. 
More people are working, which means that more people are paying 
premiums and less people are collecting benefits.  That is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been reducing premiums and the government has made a 
commitment to continue to reduce premiums.  That is an important 
signal to businesses that we are committed to supporting and 
stimulating the environment through investments, through grants 
and through other incentives, by working with businesses to make 
sure there is an environment in which our economy can continue to 
grow and continue to employ as many Canadians as possible.  Those 
are some of the fundamental objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some discussion about CPP increases.  When we came 
here pensioners of the day were getting about $8 out of CPP for 
every $1 they put in.  That is a very generous benefit, but at 
that time we had five workers for every one pensioner.   The 
actuaries looked at it and along with the consultations between 
the provinces and the feds it was discovered that with the aging 
of society there would only be three workers for every one 
pensioner in the future.  This means that level of premium 
support for the CPP program would not be available to sustain the 
same level of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way to address it was to pay a level of premiums more 
commensurate with the level of benefits being given under the 
Canada pension plan.  Based on consultations with Canadians, the 
provinces and the federal government, it was decided that this 
was the way to approach it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was on the committee during the study of Bill C-2.  I also 
spoke many times in the House on it.  Canadians wanted the Canada 
pension plan saved.  I remember the Reform Party wanted to scrap 
the CPP, to have mandatory RRSPs and to force Canadians to 
contribute.  They do not understand that there are people who do 
not have the cash to put into such programs.  They are living 
from paycheque to paycheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan is a shared cost between employees and 
employers.  It ensures that all Canadians engaged in the paid 
labour force will accrue pension benefits for their future.  That 
is a very important aspect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to rise, should I say finally, to speak to this bill, 
which concerns the implementation of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate the broad lines of my party's criticism, which were 
to the effect, for example, that surpluses much larger than those 
revealed have been accumulated.  This created a totally unhealthy 
situation because these surpluses come essentially from cuts to 
employment insurance and to the social transfers, which we are 
still suffering from, despite the government's having put the 
money back.  It is far from returning us to 1994-95 levels. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2003, the provinces will still face cuts of $33 billion. 
Quebec alone will absorb $10 billion, because in the course of 
the process, the government changed the rules and stopped 
considering the factor of poverty.  In the Canada social 
transfer, from now on, the factor of poverty will not be taken 
into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This surplus is unhealthy because it is hidden.  One of the ways 
of hiding it was to attribute to earlier years—we are beginning 
2000—but primarily to 1999, major spending that otherwise 
should have been included as spending in 2000 or 2001.  Charging 
the spending retroactively is one way to reduce the size of the 
surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share with the House an experiment I conducted. I 
brought together social groups that are used to manage budgets in 
my riding. I gave them a copy of the budget and said “When you 
have a surplus one year, can you allocate that surplus to the 
previous year?” They said “No, you cannot do that, this is not 
allowed”. But the Minister of Finance has done it repeatedly. 
This is not good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unhealthy because these surpluses still mean drastic cuts 
to social transfers. They mean yet another EI surplus that will 
not be put back in the fund. Annual surpluses of $6 billion are 
anticipated again, but that money will not be put back in the 
system. In spite of lower contributions, the surpluses will still 
be of the same magnitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to discuss an issue that few people raised, which is 
extremely unfortunate. Even though this is a surplus budget and 
even though the money taken through cuts was not given back to 
the unemployed and to the provinces for health, education and 
social assistance, there is a sector regarding which Canada had 
made major international commitments. I am referring to 
international development assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1990, Canada made a commitment to the UN general 
assembly to achieve its objective of allocating 0.7% of its gross 
domestic product to international development. At the time when 
this commitment was made, Canada was allocating 0.48% of its GDP 
to international development. In 1999-2000, it was down to 0.24%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote what the Prime Minister said when he went to 
Senegal, in November: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a rich nation and we should be able to share...There 
are many economic and social problems throughout the world. 
That is why the federal government's balanced approach, which 
consists in setting aside money to ensure the development of 
Canada while continuing to provide international assistance, is 
important. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that it was unacceptable that international assistance 
had dropped so considerably and that Canadian assistance would 
therefore increase from that point on, commensurate with 
Canada's economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had said that the level attained was unacceptable.  But, with 
this budget, the amounts earmarked for international development 
continue to drop in percentage terms.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what Bernard Descôteaux pointed out in November, when he 
indicated that the budget of $2 billion represented no more than 
0.23% of GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it disturbing, and I repeat what the Prime Minister 
said, that a rich country is contributing so little to 
international development and that its contributions are growing 
smaller, when international development assistance is not just 
something that concerns others.  I have two reasons for saying 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countries such as Sweden, Norway and Denmark have reached, on an 
ongoing basis, the 0.7% to which they committed.  How is it that 
Canada's proportion keeps dropping? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other reason it does not just concern others is that poverty 
has become endemic in many countries.  There are billions of 
people living on incomes of less than $2 a day.  Famine is 
widespread and we know that AIDS has become endemic in Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rich nations cannot be rich alone.  The Bloc Quebecois will 
continue to urge that Canada finally meet its commitment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the 
debate on Bill C-32, which my constituents need to know is an act 
to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
parliament on February 28, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has seven parts to it.  I do not intend to speak to 
every part, but I do want to mention two parts of it that are 
actually the government's key fiscal planks from the year 2000 
budget.  The fiscal health of any country is reflected in the 
budgets it presents.  The budgets indicate where the country is 
going.  The future financial health and security of all Canadians 
are determined by budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 has been presented by the government as being a very 
good one with lots of positive things contained in it.  I give it 
some credit for changes that will help eliminate bracket creep, 
which has been a serious problem.  Between 1990 and 1996 bracket 
creep accounted for $10 billion that Canadians should not have 
had to pay had their taxes been indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at what others are saying about the budget 
outside the House to have an impartial view, neither from the 
opposite side nor the government side.  One of the most respected 
organizations in the world that looks at all countries and 
assesses health from an economic point of view is the 
International Monetary Fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Monetary Fund has urged the government and the 
finance minister to lower Canada's debt.  The debt is sitting at 
around $577 billion.  Interest payments in the neighbourhood of 
$40 billion a year are a mammoth drag. Until we are able to 
reduce them, it limits our economic health and our options as to 
what we can do to promote the country's well-being.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They state that an ongoing fiscal restraint is also important 
with surpluses used primarily for further debt reduction and 
income tax reforms.  It has been at least 38 to 40 years since 
there were any significant changes made to our Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to another outsider speaking on behalf of 
the IMF, Mr. Robert Mundell.  He is a Canadian-born economist who 
earned a Nobel prize.  This is what he had to say about Canada's 
fiscal health, and it reflects on the budget that the government 
brought forward.  He stated that there is a major problem in 
Canada, which is excessive taxes and excessive government 
spending.  He stated that at one time the Canadian dollar was at 
par with or even a bit above the U.S. dollar.  We see now that it 
has slipped to approximately a 68 cent dollar, with no hope of it 
coming back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does a country do when it gets into that situation?  We 
have had some good examples from around the world of countries 
that have taken the bull by the horns and turned their economies 
around.  The most recent case that is being used is that of 
Ireland.  Ireland, 10 to 12 years ago, was a virtual basket case 
in that it was not advancing technologically and had problems 
retaining skilled and educated people.  It began a dramatic 
reform of its tax system.  A large component of that was the 
lowering of personal income taxes and corporate taxes, which gave 
the required incentives for private business, not government but 
private business, to drive the economy and keep the people in the 
country and working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting to the exact areas that I wanted to mention, let us look 
at Part 4.  Part 4 would enable 13 first nations to impose a 7% 
value added tax.  It would be along the lines of a GST equivalent 
and would be applied to all sales of fuel, alcohol and tobacco on 
reserve.  I am sure that the first nations have spoken with the 
government to negotiate an agreement and that this will happen. 
I am not against first nations raising their own money from their 
people and sales on reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to look at some of the most recent issues that 
have been brought up by the aboriginal accountability coalition, 
which is primarily composed of people who are not in political 
control of the reserves.  We find that their numbers are quite 
large and they have come forward with some recommendations to 
provide accountability on the reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring up the accountability issue because as the first nations 
people gather in tax money, which is just a little different from 
the grants and contributions idea, there has to be a system in 
place to put checks and controls on those in power who will spend 
the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with the systems we have within the federal government, we 
have a very hard time keeping checks and balances and controls 
over a government which operates in the fashion of the Liberal 
government.  The auditor general constantly comes out with 
reports which show a lack of management, a disregard for the 
rules and money being wasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the women I referred to, Leona Freed, was recently in 
Ottawa.  She spoke of the very things that the reserve 
administrations, the elected officials, must put in place in 
order to have accountability and the trust of their people in how 
they use this tax money. 
I do not think the government has ever really tried to help first 
nations in that regard or negotiated agreements with that level 
of government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the recommendations was for an ombudsman who could speak 
on behalf of the aboriginal people who are not used to dealing 
with their governments.  We have provided an ombudsman for 
non-aboriginal people, so why should first nations people not 
have a similar spokesperson? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electoral reforms are required on some reserves.  I have heard 
of a reserve in Ontario which has an official opposition-type 
party that tries to hold the elected government to account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations also need a free and independent press. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, as reported in Manitoba, on the Peguis reserve, which 
is in my riding, an aboriginal newspaper reporter was covering a 
council activity and some public meetings and was escorted from 
the meetings by four security officials answering to the chief of 
that reserve.  He was asking some very pertinent and direct 
questions, trying to ferret out what was actually happening with 
regard to the issues of the day with that chief and council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal people need an access to information act.  That 
would ensure that if their government tried to hide the facts and 
figures about what was going on with band money, they would be 
able to gather information.  In our case, concerning the 
management of the tax money of Canadians, the government always 
tries to hide things that are damaging to its reputation and 
which point to mismanagement.  We find that with the Access to 
Information Act we in the opposition parties are able to gather 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reserves need an auditor general who would independently 
check into the financial activities of reserve administrations 
and report back to the grassroots people of the reserves, who 
would then decide at the next election who they should vote for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget has certainly brought forward issues which have been 
discounted by the International Monetary Fund and it has not set 
in place proper measures for the aboriginal people of this 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to speak to Bill C-32, the 
Budget Implementation Act, 2000, and I would like to put forward 
some ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in my opinion, the budget shows very clearly that if the 
government decided to restrict its spending to its areas of 
jurisdiction, Quebec and Canadian taxpayers would get the most 
wonderful tax cut they ever had in the whole history of Canada. 
If the federal government decided that it would spend only for 
defence, foreign affairs and other areas under its jurisdiction, 
there would be a lot of spending it would no longer need to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence, the federal government would no longer be 
tempted to impose national standards in areas that are not under 
its jurisdiction. That would also have a good result at the 
accountability level for elected members, because people could 
require adequate social programs from their provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, in a province like Ontario, people voted for a government 
providing less social programs, that would be the choice made by 
the population at election time. If, in Quebec, the government 
decided to provide more substantial social programs, that would 
be in accordance with the choice made by the population at 
election time. This would rid the Canadian system of its 
accountability problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, Ontario is a perfect example of that; the Ontario 
government makes choices and then the Liberal federal government 
steps in, acting like the saviour of social programs in that 
province, playing the role of the good guy, of the knight in 
shining armour, but it is intruding in areas that are not of its 
responsibility.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing we should hope that the federal government would 
do in the budgetary area is to withdraw from all jurisdictions 
where it has no business. This would be great for to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people all across Canada who wish to see that happen 
and we will see this developing in the next few months. It might 
even be a major election issue in the next campaign. This year's 
budget, which may be the last for the current minister and 
perhaps for the Liberal government, does not appeal to us. It 
tells us that the government wants to continue to intervene in 
areas that are not its responsibility and continue to collect 
money while not giving it back to the provinces through transfer 
payments for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine how wonderful it would be if the 10 premiers did 
not have to practically beg for the money they need for health 
programs, if each province could use this tax field according to 
its vision of things and assume its responsibility, and the 
federal government would give it the leeway. This would be a nice 
way for the federal government to ensure that, in the Canadian 
system, there is an appropriate accountability. There is no such 
thing in the current program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to emphasize another point that seems very 
important to me. 
For the current fiscal year, there will be a $6 billion surplus 
in the EI fund.  In March 2001, the surplus will reach a total 
of $34 billion.  This means that, over the last four or five 
years, the federal government has borrowed $34 billion from 
workers and employers across Canada in order to fund 
expenditures that have nothing to do with the EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we took $14 billion out of those $34 billion just to cushion 
the employment insurance system, there would still be $20 billion 
left, which the federal government has collected and is using 
for expenditures not related to the EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When pay cheques are issued every week or two, people can see 
that, as far as EI premiums are concerned, employees and 
employers are contributing a huge $6 billion a year, which do not 
go to the EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just imagine what a boost it would give the economy if 
contributions to the EI fund were lowered reasonably or if the 
unemployed received decent benefits. In spite of the $6 billion 
surplus for this year, the average benefits paid to the 
unemployed no longer amounts to 55% of their average wages, but 
to only 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the infamous intensity rule, the federal government's 
assumption, four or five years ago, was that the reason why our 
seasonal workers were not working longer periods each year was 
because they are lazy. 
We have on record a statement very typical of the prime minister, 
describing the unemployed as beer drinkers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the results are there. The third annual EI monitoring and 
assessment report includes a study commissioned by HRDC and 
conducted by Messrs Pierre Fortin and Van Andenrode, two well 
known economists. According to them, the intensity rule has had 
no effect on the number of weeks worked. Seasonal workers all 
across Canada are not working longer, not because they are lazy, 
but because there are no jobs available outside certain periods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 35, 40 or 45 year old worker who worked 15, 18 or 20 weeks in 
the woods cannot become a computer technician overnight so he can 
find a job for the winter. 
A lumberjack cannot turn into a hotel welcome host come the 
fall. Things do not work that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is evidence. The studies are in. The government is 
grabbing $6 billion a year from the EI fund while continuing to 
cut benefits paid to seasonal workers. Seventy seven percent of 
fishers are affected by the intensity rule. Soon, only 50% of EI 
claimants will be eligible for benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those earning $100,000 a year, $10, $15 or $20 a week is 
nothing. But a 5% cut on $250 a week in EI benefits leaves 
unemployed workers with only $235 or $240 a week.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the $10 or $15 a week that are needed to buy shoes for 
the youngest one once in a while or are missing to pay the 
grocery bill every week. It is very frustrating for someone who 
has contributed to a plan, who has paid premiums, employment 
insurance premiums in this case, and who sees surpluses being 
racked up when he or she does not have enough money to survive 
or have a decent income between two employment periods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget falls far short in this regard. Tax cuts are 
minimal for 2000. There is no improvement in the condition of 
the unemployed. Although the unemployment rate is going down, 
the poverty rate keeps going up. 
This is due to the fact that, whether the economy is good or 
bad, in the seasonal industry, there is generally no significant 
additional income to compensate for the loss of employment 
insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people today have a lower income than what they had three 
or four years ago, even if they work a few more weeks. When they 
do receive employment insurance benefits, they get less money 
during a shorter period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read somewhere in a newspaper article the words “If I were a 
rich man”. The choices made in this budget protect the rich. The 
surtax has been eliminated. I am very happy to learn that some 
people have more money in their pockets, but if we do not at the 
same time make any effort to help those who earn less, it is not 
worthwhile, it is unjustified and unfair. And yet, this is what 
is to be found in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government missed a golden opportunity to restore 
fairness in two areas, first by making sure it only collects 
taxes to pay for the services it is responsible for. It is 
unfair to the Canadian federation as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also being unfair to the unemployed, and is not facing up 
to its responsibilities to those who contribute to the 
employment insurance system. The current system is unfair, it is 
the blatant and systematic misappropriation of the money paid 
into the system. We still do not know how the government is 
going to pay back the $34 billion it owes the workers, the 
employers and the unemployed of this country. Even when times 
are good, it cannot do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about a third issue the member for Mercier 
touched on in her speech and which seems very important to me. 
With regard to international co-operation, did you know that 75% 
of the aid provided by Canada is conditional? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that our generosity is not very genuine. During a 
period of economic prosperity such as the one we are 
experiencing today, we have responsibilities internationally as 
well as nationally. I think it is very telling of the 
government; if it had treated the less fortunate in our society 
in an appropriate manner, it would have done the same at the 
international level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases, it is trying to save face. 
It is important for international aid to produce spinoffs for 
Canada, but is just as important to provide aid without any 
strings attached, to truly co-operate with people and find it a 
worthwhile objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all theses reasons, I believe the Budget Implementation Act 
is inappropriate. It does not go far enough and does not restore 
the fairness we would have expected from a government such as 
this one during a period of economic prosperity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to 
participate in this debate on Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, the bill perpetuates the Liberal 
government's commitment to ad hoc piecemeal and random fiscal and 
economic policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most significant change in the bill is the elimination of 
bracket creep.  I join thousands of Canadians and the members of 
the Canadian Alliance who have been effective in pushing the 
government to recognize bracket creep.  I think the credit goes 
to the official opposition for that.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one time increase to the CHST continues to frustrate the 
provinces.  Since coming to power, the Liberal government has cut 
about $25 billion from CHST.  It continues to frustrate the 
provinces that would like to see stable funding for health care 
and education rather than the incremental policy of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The extension of maternity benefits simply offers more 
redistributive thinking.  Only half of all mothers currently 
receive maternity benefits.  The maternity or parental leave 
proposal excludes single income families.  It excludes 
self-employed parents, students and parents in the workforce who 
do not have enough hours to qualify.  It also excludes those who 
cannot support their families on the employment insurance rate of 
55% of regular income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to the national child benefit, the Canada child tax 
benefits and the GST credit would benefit low income families. 
Part 3 returns the administration of the student loans program to 
the government after it had backed out.  Part 4 attempts to 
harmonize a patchwork of sales tax agreements with the first 
nations bands.  Part 5 broadens the already coercive taxation 
power of the government by granting further powers to the 
Minister of National Revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This weak, arrogant Liberal government has tried in vain to 
portray itself as caring and generous.  These arguments can be 
easily refuted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for no real tax relief for Canadians.  Ending 
bracket creep is not a reduction in taxes.  It only means that 
regularly scheduled tax increases will be postponed.  The bill 
also does not address the government's wasteful spending and the 
use of taxpayer money at HRDC and other departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was not a single word from the finance minister, any 
cabinet minister or any member of the government about the 
wasteful spending in HRDC, CIDA, the heritage department, the 
industry department or any other department.  It continues the 
status quo by giving Canadians a little with one hand while 
taking a lot with the other hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it does not address the lack of competitiveness of 
our economy on a global scale.  Nothing was said about 
international trade or about the competitiveness of the Canadian 
economy for investors who want to invest and create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to families and parenting, we believe all families 
should have greater choice and we have a sound plan, called 
solution 17, to deliver it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that the political culture of this government 
is to tax and spend.  It has been taxing Canadians to death since 
1993.  It has been spending and wasting taxpayer dollars and has 
not been accountable.  It has given no information or explanation 
on important questions that we have been put forward to hold 
it accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day we were discussing access to information. It 
is a blackout for the government when we talk about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I want to make concerns the government's tax 
record. 
While the Liberals are trying to take some credit, which I said I 
will refute, I want to quote some statements made by the finance 
minister on taxation in Canada.   Let us begin with the first 
year in which he became the finance minister. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the finance minister raised federal taxes on the average 
Canadian family by $898.  On February 15, 1994 he said “Our 
ultimate goal is to lower taxes”. We want to hold him 
accountable for that statement, but let us see what he said in 
1995, a year later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister raised federal taxes on the average 
Canadian family by $779.  In his budget speech on February 27, 
1995 he said “Furthermore, in this budget, like last year's, we 
are not increasing personal income tax rates one iota”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see how we can hold him accountable in the next year.  In 
1996 the finance minister raised federal taxes on the average 
Canadian family by another $896.  In his budget speech on March 
6, 1996—look at his bizarre explanation—he said “This 
government does not rely on tax increases to hit its deficit 
targets—”.  What does it rely on?  It simply relies on tax 
increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the finance minister raised federal taxes on the average 
Canadian family by $1,568.  His excuse again in the budget speech 
on February 18, 1997 was “In not one of our budgets has there 
been an increase in personal income tax rates.  Indeed in last 
year's budget, and in this year's, we have not raised taxes at 
all”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who knows how to calculate will find out the figures I 
have quoted are contrary to what the finance minister has been 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 federal taxes on the average Canadian family were raised 
by another $237 and there was still no admission from the finance 
minister.  He said “Let me begin by reaffirming our goal.  It is 
to reduce taxes.  It is to leave more money in the pockets of 
hard-working Canadians”.  That was in the budget speech of 
February 24, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By looking at these quotes, it proves that he talks the talk but 
does not walk the walk, and it has been proven in the last five 
years that I have mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is ready to govern because there is only 
one solution to the problem:  We have to replace the Liberals. We 
came up with a strong initiative, solution 17.  Solution 17 would 
remove 1.9 million taxpayers from the tax rolls, many with young 
children.  It would lower their taxes giving them more income and 
therefore more options to work part time or full time. It would 
provide substantial, immediate and direct tax relief for 
Canadians who currently pay record high taxes.  It would also 
lead to a much more vibrant economy and greater wealth creation. 
It is fair and it is simpler. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be a member of the Canadian Alliance and proud to 
debate and oppose Bill C-32 in this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It being 5.30 p.m., the House will

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>TREATIES ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK244">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from December 1, 1999, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-214, an act to provide for the participation 
of the House of Commons when treaties are concluded, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with a 
great deal of pleasure, pride even, that I rise to speak this 
evening to Bill C-214, introduced by my colleague for 
Beauharnois Salaberry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a totally modern bill, in that it wishes to ensure that 
Parliament obtains, takes over, resumes its past role in 
approving important treaties.  This means parliamentary 
democracy will come into play with respect to treaties, which 
increasingly concern the lives of ordinary citizens and their 
role within their state.  There may also be very considerable 
consequences for the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To clarify what I am about to say, I will remind hon. members 
that this private member's bill has four objectives.  It wishes 
to require the government to table treaties it has already 
signed, for reasons of transparency, in order to ensure that 
parliamentarians and the general public have access to the 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also calls for treaties to be approved, in order to 
compensate for the gap in democracy that arises out of a 
situation where the greater number of treaties increasingly 
deprives parliamentarians of power and, in a way, destroys the 
relationship between the power of parliaments, members' 
responsibility and the role of the executive of Canada, which is 
becoming excessive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that this requirement for treaty approval 
applies solely to important treaties, defined as follows by my 
colleague: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>any treaty 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) whose implementation requires 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) the enactment of an Act of Parliament, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) that Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada be invested 
with new powers, or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iii) the imposition of a tax by Parliament; 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) imposing a substantial financial obligation...on Canada; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>c</I>) concerning the transfer of a part of the territory of 
Canada...; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>d</I>) under which Canada undertakes to impose economic or military 
sanctions...; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And continuing: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—including the transfer of jurisdiction to such institutions. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutions in question are international institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to my colleague's bill, these important treaties 
should be submitted to parliament before they are ratified.  I 
know that certain of my colleagues have argued that already 99% 
of treaties involve an implementation bill. 
The problem is that there is nothing to back this figure up, 
despite the knowledge shown by my colleague who spoke previously 
on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, in the case of an implementation act, it is not 
appropriate to talk about the major components of this treaty, 
its relationship with the life of people, with democracy, or 
about the impact it may have on the life of society or about its 
implications for provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this bill aims at guaranteeing consultation with the 
provinces. There would be an obligation to involve provinces 
having legislative authority with the implementation of treaties 
in an area under their jurisdiction. The wording of the bill is 
precise and was intended that way. The bill would guarantee 
respect for the jurisdiction of provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, I emphasise that this was what the provinces 
called for at the 40th annual premiers' conference, held on 
August 11, 1999. They published the following text: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premiers and Territorial Leaders therefore reiterated their 
long-standing support for an immediate formalised 
federal-provincial-territorial agreement on the 
provincial-territories role in the negotiations, implementation 
and management of international agreements. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add an extremely important element, which may 
not be generally known. 
Since 1966, when parliament approved the auto pact before 
ratification, no other international agreement was ever 
submitted to parliament before ratification. Yet, we know that 
since that time, treaties, by their content, their nature, have 
increasingly impacted on people's lives. For example, NAFTA has 
had and will continue to have a considerable impact. Why was it 
not   submitted to parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, some will answer that these are complex issues under 
negotiation and that as a consequence it had to be done in 
private, in secrecy. However, what that really means is that 
powerful lobbies, those who can be heard by powerful people and 
negotiators for all kinds of reasons, are the ones who really 
decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would even go as far as to say that, if those treaties are not 
submitted to parliament before their ratification, it may also 
be that they are not even given proper consideration at cabinet 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we so afraid of parliament? Countries like Australia, 
New Zealand and the United Kingdom are moving towards 
strengthening the role of parliament with regard to treaties 
before they are ratified, which means in developing them, 
integrating them into the statutes and assessing their impact on 
society. Why are we so afraid of parliament here in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I could mention the fact that, in Canada, senators 
are appointed, that there is no constitutional court that would 
be legitimate for the provinces as well as for the federal 
government. I could also mention the fact that we are used to a 
very strong executive branch. 
But it is precisely because of that and because, more and more, 
these international treaties affect the lives of ordinary 
Canadians that we must convince all our colleagues in the House 
to give back to parliament the power it once had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the question again: What are we so afraid of? Would it not 
be better for democracy and also more effective if we go to see, 
before they are ratified, these treaties that affect the lives 
of ordinary citizens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we will strongly support our colleague. We already 
know that other parties have expressed their support. We hope to 
convince our colleagues opposite to take their place as 
parliamentarians and to play their role with regard to these 
treaties, which are secretly changing our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I will say again that we must make sure that the 
provinces that have responsibilities with regard to the 
implementation of these treaties be involved, that parliament 
also be involved before these treaties are ratified, and that 
government be transparent, show us the treaties it has signed 
and table the text of these treaties. All these things are 
essential to democracy, to a modern democracy.

an explanatory memorandum including a summary, implications for 
Canada spelled out, new obligations to be undertaken, estimated 
expenditures, proposed conditions for denunciation of withdrawal, 
a record of consultations undertaken, an indication of any 
legislation required for implementation and a list of existing 
legislation requiring amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill requires that the provinces be consulted in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction.  It also provides for greater efforts to 
inform the Canadian public about the contents of the treaties 
through publication in the Canada <I>Gazette</I>.  The bill calls 
for greater scrutiny of non-governmental parties consulted and 
sent as participants in negotiations.  This seems like a long 
list, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. The 
Canadian Alliance would go even further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance wants the House of Commons foreign 
affairs committee to have greater powers to examine treaties and 
make recommendations.  In matters of international agreements and 
treaties, a Canadian Alliance government would uphold the vital 
interests of Canada and our constitution and the individual 
rights of Canadians, including the right to fundamental and 
natural justice as being sovereign and paramount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the people of Surrey Central, I will be supporting 
this bill.  But, as I have said,  we on this side of the House 
would go much further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaties are like diamonds.  They are supposed to be forever. 
Treaties have significant and long lasting implications on 
international institutions, families, our environment, our 
resources, our economy, our taxes, our investments, trade, 
competition, employment and financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International treaties affect human rights, sovereignty, 
security, jurisdictions, boundaries and borders, sanctions and 
virtually every aspect of day to day business in the lives of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if people watching this debate realize how much the 
weak Liberal government ignores or cuts out the House of Commons 
in the treaty-making process in Canada.  It is remarkable.  If it 
is not undemocratic, it is anti-democratic.  The Prime 
Minister is touring seven nations in the Middle East and writing 
Canadian foreign policy on the bus between luncheon and dinner 
engagements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the members of the House never see the treaties signed 
by the government.  Most of us know nothing about them because 
the weak Liberal government handles them behind closed doors. 
Sometimes we do not know who negotiates these treaties on our 
behalf.  Who signs these treaties?  We do not know.  Canadians 
only find out about them by reading newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1993 and 2000, during the life of the Liberal 
government, it has signed all kinds of treaties and ratified more 
than half of them. 
This is typical of the old line traditional parties when they 
formed the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Typically the Tory and the Liberal governments concentrated too 
much power in the Prime Minister and the cabinet.  When it comes 
to examining international treaties, not enough power is spread 
around our parliamentary system in the House so that a thorough 
examination of the treaty can take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current foreign minister said to the secretary general, Kofi 
Annan, “We want to make the Security Council of the United 
Nations more transparent, more democratic, more open and to the 
extent we can introduce alternative options for making 
decisions”.  Why does he not try this idea at home in Canada? 
His preaching which he is not practising at home is so ironic 
that he would recommend something abroad and not do it at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the previous hour of debate on the bill that proposes to 
make the Canada treaty process more open and democratic, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs said 
“This bill seriously affects the division of powers in Canada 
and questions certain priority aspects of Canada's foreign 
policy”.  Aside from the panic on the government benches 
exhibited by his statement, I suppose the parliamentary secretary 
got it right.  We are asking for the priority of secrecy and lack 
of input from Canadians to be scratched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said “A treaty is strictly the purview of the federal 
executive branch”.  What a shame.  “However, the legislative 
branch is still responsible for implementing the ensuing 
obligations”.  Fair enough, but how can we implement the 
obligations when the treaty has been signed and ratified with 
flaws or political positions or other things that the legislative 
branch of our government cannot possibly endorse? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reading from the speech handed to him by the foreign affairs 
department on his way to the House, the parliamentary secretary 
said in the first hour of the debate “Not only do 
parliamentarians receive all of the information, but they play an 
active role in the implementation of the treaties that Canada 
wishes to ratify”.  He further stated “Because of this 
implementation power, parliament is regularly required to study 
and discuss treaties”.  This was an unbelievable statement from 
the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could not say in true consciousness that we on this side of 
the House or anyone on the backbenches of the Liberal side of the 
House has any power to implement or should I say prevent the 
implementation of any treaties signed by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has broken Brian Mulroney's record of cutting 
off and shutting down the debate in the House.  Yet the 
parliamentary secretary in his speech tells Canadians that we 
have the power to implement treaties.  What a laugh.  What a 
sham. When has this ever happened?  Not since 1993.  That is for 
sure. Like Brian's Tories, the Liberals days are truly numbered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the parliamentary secretary said further that Bill C-214 
creates nothing new, but it imposes a tight framework on the 
Government of Canada for consulting its provincial partners. 
Good.  As an MP from B.C., I know very well the western 
alienation ailment that the weak Liberal government suffers from. 
Anything we can do to get the Liberals to work with our province 
is a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government opposes Bill C-214, claiming that the signing of 
any international treaty lies exclusively with the Canadian 
federal executive branch.  He emphasizes it because the Liberal 
government does not want duly elected MPs examining the secret 
deals reached by their Prime Minister and other foreign leaders 
behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says “Bill C-214 adversely affects Canadian foreign policy. 
Crises throughout the world must not be used for partisan 
purposes”. Are treaties a crisis?  No. 
Is consulting MPs in the House a necessary partisan exercise? No.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my time is limited, but I would like to give one 
more quote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary stated that Bill C-214 would slow 
down the treaty ratification process.  What is the rush?  Why do 
we not follow the right procedures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how the government signed treaties when it came to the 
Multilateral Agreement on Investment, the Kyoto emissions deal 
and others.  We know how it signed those treaties.  Canadians are 
not informed about the implications.  There is very little or no 
debate in the House.  The treaties are signed, sealed and 
delivered behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I will support this bill because it is a step in 
the right direction.  It complies with the Canadian Alliance 
policy according to which at least five steps are needed to bring 
sufficient transparency and accountability to foreign policy and 
treaty making process.  Very quickly, those five steps are to 
require parliamentary ratification, including going before 
committee; a national interest and impact analysis or assessment; 
strengthen co-operative federalism with real provincial input; 
ensure public information; and—

member, but his time has expired.  Resuming debate, the hon. 
member for New Brunswick Southwest. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is an interesting bill before the House and one 
that is worthy of debate.  I want to put a few comments on the 
record with regard to this treaties bill, an act to provide for 
the participation of the House of Commons when treaties are 
concluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key word is “concluded”.  I do not think we want the House 
of Commons or elected members, although we want to be part of the 
process, involved in the negotiations and this bill clearly sets 
that straight from the outset.  It is not talking about day to 
day negotiations but being involved once the treaty is concluded. 
We do understand the importance of government and leadership in 
government and the need for the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
the Minister of Fisheries to negotiate treaties on behalf of the 
Government of Canada.  That obviously means the people of Canada. 
However, at the end of the day it has to be put before the people 
of Canada right here in the House and that is what this bill 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to bring a few points forward which I think should 
lead to interesting debate on this bill.  The summary of the bill 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this enactment, Canada shall not, without first consulting 
the provincial governments, negotiate or conclude a treaty 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a)  in an area under the legislative authority of the 
legislatures of the provinces; or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b)  in a field affecting an area under the legislative authority 
of the legislatures of the provinces. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in the Act in any manner limits or affects the royal 
prerogative of Her Majesty in right of a province with respect to 
the negotiation and conclusion of treaties in an area under the 
legislative authority of the legislatures of the provinces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a key phrase which I think is worthy of some more 
thought on behalf of the member who wrote this bill.  The bill 
further states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment provides that Canada may not ratify an important 
treaty unless the House of Commons has first approved the treaty 
by resolution pursuant to the rules of procedure of that House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means this House, the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key phrase in that is “important treaty”.  The member 
designates that in Bill C-214 as an important treaty and then 
goes on to define an important treaty, and I think it is 
important that we step through the definition of “important 
treaty”. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of this enactment, “important treaty” means 
any treaty 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a)  whose implementation requires 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i)  the enactment of an Act of Parliament, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii)  that Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada be invested 
with new powers, or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iii)  the imposition of a tax by Parliament; 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b)  imposing a substantial financial obligation, whether direct 
or conditional, on Canada; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c)  concerning the transfer of a part of the territory of Canada 
or any change to the boundaries of Canada; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d)  under which Canada undertakes to impose economic or military 
sanctions, whether direct or conditional, against a State; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e)  concerning the territorial jurisdiction of Canada, including 
jurisdiction by Canada over any area of the sea or air; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f)  concerning international trade or investment or Canada's 
place in the world economy; or

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to conclude or deduce where that would leave us in 
terms of the land mines treaty which was negotiated by the 
Government of Canada.  I think every party in the House has given 
the government a lot of credit for doing this, the credit going 
in particular to our foreign affairs minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the definition of important treaties, that very treaty 
would have been left out of this bill.  I think that is one which 
should have been debated in the House more than it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other one is the international law of the sea.  Where does 
that leave us?  It does mention it, but I am not sure if, under 
the confines of this particular bill, that definition would fit 
into what we consider international law, respecting our 
obligations as a nation on the high seas beyond our 200 mile 
limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member has to take a look at that.  It is something 
which should be referred to committee for further study.  It 
could be an omission but we have to have some expert opinion on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we listen to what is going on in the world today in terms of 
the refugee problem or crisis and Canada's obligation, where does 
that leave us?  In a sense these are treaties.  They are 
negotiations which take place at the highest levels, expecting 
Canada to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just wondering whether or not that falls into the 
definition and whether or not it would exclude that type of 
debate taking place in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witness the Prime Minister in the Middle East now, making policy 
up as he goes along.  Is that an example of what we should be 
debating here in the House?  We are not sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to condemn everything the government does but we 
do think that some of those important issues should be debated 
here on the floor of the House of Commons.  We do not want to 
make it up as we go along, which appears to be happening today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the world of globalization, Canada wants to be a player and 
wants to be involved.  This is the place where it should happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point which has to be made is that there is no mention 
of the other place, the Senate of Canada, and the role it plays 
in this bigger debate.  That takes us back to a debate which is 
going on in the other place this very moment in terms of the 
clarity bill.  The admission of the senate in this bill, which 
obviously upset many senators, did not receive too much criticism 
here in the House because of that admission.  That is one of the 
issues which has to be resolved that I do not see in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to the debate.  I am sure the member is going to 
get the kind of support he needs, on this side of the House at 
least, to move this forward.  We look forward to the member's 
comments.  We look forward to moving this to at least the 
committee stage for further investigation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that nothing in this bill in any manner 
limits or affects the royal prerogative of Her Majesty in right 
of a province with respect to the negotiation and conclusion of 
treaties in an area under the legislative authority of the 
legislatures of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides that Canada may not ratify an important treaty 
unless the House of Commons has first approved the treaty by 
resolution pursuant to the rules of procedure of that House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, when Canada intends to ratify a treaty, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs must table the treaty in the House 
of Commons, accompanied by an explanatory memorandum on the 
subject matter and effects of the treaty, not later than 21 
sitting days before it is to be ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Put simply, Bill C-214 seeks to promote the participation of all 
of us in the House, as democratically elected representatives of 
all Canadians, in the process to conclude treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may wax philosophical about globalization and its importance 
in our lives but, at some point, we must be practical and see 
what it means in real terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all the members of this House will agree that an 
increasing number of decisions affecting each of us in our daily 
lives will be taken at the international level. 
Whereas in the past, the government or the legislative process 
was in the hands of people elected in certain countries, 
including Canada, more and more decisions are being made 
internationally, not by parliamentarians but by governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process is a bit topsy turvey, in other words, things on 
various subjects are negotiated internationally and then the 
governments simply pass them without the people, the elected 
representatives in the parliaments of the various countries, 
having a say.  This could perhaps be compared to a sort of new 
piece of legislation created world-wide, where there is no real 
democracy.  We can talk about a lack of democracy 
internationally and also federally or nationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of November, beginning of December, I attended an 
important conference, which the members followed with 
considerable interest, the WTO conference in Seattle. 
One of the points raised in the conference by the opponents of 
the WTO process, was the lack of democratic control over the 
WTO.  These opponents, demonstrators, had supporters in most of 
the countries, and they were saying “It is incredible that the 
governments are negotiating such things without the public being 
informed or consulted and without the people's elected 
representatives having their say”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people demonstrating against the WTO, whether in Seattle or 
here in Canada and Quebec, were right in that it is important, 
in a world where more and more things affecting us in our daily 
lives are decided internationally, for the elected 
representatives to have their say.  Such participation by MPs 
could be strongly encouraged if treaties were systematically 
tabled in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tabling treaties would have the advantage of informing members 
of the existence of treaties signed by the government, and that 
is already something, and of bringing to their attention the 
legal standards in them that could have an effect on Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passage of the bill would mean greater transparency in the 
matter, and we must not forget that greater transparency—

an act to provide for the participation of the House of Commons 
when treaties are concluded, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we had a 
most inopportune interruption in order to go and see someone who 
is not elected, but appointed, in a room full of people who are 
appointed because they are friends of the government. I cannot 
help but point out that it is sad to see—and I can see you 
rubbing your eyes with good reason—the work of this House being 
interrupted, without any consideration for the speeches that are 
made here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speeches in this House are made by representatives who have been 
elected and therefore have democratic legitimacy, unlike the 
person who signed and the people in the other place, where you 
went yourself, because these people are appointed, not elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before this inopportune interruption, I was saying that the 
passing of the excellent, wonderful and important Bill C-214 
introduced by my colleague from Beauharnois—Salaberry would bring 
greater transparency to the conclusion of treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greater transparency also means greater support by Canadians and 
Quebecers to the contents of the treaties. It is much more 
difficult to support something that we know nothing about and 
whose contents we are not aware of, than something of which we 
know the pros and cons and that we have debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-214 would also confer upon the House of Commons the power 
to approve what are termed important treaties.  During the 
break, I was informed that my friends over there have decided 
not to support this bill.  I am disappointed that they want to 
remain powerless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over there they could have said for once “Yes, we do want more 
powers, we do want more control”.  Instead ,they have just 
decided, once again, to be the government yes-men that they are, 
saying “If the government says so, and does so, then it must be 
all right, it must be a good thing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are shirking part of their responsibilities, 
responsibilities they should take seriously.  The purpose of 
this bill is to allow the House as a whole, not one or another 
party, to have its say, as an instance of the federal government 
with democratic legitimacy. 
I suppose when one is used to being powerless, maybe one wants 
to continue that way.  I feel this is a pity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would enable members to debate the content of 
treaties, but without limiting the government's leeway in 
negotiating or signing treaties.  The government's leadership is 
not being challenged here.  It is, of course, up to the 
executive to negotiate treaties.  That is the way it is done 
throughout the world.  The desire here is to ensure that the 
balance between the executive and the legislative is not 
completely tipped in favour of the executive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also provisions in this bill aimed at involving the 
provinces in the negotiation of treaties coming under their 
jurisdictional responsibility, and requiring the Government of 
Canada to consult them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself wrote an article in the period leading up to the WTO 
conference, a marvellous document if I do say so myself. 
Again, the WTO is increasingly important.  In my opinion, the 
provinces must be as closely associated as possible with the 
process of negotiation, and of representation in the event of 
trade disputes too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to congratulate the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry on introducing this bill, which is intended

representatives of the people, seize the opportunity to have our 
say on an international matter that affects us increasingly, 
that will affect our fellow citizens increasingly in their daily

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to Bill C-214. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's leadership role in human security, peacekeeping, 
international co-operation and development is well known.  The 
Minister of Foreign Affairs has just announced the Canadian 
initiative on the treatment of children in times of conflict. 
Let us hope that the invaluable experience and sterling 
reputation which Canada developed during its leading role in the 
Ottawa process for the elimination of anti-personnel land mines 
is put to use to help the innocent young victims of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will understand the importance of having a good 
system for concluding treaties, one which enables Canada to 
conduct its foreign policy effectively in the service of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill introduced by the hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry has compelled us to once again give some 
thought to Canada's mechanism for concluding treaties.  Is it as 
flawed as the hon. member suggests?  Does it need to be radically 
overhauled as he is proposing?  Does our current practice prevent 
us from playing a role and defending the interests of Canadians 
on the international scene?  In my view, our current practice, 
with its flexibility and capacity to respond to change, already 
enables us to meet our objectives while recognizing the essential 
role of parliament in implementing treaty obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems facing governments often extend beyond national 
borders.  When countries decide to work together to improve a 
situation in an area such as foreign trade, common defence, 
disarmament or international crime, they negotiate and come to an 
agreement commonly known as a treaty or a convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under our constitution, the power to conclude treaties belongs 
exclusively to the executive branch of the federal government. It 
is the executive that agrees to bind and commit Canada to 
obligations in the international sphere.  It was, therefore, the 
executive that signed and ratified the charter of the United 
Nations and voted for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
It was the executive that ratified the North Atlantic Treaty by 
which NATO was formed, and it was the executive that ratified the 
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  Canada is already party 
to nearly 3,000 bilateral and multilateral instruments and, with 
the growing need for states to respond to international trade and 
political imperatives, this number can only increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Beauharnois—Salaberry is suggesting that the 
House of Commons does not play a large enough role in the process 
of concluding those treaties to which Canada chooses to become a 
party.  I have trouble following the hon. member on this point. 
While it is true that the executive is responsible for signing 
and ratifying treaties, it has always been a responsibility of 
elected representatives to pass the implementing legislation for 
treaties in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitutional power to implement treaties granted to the 
House of Commons and the legislatures under the division of 
powers and confirmed by the highest courts more than 60 years ago 
ensures a healthy balance between the federal executive and the 
people's elected representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal executive must secure legislative implementation 
from the elected representatives before agreeing on behalf of 
Canada to be definitively bound by a treaty.  Without this 
approval, treaty obligations could not be implemented and Canada 
would fall well short of meeting its international obligations. 
Not only is it well advised to consult and obtain legislative 
approval from elected representatives in order to implement 
treaties, it is often essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canada wants to ratify a treaty involving one or more 
provincial areas of jurisdiction, the executive automatically 
consults with the provinces.  On reading Bill C-214 one would 
think there was no consultation between the federal government 
and the provinces and that this legislation was absolutely 
essential in order to remedy the situation.  Nothing could be 
further from the truth.  For example, the provinces are 
continually consulted on the Hague conventions on private 
international law, which of course fall under the constitutional 
jurisdiction of the provinces over civil rights.  Canada has not 
ratified some of the Hague conventions because of the provinces' 
unwillingness to implement aspects falling under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a practice that works, with no need to legislate or to 
impose any requirement to conclude unwieldy agreements concerning 
consultative mechanisms with the provinces.  We already have 
consultative mechanisms.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, I would like to mention a crucial point brought up 
by my colleague, the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra, in the 
first hour of debate on second reading of the bill.  In his bill 
the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry attempts suddenly and 
indirectly to grant the provinces the power to conclude treaties. 
The courts have been clear that in the Canadian constitutional 
system the power to conclude treaties for Canada belongs 
exclusively to the executive branch of the federal government. In 
other words, there is no provincial power to conclude treaties, 
nor has there ever been.  Bill C-214 would be contrary to our 
constitution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current practice already provides a balance between elected 
representatives who have legislative authority and the executive 
which has the power to conclude treaties for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member claims that members of parliament do not have 
the opportunity to help formulate Canada's position in treaty 
negotiations.  Let us stop to consider this argument and look at 
the role played by the all-party Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade when it is consulted about 
negotiating and concluding international treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Subcommittee on International Trade, Trade Disputes and 
Investment of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade held hearings and produced a report on the 
conclusion of an agreement on the free trade area of the 
Americas.  In June 1999 the full Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade held consultations and produced 
reports on the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House that 
the government presented its response to the committee's report 
regarding the WTO on November 15, 1999.  It is clear from that 
response that the government greatly benefited from the 
committee's recommendations in formulating its own position, a 
concrete example of the important role of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committee hearings provide an excellent opportunity for 
parliament to consult, examine, analyze and debate Canada's 
international commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of parliamentary participation in concluding 
international agreements comes to mind.  Canada and the United 
States are currently in the process of concluding an agreement on 
customs preclearance at Canadian airports.  As members know, 
there are U.S. customs officers at many Canadian airports 
preclearing passengers who travel to the United States.  This 
reduces the waiting time upon their arrival at U.S. airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade studied Bill S-22, the purpose of which is to implement the 
Canada-U.S. agreement before a final agreement is even concluded. 
Why did it do this?  To give parliament manoeuvring room to 
determine on its own what powers it may want to grant U.S. 
customs officers posted on Canadian soil.  Needless to say, 
during the committee meetings the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry still found reason to criticize this 
government initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament is already regularly consulted on important matters 
that may be the subject of international treaties.  Here again 
the hon. member is not inventing anything new.  The advantage of 
the Canadian practice of concluding treaties is that it is 
flexible.  It provides a balance between parliament and the 
executive branch in concluding and implementing international 
treaties and gives elected representatives an important role in 
debating and studying international agreements.  Let us not 
forget that the government is responsible to this House for the 
conduct of Canada's foreign affairs, including the conclusion of 
treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, our system of concluding treaties, including the 
practice by which it is governed, works very well indeed. Through 
its flexibility it provides for the effective participation of 
elected representatives, in consultation with the provinces in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction, while guaranteeing that the 
interests of Canadians are fully defended and promoted on the 
international stage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate in the second hour debate of Bill 
C-214.  At the outset I would like to clear up two points raised 
by the hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry in the first hour 
of this debate last December 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member stated that “We are still waiting for the 
treaties signed in 1993, 1994, 1997 and 1998 to be tabled”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1994 treaties were tabled June 9, 1999.  The 1993 treaties 
were tabled June 10, 1999.  The 1997 treaties were tabled April 
13, 1999.  Currently there are no treaties outstanding to be 
tabled under the current practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the 1998 treaties, departmental officials are now 
in the process of preparing 47 treaties for tabling.  There is a 
normal lag of at least one year with respect to multilateral 
treaties.  This period enables the depositories of these 
treaties, often the UN, to advise states of their entry into 
force and prepare the certified copies which are then tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the depository of Protocol II, annexed to the 
Convention on the Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of 
Certain Conventional Weapons, intended to bring mines into the 
disarmament regime created by the main convention, advised Canada 
on July 7, 1999 that this convention had entered into force on 
December 3, 1998 and provided the certified copies.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such time lags are normal practices among depositories such as 
the UN which manages hundreds of multilateral treaties and must 
calculate the exact date of entry into force of the convention 
based on the number of acceptances received and then prepare the 
certified copies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also suggested on December 1 that this bill 
would correct an obvious deficiency, allowing ordinary citizens 
as well as parliamentarians access to international treaties. 
This bill does no such thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government already provides Canadians, including MPs, wide 
access to treaties.  They are published in a Canadian treaty 
series and distributed to numerous libraries throughout Canada. 
In addition, they can be purchased from the government publishing 
centre on a cost recovery basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind all MPs in the House that they have access to treaties 
tabled since 1990 in CD-ROM format through the Library of 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill deals with the Canadian practice with regard to the 
conclusion of treaties, an important element of the Government of 
Canada's prerogative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill seriously affects the division of powers in Canada and 
calls into question the ability of Canada to pursue major foreign 
policy objectives.  It purports to democratize the treaty process 
by providing parliament with a greater role.  Parliament already 
has a considerable role in our treaty process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian constitutional law clearly establishes that the 
negotiation and signature of a treaty are strictly in the purview 
of the federal executive.  However, the legislative branch is 
still responsible for implementing the ensuing applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a treaty results in changes to current laws, or enactment of 
new ones, the legislative branch alone can take such action. 
Depending on the jurisdiction, implementing legislation must be 
passed by parliament or provincial legislatures.  As the hon. 
member knows, this role is essential because in the absence of 
any participation from the legislative branch, the international 
commitments made by Canada could not be met for lack of domestic 
enactments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of this implementation power, parliament is regularly 
required to study and discuss treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 1 the hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry stated 
that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither the Free Trade agreement between the U.S. and Canada, nor 
NAFTA nor the recent treaties on Landmines and disarmament were 
approved by this House before the government expressed its 
consent to be bound by them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statement once again ignores parliament's crucial role in 
treaty matters.  All of these treaties were subject to intensive 
study and scrutiny by the House when it considered the 
legislation to implement them.  It was up to parliament to decide 
if it wished to enact this legislation and, if it were not 
passed, the government simply could not have ratified these 
treaties.  Canada's most important treaties are already, and have 
always been, subject to this legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of parliament in treaty making continues to evolve. Not 
only is parliament involved in the implementation of treaties but 
consultation on our most important treaties now takes place 
before committees and prior to the government taking binding 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade and its subcommittee examined exhaustively and made 
recommendations to the government on the multilateral agreement 
on investment, on the WTO and the FTAA negotiations.  They did so 
prior to the conclusion of these agreements by the federal 
executive.  Let me be clear.  Our current practice strikes a 
careful balance between the constitutional power of the executive 
to make treaties and the crucial role of parliament in 
implementing them, providing for the flexibility and efficiency 
which Canada needs to pursue its foreign policy objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As another example, last spring parliament debated Bill S-22, 
the implementing legislation of an agreement with the U.S.A. on 
customs preclearance, prior to the conclusion of the agreement in 
order to give parliament greater latitude in determining what 
powers Canada would provide U.S. customs officers in Canadian 
airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Bill C-214, with its proposal to provide for the 
approval of treaties by the House of Commons prior to 
ratification, would adversely affect the development of Canadian 
foreign policy and would emulate the legislative approval system 
in the United States.  Crises throughout the world must not be 
used for partisan purposes on the national political scene.  The 
Government of Canada, which is accountable to parliament, is 
responsible for the country's foreign affairs.  In order to be 
heard and to be perceived as a leader, it must have a single 
voice on the international scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision of the U.S. Senate not to sign the comprehensive 
nuclear test ban treaty stunned Canada and the entire 
international community, dimmed the hopes for peace and 
international stability generated by the treaty, and dealt a 
serious blow to the United States' reputation, even though the 
administration supported ratification. 
This is a clear illustration of what happens when sterile party 
politics find their way into the conduct of a country's foreign 
affairs.  Canada does not wish to undergo such a drastic change 
in the conduct of its foreign affairs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill raises major constitutional concerns.  Bill C-214 
refers to the royal prerogative of the crown in right of a 
province with respect to the negotiation and signing of treaties. 
No such provincial prerogative exists.  The prerogative with 
respect to the negotiation and signing of any international 
treaty lies exclusively with the Canadian federal executive. 
Therefore, Bill C-214 violates the constitutionally determined 
division of powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would require the government to negotiate consultation 
agreements with provincial governments in areas of provincial or 
shared jurisdiction.  Canadian constitutional law already 
requires that the Government of Canada secure the support of 
provinces before ratifying an international treaty requiring 
implementation through provincial legislation.  It is done 
because it has to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the federal government is engaged in extensive 
consultations with provincial governments developing a national 
implementation strategy to allow Canada to ratify the Kyoto 
Protocol to the Climate Change Convention and there are extensive 
consultations to develop positions and policy to allow 
implementation of crucial agreements in the trade area. 
Provincial representatives are sometimes part of Canadian 
delegations when treaties concerning provincial matters are 
negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-214 creates nothing new in this area but it imposes a 
straitjacket on the Government of Canada for consulting its 
provincial partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Bill C-214 with its requirement that treaties be 
tabled 21 sitting days prior to their ratification, would 
preclude Canada from playing a key role on global issues, as it 
has done in recent years.  Our current treaty-making practices 
enabled Canada to be the first to ratify the Ottawa Convention on 
Landmines on December 3, 1997 when the international community 
came to Ottawa to sign the convention.  Had Bill C-214 been law, 
Canada would never have managed this feat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-214 could also seriously affect our ability to enter 
quickly into agreements on emergency food supply or peacekeeping 
forces deployment in times of humanitarian crises.  It would 
fetter our ability to enter into ad hoc extradition agreements to 
extradite criminals seeking refuge in Canada and damage our 
commercial interests when time is of the essence to give an 
advantage to Canadian businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must have a treaty-making process that allows it to 
achieve its foreign policy objectives and to deal quickly and 
effectively with changing and urgent situations.  Our current 
practice meets these imperatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is already a major role for parliament with respect to the 
implementation of treaties and parliament has been consulted on 
our most important treaties prior to their conclusion.  It is my 
strong view that Bill C-214 provides for an overly complex and 
inefficient procedure to replace a treaty-making process that so 
far has well served Canadians, parliamentarians and Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am aware 
that I do not have much time to speak to this bill, which I think 
is a very good one, introduced by the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very interested in issues of globalization. In a world 
where areas of activity that were formerly more the concern of 
the United Nations are now making their way onto the world 
stage,  we will be increasingly called upon to make decisions on 
an international scale and to ratify treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One question comes to me right off the bat and it is this:  What 
is the role of parliamentarians in this regard?  Should we 
always rely on governments to negotiate treaties?  I think that 
one of the most flagrant examples we have seen is the 
multilateral agreement on investment.  People will recall that, 
for two years, this agreement was being secretly negotiated by 
the OECD, an organization of the 29 richest countries in the 
world.  Nobody in the world, except of course the negotiators, knew 
this was in the works.  We parliamentarians were not in the 
picture.  It took a leak by one of the negotiators on the 
Internet before pockets of resistance began to spring up around 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that this was an historic event because, for the first 
time, we saw civil society join forces internationally, we saw 
young people the world over ready to be mowed down rather than 
see this agreement signed. 
I am thinking in particular of the young people of salAMI in 
Montreal, who resorted to civil disobedience.

<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have money freely flowing from the 
Human Resources Development Canada offices to individuals and 
businesses without being properly accounted for.  But for our 
farmers, they basically have to walk through fire to receive 
money from another government managed program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The internal audit of HRDC exposed severe mismanagement of 459 
job creation programs worth almost $1 billion.  Some of the major 
problems were 80% of grant recipients showed no evidence of 
financial monitoring, 72% had no cash flow forecast, 87% showed 
no proof of supervision and 11% had no budget proposal or 
description of expected results.  In one instance, seven people 
listed as unknown on the applications received $11 million.  This 
is hard to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money flows out of the human resources development 
department without proper checks or balances.  However, another 
program, the agriculture income disaster program, or AIDA as it 
is known, is the exact opposite.  Farmers fill out, or in most 
cases pay their accountants to fill out, complicated forms and 
then submit their applications to an AIDA office.  Months later 
the farmer finds out if he qualifies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One producer in my riding told me his application was submitted 
in May 1999, but it took until March 2000 to be processed.  That 
is almost a year.  How long does it take for a human resources 
grant to be approved and distributed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AIDA applications are also heavily scrutinized.  The forms 
go through a number of government staff and each one looks for 
ways to limit the payout to the farmer.  In one case a farmer in 
my riding found out that his AIDA application had been worked on 
six times.  By the time it had gone through bureaucrats, his 
payout was a fraction of what he had expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this type of scrutinizing take place at the human resources 
development offices when they are looking at grant applications? 
Is it true that the officials in charge of AIDA have been told to 
reduce payouts and limit benefits because it is agriculture and 
not HRD?  There appears to be a deliberate scheme to not support 
farmers but to shovel taxpayers' dollars to patrons of HRD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should I be telling farmers in my riding to skip the AIDA 
procedure and go to the human resources development office for 
assistance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent <I>Globe and Mail</I> article discovered 49 of Canada's 
top 100 most profitable companies have received grants in the 
past three years totalling $4.2 million from the HRDC office. 
Each of these companies has made a profit of at least $70 
million.  Do we have to show a profit of $70 million and 
contribute to the Liberals before qualifying for grants from the 
federal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have farmers who are struggling to stay afloat and one of the 
main reasons for their problems is that the government taxes them 
to death and does not defend them at the international bargaining 
table.  The government is taking dollars out of farmers' pockets 
and funnelling them to rich corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does not want to give farmers their money 
back, why does it not just reduce taxes?  Taxes kill jobs.  The 
grants at HRD use tax dollars which come directly from the 
farmer.  In fact, farmers pay huge amounts of tax on the inputs 
they buy to grow their product.  Fertilizer, fuel, chemicals and 
machinery all have a hidden tax component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grants at HRD are shovelled out through what is called a job 
creation fund.  Let us rename this the job destruction fund.  It 
is driving farmers off the land and many other Canadians do not 
have jobs because of the high taxes needed to support the 
Liberals' jobs destruction grants program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should not be easy to access public funds, but there is an 
obvious double standard taking place when we look at the HRDC 
programs and compare them to the AIDA program. 
I would like to know how the human resources development minister 
can justify handing out a billion dollars in grants with no 
accountability while our farmers continue to struggle and cannot

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to have this opportunity to respond to my good friend across the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really cannot comment on the AIDA program because that was not 
suggested in his earlier question to which I was preparing to 
respond.  However, I can respond to some of the allegations made 
against HRDC.  For example, he said that money was freely flowing 
from HRDC in these grants and contributions.  He should realize 
that the section of grants and contributions that was audited, 
and which had a very serious result that all of us took 
seriously, the audit covered an audit universe that represents 
less than 1% of the Government of Canada's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now had months of allegations being hurled across the 
floor from the opposition at us based upon 1% of the government's 
budget.  I want to assure the member that there is a strict 
process for approval of these grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as his allegations about us working with big companies, 
yes we do.  We work with both the private sector and the 
non-profit sector.  In the private sector we work with both big 
companies and small companies because we respect all businesses 
and they all have a right to apply for assistance when they need 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as cutting taxes, as he is suggesting we should be doing 
instead of creating economic activity, we have begun to cut taxes 
now that we have eliminated the deficit and can afford to cut 
taxes.  There was a big plan announced in the last budget to that 
effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would the hon. member replace the $3 billion in economic 
activity that we have managed to start through our investment, 
for example, of $300 million in the Canada jobs fund?  That 
leveraged $2.7 billion from the private sector and the non-profit 
sector and resulted in $3 billion of economic activity, which we 
would not have otherwise had in the country, and in the creation 
of approximately 28,000 new jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is 
now deemed to have been carried.  Accordingly, the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing 
Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.46 p.m.)
