</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard—La Prairie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canada's economic upturn is indeed a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a recent Statistics Canada report, the gross 
domestic product rose 0.5% in January.  This is the 18th month 
in a row in which there has been an increase, the longest 
uninterrupted series since 1961, when the GDP began to be 
measured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic and budgetary choices made by the Liberal 
government are now bearing fruit.  Despite the opposition 
raised, of course, by the opposition, we have done the job. 
There are now some truly concrete results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone, including the opposition parties, is clearly forced to 
acknowledge that we have come a long way from the distressing 
situation of 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results are great, but what is still more important is that 
they are so full of promise and of hope for everyone in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, thanks to the government's tax them until they drop 
policy, the EI surplus will hit a whopping $35 billion this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since only about $15 billion is needed as a hedge against a 
recession, Canada's premier payroll tax will be used to fund the 
government's pre-election spending spree.  Workers and small 
businesses who struggle to feed this government's insatiable 
appetite for taxes are outraged that their EI premiums will be 
used to prop up Liberal electoral fortunes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debt reduction and tax relief are needed immediately to stop the 
brain drain and to stem the exodus of our homegrown industries. 
But these Liberals are so out of touch with reality that they 
think they can buy the hearts and votes of Canadians by simply 
reversing the changes they made to the EI rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want lower taxes and real jobs, not make work 
projects, grants or EI.  Liberals are not going to give that to 
them, but a Canadian Alliance government would make it a 
priority.

who have just won an award, the Mérites du français dans les 
technologies de l'information 2000, in the category of Internet 
site in French and encouragement of the use of French in 
cyberspace.  This is one of the awards given by the Office de la

festivities for Francofête 2000, the week celebrating French and 
the Francophonie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Francomania doubly deserves congratulations, for it also won the

time of the 8th Francophone Summit in Moncton and the Year of 
Canadian Francophonie, by and for young francophones aged 16 to 25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This recognition of the excellent work done by this team is a 
victory for the development of the Internet in French, an honour 
shared by its partners: Radio-Canada, the Department of Canadian 
Heritage and Industry Canada.

give rank and file Indians an effective tool that would enable 
them to hold their band leaders accountable for their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the hon. member for Wild Rose, had created a bill 
called the first nations ombudsman act that had the potential to 
empower Canada's most powerless people, those who live on 
reserves. The legislation was launched after extensive coast to 
coast consultations with grassroots aboriginals and was supported 
by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night the aspirations of those people were crushed when the 
Liberal, Bloc and New Democratic parties ganged up to defeat the 
legislation.  Members of those parties have forgotten that the 
primary goal of government is to protect and serve the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grassroots aboriginals will not forget this setback.  Their 
struggle for accountability will go on and members of the 
alliance will continue to support them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bernard Lajoie, the son of one of Trois-Rivières' best known

best animated short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, having won the Jutras award for the best film in 
its category a month ago, this work, inspired by Ernest

countries are expected to soon fall under the spell of this 
Quebec production.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Eric Bishop, an institution in Calgary for decades, passed 
away last week.  Today is the day that his legion of friends will

</I></B></P><P align=left>Eric Bishop was born in Lacombe, Alberta 74 years ago and very 
early on established himself as a pillar in the sports world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote George Hansen, “One way or another, everyone knew who 
Eric Bishop was”.  He was one of the best broadcasters to ever 
sit in front of a microphone and one of the most insightful 
sportswriters to ever sit at a typewriter. 
We all have our own idea of what heaven will be like.  Those who 
knew Eric Bishop say that for him, there will be green felt 
covered tables, plenty of good cigars, unopened fresh decks of 
cards, and rooms full of family, friends and fans.

Ridge, April 9, 1917:  Canada's nationhood was forged by the 
tremendous efforts of its soldiers.  More than 66,000 Canadians 
died in action or of their wounds after the war, more than one in 
ten of those who had worn uniforms.

I rise today to express the objection of the NDP to the fact that 
Canada Post has turned down a request to issue a stamp in honour 
of the 75th anniversary of the United Church of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Census figures show that almost three million Canadians identify 
themselves as United Church members.  Refusing a stamp that so 
many Canadians could relate to shows bad judgment at best on the 
part of the stamp advisory committee or at worst, more evidence 
of what one United Church spokesperson has called “the tendency 
to marginalize the place of an historic Christian communion in 
the cultural life of the nation”, in this case, the largest and 
most uniquely Canadian Protestant denomination in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my former colleague, André Ouellet, chairman of Canada 
Post, to right this wrong against the United Church and restore 
some perspective to the issuing of commemorative stamps.

pleased to introduce in the House the first bill aimed at 
reducing violence on television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 18, 1992, Virginia Larivière, who was 13 years old 
at the time, delivered a petition to the government bearing the 
signatures of 1.3 million people calling for legislation against 
violence on television.  This was a reflection of the desire of 
Quebecers and Canadians to take the necessary steps to reduce 
violence on the small screen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far back as 1993, the television industry created a voluntary 
code on violence on television.  Among other things, it refused 
outright to show gratuitous violence.  As well, programs 
containing scenes of violence intended for adult audiences were 
not to be broadcast before 9 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are forced to acknowledge that this approach appears 
not to have resulted in any reduction in the amount of violence 
being shown on television.  That is why action must now be 
taken.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance referred the problem to the 
ethics counsellor.  A spokesman for the office of the ethics 
counsellor told journalists that the examination of the matter 
was conducted without any trace of interference by anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They had to look at all the files and they had to check with 
every department, which included the Department of Finance.  They 
have done that and there will be a report by the ethics

</I></B></P><P align=left>I said before, and I will repeat to the House of Commons, that I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left>Any cabinet minister who had even the slightest involvement with 
the blood products industry in the eighties would have been in 
conflict sitting at the cabinet table when they were discussing 
compensation packages for tainted blood victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister sat on the board of a company whose 
subsidiary was cited by the Krever commission for 10 counts of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Department of Finance, like any other department, 
had to be consulted to make sure that all the facts were known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were no demands or instructions by the Minister of Finance 
to send anyone there.  The ethics counsellor wanted to have some 
information from every department, including the Department of

ethics counsellor himself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister had a huge interest in boosting profits at 
Connaught Laboratories during the year it imported tainted blood 
from U.S. prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Years later he sat at the cabinet table and denied the victims 
of that tainted blood scandal the right to compensation from his 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While they discuss it over there, this is clearly a conflict of

<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This company was not a company with shares.  It was a Canadian 
government corporation and the Minister of Finance, if he had any 
shares, had shares for qualification purposes only.  There was 
absolutely no profit to be made by the Minister of Finance in his 
participation on the board of this corporation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Canadian

Calgary to investigate a conflict of interest situation involving 
the finance minister, Connaught Laboratories and the Canada 
Development Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They must have found something interesting because we know from 
a memo concerning that investigation that they faxed copies of 
certain CDC minutes to the finance department, but when we asked 
for this information under an access to information request the 
finance department denied that it had such minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that the finance minister does not want us to know 
about this conflict of interest? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I hope that the deal cooked up by the Reform Party 
yesterday which led to the withdrawal of one of the candidates 
because of pressure under the table does not distract the hon. 
member.  He should be the last to talk about lessons of ethics 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that it was a crown corporation.  The Minister of Finance 
was a private citizen.  He was sitting on the board.  There was 
absolutely no possibility for him to make any profit for himself.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A larger than ever number of Canadians are borrowing money in

in the main by the banks, the finance companies and the mortgage 
companies extending too much credit to people who just want to 
speculate in the market.

the finance department withheld these documents.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recently announced a blue ribbon scientific panel 
to ostensibly address growing consumer concerns about the safety 
of food biotechnology.  Now we learn the government is spending 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to send every household in 
Canada a 24 page full colour leaflet asserting the safety of 
genetically engineered foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the government prejudged the outcome of its own review

Canadians?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the government is very proud of the quality and safety of 
Canadian food.  Together with my colleague, the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, we have sent factual information to 
Canadian households as to why they should be satisfied with the 
safety and quality standards of our food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, because biotechnology continues to push back 
the frontiers of science, we have appointed a blue ribbon panel, 
including the Nobel Laureate, Dr. Michael Smith of British 
Columbia, to work with us in ensuring that in the future we will 
have the science capacity necessary to keep on the cutting edge 
of science and safety.

Indian band financial statements was confidential and not subject 
to public release under paragraph 20(1)(b) of the Access to

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
co-operation of hon. members. 
This bill on money laundering deals with an emerging crime, and 
one that is getting worse.  Dirty money is that money earned from 
criminal activities, mainly drug dealing, but also such 
activities as smuggling cigarettes and theft, and is often the 
product of organized crime.  Money laundering is the process by 
which that dirty money is cleaned in such a way that it cannot be 
readily or easily traced back to its illegal activities, 
therefore allowing crime to profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial action task force, of which Canada is a member, 
consists of 26 countries.  It consists of the OECD countries, 
plus Singapore.  It estimated that the global amount of money 
laundering is in the area of $300 billion to $500 billion U.S. 
every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I do not think you heard, but there were members on this 
side of the House who said no when you asked for unanimous 
consent.  I do not think you heard that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  No, the Speaker did 
not hear that and we are not going to revisit it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try to be brief so 
that hon. members from other parties have as much time as they 
would want to debate this important measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial action task force also indicated that the extent 
of money laundering going on in Canada—and we will never know 
for certain what it is—is somewhere between $5 billion and $17 
billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is aimed at doing one thing, and that is to help take 
the profit out of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we currently have in place in terms of law?  We have the 
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act, 1991, which does three 
things.  It requires that records be kept of cash transactions 
over $10,000.  It requires that client identification procedures 
be followed, that is, financial institutions are required to know 
the client.  Third, it provides for the voluntary reporting of 
suspicious transactions by the financial institution directly to 
the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we need this new bill in light of the existing law?  This 
new bill retains the record keeping and client identification 
provisions of the old law.  However, it has extended beyond the 
current institutions which must report, such as financial 
institutions, casinos, intermediaries, lawyers and accountants, 
to other types of financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering is not just a phenomenon which takes place 
through financial institutions.  There are expanded means, 
including the Internet.  This new legislation will apply to 
cheque cashing businesses, crown owned institutions and crown 
owned casinos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old law, as I said, provided for the voluntary reporting of 
these suspicious transactions.  We are moving beyond this to 
mandatory reporting.  Where there is a suspicious transaction, it 
must be reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have three types of reporting.  First, it will be 
mandatory for financial institutions and others who have 
reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is linked to 
money laundering to report that transaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there will be mandatory reporting of prescribed 
transactions.  We are proposing that they be cash transactions, 
or the equivalent, of $10,000 or more.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we want to deal with the importation and exportation in 
and out of Canada of large amounts of cash or negotiable 
instruments.  We are proposing that one has to report any sum 
exported or brought into Canada in the order of $15,000 or more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the guts of the new law.  We have struggled.  It is 
not an easy task to balance the requirement to have an updated, 
modern, crime fighting legal system in Canada with protecting the 
privacy of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having reviewed many international situations and examples and 
after extensive consultations, we have proposed that in order to 
safeguard individual privacy but at the same time ensure that 
crime is stopped we would institute a financial transactions and 
reports analysis centre of Canada, or the FTRACC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centre would be an agency reporting to the Minister of 
Finance, who would be responsible for it.  It would be run by a 
director.  It would have approximately 60 employees and cost 
approximately $10 million a year.  The centre will receive 
reports from financial institutions or others required to report. 
In other words, they will not report directly to the police or to 
the government.  They will report to the centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centre will gather, collect and analyze all the information. 
It will then refer the information to the appropriate policing 
authorities, only when it is satisfied there are reasonable 
grounds to suspect that the information would be relevant to the 
crime of money laundering.  The centre must satisfy itself first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the centre pass on?  It passes on only tombstone or 
bare bones information:  the name of the account, the date of the 
transaction, the account number and the value of the transaction. 
If the police authorities want to get more information from the 
centre they would have to do so by virtue of a warrant issued by 
a judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This information can also be passed on by the centre to CSIS, to 
Revenue Canada and to immigration authorities.  It cannot be 
passed on willy-nilly.  It can be passed on only in the event the 
centre has determined there are reasonable grounds to suspect 
money laundering and has determined that there may be, for 
example, tax fraud involved as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any individual who feels that privacy rights have been hampered 
would be entitled to go to the privacy commissioner to have the 
case looked at.  The centre will not be exempt from examination 
by the privacy commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at why it is important that we pass the bill 
quickly.  The financial action task force on money laundering has 
pointed out that Canada, one of its members, is the only member 
that does not have mandatory reporting.  We have the commitment 
of our Prime Minister at the G-8 summit in Birmingham in 1998 to 
this type of law.  This was reconfirmed again last year at the 
Cologne summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had extensive consultations starting in May 1998 when 
the solicitor general issued a consultation paper.  We in finance 
issued a consultation paper in December.  We have considered wide 
consultations with all interested parties.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I believe that we have found a way to expand the 
reporting requirements, to make them mandatory and at the same 
time to balance the rights of individuals to privacy and freedom 
from unjust or unreasonable search and seizure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is through using this unique concept of the centre.  The 
centre will be able to analyze trends in money laundering.  It 
will be able to work with international law enforcement agencies. 
I think it will be a great addition to our war against crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By enacting the bill, Canada will be a much less attractive 
target for money laundering.  We will be sending a clear message 
to the world that organized crime and criminals should not try to 
do business in Canada.  We will appreciate the support of all 
parties.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the members of this House 
for allowing me to take part in the debate on this very 
important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot we do not know about organized crime and money 
laundering, but we do know, from informed sources, that it 
involves a constant battle always in a state of flux.  It is a 
substantial problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to independent estimates for the Department of the 
Solicitor General of Canada, up to $17 billion is laundered in 
Canada each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other estimates that reveal the scope of 
the problem. 
No one knows exactly how much is involved, but everyone knows 
that there is a real and serious problem, in Canada and 
throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a recent study by the financial action task force, 
established at the G-7 summit in Paris in 1989, the way money is 
laundered in Canada and in the other member countries has 
changed in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money launderers no longer limit their activities to banks and 
other deposit institutions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other kinds of businesses are being used for money laundering 
such as securities dealers, insurance companies, casinos, 
currency exchange houses, money transmitters and non-financial 
professionals including lawyers and accountants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that proceeds of crime are often laundered through 
legitimate businesses.  Criminal Intelligence Service Canada 
backed this up in its annual report on organized crime just last 
year.  The physical movement of proceeds of crime across our 
borders is also part of this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new system proposed in Bill C-22 will be an important step 
in helping to prevent cross-border money laundering through 
airports and other border points.  More than that, Bill C-22 
builds on the excellent work that we continue to do in 
partnership with the provinces, territories and law enforcement 
agencies as part of a larger global network of countries fighting 
this problem together. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite vigorous efforts the current government and its partners 
continue to apply in Canada and abroad, we can still do much 
more.  Bill C-22 represents a major step forward in the fight 
against organized crime. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should remind hon. members that in the budget the government 
devoted significant new resources to increase federal policing 
activities, particularly in the area of organized crime.  Over 
the next three years the RCMP will receive $584 million in extra 
funding.  In the next fiscal year alone the RCMP will receive $59 
million extra for federal policing services.  This means more 
resources to fight organized crime activities such as drug 
trafficking, smuggling of commodities and people, telemarketing 
and commercial fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is further proof of our commitment to giving our law 
enforcement agencies the tools they need to do the job.  By 
implementing the bill not only will Canada be living up to its 
international commitments to the G-8 and its financial action 
task force, but we will also be making good on commitments here 
at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP and police forces across the country will benefit from 
the system proposed in the bill as information from the new 
agency will go directly to the police to support investigations. 
Other federal agencies will also receive information from the 
agency to help investigate certain national security, revenue and 
immigration offences, but only when they are also related to 
suspicions of money laundering.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing the new agency with suitable protections to share 
information with similar agencies in other countries will allow 
us to play our full role against money laundering on an 
international scale.  It will also allow us to benefit from 
information that foreign agencies may have about money laundering 
going on in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When dealing with global organized crime sharing information is 
vital, but we are also aware of the need to respect privacy in 
the process of investigating these crimes.  We take these 
concerns very seriously. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must bring our investigative methods up to date to fight 
against today's money laundering techniques.  We need 
centralized and automated systems to discover the links between 
dubious financial operations and the movement of illicit funds, 
and to ensure their follow-up. This is exactly what Bill C-22 
does. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our consultations have shown strong support for a new and 
tighter anti-money laundering system.  Officials continue to work 
closely with financial institutions and other stakeholders to 
make sure that the new requirements are clear and reasonable.  We 
are also consulting provincial governments, the police and others 
to ensure that the new arrangements will address the needs that 
have been identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 strikes a sound and effective balance between the 
legitimate needs of law enforcement and respect for individual 
privacy.  It will also make Canada a less attractive target for 
money laundering and send a clear message around the world that 
this is a country where organized criminals should not try to do 
business.

Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to 
participate in the debate on Bill C-22, an act to facilitate 
combatting the laundering of proceeds of crime, to establish the 
financial transactions and reports analysis centre of Canada and 
to amend and repeal certain acts in consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a party to international agreements asking us to 
report transactions that may involve money laundering.  The 
official opposition believes that the vast majority of 
law-abiding Canadians want legislation that will fight crime and 
that will prevent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weak Liberal government introduced this bill as Bill C-81 on 
May 31, 1999, and let it die on the order paper.  Now we are only 
at second reading of the bill and still it will have to be sent 
to the committee for much study and amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to the comments of the Secretary of 
State for International Financial Institutions.  I am convinced 
that the government did not evaluate, did not look into the pros 
and cons of the bill in depth.  I would like to give an overview 
whereby we will look into the gravity of the situation first and 
then look into the problems and concerns.  I would also like to 
provide some suggestions and amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized criminals, particularly in the drug trade, generate 
and launder billions of dollars annually. 
They have to do that to continue their illegal operations.  They 
move from jurisdictions with strong controls to jurisdictions 
with weak or no controls.  This criminal activity undermines 
Canada's financial and social systems and increases the power and 
influence of illegal businesses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experts estimate that from $300 billion to $500 billion of 
criminally driven funds enter the international market annually. 
In Canada alone the ballpark estimate is around $20 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Financial Action Task Force estimates that about 70% of the 
money laundered through Canada is derived from drug trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many ways to launder money, including through 
financial institutions, foreign exchange dealers, significant 
cash purchases, brokerage houses, foreign tax havens, real 
estate, the operation of shell companies, travel agencies, 
insurance agencies or companies, and dealing in gold and other 
precious metals. Even some professionals such as lawyers and 
accountants help in money laundering.  Criminals launder money 
through gambling and cross-border transfers.  It is a wide open 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some other methods are more sophisticated, for example smurfing, 
human mules, over-invoicing for import-export purposes.  I will 
not mention the details for security reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian banks are reportedly favoured for the transfer of funds 
because of their wide international presence, stability, 
efficiency, strong tradition of banker-client confidentiality and 
facilities of transfer such as wire transfers, currency exchange, 
denomination exchange, savings deposit boxes, and please do not 
laugh, even government savings bonds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign currency exchange houses being less regulated than 
the chartered banks provide the second most common vehicle for 
money laundering, at least in Canada. There is a potential for 
concealing the identity of the launderers because the negotiable 
instruments or the wire transfers are deposited in the banks and 
the client is perceived as the currency exchange house, not those 
people who are laundering the money.  The perception is created 
that the financial negotiable instrument comes from the currency 
exchange house and is then deposited in the bank and the 
laundering of the money continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other illicit funds are also laundered through the purchase of 
stocks and bonds in the securities market through a shell company 
located in a tax haven somewhere where the laws protect the 
anonymity of the owners.  Therefore money is laundered through 
the stock exchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investing in a private company also is a way of laundering. The 
private company will go public and then the earnings from the 
sale of shares create an illusion that the profits generated are 
legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These side issues of money laundering or its byproducts have 
serious consequences.  Street gangs channel criminal profits to 
fund terrorism or military operations abroad. 
Money laundering feeds armed conflicts and illegal activities 
that threaten everything from our families to our society to our 
national and international security and economy and perhaps even 
world peace.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A staggering variety of activities such as extortion, home 
invasion, murder, theft, drugs and arms trafficking, counterfeit 
currency and passports, migrant smuggling, prostitution, mafia, 
casino and lottery frauds are additional costs to society at the 
expense of the taxpayer and at the expense of our future. These 
activities make our streets unsafe. It is not only money 
laundering which affects our economy and undermines society, but 
other criminal activities piggyback on it and affect our 
children, our future and undermine our security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These activities are escalating.  It will likely become more 
difficult for police to deal with them if the weak Liberal 
government does not wake up.  The Liberals can have a deep sleep 
if they want to, if they are tired and cannot remain awake. 
Someone else can sit in the driver's seat.  We now have a licence 
to do that and we could do that for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will remember that in 1997 one of the six key 
platforms of the former Reform Party was to make our streets 
safer.  A Canadian Alliance government would do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are fed up and have had enough.  We do not want Canada 
to be a haven for money laundering.  I urge the government to 
look at this bill very diligently and look through lens of the 
importance of the issue and not through the lens of politics, 
selfishness or arrogance as it usually does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The broad purpose of Bill C-22 is to remedy shortcomings in 
Canada's anti-money laundering legislation. It was identified by 
the G-7 Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering in its 
1997-98 report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial task force recommended that reporting requirements 
in Canada be made mandatory rather than voluntary as is currently 
the case.  Why has the reporting been voluntary in the first 
place?  That means every honest person was supposed to report 
whereas the criminals escaped reporting.  This does not make 
sense. The other recommendation made by the task force was that a 
financial intelligence unit be established to deal with the 
collection, management, analysis and dissemination of suspicious 
transaction reports and other relevant intelligence data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 proposes to bolster Canada's anti-laundering efforts 
by making it mandatory for financial agencies to report 
information relating to certain types of transactions.  The 
information is to be sent to a central data gathering and 
analysis body called the financial transactions and reports 
analysis centre of Canada.  This analysis centre would authorize 
the release of information to domestic and foreign law 
enforcement agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 will also establish in association with Canada Customs 
and Revenue Agency a system of reporting large cross-border 
transactions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government not only lacks vision but it is also very 
weak.  It does not have the political will nor is it capable of 
fixing the ailing departments.  It thinks that the status quo is 
the only option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when international organizations tell it to fix something 
serious it does it half-heartedly.  It has a mentality and 
culture of only doing a patchwork job.  The patchwork does not 
work, particularly when dealing with organized crime. The 
criminals are light years ahead of our government.  We need to 
overhaul the whole system.  Corruption and abuse in the system is 
enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians suffer as a consequence of abuse and fraud in many 
areas.  These include the GST refund, welfare, employment 
insurance, social insurance numbers, insurance, workers 
compensation board, immigration, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminals are buying mansions, boats and luxury cars with the 
proceeds from organized crime.  They have hefty bank accounts. 
What is the reason?  The loopholes in the system and the law are 
not plugged.  There are so many loopholes and the criminals are 
exploiting them.  Tax evasion and the underground economy are 
putting pressure on small businesses and legitimate taxpayers who 
cannot bear the huge Canadian tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax burden is responsible for a poor quality of life, the 
brain drain and so many other things.  Due to the illegal 
activities of some individuals, the legitimate taxpayers suffer. 
The whole nation suffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are criminals who do not pay taxes but they pay bribes or 
political donations, and they continue to enjoy the government's 
most favoured status.  Many organizations enjoy charitable tax 
free status only to rake in money to finance organized crime or 
even wars in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Canadian multinational trading company, which I will not name, 
whose stock was valued at about $600 million, was found to have 
very close ties to the eastern European mafia.  It was laundering 
the money through the stock exchange and sending the money to its 
counterparts in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a candy store for these criminals.  It is a shame that 
the government cannot come up with legislation that would be 
effective and would do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The blurred vision of the Liberal government has caused the 
dismantling of the Vancouver port police.  This makes the port a 
gateway for the importation of drugs and narcotics.  It opens up 
the way for the criminals and makes their jobs easier rather than 
tougher.  It is a shame the Liberal government gives 
international organized criminals VIP treatment while those same 
criminals according to the Immigration Act are supposed to be 
inadmissible into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human smugglers and criminals who live on organized crime 
should be given the toughest penalties.  That is what Canadians 
are telling us.  That is the only way to discourage them. 
Otherwise unfortunately, they have the motivation to come to 
Canada and commit crimes because they consider Canada to be a 
crime haven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about stopping the federal government when it launders the 
money?

</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that CIDA contracts and EDC loans have been given to 
businesses which donated huge sums of money to the Liberal 
campaign before the elections.  We all know those figures.  When 
we ask a question, the government does not reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that everyone in Canada knows about the billion dollar 
boondoggle.  Do we need a bill to fix all that is wrong with the 
government?  No, I do not think so.  Rather, we need to replace 
the federal Liberal government, which we can and which we are 
prepared to do with the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some other aspect of the bill.  When Bill C-22 
comes into force, it will replace the existing Proceeds of Crime 
Act.  However, the existing proceeds of crime regulations would 
remain in effect until the mandate regulations are promulgated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four key principles of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first would provide tools for law enforcement agencies, 
giving them the information to identify charges to be laid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second would strike a balance between privacy rights and law 
enforcement needs.  We need to place strict controls on the 
collection, use and disclosure of personal financial information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third would minimize compliance costs for financial 
institutions and other stakeholders. We have to minimize 
compliance costs.  We need to establish a workable regime with 
the full co-operation of all stakeholders, without unnecessary 
red tape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth would provide for contributions toward international 
efforts to combat money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to see the government's definition for these efforts. 
These definitions are not given in this bill.  We do not know 
what they mean.  They are too vague.  I will come to that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles are ones that any law abiding citizen would 
support, but as always, we know we cannot trust the government 
because it does not keep its promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me dwell on the concern we in the official opposition have 
about the cautions we should take.  One of the problems with Bill 
C-22, other than what I have mentioned, is that while the policy 
objective is laudable and Canada should not be a haven for 
laundering the proceeds of crime, the bill raises many concerns. 
The bill is too vague in many areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is concerned that the bill is too vague 
concerning who is affected by the act.  The Liberals have to show 
us clarity in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lack of precision in this bill.  There are no 
definitions of many terms, for example, the definition of 
“suspicious transaction”.  What is a suspicious transaction? 
There is no definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States of America opposed this legislation because it 
presented problems of probable invasions of privacy.  We in 
Canada are also concerned that the privacy of Canadian citizens 
could be unreasonably invaded inadvertently through overly 
restrictive regulations defining transactions that must be 
reported.  There should be sufficient protection and freedom of 
law abiding citizens should be preserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is that customs officers are being given broad 
powers to search anyone they want when they have reasonable 
grounds to suspect that the person has hidden currency or 
monetary instruments which are of greater value than the amount 
prescribed or declared. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, we are concerned that the powers to search should have 
safeguards to ensure that customs officers do not hassle persons 
lawfully crossing the border.  They should not be hassled.  It 
may grant customs officers the power to strip travellers of 
undeclared cash.  The financial transactions and reports analysis 
centre of Canada could end up with a licence to harass innocent 
and legitimate people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If passed, Bill C-22 would give bureaucrats fresh authority to 
trap the innocent, infringe on privacy, gather information on 
citizens and put routine money transactions under suspicion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are broad delegations of authority to the cabinet, 
including making regulations to define what transactions must be 
reported and who must report them.  The government has overall 
authority to make those regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, it will conscript lawyers, banks, accountants and others 
into a national subculture of informants and snitches.  Routine 
legitimate business transactions could be disrupted as a result 
of the bill.  The bill will restructure the relationship of trust 
between lawyers and clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be a reasonable balance between entrapment of 
innocent citizens and effective tools of law to help our law 
enforcement agencies to do their jobs effectively and 
efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about securing a conviction of money laundering. 
Securing a conviction of money laundering requires the crown to 
prove four elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.  It 
must be proven that the accused dealt with the laundered property 
with intent to convert or conceal it.  The property must have 
been derived from the commission of a predicated offence.  The 
accused must have had knowledge of this fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment could now allow the police to arrange sting 
operations even though the above may not be proven by the crown. 
It could also help the police to get someone convicted of a 
companion crime, the crime which is attached to the money 
laundering crime, even if the laundering cannot be proved.  That 
is dangerous.  The legislation should be driven by need and not 
by police hype, political or international pressure.  It should 
be needs based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance issued a consultation paper on January 
17.  The paper promises that after Bill C-22 becomes law, 
proposed regulations will be published in the <I>Canada 
Gazette</I> for 90 days to allow further public input.  This 
addresses some of the concerns about the broad discretion.  But 
the proposed regulations include cheque cashers, money order 
vendors, crown owned or controlled deposit-taking institutions, 
which are banks, credit unions, trust companies and so on, and 
even Canada Post money order businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally, transactions involving $10,000 would have to be 
reported, as would any transaction involving five or more $1,000 
bills.  Cheque cashers, money vendors and money transmitters 
would be required to retain a record of every transaction of 
$1,000 or more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything is hidden in these regulations.  Nothing has been 
clearly defined in the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about regulations.  As the House knows, I am 
co-chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Scrutiny of 
Regulations, so I can talk about regulations.  I can say that 
this government governs by regulations only.  The House will 
recognize that 10% to 15% of the laws are made in this Chamber 
and 80% to 90% of the laws are brought in through the back door. 
Only 20% come through the front door and 90% are hidden in the 
regulations.  The regulations will hold the real story which no 
one will know because they will be buried under tonnes of 
paperwork. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My committee is responsible for examining and scrutinizing 
regulations that accompany a bill which is passed by both houses, 
this House and the other house, the Senate.  This weak Liberal 
government that lacks vision, like the Tories before it, crippled 
our committee's work by not giving it the resources it needs to 
scrutinize hundreds and thousands of regulations.  The bill will 
have so many regulations attached that only the courts will be 
able to tell us about the mayhem and the damage done to our 
economy by this bill's regulations.  Every small business will 
sue the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Joint Standing Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations, 
there are about 800 regulations in the pipeline.  Those 800 
regulations are on questionable files that have been backlogged 
for years and years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will be surprised to know that some of the regulations 
have been operating for as long as 25 years against the wishes of 
the committee which is supposed to be scrutinizing those 
regulations.  For 25 years those regulations have clogged the 
pipeline and thus the work of the committee.  Successive 
ministers have kept the stonewalling going.  The regulations that 
the committee objects to are kept in place and are fully 
operable.  That is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have criticized this bill enough.  Let me now discuss some of 
the suggestions for the government if it is listening. There are 
only three members here in the House who are listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will call them proposed amendments.   Broad delegation to 
cabinet to make regulations to define what transactions must be 
reported or who must report should be restricted.  There should 
be precision in the legislation.  The term, for example, 
“suspicious transaction” should be clearly defined, otherwise 
properties will be seized, like in the case of the flawed gun 
control legislation under Bill C-68.  Broad powers of customs 
officers to search anyone or open mail should be limited and 
carefully crafted so that legitimate citizens do not suffer. 
Privacy and freedom of citizens should be respected.  There 
should be safeguards in place to curtail hassling of persons by 
customs officers while lawfully crossing the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witnesses before the committees must be representative of a 
cross-section.  Regional and provincial police authorities, 
businessmen, federal and provincial government officials, all 
should be invited so that the committee can hear their concerns 
and ensure that the bill is crafted very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Law enforcement agencies should be prepared and equipped to deal 
with sophisticated activities of organized crime.  The government 
does not put its money where its mouth is.  We need to invest in 
the facilities and the tools given to law enforcement agencies so 
that they can effectively control crime in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hard positions, intransigence and thoughtlessness have no place 
in our deliberations when talking about this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must arrive at the best possible solution to this complex 
problem.  Therefore, all parties must co-operate in the committee 
work.  The committee work should not be like other committee 
work, which is a sham and so partisan that everyone looks through 
the lens of politics rather than the lens of issues. Sometimes 
the actual issue is lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember once, when I was on the immigration and citizenship 
committee, we introduced a motion to study fraud and criminal 
activities under the Immigration Act for illegitimate immigrants 
coming to this country, but the Liberal members refused the 
motion.  Even when we want to discuss the future business of the 
committee, the discussion is based on partisan lines.  In 
committees, when we need a minister to appear to answer some of 
the opposition members' questions, the motions are often 
declined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge government members and all members of the House to work 
seriously at the committee on this serious legislation and come 
up with a constructive solution that will be the best solution to 
deal with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another suggestion I have is to keep regulations to a minimum 
because businesses and financial institutions have to deal with 
so many regulations that they can cause serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we want to support the bill in principle but the 
contents and details need to be worked out at committee.  We 
agree with the spirit of the bill but it should be workable.  It 
should offer effective tools to our law enforcement agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should take fair warning that we want to see 
specifics during the committee hearings.  The official opposition 
wants to know exactly what is being done with the bill and what 
the specifics are in the bill.  As it is written, it is very 
vague.  The terms are unclear and will not help to contain the 
serious money laundering situation. They will also not help the 
undermining of our economy.  The black market, which is another 
byproduct of money laundering, affects our economy very seriously 
and puts extra onus on law-abiding citizens who pay taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not define the bill very clearly, we will have the same 
old story, the catch-22.  If we look at the courts, lawsuits will 
follow, businesses will be hurt and small businesses, which 
create jobs in the country, will suffer.  Jobs are not created by 
contributions and grants.  Jobs are created by small businesses 
and we should support them by making sure we have clear 
legislation that will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have not done that so far with this bill and they 
should have done that.  Hopefully they will listen to the 
witnesses who came before the committee and accept the amendments 
that I just put forward which Canadians want us to make in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a nutshell, I ask the government and all members of the House 
to support the intent of the bill.  However, we need to look at 
the substance of the bill, which is not clear at the moment.  I 
am sure at committee, with the hard work and diligence of all 
party members, we will be able to produce effective legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak at second reading of 
Bill C-22, which is, as hon. members are aware, intended to 
remedy the flaws in the present legislation as far as money 
laundering is concerned, which is the common term for laundering 
the proceeds of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that, every year, up to $17 billion from the 
proceeds of crime are laundered in Canada alone, most of that 
amount coming from the drug trade, heroin, cocaine, cannabis and 
hashish in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that, out of that $17 billion from the proceeds 
of crime that are laundered in Canada alone, the bulk of it, 
some $10 billion, is connected to the traffic in illegal drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a major problem.  Internationally, according to federal 
government figures, the total proceeds of crime that are 
laundered are in the order of $500 billion U.S., a considerable 
sum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since our arrival in the House of Commons, we in the Bloc 
Quebecois have been calling for money laundering to be 
considered a violent crime and to be treated as such by judges 
hearing money laundering cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that the government listened to us—a first really for 
the Bloc Quebecois since we got here—because, when the Criminal 
Code was recently amended, the government paid heed and decided 
that money laundering would now be considered a violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word “violent” is not used lightly. As I mentioned, in 
Canada, the laundering of proceeds of crime is a $17 billion 
business, including $10 billion from drug trafficking. There are 
human tragedies behind these figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, every year, thousands of children in Canada become 
addicted to so-called hard drugs. Perhaps we should stop making a 
distinction between hard and soft drugs. 
For example, while, 100 years ago, cannabis was considered a 
soft drug, it now has an hallucinogenic content 7 to 30 times 
greater than the cannabis that was being sold in the 1970s. 
Therefore, we can no longer talk about a soft drug. All drugs 
are becoming hard drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Associated with the laundering of proceeds of crime are human 
tragedies, particularly in the case of illicit drugs. Thousands 
of children become addicted to these hard drugs, with all the 
social costs that this situation might generate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every week there are tragedies, such as killings between biker 
gangs for control over criminal activities, including the drug 
market. In the end, the laundered money is the product of these 
tragedies, these wars between biker gangs, which often claim 
innocent lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must never forget or lose sight of the fact that, in addition 
to the thousands of children who become addicted to hard drugs 
every year, there was also an 11-year old boy who died in 
Montreal in 1995 because a bomb exploded right beside him as a 
result of this war between biker gangs to control the drug 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Associated with money laundering are also murders. In 1994 
alone, no fewer than 79 murders were committed in Quebec alone 
to gain control over the drug trade.  Ultimately, the proceeds 
of such crime turn up as laundered money.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 89 attempted murders, 129 cases of arson, and 82 
attempted bombings.  In 1998, there were 450 acts of violence 
related to control of the drug trade.  Such are the social and 
economic ramifications of this laundered money.  Just to help 
children who have turned to hard drugs because of criminals get 
off them is costing Canada a minimum of between $4 billion and 
$7 billion annually.  This is quite a sum of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering money laundering a violent crime and improving the 
existing legislation concerning the laundering of proceeds of 
crime is a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, without blushing, the fact that money 
laundering is now considered a violent crime is the product of 
the work of several members of the various political parties in 
the House, but particularly those of the Bloc Quebecois, who 
worked relentlessly to have this included in the Criminal Code, 
with everything that resulted from that in terms of toughening 
our laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting into the provisions of this bill, I would like to 
make an important comment. Justice in this country has always 
been one of the Bloc Quebecois' main concerns. Our party has 
always wanted to see justice done. It has always wanted justice 
to be effective and to stop the real criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from money laundering, we have devoted our attention to at 
least six other issues. 
That has allowed us to progress in this parliament, with the 
measures that were announced both recently and earlier. They are 
the product of the work members of the Bloc Quebecois have done 
in the area of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take for example the removal of the $1,000 bill from 
circulation. Our colleague from Charlesbourg went on a crusade 
to have those Canadian bills taken out of circulation. Why was 
that so important? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, Canada is the only country to have such high 
denominations. When one looks at the United States or Europe—and 
it has been demonstrated around the world—that having $1,000 
bills in Canada facilitates criminal transactions. It also 
facilitates money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to better illustrate the crucial need for the 
elimination of the $1,000 bill, something the Bloc Quebecois has 
worked to convince the government on, let me give the following 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A street sale of 20 kilos of cocaine generates profits of 
between $2 million and $4 million, depending on its purity.  How 
much does a mix of bills of $10, $20, $50 or $100 denominations 
weigh?  The small denominations weigh 120 kilos.  Imagine the 
handling involved for the criminals doing the laundering, who 
collect the proceeds of crime, of the sale of the 20 kilos of 
cocaine, how much easier it would be for them to carry higher 
denominations such as $1,000 bills and to launder them.  It 
would be a lot easier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they just use $1,000 bills, if they have them to convert $5, 
$10 or $100 bills, they have to handle only two kilos worth of 
bills.  They start off with 120 kilos of bills of small 
denominations and, with $1,000 bills, they cut the weight of the 
proceeds of crime to two kilos.  It is a lot easier to go around 
with a two kilo bag of money from the sale of cocaine, heroin or 
some other illicit drug than to have to handle $5, $10, $20 or 
$100 bills.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We worked very hard with law enforcement authorities to convince 
this government that the $1,000 denomination needed to be 
withdrawn.  The Secretary of State for International Financial 
Institutions recently announced that he would soon be 
withdrawing the $1,000 bill from circulation.  That is good 
news, and I would again like to congratulate my colleague from 
Charlesbourg for his considerable efforts in this connection, 
along with my leader, the hon. member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, 
and all of the Bloc Quebecois.  They have fought long and hard 
to get this measure implemented, in order to have the $1,000 
bill taken out of circulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any measure—and we can never say this too often—that can hinder 
organized crime is a welcome one. Any improvement to the 
Criminal Code, like the other measures created to make the 
police forces' work easier, is a welcome one, if the objective 
is to fight more effectively against organized crime and to make 
it harder and harder for them to operate in Canada and 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois have addressed one other important 
matter, on which we have also taken action: pawnbroking. 
My colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve has done an admirable job 
in this connection to ensure compliance with municipal bylaws 
concerning record keeping by pawnshops.  Such compliance 
prevents these businesses from becoming a means of laundering 
money, the proceeds of crime, or other crime related property. 
This represents a considerable victory for the Bloc Quebecois, 
and this action again arose out of a concern for greater justice 
and for making it easier for law enforcement officers to collar 
real criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efforts by the Bloc Quebecois member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve have led to tighter controls on pawnbroking 
establishments. 
Following these efforts, 70 pawnshops closed in Montreal. These 
businesses did not comply with municipal bylaws and they 
bordered on being illegal. These 70 pawnshops were probably used 
to launder money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth issue that we in the Bloc Quebecois tackled because 
we care about justice, which is also reflected in Bill C-22—and we 
will get back to this a little later—is the fight against 
organized crime. A few months ago, the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm, who is here today, tabled a motion in the 
House to establish a justice subcommittee to find ways to fight 
organized crime more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very pleased to see that, through the work of the hon. 
member for Berthier—Montcalm and all members of the Bloc 
Quebecois, we were able to convince not only the government but 
all the parties in this House of the need to set up such a 
committee. Incidentally, the subcommittee will begin its work 
next week to report back in the fall, with a series of 
recommendations on how to increase the effectiveness of our 
fight against organized crime. These measures will not only 
allow us to catch petty criminals, but also the leaders, for 
crimes that they commit or that they ask others to commit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the work of that committee will be successful, because it 
is in everyone's interest. I do hope that the consensus achieved 
by the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm and the Bloc Quebecois 
is a guarantee that we will get recommendations that will take 
us one step further in the fight against crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth issue concerns the increase in the RCMP budgets, 
particularly as regards the fight against drug traffickers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something that we have often talked about here. Recently, 
under special circumstances which you know, I had the 
opportunity to express to you the terror experienced by farm 
families not only in my riding, but throughout Quebec and 
Canada, particularly in southeastern Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That feeling of terror sets in every year as criminals 
confiscate certain plots of farmland in May, at the beginning of 
the farming season, to prick out cannabis seedlings and let them 
grow until late fall. During that period, not only thousands of 
farm families throughout Canada live in terror, but they can no 
longer enjoy their property. These farmers receive death 
threats. They are told their children could be harmed. They are 
told they themselves could be physically harmed should they 
venture too close to the cannabis planted by these criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the opportunity to discuss that. 
From the example we saw in the Montérégie region, particularly 
in Saint-Hyacinthe, we, in the Bloc Quebecois, had the 
opportunity to demand that the government increase the budgets 
of police forces and give them the tools they need to do their 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was ridiculous. Since 1994, the Minister of Finance, who 
prides himself on being a good manager, had reduced the RCMP 
budget to fight money laundering and drug trafficking by 12% or 
15%, depending on the item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we were witnessing exponential growth in organized crime 
activity, the Minister of Finance, with his usual wisdom—when 
something does not concern him or his shipping companies and his 
profits, I think he is less interested in the common good—had cut 
budgets to fight criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make the point again that Bloc Quebecois members, who 
are concerned about justice and brought pressure to bear, have 
managed to get the RCMP budget increased this year and 
additional resources allocated to the various RCMP detachments 
in order to wage a more effective battle against drug 
traffickers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Bloc Quebecois representations resulted in the 
maintenance of all RCMP detachments in Quebec threatened with 
closure, in many cases because of bureaucratic decisions that 
ignored the fact that an effective fight against organized crime 
must be like a chess game.  If there are gangs of organized 
criminals in one location, there must be a strong police 
presence nearby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been such a presence for several years now.  Trust 
must be established between these police forces, which include 
the RCMP, the Sûreté du Québec and municipal forces, and the 
public, particularly in a case where the law of silence reigns, 
where there is a regime of terror surrounding the activities of 
drug traffickers.  It take time to build up this trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet the federal government threatened to close down many 
detachments in Quebec when what should be done is to increase 
the resources in order to wage a more effective anti-crime 
campaign. It should not be forgotten that it is Ottawa that has 
the means to increase budgets to wage a more effective battle 
against organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, because of the Bloc Quebecois' efforts, budgets were 
increased and RCMP detachments kept open in order to wage the 
battle against organized crime more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One more step remains—increasing resources in the short term—and I 
will have an opportunity to get into this a little later on. 
If there is to be another year this year of “agricultural” 
activity by drug pushers in the fields of Quebec and Ontario, 
and it takes two or three years before any action occurs, this 
means two or three years more of a reign of terror threatening 
whole families, with the billions these criminals pocket from 
their illicit activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another productive effort by the Bloc Quebecois in its concern 
for improving justice and the means available to the government 
and to justice to fight organized crime involved the requirement 
to disclose any dubious transaction involving $10,000 or more 
and increasing the number of institutions obliged to report such 
transactions or any other dubious transaction. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its 1997 election platform, the Bloc Quebecois expressed its 
concern at identifying all dubious transactions and ensuring 
that all institutions and individuals suspected of handling 
dirty money be obliged, in case of doubt about the amount of a 
transaction, to report such a transaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law was distinctly lacking in this regard.  Under it, an 
impressive number of financial institutions were and still are 
not obliged to report dubious transactions of $10,000 or more or 
any other transaction.  They do so on a voluntary basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far back as 1997, we were calling for this declaration to be 
made mandatory, for there to be a ceiling above which all 
dubious transactions of sizeable amounts, say $10,000, would 
have to be reported, along with any other suspicious 
transactions or transactions by suspicious individuals.  We 
called for the scope of this legislation to be expanded to other 
institutions, bodies or individuals liable to be dealing with 
such suspicious amounts or transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased to see that, with Bill C-22, the government has 
finally grasped what the Bloc Quebecois has been calling for 
since 1997, out of concern for justice and effectiveness of 
police and customs operations to nab criminals.  The government 
has finally understood that it was in the common interest, the 
national interest and the interest of Quebecers and Canadians, 
to implement these recommendations by the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, Bill C-22 does what the Bloc Quebecois had proposed. 
This was essentially what had to be done, for the present at 
least.  There are some questions, but we are only at second 
reading.  Other steps are yet to come, including consideration 
by a committee and report stage.  We will have some questions to 
ask, but overall what we find in this bill is satisfactory to us 
in principle.  It is also satisfactory in its application, with 
a few minor reservations I shall go into later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the bill makes it mandatory to report suspicious 
transactions, at a level that has been set at $10,000 or more, 
but also any other transaction where there are grounds for 
suspicion about the origin of the funds, in other words 
transactions which might involve the proceeds of crime, whether 
drug trafficking or any other criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also broadens the scope of existing legal provisions. 
Again, this responds to our repeated representations, since 
1997, regarding certain flaws in the provisions dealing with 
money laundering. The bill specifies that this reporting, which 
is now compulsory in the case of suspicious transactions, has 
been broadened to include all regulated financial institutions, 
casinos, businesses involved in foreign exchange dealings, 
persons engaged in the business of dealing in securities, 
insurance companies and persons acting as financial 
intermediaries, such as lawyers and accountants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel this is an improvement. As I said, we will have 
questions for the government, officials and numerous witnesses 
who will soon appear before the Standing Committee on Finance, 
but, on the face of it, the Bloc Quebecois is pleased with this 
measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also increases the penalties for illicit or criminal 
activities, namely the laundering of proceeds of crime. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, since money laundering is now recognized 
as a violent crime, these penalties are harsher than they used 
to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second improvement found in Bill C-22 is the series of 
provisions dealing with transborder operations, such as imports 
or exports of currencies or instruments, such as travellers 
cheques, and any illegal trafficking of these currencies or 
instruments. The provisions have been strengthened precisely to 
catch the real criminals who engage in this type of illicit 
trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the bill increases the powers of customs officers 
to search people and vehicles.  In this regard, we have certain 
reservations but, overall, we agree with the principle that when 
there is serious and reasonable suspicion—and customs officers 
are well trained—with respect to the trafficking of such currency 
or the failure to report such currency or monetary instruments—it 
would be normal—let us be honest—to check whether or not such 
instruments should be seized, the traffickers pursued and the 
real criminals required to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also provisions for co-operation with foreign 
countries.  Too often, discussions about globalization ignore 
the fact that it is not just about trade and legal matters in 
the noblest sense.  One example given is international tribunals 
trying war criminals. 
Globalization also has to do with very close co-operation between 
governments to catch criminals. We must never forget this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, there was a conference in Russia on the evolution of 
organized crime.  We must remember that organized crime is 
becoming increasingly international.  I repeat what I said 
earlier:  every year, world wide, approximately $500 billion 
U.S. is laundered—and money launderers do not file tax returns. 
This is the amount laundered internationally.  Part of this 
money falls into the hands of organized crime in Quebec and in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a lot of money and it leads to some tragedies, 
as I mentioned earlier.  Co-operation between governments is 
essential.  Such co-operation, which was also called for in a 
recent international conference on the subject, is made possible 
by Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Bill C-22 provides another innovation.  Following 
consideration in committee and questioning of officials and 
witnesses appearing before the committee, we will be more 
certain of our final analysis.  At first glance, though, the 
third major clause of this bill, which provides for the creation 
of a financial transactions and reports analysis centre of 
Canada, is a step in the right direction in that, at the moment, 
information on criminals, money laundering and interprovincial 
transactions is spread here and there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All efforts to centralize this information or to obtain the 
co-operation of other police forces or between the investigators 
of the financial transactions and reports analysis centre of 
Canada, the various police forces and even Revenue Canada are 
welcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future, with this centre, all information on suspicious 
transactions and those that may lend themselves to money 
laundering will be centralized.  There will also be information 
on individuals or institutions found guilty of failing to make 
the mandatory disclosure in the case of a suspicious transaction 
or of having been accused of money laundering themselves. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to note the bill provides that information 
disclosed by the centre—very confidential information will pass 
through it—will be carefully controlled and governed by the 
Privacy Act.  This is good news, but we would like to question 
the government and the officials who worked on the bill, and 
hear them as witnesses before the Standing Committee on Finance 
to be sure this information will not be used and cast to the 
four winds or, more importantly, sold for financial gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very sensitive information will pass through the centre.  We 
want to make sure the requirements of the Privacy Act are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, we do have certain reservations about the bill 
nevertheless.  The first of these relates to increasing the 
powers of customs officers.  This may be beneficial.  Often, 
customs officers may have their hands tied by various 
constraints that make it impossible, even if they are 
suspicious, to carry out the necessary search in order to collar 
real criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned, at the same time, about people's rights and 
freedoms.  This will be one of our concerns during the next 
stages of examination of this bill.  We would like tight 
controls over the work of the customs officers, with strict 
regulations, so that there will not be any abuse relating to 
searches of individuals or their vehicles.  Customs officers 
must have a framework of operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a question arises, particularly in the light of clause 
73 of Bill C-22: the extraordinary power assigned to the Governor 
in Council, and the minister responsible, for making any 
regulations relating to the legal provisions of Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have misgivings about this.  To give so much power to a group 
of individuals, to the Governor in Council or the minister 
responsible, on matters that might become criminal in nature, 
without involving parliament, has always meant to us that the 
powers of the departmental employees and the minister are 
extraordinary.  This has also come up in other bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to know if it would be possible to ensure that the House 
has a say in the process, to make sure that the powers are not 
concentrated in the hands of a few individuals when it comes to 
such important issues, particularly as regards the regulations 
that have yet to be drafted to implement Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another concern we will raise when a more in-depth review 
of the bill is conducted by the Standing Committee on Finance 
and at the various legislative stages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a third concern regarding this bill, but also the whole 
issue of organized crime. Next week, the justice subcommittee 
will be meeting. It enjoys the unanimous support of the House of 
Commons, with regard to what still needs to be done to give 
adequate tools to police forces and what changes must be made to 
the Criminal Code to fight organized crime more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, I went through a harrowing experience, not just me, 
but several other people too. Some people have been going 
through that experience for years. I am referring to the reign 
of terror, the law of silence imposed by organized crime on 
people whose lands they invade. These people cannot say 
anything, otherwise they are beaten or receive death threats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to send a message to the government. Will this 
subcommittee get the government's co-operation so that, by early 
fall, we can have measures that will truly help us fight 
organized crime effectively? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, was the government's support for the establishment of 
that subcommittee just a smoke and mirrors operation, or will it 
truly help the subcommittee to propose a series of 
recommendations with, of course, the input of opposition 
members, including Bloc Quebecois members, to fight organized 
crime more effectively? The hopes of several thousand people 
rest on that subcommittee. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not say that as a figure of speech. I have met people who 
have been living in terror for the last three, four or five 
years because of threats from organized crime. They place a lot 
of hope on the work of the justice subcommittee, on measures to 
fight organized crime more effectively and to protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also place a lot of hope on short term measures. I will put 
particular emphasis on the illegal production of cannabis on 
Quebec and Ontario farms, for obvious reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the government that, in the short term, before the 
justice subcommittee can make its recommendations in the fall, 
it is imperative that we take a series of measures immediately, 
this year, to fight the illegal production of cannabis, with the 
farming season that will start at the beginning of May and with 
the pricking out of cannabis seedlings in our farmers' fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not take action this year, we are giving one more 
farming season, one more year of illegal profits to criminal 
organizations in Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and 
throughout Canada, but particularly in eastern Canada and in the 
westernmost part of Canada. It is one more year of extraordinary 
profits, or proceeds of crime, that we are giving them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also one more year to convince even more school 
children—and the Standing Committee on Finance will have an 
opportunity to hear from people involved in the schools who see 
what is happening—to sell them not just cannabis or hashish, but 
also heroin and cocaine.  They will have another year in which 
to damage the future of thousands of children in Quebec and in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If action is not taken immediately in April or May to let 
organized crime know that things will no longer be the same and 
that, this year, measures will be implemented on the strength of 
increased budgets, for the RCMP among others, I think that a 
good opportunity will have been missed to show that we are 
really serious about fighting organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, starting with my riding of Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, there 
are thousands of farm families and owners of woodlots who are 
waiting for short term action from the government and who are 
probably glad that money laundering provisions are being 
tightened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more we cut the ground out from under organized crime and 
money laundering, which is the key to the long term 
profitability of criminal activity, the less it will tend to 
increase its annual production or squatting on land in order to 
grow cannabis, exchange it for cocaine or heroin on the American 
market and so forth, and profit from the proceeds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are also happy that the continued pressure brought to 
bear by the Bloc Quebecois has meant an increase in budgets to 
fight organized crime.  That is undeniable. But they are waiting 
for short term action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring this message to the government. 
We must see improvements before the start of the next criminal 
cannabis production season.  We must see improvements.  After 
breaking the law of silence, and I am not the only one to have 
done so, there were others after me in my riding and throughout 
Canada, we have to improve the situation.  Organized terrorism 
in the fields of Quebec and Canada must stop this year or at 
least there must be a marked improvement, because it cannot 
continue.  I have met farm families who are victims of organized 
crime, and this has to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government hears us as members, and I think that 
opposition members are very aware of this issue, it must 
announce, this year, in the coming weeks, that it is taking 
steps to reduce criminal activities, beginning with those of the 
drug dealers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to analyze this bill considering it a step in 
the right direction but recognizing that there are many things 
yet to be done so that the freedom we were proud of in Quebec 
and in Canada is not a false freedom, but rather true freedom 
because we will deprive organized crime of the power to threaten 
the freedom of the majority of the people.

laundering, is a very important piece of legislation in many 
ways, but it could be better.  We have heard some of the speeches 
from the minister and others who talked about the wonderful and 
positive things it might do, and I believe that it will have a 
positive effect on our economy.  However, I am concerned about a 
number of issues with respect to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP supports this bill in principle.  It is obviously 
important to support the introduction of legislation that curbs 
illegal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a problem because of the wariness concerning 
the lack of certainty and clarity in some parts of the bill. 
Before I address that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with 
you some of the concerns I have with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I am concerned that this is going to be a piece of feel 
good legislation.  The Liberals in the past have introduced 
legislation which I classify as feel good legislation. I hope 
this bill will not fall under same definition.  What I mean by 
that is that the Liberal government tends to address very serious 
criminal activity in this country with a piece of legislation 
that makes Canadians feel good that something is happening to 
protect them, but in fact nothing ever happens to protect them. 
There is a law on the books, but there are never any resources to 
back up the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would use two examples.  There was cigarette smuggling in 
Quebec and Ontario a few years ago when the Liberals were cutting 
everything, including customs agents, police and security forces. 
A certain group of individuals started smuggling cigarettes into 
Canada, selling them in Quebec and Ontario.  Rather than pass 
legislation which supported the customs and duty officers and our 
police forces in nabbing the people who were smuggling, they 
introduced a piece of feel good legislation.  They made people 
feel good because they were doing something by passing a law 
which took federal tax off cigarettes in Quebec and Ontario, but 
that cost taxpayers $2 billion a year.  Guess what.  The 
smugglers went from smuggling tobacco to smuggling guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than dealing with legislation like the Firearms Act, they 
should have committed resources to nab the gun smugglers.  What 
did the government do?  It passed a gun registration law, which 
has nothing to do with protecting Canadians, but it made them 
feel good that the Liberal government was actually doing 
something to protect Canadians.  In fact, it was not doing a 
darned thing.  It was encouraging smugglers to continue to 
smuggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have these two pieces of feel good legislation which the 
Liberals passed.  One was on tobacco taxes, which cost us $2 
billion a year, and which will probably add tens of thousands to 
the debt because more people will be smoking in Ontario and 
Quebec because of the low price of tobacco.  Then they passed the 
Firearms Act, which forces criminals to register their guns.  As 
we know, criminals do not register their guns.  Nothing has 
changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have Bill C-22, which is supposed to stop money 
laundering in Canada. 
If anybody believes this is going to be the epitome of 
legislation, they are dreaming in technicolour.  I hope it has 
some effect, but if the bill is not backed up with some cash and 
resources to provide our country with more security, more police 
officers and more customs agents to look into these issues, then 
the law will be useless.  It is a feel good piece of legislation. 
The government is trying to make Canadians feel good about it, 
but nothing will ever happen.  The same old story continues, the 
money laundering, smuggling and all the criminal activities 
committed by people who want to use handguns and other kinds of 
illegal weapons.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The potential in this bill is very great, but I want to raise a 
couple of issues which I feel have to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I am hoping the Liberals will put some money where their 
mouths are for a change when it comes to a piece of legislation 
which is in principle very good, but will not work unless there 
are some resources put behind it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem we see with the legislation is the potential for 
charter violations.  The guarantees of reasonable search and 
seizure in the charter are at risk in our view with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Lawyers' Association argues that the standard of 
suspicion outlined “fails to meet even the first and fundamental 
requirements of reasonable grounds”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation may create an irreconcilable conflict for 
professionals, such as lawyers, who remain subject to certain 
codes of conduct that prohibit them from disclosing information. 
It must also provide a mechanism to absolve an individual from 
the potential liability that may result from disclosing this 
particular confidential information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third issue in terms of our concerns is a possible pressure 
on consumers.  As the consumer affairs critic, I am very 
concerned about every piece of legislation that comes before the 
House which would cost consumers more money than it would benefit 
them.  We feel that the reporting regime set up to track and 
communicate suspicious transactions from criminal activity have 
at least two financial repercussions for consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is a cost to be borne by the taxpayers for the 
establishment and maintenance of the financial tracking system 
that will be set up.  Second, in having to establish compliance 
mechanisms, there is a concern that the cost for setting up 
reporting mechanisms for financial institutions will be borne by 
these institutions' customers.  That means that the consumer 
stands to pay the fare one more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth issue of concern for us is the question about the 
system's effectiveness.  There remains a series of concerns about 
the planned reporting scheme's effectiveness.  There is a warning 
that the new regime has the potential to create a bureaucratic 
behemoth and the chance that organized crime could short-circuit 
such a system through a series of shadowy sophisticated 
transactions.  Money might be better spent by granting law 
enforcement investigative bodies additional resources to detect 
and prosecute money laundering offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth concern we have is that the bill does not address 
technology based crimes.  Technology based crimes include credit 
card and debit card fraud, telephone fraud, stock market 
manipulation, computer break-ins and so on.  These are very 
important because they are on the rise.  More and more people are 
using the Internet.  There is a huge growth in the debit card 
business.  More and more consumers are using cards for instant 
transactions.  A lot of personal information is on the Internet 
and is in the hands of tens of thousands of businesses in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly organized crime syndicates are using technological 
and digital means of communication, such as encryption and 
scanning devices, potentially circumventing the provisions of the 
bill.  People can buy a scanner for $200.  Things can be scanned 
quickly, and then that information is put into a computer, which 
puts it all at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more important is that money laundering is taking place 
in many cash businesses, not just with card transactions.  I 
will not mention any particulars, but take for example a cash 
business such as a fast food franchise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to know someone from New Jersey who owns a fast food 
franchise.  I asked him why he had it, because he was a very 
wealthy person.  He said he had a couple of other businesses, but 
when his five year old daughter was asked what her father did he 
did not want her to have to answer something that was really not 
important or perhaps on the verge of not being legal.  So he 
bought a fast food franchise and his daughter can now say that 
her dad owns a fast food franchise that sells ice cream.  It is 
actually quite nice. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, a cash business like that opens all kinds of 
opportunities for people to launder money.  I am not suggesting 
that person is doing that, but it is one way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way to launder money would be for a family to buy five 
or six business class airline tickets to Europe, decide not to 
use them, cash them in and the money goes to the money launderer 
who gave them the money to buy the tickets in the first place, 
and then they split.  I am not sure if that situation would be 
covered by the bill, but there are thousands of ways to launder 
money, more ways than I could recall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that we have to toughen up the bill and put some 
resources behind it to assist the lawkeepers and the peacekeepers 
in ensuring that the laundering issue is addressed in a tighter 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clearer and more precise definition of what constitutes a 
suspicious transaction is needed.  The subjective nature of the 
definition could provide an excuse for compliance failure and, as 
a result, many suspicious transactions may not be reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the use of a vague definition could result in 
institutions over-reporting for fear of involuntary 
non-compliance, thus creating unnecessary and unwarranted 
scrutiny of innocent individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation must clearly address the issue of the 
threat to the privacy of Canadians, specifically the possible 
disclosure of information to Revenue Canada, should it involve a 
taxation matter.  Strict guidelines must be established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must also address the possible violation of the guarantees of 
reasonable search and seizure under the charter or rights and 
freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the issue of tax related offences should be 
addressed.  Tax offences occur when money is transferred to 
offshore tax havens through offshore companies, trusts and bank 
accounts when the purpose is to conceal assets from Revenue 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering, on the other hand, involves the intent to 
conceal criminal profits to make them appear legitimate.  We have 
seen the Royal Bank, the Bank of Montreal, the Bank of Nova 
Scotia and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce account for 80% 
of local banking in the Bahamas.  Both the Royal Bank and the 
Bank of Nova Scotia have been implicated in money laundering 
cases in the Caribbean on more than one occasion.  In one case 
the court ordered the Bank of Nova Scotia to pay $2,500,000 in 
fines, noting that laws should not be used as a blanket device to 
encourage or foster criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am really worried about is that small aircraft and boats 
can land in our country and in the U.S. at tiny airports or 
marinas and they rely on the honour system when it comes to 
customs declarations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government also has plans to implement signing 
accords with major shippers that will allow them to cross into 
the U.S. without stopping.  Companies would provide computerized 
updates to Revenue Canada of their shipments and custom agents 
would make spot checks at company locations rather than at the 
border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has cut in half the customs enforcement 
budget, and it is still cutting.  I am concerned that if this is 
not stopped and reversed, then this feel good legislation will be 
just that; it will not solve the problem, but through the public 
relations offices of the Liberal Party of Canada and the federal 
government they will try to persuade people that they should feel 
good because the legislation is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard that money laundering is the world's third largest 
industry by value.  Between $5 billion U.S. and $17 billion U.S. 
is laundered in Canada each year.  Money laundering extends far 
beyond hiding profits from narcotics.  It includes trade fraud, 
tax evasion, organized crime in arms smuggling, and bank and 
medical insurance fraud.  I would hope the government would 
provide the appropriate resources to address and look into these 
issues further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>American tax collectors estimate that they lose about $9 billion 
yearly to tax evasion.  This comes from a book by Diane Francis 
entitled <I>Contrepreneurs</I>.  At a rate of 1:10, because 
Canada's population is about 10% of the population of the United 
States, we stand to lose at least $1 billion.  That sounds like a 
lot of money over a period of a year. 
When we look at it in terms of how the Liberals have helped their 
friends evade taxes, it is a drop in the bucket.  Some members 
may be wondering what I mean by that.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members will recall, the Liberals allowed the Bronfmans to 
transfer billions of dollars in trust accounts to the U.S. 
without paying taxes on the accounts.  This created a loss to the 
Canadian taxpayers of almost a billion dollars.  I think it was 
$750 million but we would not know because we were not told the 
value of the tax evasion, which was supported by the Liberals and 
the member for Wascana who also supported it front and centre. 
The Liberals allowed the Bronfmans to take this trust fund, which 
was set up in trust for the Bronfman family to use in Canada, and 
move it outside the country, thereby avoiding taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians view this kind of legal money laundering or 
legal tax evasion, which the Liberals support, as something that 
is a very big concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Wascana has some suggestions we would 
appreciate his participation in the debate.  I am sure he would 
be able to provide more information on that than I can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other concern I and the NDP have is that we have a money 
laundering bill that will be tough and that will addresses the 
issue of criminal activity and proceeds from criminal activity. 
Obviously if the government had the wherewithal it would try to 
shut down all the criminal activity in this country.  That would 
be an honourable objective but I am not sure how the government 
views that.  It has not really undertaken, in my view, a 
comprehensive attempt to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the RCMP, which has really been choked for funds, 
has been strangled in terms of trying to hire and train enough 
officers in the country to handle just the bare, basic bones of 
police provisioning.  The Liberals have choked back funding to 
the RCMP over the years to the point where in Saskatchewan alone 
we are 200 RCMP officers short.  Over the last three years the 
Liberals have not provided enough funding to the Regina RCMP 
training depot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to say that in this budget the Liberals did provide 
more money to the RCMP training academy, and I thank the member 
for Wascana for that effort.  I think it is a very important 
initiative but it is too little too late.  We are still waiting 
for the weather station that the Liberals promised in the last 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale:</B>  It is there. It is up and running 
in Bethune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  It is up and running in Bethune? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale:</B>  It has been there for two years 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  It was in my riding and he never 
invited me.  He should have invited me to the opening.  He has to 
be more co-operative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to see that is happening.  One of his promises has 
been completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get back to the RCMP because it is a very important 
institution in my riding.  I know the RCMP were very concerned 
about the lack of funding and the lack of money involved in 
recruiting and training new officers.  Hopefully the government 
opposite will provide sufficient funding for these individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am at it, I want to say that I am very concerned about 
the privatization of the RCMP depot.  Many of the workers there 
have worked hard to support the RCMP and to make sure that it is 
one of the best policing institutions in the world, but they are 
not treated as fairly as we think they should be treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point is that if the bill can provide some sort of 
controls on laundering money from criminal activity, why can the 
government not introduce a bill that will provide a Tobin tax on 
financial transactions that are legal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By unanimous consent, the House of Commons passed a motion, 
which was introduced by my colleague, the NDP member of 
parliament for Regina—Qu'Appelle, that would undertake to 
institute a Tobin tax for Canada and the rest of the world but I 
have not seen any kind of initiative by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wascana is here today and he has done a couple of 
good things in the last while.  He has not done as much as we 
would have liked but he is progressing.  We are training him well 
and we are happy he is finally taking some of our ideas to heart. 
I was wondering why he will not undertake with his colleagues, 
the Minister of Finance and the Secretary of State for 
International Financial Institutions, to initiate the promise in 
the motion that was passed in the House to support a Tobin tax 
which is a financial transaction tax on all the stock market 
transactions.  There are no taxes on those particular 
transactions. 
Most members of parliament in Canada believe there should be a 
tax.  Most elected officials in the world believe there should be 
a tax.  The people who do not believe there should be a tax are 
the people in wealthy corporations and in very wealthy families.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals continue to support that kind of approach, that of 
the very wealthy corporations and very wealthy families in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned whether they will allow more tax evasion by 
wealthy families like the Bronfmans, whether they will allow more 
tax evasion by wealthy individuals and companies on the stock 
market or whether they will undertake to do what Canadians want 
them to do, which is to institute a Tobin tax, a fair tax on 
financial transactions on the stock market and throughout 
exchanges in the world so we can have a very controlled, steady 
and stable system that would not encourage people who get money 
through illegal means, such as money laundering, to use the stock 
market for their particular advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, we support the bill in principle.  It has many more 
positive things to address.  The government needs to put in some 
resources to support the bill to make sure that the law it is 
passing can actually be carried out by our law enforcement 
agencies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to ask the member a question because, unknown to 
the House, he is an expert on laws around the world concerning 
money laundering and has a great deal of background in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the member's opinion, why did the government leave out the 
whole question of tax evasion?  I see the member from 
Saskatchewan across the way.  The minister is in the cabinet and 
I would ask him this question but I cannot because this is not 
question period.  Tax evasion is not addressed in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internal Revenue Service in the United States estimated that 
the tax collector loses about $9 billion a year in the U.S. 
because of tax evasion.  Nine billion dollars a year is a lot of 
cash.  If one were to extrapolate that into Canadian dollars, 
where we have one-tenth the population, it would mean, if we were 
similar to the United States in terms of our loss of money 
through tax evasion, that we would lose about $1 billion a year. 
That is a lot of cash.  It could pay for a lot of health care and 
a lot of educational systems that we all need.  It could also 
address some of the farm crisis.  It could address all kinds of 
major problems that we have in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his very studied and learned opinion, why does the member for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre think this is not part of the bill. 
Is it too complicated or just not a high enough priority?  Why 
would this not be part of the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also appreciated his comments on the Tobin tax.  If we can 
follow the flow of money in terms of criminal activity—and I 
remind the House again that the third largest industry in the 
world is criminal activity in terms of the flow of illegal money, 
dirty money—by setting up rules and regulations in the OECD and 
the G-8, then it puzzles me as to why we cannot do the same thing 
on currency speculation in terms of what is called the Tobin tax. 
I maintain that if there is a will, there is a way as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyway, I will go back to the tax evasion issue and ask why it 
is not included in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, for that very important 
question because I actually never addressed that in my remarks. I 
ran out of time but I had many more things to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax evasion is not addressed in this legislation because it is a 
possibility that many Canadians have a lot of flexibility in 
terms of accessing sophisticated offshore companies.  Trusts and 
bank accounts can be set up in places like the Bahamas, which I 
mentioned earlier.  Canada's chartered banks all offer banking 
services and tax savings, with most services offered in the 
Caribbean and Switzerland.  Money that is in an offshore tax 
haven is not only out of reach of Revenue Canada, it is also safe 
from creditors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remarks earlier I said that the reason it is not in the 
bill, I suspect, is because the government's very wealthy friends 
do not want it to be in the legislation.  One example of why I 
say that is the Bronfmans.  They had a trust account in this 
country which was set up under legislation created by the 
Liberals in the 1970s on a 20 year term.  It was extended by the 
Conservative government for a number of extra years. 
When the term was coming to an end and they had to actually pay 
taxes on the trust account, the Liberals encouraged and gave 
permission for the Bronfmans to transfer this multibillion dollar 
trust account outside of the country, thereby avoiding taxes in 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that we lose about $1 billion a year on tax 
evasion.  That one transaction that the Liberals undertook, 
encouraged and allowed the Bronfmans to undertake, cost us about 
$750 million in lost taxes on one transaction.  I think the 
estimate of $1 billion is really out to lunch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that the reason tax evasion is not in the 
bill is because the wealthy friends of the Liberals, the wealthy 
powerful corporations who support the Liberals, do not want it in 
here.  Guess who pays the piper? 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the previous speaker on his recent 
designation as world expert in the area of money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 is of course a very important bill before us today and 
it is long overdue.  In the final analysis it will bring about 
some very necessary and important changes in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Put quite simply, Bill C-22 will make it mandatory for financial 
institutions to report suspicious transactions and will create a 
new federal centre to receive and manage reported information 
with respect to potential criminal activity, both inside and 
outside our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite obvious that this should and is a priority for many 
in the country.  Sadly, the government has waited a significant 
period of time before introducing the legislation, although there 
was an outcry from around the country, particularly within the 
policing sector, asking that something be done to assist them and 
to give them the tools to address this growing problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that this is but part of a larger problem.  That 
larger problem obviously being organized crime, again here in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reflect upon the government's addressing of that, it took a 
motion from the Bloc Quebecois to bring this matter to the 
forefront, based on the fact that one of their own members was 
under threat of violence as a result of his addressing the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular legislation focuses the efforts of the law 
enforcement community and the entire system on addressing the 
problem.  The money that is often shifted between countries and 
financial institutions, investments of that sort without a paper 
trace, is something that opens the door to a significant ability 
to launder money, which is highly criminal and obviously highly 
attractive to criminal organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be more aggressive and more vigilant in addressing 
this problem. I commend the solicitor general for the legislation 
at this time because it does empower law enforcement agents to 
address this.  This centre I do hope will become a focal point 
and will receive the funding necessary to do that good work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Giving law enforcement agents the tools is the belief of the 
Progressive Conservative Party.  I know the member for St. John's 
East, as do all members of our party, do support the idea that 
law enforcement agencies throughout the country, sadly, have not 
been given the resources and the support from the government to 
achieve the very important task that they have before them.  This 
legislation does move in the right direction in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been under heavy criticism in recent years with 
respect to the fact that the United States is feeling more 
vulnerable as a result of our lax internal security measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I am talking about trafficking, it is not only in money 
that we see this occurring.  It is often very much the illicit 
drug trade, firearms, pornography and all those things which 
Canadians want to feel a significant degree of protection from 
and where we should be focusing our efforts to close down our 
borders with respect to that type of material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering, in and of itself, poses to law enforcement 
personnel one of the greatest challenges in the ongoing battle of 
organized crime.  To fight organized crime effectively, law 
enforcement agencies and we as legislators must address those 
challenges posed specifically by current trends in money

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ) </B>moved: 
<A NAME="LINK187">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-276, in 
Clause 1, be amended by adding after line 29 on page 2 the 
following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(2.1) Subsection (1) does not apply in the province of 
Quebec to an enterprise that provides or sells a new service in 
Quebec.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, today we are debating Bill C-276 on 
negative option marketing.  This refers to the fact that, when 
there are new television channels, consumers are charged for 
them, and if they do not wish to receive the new channels, they 
must say so, otherwise they will have to pay for the service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its objective is, in principle, a most praiseworthy one, but we 
have a number of problems with it, which is why we have proposed 
the amendment. 
In Quebec, we have the Consumer Protection Act, which prohibits 
this kind of practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as widespread a practice as some might think. It was 
used mainly when new specialty channels were introduced to 
promote a greater penetration rate. There was some public outcry 
around that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, when we indicate we no longer want to receive these 
channels, the subscription fee is very different from what it 
would be if we wanted the service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When new channels are introduced, for cultural reasons, to help 
French channels achieve greater penetration, it may happen that 
these channels be part of a package. This kind of approach is 
helpful to reduce costs and increase penetration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people have criticized this kind of approach, arguing 
that banks do it, among others, but we must dispel the myth. 
Some people, and I am thinking of a number of Liberal members, 
are saying that certain practices will no longer be allowed with 
this bill, but it is not so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, banks sometimes have a promotion. One can get free 
life insurance or any type of insurance for three months. Anyone 
who signs a loan contract or any other document also gets that 
other service, whatever it is. It is free for three months. The 
initial contract says that charges will start to apply after 
three months unless the company is notified. That is not 
negative option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will not prevent this kind of practice because consent 
was given in the initial contract. Therefore, it must be clearly 
understood that the bill will not solve this kind of problem. 
The negative option marketing cases we have seen were mostly in 
relation to the introduction of new channels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect is that there is still a possible exemption 
procedure, but the decision would be left in the hands of 
political officials instead of the CRTC. The Minister of 
Canadian Heritage will now have the authority to allow licensed 
services to use that practice. Very strong political pressure 
from the minister will be brought to bear on the CRTC, which we 
would like to be much more independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all kinds of reasons, we do not support that and our 
amendment is designed to exempt Quebec. It is not because we 
want Quebec consumers to be protected against that practice 
generally, but because they are already under the Consumer 
Protection Act. We do not want another piece of legislation that 
will introduce different definitions and different recourses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, we have the Consumer Protection Bureau. In Quebec, 
anyone who feels he has been wronged may call on the Consumer 
Protection Bureau. This bill will give powers to the Competition 
Bureau, which is governed by a different act and has a different 
approach. 
The offence leads to different sanctions, whether it is an 
offence against the Quebec act or against this new federal 
legislation, if passed.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be remembered that issues related to contracts, local 
trade and consumer protection are provincial jurisdictions under 
section 92.13 of the constitution. It is under this section that 
Quebec passed its consumer protection act, which prohibits 
negative billing in paragraph 230(<I>a</I>), which reads as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) No merchant, manufacturer or advertiser may, through any 
means, demand any money for a product or service provided or 
sold to a consumer without the latter having asked for it. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the consumer protection act makes it very clear that this 
kind of practice is prohibited. Some people will say yes, but 
this bill applies to federal institutions, banks, 
telecommunications and so on. For those who might say this does 
not apply to federal institutions, I will quote some court 
decisions, such as the one in Attorney General of Quebec v 
Kellogg, which says in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kelloggs are not exempt from the application of restrictions 
on advertising practices because they chose an advertising 
instrument under federal control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual who discloses defamatory material is not 
exonerated under provincial law because the publication 
instrument is under federal control. Moreover, this individual 
could be prohibited from publishing any new material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the Kelloggs are in a similar situation regarding 
these regulations. They cannot justify a behaviour which has 
become illegal by saying that they are using television. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial legislation is not about television but about 
consumers, trade and advertising. We are applying the terms of 
the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the same thing applies in this case. 
The supreme court decided, in Attorney General of Quebec v 
Irwin Toy Limited, that, and I quote in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that television advertising is a vital part 
of the operation of a television broadcast undertaking. The 
advertising services of these undertakings therefore fall within 
exclusive federal legislative jurisdiction. It is well 
established that such jurisdiction extends to the content of 
broadcasting and advertising forms a part of such content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, ss. 248 and 249 of the Consumer Protection Act do not 
purport to apply to television broadcast undertakings. Read 
together with s.252, it is clear that ss. 248 and 249 apply to 
the acts of an advertiser, not tothe acts of a broadcaster. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cable television companies themselves have acknowledged that 
they were under the jurisdiction of Quebec legislation. It is 
precisely for that reason that some companies recently undertook 
to abide by the decision of the Consumer Protection Bureau 
regarding the establishment of new specialised channels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that this new federal legislation will complicate 
measures available to consumers to obtain redress complicate 
determination of what really applies to protect them, especially 
since no one in committee was able to give a definition of new 
service prescribed in the bill. Everyone had his own 
interpretation and a different definition of what a new service 
is. The bill purports to prevent those areas from applying to 
new services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people, including representatives of the Canadian Bar 
Association and others, said “You are going about this in the 
right way to achieve your goal. We already have a Bank Act, a 
Broadcasting Act and a Telecommunications Act. These acts 
already include means to prevent this type of practice and they 
would be much more appropriate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even those who would like to see federal legislation are saying 
“Start by using the existing legislation, do not create new 
legislation that will only complicate the process and the 
capacity to implement it”. It is all very nice to make a show, 
to make believe that we are doing something for Canadian 
consumers, but if, at the end of the day, these people are not 
better protected than they were before, we have not achieved 
much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one last issue that I want to raise because I know that 
time is flying. We are extremely concerned about the 
politicization of the exceptions that could be given to the 
bill. Each of the ministers in his or her own area of 
jurisdiction, be it finance, industry or heritage, will be in a 
position to grant exemptions by virtue of an order in council. 
This means that it would not be an organization like the CRTC, 
independent from the government, that would evaluate this 
anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are not satisfied with the decisions made by the CRTC 
have legal remedy. They can submit their case to the Federal 
Court for example. From now on, the decisions will be political 
and they will or will not include exceptions. We are very 
concerned, especially about the heritage minister, because we 
know that she is very good at politicizing everything. As a 
matter of fact, the situation is the same with the other two 
ministers, because they will both be replaced eventually.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the intention may be laudable, this is not done at the 
right level. As far as Quebec is concerned, we do not think it 
will make it easier to achieve the objective, because consumers 
are already protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to engage in negative option billing in Quebec, a 
notice or an authorization from the Consumer Protection Bureau 
is required. This is hardly ever done, the only exception being 
the introduction of new television channels, which comes under 
the CRTC with a whole different set of objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I dealt with the core of the issue. We will vote against 
this bill for the reasons that I explained, but we do have one 
hope. It may be that the other provinces want the federal 
government to look after their affairs. If the rest of Canada is 
happy to have the federal government look after that, let them 
give up their jurisdiction, but Quebec will not. If the 
amendment to exclude Quebec is adopted and it is recognized that 
Quebec's Consumer Protection Act takes precedence, under those 
circumstances, we might support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were elected to protect Quebec's interests in this place and 
that is what we intend to do. 
We are proposing an amendment and we will see if this 
government, which claims to be very flexible toward Quebec and 
apparently recognized the Quebec society as a distinct society 
in a motion—we are anxious to see the real weight of that 
motion—will go so far as to support the amendment that would 
exclude Quebec from the application of the act, since Quebec 
consumers are already protected.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on the 
amendment proposed by the Bloc to Bill C-276, an act to amend the 
Competition Act.  It is a sad day for consumers in the province 
of Quebec because the member for Témiscamingue, as a member of 
the Bloc Quebecois, has proposed an amendment to exempt Quebec 
residents from the consumer protection measures contained in the 
bill.  It is difficult to imagine why on earth we on this side 
would support such a cold hearted and callous proposal from the 
member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would protect consumers from the deceptive marketing 
practice known as negative option billing which occurs when a 
company forces its customers to decline or opt out of new product 
or service offerings to avoid higher fees.  This practice is a 
perversion of the traditional buyer-seller relationship.  It 
relies on the concept of implied consent: if the buyer does not 
say no or register an objection with the seller or the vendor, he 
or she is deemed to have said yes and to have given consent to 
the purchase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a rather sick way of doing business because it takes 
advantage of consumers from all walks of life whether they are 
young, poor, elderly or people on fixed incomes.  With the 
proposed amendment the Bloc Quebecois would leave millions of 
consumers in the province of Quebec vulnerable to such marketing 
rip-offs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often have trouble following the twisted logic of the Bloc. In 
an attempt to humour our friends across the way, I will try to 
see how their amendment would benefit consumers who reside in 
Quebec or any place else in Canada, for that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look closely at Bill C-276, as amended by the Standing 
Committee on Industry, we see that it has been improved.  I would 
like to take the opportunity to thank and commend members of that 
committee for their hard work.  In a four month period the 
committee heard testimony from 28 witnesses, including consumer 
organizations, industry groups, and officials from the government 
departments of finance, industry and Canadian heritage who 
appeared not once but twice before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee passed a number of amendments to bring Bill C-276 
in line with recent changes to the Competition Act precipitated 
by the passage of what was called Bill C-20. 
Concerns over the viability of certain specialty television 
channels were addressed.  A change was made to deal with the 
evolution of electronic commerce.  Changes were made but the key 
elements of consumer protection have remained in this bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill still applies to federally regulated banks, telephone 
companies and cable companies.  Here we see the irony of the 
Bloc's proposed amendment, the politicization of their proposed 
amendment.  They would give a green light for federally regulated 
banks and others to essentially rip off consumers in the province 
of Quebec by way of negative option marketing.  I am certain the 
Bloc's position has nothing whatsoever to do with their recent 
change of heart when it comes to accepting campaign donations 
from large corporations.  I am sure this is simply a coincidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, perhaps we should refer to what the experts who 
appeared before the committee have said.  At the industry 
committee hearing on December 13, 1999 the head of the Quebec 
based consumer organization Action Réseau, Ms. Nathalie 
St-Pierre, was questioned by the member for Timiskaming. I will 
quote his question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are a watchdog organization involved in consumer protection 
in Quebec.  At the present time, do companies under federal 
jurisdiction and subject to this bill comply voluntarily with the 
[Quebec] Consumer Protection Act? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. St-Pierre in her reply stated “They do not comply with the 
Consumer Protection Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter to the CRTC dated October 8, 1999, Ms. St-Pierre 
exploded the myth that Quebec consumers do not object to negative 
option marketing.  She referred to the 1997 launch of new 
specialty channels by the Quebec based company Vidéotron and I 
quote once again from her letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the channels were launched, Quebec consumer groups, the 
Consumer Protection Bureau and Vidéotron all received numerous 
complaints, particularly about the marketing method used, which 
was negative option billing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Bloc points out, Quebec's Consumer Protection Act 
prohibits negative option marketing.  However, the Bloc does not 
say that it can only apply to areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
What they do not say is that their act specifically exempts 
federal jurisdiction.  It in fact says it does not apply to 
cable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only surmise that the member for Timiskaming has finally 
come to his senses on this jurisdictional question.  Why else did 
he ask a Quebec based consumer group if federally regulated 
companies voluntarily comply with the provincial law?  The fact 
is that the Bloc knows that the Quebec law does not, cannot, 
never has and never will apply to industries like banking, 
telephone or cable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then do Bloc members stand in this place and demand a carve 
out, a big exculpatory clause for Quebec consumers?  Why do they 
stand with the Canadian Bankers Association and others who like 
things just the way they are?  No changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know the answer to these questions, but I do see a ray 
of light over the Bloc members.  It is the member for Portneuf, 
their official critic for Canadian heritage, who recently 
launched a public campaign against the distribution of a French 
language educational channel, TFO, which wanted to broadcast in 
the province of Quebec and was made in the province of Ontario. 
The member for Portneuf broke ranks with his pro-business 
colleagues and stood up for consumer rights and explained his 
views in a TFO interview which aired on October 28, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is going to try to shout this down, but I want him to 
hear what his colleague said.  I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look, I have no objection if a Quebecer wants to subscribe to 
TFO.  I have a problem with the CRTC, which is a federal 
organization, forcing all Quebecers who get cable to pay for TFO, 
whether they want it or not.  That's wrong.  That is not what I 
would call a free market practice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On a daily basis we are bombarded with the marketing campaigns 
of these federally regulated businesses.  With the explosion of

at the end for my colleague from Surrey Central, who has a keen 
interest in this area and I know would like to have the 
opportunity to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is report stage of the private member's bill, Bill C-276— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is the hon. member

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  No, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Very good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Madam Speaker, as I was saying, this 
is report stage of this bill.  My understanding is that the Bloc 
amendment would not address the issues that the member for 
Sarnia—Lambton just alluded to, that these are federally 
regulated industries which are involved and therefore it is 
necessary to provide protection, even in Quebec, to have this 
bill apply in the way in which it was intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our position that in principle we agree with the 
philosophy involved here, which is to put the onus on companies, 
the providers of services, to obtain the consent before offering 
a service or starting to bill for that service.  That is a 
reasonable proposal to use and therefore we are supportive of 
that concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that there may be some problems with it and I will 
talk about that in a moment, but currently the negative option 
procedure as we know it puts the onus on consumers to advise 
suppliers of a service, for example a television company offering 
a cable service, that they do not want that service, otherwise it 
would continue and the consumer would continue to be billed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle I think it should be the other way around.  I know 
that is the intent of this bill.  This would apply to federally 
regulated industries and therefore banks and telecommunications 
companies would be involved.  We know that there may be some 
consequences in requiring these institutions to obtain that 
consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that it would be a serious matter.  There are new 
methods, including electronic options through the Internet and 
various other ways available to those companies to obtain 
consent, but in the event that it is too onerous on these 
companies and provides too much of a problem, the member who 
proposed this private member's bill has built into it a section 
which says that if that were to be the case, for example if a 
bank were not able to do this without incurring a tremendous 
amount of debt to provide that service, there is a provision to 
exempt those particular areas out of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister involved in that particular category, who might be, 
for example, the Minister of Industry or the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage in regard to telecommunications, will be given the power 
to exempt those companies in the event that it is too onerous on 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is in proper balance.  What it means is that the 
minister involved would have to justify before the Parliament of 
Canada why that exemption is being given.  I think that is a good 
check and balance which will be used very rarely.  It seems to me 
that the onus will then be on the company to try to obtain this 
consent.  That is a very good provision in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The negative option part of it would be reversed and it would be 
up to the companies to obtain the consent necessary before they 
expanded packages and provided that service.

consumers in Quebec be opposed to the idea?  I have difficulty 
understanding that, although I understand the member saying that 
it is provided right now.  I have the counterbalance from the 
member for Sarnia—Lambton who says that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case the member for Sarnia—Lambton is right, I think this 
should apply to Quebec.  If it is already covered in its 
legislation, what is the argument involved?

marketing in industries subject to federal jurisdiction.

member of parliament, I do not recall a single piece of consumer 
legislation coming directly from the industry minister himself. 
We have not seen any kind of progressive consumer legislation 
come from the government.  It has always been from private 
members like the member for Sarnia—Lambton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians do not realize that the department of consumer 
and corporate affairs was long ago renamed the Department of 
Industry, reflecting quite well the concerns of this Liberal 
government and the Mulroney Conservatives before it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except for the member for Sarnia—Lambton, the Liberals care 
only about industry and care nothing for consumers as we have 
seen over and again, whether it is gas prices or all kinds of 
other issues.  Liberals are shoulder to shoulder with millionaire 
hockey players and millionaire oil company execs to protect their 
particular situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumer affairs is now a little branch tucked away in the 
corner of the industry department.  The consumer affairs minister 
is the industry minister, not that one would notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only need to look south of the border to see how things might 
be different.  There the U.S. attorney general is prepared to 
take on a giant company like Microsoft and win.  They have 
anti-combine legislation which actually protects consumers.  They 
have competition legislation which actually encourages 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an act which the Liberals have misnamed.  They call it 
the Competition Act.  From all experience seen under that act, 
everyone I know calls it the lack of competition act because 
there is no competition this particular act encourages.  It 
encourages large, wealthy corporations to do whatever they want 
at the expense of consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, when the banks come calling, the finance department 
and its various political flunkeys in the Liberal Party fall over 
themselves to co-operate and basically they cave in.  It did not 
work, however, with this bill at the industry committee but it 
will be interesting to see how the junior finance minister, and 
the member for Etobicoke North, who both supported Bill C-276 at 
second reading, vote on it at third reading.  I would hope they 
will support it as they did at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will they vote for the bankers or will they vote for the 
consumers?  I suspect the bankers will be first on their priority 
list, as they always have been, but we will be watching very 
closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the member for Sarnia—Lambton that I was not always 
able to be at the industry committee hearings on this bill since 
I was also responsible for Elections Act amendments which were in 
committee at the same time in the procedure and House affairs 
committee.  However, I followed the evidence and various 
amendments proposed, some of them constructive and some 
destructive, and I speak on them today as consumer affairs critic 
on behalf of my party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at second reading, banning negative option billing is 
a way to tell enterprises that where there are consumers 
involved, yes means yes and no means no.  There is no implied 
consent in silence.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If they want customers to pay for a new service, they have to 
ask first, nicely.  They just cannot ram new fees down customers' 
throats or sneak them in through the back door.  Every consumer I 
have spoken with agrees with this statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill follows similar legislation adopted by the NDP 
government in British Columbia and by the Parti Quebecois 
government in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, as now amended by the committee, changes negative 
option marketing from a criminal to a civil reviewable offence. 
This amendment comes at the suggestion of the Competition Bureau 
which would be charged with administrating the Competition Act as 
amended by this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are arguments in favour and against.  The criminal route 
has stiffer fines and can include every industry, but has a much 
higher evidentiary threshold and so is harder to enforce.  The 
civil route amounts to a slap on the wrist, but it can be 
administered more quickly and, one hopes, very publicly.  Given 
the public outcry against the cable companies back in 1995, we 
have some good evidence to believe this can be effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party reluctantly supports these changes so as not to let 
the purpose be the enemy of the good, but there is another 
unfortunate consequence.  While the criminal law can apply to all 
industries, the civil reach of federal legislation extends to 
only those industries under federal jurisdiction.  This limits us 
to the banks, the cable companies and the phone companies. 
Unfortunately, the insurance and trust companies and the credit 
unions have been dropped from the application of the member's 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is so confusing about the latest report stage 
amendment being tabled by the Bloc member for Témiscamingue.  The 
Bloc wants to exempt the province of Quebec from the bill.  It 
claims the bill is not constitutional because it relates to 
commerce and other fields which come under provincial 
jurisdiction.  If so, why does it not just exempt the whole 
country?  Why exempt just Quebec?  This approach is quite 
outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all respect to my progressive colleagues in the Bloc, I do 
not know how in all good conscience they can oppose this bill 
which protects consumers in their own province.  They apparently 
believe in the fiction that federally regulated companies comply 
with provincial legislation.  I do not think they should rely on 
that when push comes to shove, especially not with the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Quebec consumer group, Action Réseau Consommateur, 
which testified at the Standing Committee on Industry, sees the 
need for this bill in Quebec.  The Liberal government will 
sacrifice consumers at the altar of industry.  The Bloc Quebecois 
will sacrifice common sense at the altar of ideology.  That is 
appalling and, needless to say, we will oppose that amendment as 
the New Democratic Party as I am sure all other federalist 
parties will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks could not defeat the bill in committee.  The Bloc will 
not defeat it in the House.  But what about the other place, the 
Senate, where friends of the Prime Minister are appointed to 
ensure that the rich and powerful have veto over common sense 
legislation which protects consumers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament the cable companies effectively sabotaged 
an earlier version of this bill in the Senate.  This time we can 
expect the banks to take another try at it, unless of course we 
can abolish the Senate before the bill gets there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party believes there is substantial merit in even this 
modified version of the member's bill so we hope he has enough 
friends in the chamber of so many second thoughts.  We wish him 
luck in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the New Democratic Party will be opposing the Bloc's 
amendment and supporting the member's bill at third reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I rise today to address Bill C-276, an act to amend 
the Competition Act with respect to negative option marketing. It 
is also with pleasure that I commend the efforts of the hon. 
member for Sarnia—Lambton.  His tireless work on this file is a 
testament to his character and his commitment of upholding the 
interests of the Canadian consumer, all of this despite intense 
pressure from members of his own caucus and, in particular, from 
his party's front bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option marketing is a practice in which enterprises 
offer clients new goods and services that clients must expressly 
refuse in order to avoid being billed.  If clients do not 
expressly refuse the offer, they are deemed to have accepted it 
and are therefore charged.  It is usually common practice for 
goods or services to be provided for a free trial period, after 
which a charge is automatically levied, unless the vendor is 
contacted directly and told to discontinue the service.  Often 
the free product is bundled with other services the customer has 
already ordered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before proceeding to discuss the merits of this bill, I would 
like to address the motion brought forward by the hon. member for 
Témiscamingue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly no secret that the member's party has opposed 
this bill since it was first tabled.  Last spring during the 
debate in which the Bloc opposed this bill, the party argued that 
French language broadcasting services need the protection of the 
CRTC given the smaller market in Quebec. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However misguided, the Bloc believes that the French language is 
under fire across Canada and that its viability is increasingly 
threatened.  I will not go into the numerous reasons why the 
Bloc's reasoning is flawed in this regard because there are 
countless groups, organizations and political parties like the PC 
Party, which are forcefully committed to ensuring the continued 
vitality of the beautiful French language from coast to coast to 
coast.  Despite the PC Party's articulated pledge to uphold the 
rights of all Canadians, the Bloc feels that the French language 
must be protected and promoted as much as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, the Bloc believes that negative option marketing, as 
for instance in the case of cable companies that use negative 
option marketing to introduce new French language services in 
Quebec, must be protected.  As far as the Bloc is concerned, 
negative option marketing is a good thing which means that this 
bill is a bad thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story gets very interesting as we uncover its many layers. 
It turns out that this past fall the Bloc member for Portneuf 
articulated the opposite sentiment.  He complained about the 
CRTC, a federal organization, forcing all Quebecers to pay for a 
service whether they liked it or not.  Translated into English, 
the member said “that is not right, that is not representative 
of a free market”.  The member for Portneuf declared it is not 
right to force consumers to pay for something that they may not 
want.  It is not right, according to the Bloc, to make Canadians 
pay for something that they have not explicitly said they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely what Bill C-276 does.  The bill protects the 
rights of Canadian consumers because it prohibits negative option 
marketing, a tactic that forces consumers to pay for something 
that they may not want in the first place.  This is the same kind 
of tactic, I might add, that the Bloc has most recently described 
as not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not support the motion brought forward by the member for 
Témiscamingue and, as we have seen, neither do certain members of 
his own caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this bill, I offer my support to the member for 
Sarnia—Lambton because I realize the importance of consumer 
rights and I recognize the value in upholding those consumer 
rights.  Bill C-276 protects the most fundamental of all consumer 
rights: consent.  Bill C-276 protects the right to express 
consent before purchasing a new product or service.  Consent, 
which is an individual's expressed will to accept the offer to 
contract, is an essential condition of contracting, one which 
negative option marketing disregards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, if my colleagues see the wisdom in allowing it to 
pass in this place, represents a large victory for Canadians. 
Not only does it protect all Canadians, but it is truly 
refreshing to see that it seeks to protect the little guy in an 
age where the concerns of the little guy are always deemed 
secondary, if not even meaningless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to record my acknowledgement of 
the concerns this bill poses to the Canadian banking industry. 
Although, as I see it and as the banking industry itself does as 
well, there are no valid principled objections to this bill, 
there are examples which show that should the bill become law it 
would be very difficult for banks to abide by its provisions.  I 
recognize these difficulties and I offer my assistance to the 
banking industry in identifying possible solutions to the hurdles 
it would face if the bill were to pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes to eliminate what is known as default billing. 
Default billing is an insidious practice that has plagued 
unwitting consumers for years.  If the bill does not pass, 
default billing will continue to plague consumers in an 
increasingly invasive and damaging fashion.  What opponents of 
the bill fail to recognize is that default billing upsets the 
traditional buyer-seller relationship.  This relationship is 
simple.  Basically, if we want something, we inquire as to its 
availability and if it is available, we buy it from the seller. 
This is only logical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, some crafty and, quite frankly, cunning individuals 
have upset the harmonious balance in the buyer-seller 
relationship by instituting the practice of negative option 
marketing.  This practice does not allow the buyer to even 
consider purchasing a product.  It does not allow the buyer to 
even consider if the product or service is something the buyer 
needs or that would be helpful in his or her life.  Rather, this 
practice imposes products and services upon the buyer without 
consent, without even asking the prospective buyer if this is 
what he wants.  Madam Speaker, would you believe that right now 
it is legal to do that? 
Did you know, Madam Speaker, it is legal for shrewd individuals 
to do this in certain instances?  You, Madam Speaker, could be 
billed for something that you did not even ask for, something for 
which you did not even express an interest.  Does this sound 
fair?  Does this sound right?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Portneuf so accurately stated, this is 
simply not right.  Beyond the fact that this kind of tactic 
inconveniences and troubles average Canadians, this tactic has 
far reaching impacts upon those who do not represent the average 
Canadian.  For instance, negative option tactics penalize 
customers who do not understand that they must cancel the 
service, for instance, Canadians like the elderly or the aging. 
It also penalizes immigrants whose first language is not English 
and even those who are away on vacation and cannot respond in a 
timely fashion to the new charges imposed on them during their 
absence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are simply a number of many specific problems the bill 
will address, problems I am thankful will finally be resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, Madam Speaker, please allow me to reiterate that 
consent is a fundamental tenet upon which the consumer-business 
relationship is founded.  Here in Canada we have always thought 
to preserve the privileges and uphold the rights of our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must preserve the basic principle of consent and ensure that 
that it continues to hold the same consequence and weight that it 
has for ages.  How can we do this?  What role can this House have 
in furthering the preservation of consent?  We can start by 
passing this bill, Bill C-276.  I encourage my colleagues to 
recognize the importance of this legislation and to look beyond 
our party distinctions in order to offer a resounding commitment 
to ensuring the security of the Canadian consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my colleagues to do as I will, that is to support Bill 
C-276.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am quite pleased to take part in this debate. Members 
of the Standing Committee on Industry have discussed this bill, 
and today, the arguments put forward in committee have been 
summarized for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to acknowledge the persistence of the hon. member, 
even though I do not share his view, because this is the fourth 
time he has tried do convince the House of the merits of this 
private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objections of the Bloc Quebecois are in the same line as the 
motion presented by the hon. member for Témiscamingue to exempt 
Quebec from this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it passing strange that a sovereignist member like me 
should explain the Canadian constitution to federalist members 
of various parties in the House. Our objections are based on the 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may wonder how that can be. Section 92.13 grants to the 
provinces the powers over questions of property and civil law. 
This is especially true for Quebec, because our civil code is 
different from the legal system in the other provinces. The 
civil code comes from the Code Napoléon, and it was accepted 
when Quebec joined confederation. Its inspiration and 
implementation differ from common law, which applies elsewhere 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We constantly have to remind federalist members, who should be 
more mindful of the Canadian constitution, of this. And it is 
the Bloc Quebecois members, sovereignist members, who have to do 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the member for Témiscamingue referred to two specific 
cases where section 92.13 of the constitution was used, as well 
as paragraph 230(<I>a</I>). These cases went all the way to the supreme 
court, they are the attorney general of Quebec v Kellogg's and 
the attorney general of Quebec v Irwin Toys.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases, the arguments put forward by the attorney general 
of Quebec were accepted. Cable companies themselves recognized 
that they were subject to Quebec's legislation, because 
legislation exists, which established the Consumer Protection 
Bureau and which, in section 230, prohibits negative option 
marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After meeting with officials of the Consumer Protection Bureau, 
Vidéotron, Cogeco, Star Choice and ExpressVu all promised to 
abide by the bureau's directive that they may not use negative 
option marketing to sell their new package, as of January 1 of 
this year. Therefore, the new package is offered on a positive 
option marketing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people do not want to hear about the constitution 
any more but the constitution is about the rules that govern a 
country, in this case the Canadian federation. If those rules 
are not respected, what is the use of having them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from the Progressive Conservative Party, the New 
Democratic Party and the Canadian Alliance who spoke before me 
used the same arguments than those used by the Liberal Party 
with regard to the Bloc Quebecois' objection, saying that there 
is nothing wrong with the federal government interfering in 
provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something that many surveys and studies have shown and 
that those involved in teaching political science often talk 
about. For Canadians outside Quebec, the main government is the 
federal government. When it offers money or proposes measures 
they find interesting, the objections raised by their provincial 
government are regarded as secondary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, whether one is a federalist or a sovereignist, the 
exact opposite is true.  This has always been the case, because 
the first government they think of is the Government of Quebec. 
This is also clear from voter turnout.  Turnout in provincial 
elections in Quebec is always higher.  In general, although 
there are exceptions, the opposite is true in the other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my first term of office, I sat on the Standing Committee 
on Human Resources Development and the Status of Persons with 
Disabilities.  This committee travelled across Canada and 
Quebec, and I was particularly struck by one thing.  When it was 
a question of postsecondary education, the other provinces 
wanted the federal government to step in and had no problem with 
national education standards.  Yet this is clearly a provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true for health. 
A debate is now going on in the House of Commons and, during 
oral question period, the NDP kept coming back to the charge, 
practically goading the federal government to step in with 
certain governments, such as Alberta, which wants to limit 
certain health criteria set by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This important difference in perception has been noticed by 
many, and the motion brought forward by the member for 
Témiscamingue is very respectful of this reality.  There are two 
mentalities and two cultures in this country that even honest 
federalists should respect until such time as Quebec becomes 
sovereign.  We are different because we have a different past, 
culture, language and civil code.  These are arguments that do 
not seem to interest the members opposite or those of other 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It upsets me even more coming from the New Democratic Party.  I 
was an observer at their last convention.  They were the first 
federal political party to recognize the existence of a Quebec 
people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, it pointed out that Quebec had the right to 
self determination.  We saw what happened with Bill C-20.  At the 
first opportunity, the NDP changed its approach.  They were in 
fact taken to task by their members in Quebec and those of their 
national executive who resigned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People say it is always the members of the Bloc Quebecois who 
raise this argument.  The only consumer group appearing before 
the committee came from Quebec, the Action Réseau Consommateur. 
I would like to recall the remarks of the representatives of 
this group.  They said that the bill was a matter of provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The group asked: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, if this bill is pursued, it not include in it the concept 
of prior consent, which contravenes the spirit of the law and 
takes away its meaning, to all intents and purposes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also asked: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—for an amendment of clause 1(3), in order to prevent banks and 
broadcasting and television undertakings from replacing a 
service with another if no additional cost is charged, without 
the consent of the consumer. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen if the bank replaces a paper service with an 
electronic service, when the client does not want the electronic 
service? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also asked: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That for all transactions, consumers be given a hard copy 
contract. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of these recommendations was heeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I would like to say that, in addition to invading 
areas of provincial jurisdiction, this bill serves no purpose, 
in our opinion, since the legislative provisions already exist, 
especially in Quebec, and protect the consumer in this regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join the 
debate, and I will make my remarks brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill was introduced in the last parliament, which died 
on the order paper, I supported it because it dealt with cable 
companies.  Cable companies have a monopoly in the industry.  I 
know that in my riding there is a certain company, and that is 
it.  If that company sends me a letter saying it is going to add 
two channels at another $2 per month unless it hears from me, I 
find that offensive.  That is why I supported the member's bill 
in the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time a number of things have been added to the bill. 
It seems to me that we should enact legislation that is not only 
principled, but legislation that will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion is that people should not be subjected to negative 
option marketing. Should that apply to the banks?  The principle 
is the same. Members should ask themselves if it is workable in 
the context of banks.  I would submit that it is not.  I do not 
know why we would support something which would not be workable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance member opposite said that there is an opting out 
clause toward the end of the bill by which cabinet could delete 
certain services.  If we are parliamentarians, then why would we 
not put something into the bill which would work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to make the case very briefly as to why I do not 
think it would be workable for the bill to include banks, however 
attractive that might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, banks are not monopoly providers.  If a bank sends me a 
letter saying that if it does not hear from me it will change my 
service package, if I do not like that, then I can go to another 
bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very much part of the movement which opposed the proposed 
merger of the banks last year because I felt it would create too 
much concentration at that time.  We did not have the competition 
in the industry which we will have when the government brings 
forward the financial services sector legislation in the next few 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically, that legislation will talk about a new financial 
consumer agency.  It will talk about a new re-defined ombudsman, 
which will be more independent of the banks.  Therefore, I find 
it strangely odd that we would bring forward this bill now to add 
the banks when we have this new regime coming forward which will 
provide much more protection for consumers and, more importantly, 
when the provisions of this bill would not work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give members an example to try to express my point.  The 
Toronto Dominion Bank or CIBC or any one of the major banks might 
have five million to seven million customers.  They send a letter 
saying they are going to change their service package, but it 
will only be done if they hear from them in writing or 
electronically.  Guess what, maybe 90% to 95% of customers of 
banks will not respond.  That is a reality.  We can pretend it is 
not the case, but it is.  We know from experience that surveys 
will not get the kind of response we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the bank supposed to do?  It has seven million 
customers. If it is lucky, it has heard from maybe 200,000 
customers saying yes, they would like the new service package and 
to proceed.  What does the bank do now?  More importantly, how do 
consumers benefit from this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, in this age of technology banks are adapting to a 
very changing world where we have Internet banking, banking at 
kiosks or computer based banking.  The face of banking is 
changing so radically that very often it is in the interests of 
consumers to have their service package changed, like more 
Internet banking and not so many visits to the branch.  That is 
what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this legislation is passed, the banks will not have the 
flexibility to change any of that.  The irony is the banks are 
doing this right now.  How many of the member's constituents have 
phoned them and said that they are really angry because the banks 
changed their service package?  The reality is members do not 
hear a lot from their constituents.  The banks are in a very 
competitive environment and have to deal with modifications to 
the services packages.  In most cases, they enhance the service 
packages available to customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make the point that, in principle, no one would 
really support the fact that banks should practice negative 
option marketing.  The question is:  Is it workable?  I submit 
that it is not for some of the reasons that I have outlined and 
there are many more.  I hope members would not be so attracted to 
the politics of this that they would not recognize the practical 
realities that are not workable with respect to banks.

Madam Speaker, I wish to acknowledge the good work by the member 
of parliament for Sarnia—Lambton on this matter over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-276 seeks to amend the Competition Act to ensure that 
Canadian consumers are not victims of negative option marketing. 
Negative option marketing offers customers products and services 
that the consumer is required to expressively decline or opt out 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we provide this protection for Canadians, including those 
in Quebec?  Should it come in the form of Bill C-276 or can it be 
achieved through market based reform?  Those are the important questions. 
The competition law can profoundly restrict economic freedom and 
market efficiency and the general move toward strengthening laws 
should be approached with caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that good note, since my time is so limited, the Canadian 
Alliance supports free enterprise but recognizes the important 
role of the government in creating an economic environment with 
fair and transparent rules that protect both consumers and 
businesses.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the public consultation component of the five year review of the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act recently concluded.  It now 
remains for the Environmental Assessment Agency to provide those 
comments to the Minister of the Environment who will then report 
to the House by January of next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of concerns were raised about the act through the 
consultation process.  A few of these include:  The review itself 
is not independent; the Environmental Assessment Agency should 
have a much stronger role in co-ordinating and overseeing 
assessments; there must be improved opportunities for public 
participation in environmental assessment; federal funding for 
environment assessment must be increased; more emphasis must be 
placed on the assessment of cumulative effects; more attention 
must be paid to broadening the scope of projects, and to 
monitoring and follow-up; and, the federal-provincial 
environmental harmonization accord must not be allowed to detract 
from a strong federal presence in environmental assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it is not clear how the harmonization accord's 
subagreement on environmental assessment will affect 
environmental assessment in Canada and what implications it has 
for the current CEAA review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many have commented on the need for the parliamentary Standing 
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development to have a 
formal role in the review of the assessment act.  To date, it has 
none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee is an important component in the parliamentary 
process surrounding environmental legislation.  For example, it 
undertook a mandatory one year review of the Canadian 
Environmental Protect Act commencing June 10, 1994.  One year 
later, it tabled its report in the House of Commons in June 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intensive review of CEPA 88 culminated in a report entitled 
“It's About Our Health! Towards Pollution Prevention”, 
containing 141 recommendations.  Many referred to the report as 
thorough, forward-looking and a comprehensive and substantive 
contribution to environmental protection in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For reasons such as these, many feel that the committee should 
be formally involved in the CEAA review process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
Minister of the Environment has launched an extensive 
consultation process for this review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National public consultations began on January 31 in Ottawa and 
will continue for several weeks in 19 cities across Canada.  They 
will provide members of the public and interested stakeholders 
with an opportunity to provide their views on how environmental 
assessment and the act can be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also has an interactive website which will allow 
the minister to reach out to rural Canadians and others who may 
not be able to attend the public meetings.  At the same time, 
parallel consultations are taking place with aboriginal peoples, 
the provinces, the regulatory advisory committee and with other 
federal departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment is committed to a timely, 
effective review of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. He 
has launched an extensive, multifaceted consultation process that 
will provide valuable input on how environmental assessment can 
be improved in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister looks forward to sharing the results of the review 
and the views of Canadians on how the act can be improved with 
his hon. colleagues in his report to parliament at the end of 
this year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the HRDC boondoggle will just not go away.  The 
HRDC problem is the tip of the iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate came about as a result of a random audit to evaluate 
459 projects receiving $235 million in grants and contributions 
from HRDC.  The findings were astounding, to say the least: 97% 
contained no evidence of checks to see whether the recipients 
owed money to HRDC; 80% contained no evidence of financial 
monitoring; 72% did not have a cashflow forecast; two-thirds did 
not have a rationale for recommending the project; and 15% did 
not have an application form.  This is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>TJF grants are supposed to be used to create sustainable jobs. 
But at what cost?  Here are some examples.  Confections St-Élie 
Inc., a textile company in the Prime Minister's riding, failed to 
create the 61 jobs it had been committed to create but continued 
to receive a payment of $223,000 in 1997. 
A program to teach troubled youths to fix slush puppy and 
espresso machines received $300,000.  Of the 20 who took the 
course, 4 found work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was the transitional jobs fund a slush fund?  Let us take a 
look.  In 1997, Pierre Corbeil, a key Liberal fundraiser in 
Quebec, was charged with four counts of influence peddling for 
allegedly threatening to dismiss or stall TJF grant requests 
unless firms donated to the party.  He later pleaded guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 1998 independent review by Ekos Research Associates Inc. 
suggested that TJF grants were approved for political reasons. In 
1999 the question was raised as to whether the Prime Minister 
used his power to secure a federal grant for a friend, Yvon 
Duhaime, to expand his hotel.  Mr. Duhaime, whose hotel, Auberge 
Grand-Mère, sits in the Prime Minister's riding of Saint-Maurice 
and was once owned by the Prime Minister himself, received a 
grant of $164,000 as well as an additional $650,000 in government 
loans even though federal officials had a report indicating the 
hotel was poorly managed and had massive debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be no end to the shovelgate affair.  There are at 
least 13 RCMP investigations occurring at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by quoting the auditor's report of December 
1998, the section under the heading of grants and contributions. 
It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our audits of the management of grant and contribution programs 
over the past 21 years have produced a long series of consistent 
observations: problems in compliance with program authorities, 
weaknesses in program design, instances of poor controls, and 
insufficient performance measurement and reporting.  Overall we 
have continued to find the same problems.  There are many reasons 
why these problems have persisted.  They range from 
decision-makers not following the rules governing expenditures on 
grants and contributions to weak management practices. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, over the last 21 years, has not been accountable 
enough to pay attention to the findings of the auditor general. 
It is unfortunate that the auditor general does not have teeth. 
Perhaps it is long overdue that the House give the auditor 
general some teeth.  After all, the buck stops with the 
politicians.  The money belongs to the people.  People expect 
responsible government, not a government that tries to write off 
the HRDC boondoggle as no big deal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the Reform 
Party continues to accuse the government of having a billion 
dollar boondoggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say once again that there was no loss of a billion 
dollars in this particular situation.  We had a report on poor 
management and poor administration.  We are addressing it with a 
very serious six point program which has been approved by the 
auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite should realize that partnerships with the 
private sector, through which we leveraged $330 million into $3 
billion worth of economic activity, also involve the same risks 
that private sector firms face every day.  They face the ups and 
downs of the business cycle, and some of our projects did that 
too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the long run, 95% of our projects survived their 
first birthday, which is better than the 72% of projects that the 
banks managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the attack that this has something to do with a slush fund, 
this is usually tied to the flexibility component of our program 
which has to do with pockets of high unemployment.  If indeed it 
was a slush fund, how in heaven's name could it be that more than 
50% of those particular projects went to opposition ridings? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, those members are singing the same song but it has 
no basis when we look at the numbers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
on March 27, I asked a question of the Minister of Industry 
relating to shipbuilding and to my concerns about the lack of 
government intervention to change the current situation in that 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to figures I had myself checked the previous week, the 
workforce in that industry had gone down from the 1993 total of 
12,000 to 3,000, or one-quarter, 25%, of that number.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's response was that the overcapacity in this 
industry throughout the world stands at 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this a curious response, because the assistant deputy 
minister, John Banigan, told the industry committee on November 
16, 1999 that, based on certain predictions, he feared an 
overcapacity by 2005 which could, according to his own forecast, 
go as high as 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reports confirm that there will be a growing demand on the 
shipbuilding industry because, among the world's ocean-going 
fleet of vessels with gross tonnage of 100 tonnes or greater, 
there are 85,494 ships with an average age of 19 years, and 45% 
that are over 20 years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members of the significance of the 20 year figure. 
Most industrialized countries require that vessels undergo major 
refitting after 20 years to be allowed to continue sailing. This 
is not the case in all countries. That is the problem. This is 
why the international fleet is extremely old and, I submit, 
potentially dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody will remember last summer's incident in the St. 
Lawrence River. There were other incidents along the coast of 
Brittany and in several countries of Asia. When dangerous and 
toxic products are on board, such incidents are a great cause 
for concern. They constitute a tremendous threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is not here tonight, but his representative will 
undoubtedly try to explain on what he relied to conclude there 
was overcapacity when the deputy minister of industry says that 
we will certainly not reach that point before 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On what secret study did the minister rely to say what he said? 
Maybe he made a mistake? If that is the case, I forgive him in 
advance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. members opposite who support Bill C-213, whose 
objective is to help shipbuilding.

<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, let me begin by thanking my 
hon. colleague from the Bloc for giving me the opportunity to 
speak on the subject of consultation on the shipbuilding 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a policy on shipbuilding, one that is evident 
in Canada's position in both domestic, let me point out, and 
international shipbuilding markets.  However, we have remained 
committed always to maintaining a dialogue with industry 
proponents and we are receptive to evidence of changing 
circumstances within the shipbuilding sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for dialogue to be meaningful, we must all start from 
the same basis.  It has become clear through my discussions with 
various shipbuilding representatives that all stakeholders are 
not dealing with the same set of facts.  So far the debate on 
shipbuilding in the media and here in the House has been mostly 
an emotional discourse rather than a rational debate on the facts 
and issues facing the industry in Canada and, of course, abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, let me point out that just last week the Minister 
of Industry held a meeting with the chairman of the Canadian 
committee on shipbuilding and policy.  He will continue to 
dialogue with this committee and will also hold meetings with the 
major yardowners for example, labour representatives and other 
major stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to work with all the stakeholders to set forth a set of 
clearly stated facts on Canada's shipbuilding industry.  As this 
information evolves, all stakeholders including government and 
industry proponents, will be better equipped to deal with the 
future direction of this industry.  These directions will take 
into account the outcome of our dialogue, but will also have to 
respect the realities of our domestic and international 
marketplace, use the economic levers currently at our disposal 
and be also fiscally responsible.

House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, this
