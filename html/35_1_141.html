	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-51, an act to amend the 
Canada Grain Act and respecting certain regulations made 
pursuant to that act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-51 this morning, an 
act to amend the Canada Grain Act.
<P>
	Bill C-51 represents a consensus among Canada's western 
grain producers and the grain industry. This bill contains the 
changes to the Canada Grain Act these communities have told us 
they need.
<P>
	There are four key elements to Bill C-51. The first is to renew 
Canada's commitment to quality and therefore reinforce the 
uniqueness of the Canadian quality control system. The second 
is to eliminate the obligation for government to set maximum 
elevator tariffs. The third is to improve the financial protection 
available to grain producers. The fourth is to reduce the 
exposure of taxpayers in the event that licensees of the Canadian 
Grain Commission fail financially.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	I will now give some detail on these four particular aspects 
beginning with commitment to quality. Bill C-51 renews this 
commitment to quality. When we talk about quality, what we 
mean are the measurable characteristics that end users of these 
products tell us they need. Bill C-51 restates the need to meet 
the requirements of end users through visual and other quality 
determination methods. Until instrumental means are developed 
to rapidly and efficiently determine quality, visual methods 
must still be relied upon.
<P>
	Grain quality, which is the primary reason for Canada's 
success in international markets, is more important than ever 
given the post-GATT climate in which freer trade rules reduce 
the role of export subsidies. Our competitors are going to have 
to become more like us. For this reason it is important that 
Canada  preserve its tradition and widely acknowledged 
leadership in this area.
<P>
	On the issue of maximum elevator tariffs, Bill C-51 provides 
that the Canadian Grain Commission will no longer be required 
to set maximum elevator tariffs. Tariffs are the charges grain 
elevator operators levy for their elevation, storage and cleaning 
services.
<P>
	In the absence of maximum tariffs, elevator operators will be 
able to decide what to charge for their services. Operators will 
also no longer be required to provide the commission with 14 
days notice when changes to tariffs are to be made. These 
measures will provide companies with more opportunities to be 
flexible and competitive.
<P>
	Removing the obligation of the commission to set maximum 
tariffs is being done at the request of the industry. Elimination of 
the maximums should encourage more capital investment by 
elevator companies and result in a more flexible and 
competitive elevator industry.
<P>
	Producer reactions to this provision have been mixed. Some 
do believe there is a risk that companies will charge excessive 
tariffs unless they are regulated but we are convinced that Bill 
C-51 addresses these concerns. There are safeguards within the 
bill and within the structure of the industry.
<P>
	For example, the majority of primary and terminal elevators 
are owned or controlled by producers through the Saskatchewan 
Wheat Pool, the Alberta Wheat Pool, the United Grain Growers, 
and the Manitoba Pool Elevators. These operators are 
responsible to their producers, so it is expected they will 
consider the interests of producers when setting these tariffs.
<P>
	Some may argue that the corporate interests of producer 
organizations will override the producers' interests. It would be 
presumptuous for government to tell producers they are 
incapable of directing their own organizations. I am very much 
convinced that producers know what they are doing and they are 
in the best position to determine whose interests their 
organizations will serve.
<P>
	In the unlikely event that producer owned elevators are not 
able to protect their producers Bill C-51 does include some 
legislative remedies. Specifically for a two-year transition 
period the Canadian Grain Commission will have the power to 
immediately establish maximum tariffs by order if the 
investigation of a complaint from an elevator user finds that a 
particular tariff is unjustified. The two-year period should be  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8866"> 8866 </A></B>
<P>
sufficient for the industry and producers to adapt to a 
deregulated tariff environment.
<P>
	The commission will continue to have the power to set 
maximum tariffs by regulation as a last resort if elevator 
operators set tariffs that are excessive. Furthermore, the 
commission will continue to investigate complaints and to 
mediate disputes.
<P>
	However, if the past behaviour of Canada's elevator 
companies offers any indication of their future actions they will 
behave responsibly. The recent experience where the 
commission issued an order which removed elevation tariff 
ceilings for terminal elevators for the current crop year has 
shown this. Limits on these maximums were removed to allow 
operators to recover overtime costs, enabling the industry to 
deal with backlogged orders. The resulting tariff increases were 
modest and responsibly applied.
<P>
	It is significant that the tariffs companies are charging for 
their other services are below the ceiling established by the 
Canadian Grain Commission.
<P>
	The next point has to do with the licensing and security 
provisions contained in the bill. The Canadian Grain 
Commission plays an important role in helping maintain the 
integrity of grain transactions and thereby protecting the 
interests of grain producers.
<P>
	The Canadian Grain Commission licenses elevators and grain 
dealers and holds security posted by licensees. This security 
which is mandatory for all licensees is intended to help protect 
farmers against losses in case a licensee defaults on payments to 
farmers.
<P>
	In the past the industry viewed this security as insurance to 
cover licensee liabilities only up to the amount of security 
posted.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	However, in 1990 the Federal Court found the CGC liable in 
the case of the bankruptcies of two former licensees. In both 
cases the security held by the Canadian Grain Commission was 
insufficient to cover the licensees' obligations to farmers and 
the government had to pay the shortfall in security which was 
approximately $3.8 million.
<P>
	The payments that resulted from these court decisions came 
out of general revenue, more specifically out of taxpayers' 
pockets. We feel it is important to change the act to protect 
taxpayers from further payments by clarifying the government's 
responsibility in any further bankruptcies. This view is shared 
throughout the grain industry with which the licensing and 
security provisions of Bill C-51 were thoroughly discussed.
<P>
	The new licensing and security provisions are as follows. 
There is currently a one-year limit on security. The act will 
allow the time limit to be prescribed by regulation and it is the 
government's intention to fix this period at 90 days. The change 
is based on one of the major recommendations flowing from 
consultations. That recommendation was that farmers should 
take more responsibility for their transactions. This includes 
promptly pricing grain on delivery and cashing payment 
documents.
<P>
	The vast majority of those consulted agreed that security is 
not intended to help farmers speculate on rising grain prices. By 
limiting their time to claim the act will place the responsibility 
on farmers for promptly obtaining payment and cashing 
documents.
<P>
	Another provision is that farmers will have 30 days to notify 
the CGC of a licensee's failure or refusal to pay. If the CGC is 
notified promptly of a default, it can investigate a licensee that 
is potentially in financial difficulty and may be able to prevent 
the licensee from incurring further liabilities.
<P>
	The onus will be on farmers to determine whether they are 
dealing with licensees. This is because the CGC only holds 
security posted by licensees. If farmers want to be eligible for 
security they will have to ensure they are dealing with a licensed 
organization. They can do this by contacting the CGC or by 
monitoring regular CGC advertisements in the farm press.
<P>
	Farmers will have to hold prescribed documents to be eligible 
for security. Security posted by licensees applies only to cash 
purchase tickets, elevator receipts and grain receipts. To be 
eligible to claim against security farmers must obtain one of 
these prescribed documents. Only licensees will be entitled to 
use them. This will prevent non-licensees from misleading 
producers about their licensing status.
<P>
	Security available to producers will be limited to the amount 
held by the commission. If the security held is less than total 
liabilities, the monies will then be shared on a pro rata basis. 
Government will not be liable if the security held is not 
adequate. The commission will monitor companies to make 
certain their security is adequate to cover their liabilities.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-51 will enable the commission to set by 
regulation the percentage of losses that would be covered by 
security. The government intends this will remain at 100 per 
cent of any losses. These are very important provisions that will 
resolve some of these long outstanding issues.
<P>
	There is another point here that should be discussed that has to 
do with special crops. When Bill C-51 was reviewed by the 
agriculture committee some members and witnesses expressed 
the view that Bill C-51 should be held back until issues of 
specific concern to some members of the special crops industry 
could be addressed in the legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8867"> 8867 </A></B>
<P>
	The answer to the problem does not lie in holding up this bill. 
Rather, the answer is to proceed with developing legislation 
that is geared to special crops. What does special crops mean? 
This refers to products such as canary seed, sunflower seed, 
mustard seed, lentils, buckwheat, beans, peas, corn, safflower 
seed, soy beans, triticale, fava bean.
<P>
	At one time special crops played a relatively small economic 
role when compared with other Canadian grains such as wheat, 
barley, oats, canola and so on. However, the industry has grown 
significantly, particularly in western Canada where special 
crops have grown by about 30 per cent in the last 10 years.
<P>
	Special crops are regulated under the Canada Grain Act. This 
act was designed to regulate an industry largely devoted to the 
bulk handling of cereal grains. Many industry participants have 
observed that because special crops differ significantly in terms 
of handling and marketing the act does not meet all the needs of 
the special crops industry.
<P>
	This general assessment has some merit. Over the past several 
years the Canadian Grain Commission has consulted widely on 
this issue, mostly through the special crops initiative which was 
conducted by a committee of special crops producers based in 
the three prairie provinces. These reviews have confirmed that 
the special crops industry operates differently than the sector of 
the industry that handles the major grains and that legislative 
changes are needed to address these special needs.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	These reviews have also consistently underlined the need 
expressed by producers to have access to companies which are 
licensed and to financial security should those companies 
default on their payments to the producers.
<P>
	The commission has examined numerous suggestions and a 
combination of suggestions that have come forward from 
participants in the special crops industry. Some suggestions had 
to be rejected because they were administratively complicated 
and unduly expensive.
<P>
	More consultation is planned because the commission wishes 
to determine which regulatory option is most acceptable to 
special crops producers and the industry.
<P>
	The commission recently circulated a discussion paper which 
outlines options and it will be holding discussions with the 
special crops industry in western Canada over the next two to 
three months. From these discussions will emerge 
recommendations for legislation in 1995.
<P>
	The conclusion to be drawn from all of this is as follows. 
First, a special crops industry has special needs which must be 
addressed. These needs are being addressed in a thoughtful and 
timely fashion. Second, because the needs of the special crops 
industry will be the subject of legislative proposals, the minister 
of agriculture intends to bring it to the House in 1995. We should 
not delay the passage of Bill C-51. Delays will aggravate 
problems C-51 is designed to overcome.
<P>
	In conclusion, we should all thank the many people who have 
been involved in one way or another in the development of Bill 
C-51. They include many members of the multitude of Canada's 
producer and industry organizations, staff of the Canadian Grain 
Commission, Agriculture Canada and many members of the 
House, all of whom have contributed to make this bill a success 
in addressing these issues.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-51 
under consideration today is an administrative bill. It is 
designed to make the operation and administration of the 
Canadian Grain Commission and the grain industry more 
efficient.
<P>
	Canada's reputation for grains of constant and reliable quality 
is commonly recognized as Canada's winning card on 
international grain markets. The Canada Grain Act will be 
amended a number of ways by the bill before us, to strengthen 
the role played by quality in the Canadian grain industry.
<P>
	Under the provisions brought forward today, the Canadian 
Grain Commission, which is responsible for administering the 
Canada Grain Act, will no longer have a duty to set maximum 
elevator charges. We know that these charges are fees levied by 
elevator operators for the handling, cleaning, storage and drying 
of grain.
<P>
	This deregulation of maximum charges will be introduced in 
stages. There will be a two-year transition period during which 
the commission will retain the power to set rate ceilings by 
regulation. During and after this transition period, the Canadian 
Grain Commission will act as an ombudsman, investigate 
complaints and try to settle them. Following the transition 
period, the Canadian Grain Commission will retain the power to 
set maximum charges by regulation, as required.
<P>
	This enactment will give elevator operators more flexibility 
in setting their prices, enabling them to compete. It will also 
encourage much needed capital investment.
<P>
	Bill C-51 will lift the requirement for grain to be hauled from 
province to another exclusively by common carrier. This will 
benefit the producers, in our view, by giving them transportation 
options that could help them cut their marketing costs.
<P>
	The Canada Grain Act, 1912, established the Canadian Grain 
Commission mainly to look after the interests of grain 
producers. Their protection remains the main focus of the act 
and several of the proposed changes are designed to ensure this 
protection. Among the amendments is one giving the Canadian 
Grain Commission the power to take measures against 
companies making illegal use of the grade names established 
under the Canada Grain Act.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8868"> 8868 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	The bill also requires licensed grain dealers to use the official 
grade names established under the Canada Grain Act in all their 
dealings with producers.
<P>
	There is also a provision allowing the Canadian Grain 
Commission to suspend primary elevator operation licenses 
when surpluses exceed the allowed limits. A surplus is the 
difference between the quantity of grain stored in the elevator 
and the amount that should be there according to shipment 
records and receipts.
<P>
	The bill also contains provisions giving the Canadian Grain 
Commission the authority to require operators to fully insure the 
grain stored in their elevators. Finally, it requires eventual 
licensees to provide specified financial data proving their 
solvency.
<P>
	Under the bill, the Canadian Grain Commission would license 
elevator operators and grain dealers and hold security posted by 
licensees, to help protect farmers in cases where a licensee 
defaults in its payment to a grain producer.
<P>
	After the bankruptcies of two licensees who had posted 
insufficient security, the courts ruled that the shortfall should 
come out of general revenue or, in other words, out of taxpayers' 
pockets. The bill before us proposes several amendments 
intended to clarify the respective responsibilities of the 
Canadian Grain Commission and of grain producers and to 
protect taxpayers against future disbursements.
<P>
	These amendments include a provision that protects 
producers by regulation during a fixed period following grain 
delivery to a licensee. Should producers not try to obtain 
payment during this period, they will not be eligible for 
reimbursement out of the security posted by the licensee, in case 
the licensee goes bankrupt, of course. Based on the 
consultations which the Canadian Grain Commission held with 
producers and industry stakeholders, the statutory period will be 
90 days.
<P>
	The bill also contains a provision requiring the grower to 
notify the Canadian Grain Commission within 30 days if a grain 
company has not met its obligations.
<P>
	It also contains a provision making the grower responsible for 
determining whether he is dealing with a duly accredited 
company. Since accredited companies are the only ones that 
have to provide security to the Canadian Grain Commission, 
claims against the security will not be valid if a grower deals 
with a non-accredited company.
<P>
	We also find a provision requiring the grower to obtain 
documents authorized by the Canadian Grain Commission from 
grain dealers and other Commission licensees.
<P>
	The bill also contains a provision allowing the Commission to 
set a limit on the protection afforded by the security. The 
Commission could not use this regulatory power without the 
approval of the Governor in Council. At present, the protection 
is total-100 per cent-and will remain so in the foreseeable 
future.
<P>
	There is also a provision explicitly limiting the Canadian 
Grain Commission's obligation to the amount of the security 
provided by the companies which it accredited. This provision 
exists to make the protection which the growers enjoy closer to 
the security provisions commonly found in other sectors. It is 
similar to the limits set on the amount guaranteed by the 
government when financial institutions fail.
<P>
	I realize that I went quickly, but for these reasons, I will 
support Bill C-51 presented by the government.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak at third reading of Bill C-51 which amends the 
Canada Grain Act.
<P>
	The Canada Grain Act regulates grading and inspection of 
grain, maximum tariffs on handling charges including elevation, 
cleaning, drying and so on. The act also restricts in some cases 
transportation of grain. It is involved in licensing of businesses 
dealing in or handling grain and also in the security 
requirements of these companies.
<P>
	The Canadian Grain Commission oversees the act. It is made 
up of appointed commissioners who seem, for some reason, to 
turn over to some extent after an election.
<P>
	Today I will discuss the changes to the Canada Grain Act 
which are proposed in Bill C-51. I will discuss these changes 
under three headings: first, excessive power moved to the hands 
of the minister and to cabinet; second, maximum tariffs on 
handling charges; and third, bonding and licensing. As well as 
these three main areas I will speak briefly about a few other 
areas which I think are of particular interest.
<P>
	I will begin with the excessive power moved to the hands of 
the minister and cabinet under the changes made in Bill C-51. In 
this bill an increased amount of legislative action is given to the 
governor in council which is the formalized constitutional body 
through which the federal cabinet exercises executive power. 
The executive instrument of the governor in council is known as 
an order in council which represents delegated legislative power 
as permitted under specific acts of Parliament.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8869"> 8869 </A></B>
<P>
	This delegated legislative power gives cabinet, or really the 
minister, the ability to enact subordinate legislation by order 
in council or by regulation. Power delegated through enabling 
legislation is so common that the law is effectively formed by 
administrative bodies rather than by Parliament as it should be.
<P>
	The legislator's role should be to pass the initial legislation 
authorizing certain agencies to devise, promulgate and 
supervise regulations as may be deemed necessary to give full 
effect to a particular act.
<P>
	Too much power is continuing to be centralized in governor in 
council. In this bill, clauses 2, 4, 9, 15, 33 and 35 are examples.
<P>
	How can the Liberals reconcile this with their red book 
promises of more open and more democratic government? Why 
are they formalizing control in cabinet? The argument that was 
presented when this question was raised is that the bill only 
legitimizes the authority that is there anyway.
<P>
	If the government is serious about moving to a more open and 
less interventionist style of government, why did it not remove 
these powers rather than just formalizing what was there 
anyway?
<P>
	This expansion of the scope and use of governor in council 
power which has occurred at the expense of the power of the 
legislature or Parliament is largely a result of the increasing 
complexity of modern government. However this delegated 
legislative power may involve matters of administrative routine 
right up to matters of major political and economic 
consequences. A wide range of issues are dealt with by the order 
in council power.
<P>
	Such legislation is so extensive that Parliament can do little 
other than conduct random checks and investigate only some 
apparent abuses. The decisions made by cabinet or governor in 
council are based on informal procedures and the deliberations 
are secret. This amounts to little more than government by 
cabinet decree with no accountability.
<P>
	In this bill there are an increasing number of areas for which 
the Canadian Grain Commission will now require governor in 
council approval. Conceivably the Liberal government under 
the revised act would be given the ability to covertly affect the 
interest of an individual farmer, a farm group or a grain dealer, 
for example, which is not operating according to its wishes. 
Dare I suggest this change opens the door to pay-offs for 
political favours or punishment for political foes. This is the 
type of thing the governing Liberal Party campaigned against 
during the election.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	In two cases in this bill there is a movement toward less 
ministerial control. This bill states that the Canadian Grain 
Commission will have the power to set the salaries for the 
members of the eastern and western standards committees 
which have 26 members and the grain appeal  tribunal which is 
made up of three members. This is in clauses 4 and 6 of this 
legislation.
<P>
	Currently the salaries of members of these committees are 
fixed by governor in council at a $125 honorarium per day for 
non-government participants and $10 per sample for the grain 
appeal tribunal. The commission will now be setting the salaries 
for committee members in order to better reflect the reality and 
provide the Canadian Grain Commission with additional 
flexibility to make adjustments without having to go to order in 
council.
<P>
	The second area I would like to talk about briefly this morning 
is the setting of maximum tariffs. Clause 14 and some following 
clauses eliminate over two years the requirement for the 
Canadian Grain Commission to set maximum tariffs charged by 
grain elevators. Instead the Canadian Grain Commission is 
provided with the discretion to decide whether or not it wishes to 
regulate this aspect of the grain industry while eliminating the 
requirement that elevator operators have to give advance notice 
to the Canadian Grain Commission of changes to elevator 
charges. Tariffs are fees charged for handling, cleaning, storage 
and drying of grain, that type of thing.
<P>
	Removing these tariffs is a positive step. My concern though 
is with the grain companies that own primary, that is the country 
elevators, as well as terminal elevators. It is very common in the 
grains industry for companies to own the farm elevators that 
farmers ship directly to as well as the terminal elevators which 
are responsible for receiving the grain in port position and 
loading it on the ships. Those grain companies may lower the 
tariffs in the country elevators which is good, but they may at the 
same time raise the tariffs in the terminal elevators to make up 
for the cut rates in the country.
<P>
	This would be fine if only these companies were dealing 
through their terminals. However these terminals are 
semi-public terminals by law which means that companies and 
individuals other than the owners are allowed to ship grain 
through the terminal.
<P>
	I am afraid these changes may cause an increased rate at the 
terminal. The smaller companies which are provided an 
opportunity by law to deal through the terminals may be 
squeezed out of business. The rates could be raised beyond that 
which is reasonable.
<P>
	Just to make this very clear, there is a provision in place which 
allows the Canadian Grain Commission to set a maximum in 
cases where the rate is raised too much. That provision is there 
and I will talk a bit about that in a minute.
<P>
	The irony is that while I am concerned about this happening, 
the positive result from this type of action could be that the 
small companies may decide to improve the direct hit loading. 
That is simply loading directly from rail car to ships which 
started in the port of Vancouver and they may actually expand 
this to increase the competition. I see this as something positive.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8870"> 8870 </A></B>
<P>
	The other positive thing that may result from this is more 
grain movement through the United States and through 
American terminals so that Canadian farmers have another 
option when there is a disruption in grain movement within 
Canada. That would encourage settlements by those in the grain 
handling industry, including the companies that own the 
business and labour. Settlement may be encouraged if they 
know there is competition so that they cannot stop the flow of 
grain.
<P>
	I touched on my concern before about the Canadian Grain 
Commission or order in council maintaining the power to set the 
maxmimum tariffs. By getting rid of the maximum tariffs it 
gives the grain buyers more authority to penalize people who put 
grain in terminals and do not move it quickly enough. This is in 
clause 14 of the bill. I believe this is a good move. However, 
since we know that government wants to increase and not 
decrease the authority of the Canadian Wheat Board for 
example, cabinet just may choose to reverse these penalties in 
cases where the Canadian Wheat Board is affected.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Could the ability to invoke governor in council authority be 
used in the future by government to give even more power to the 
central selling desk of the Canadian Wheat Board to further 
regulate the grain sector? This is a legitimate concern.
<P>
	With the present legislation the terminals do not have the 
power to penalize the Canadian Wheat Board for dumping grain 
for which they do not have an immediate buyer. All other 
shippers of grain must have a buyer ready before they can move 
the grain to port. The Canadian Wheat Board is the exception.
<P>
	We have found over this past year that the Canadian Wheat 
Board moved grain into terminal position for which it had no 
buyer. This was the case particularly in Thunder Bay. Without 
the ability of the companies that own the terminals to raise the 
tariffs, this put them at a disadvantage because they could not 
move the grain due to the terminals being plugged with 
Canadian Wheat Board grain. At least now the law provides for 
them to raise this rate, but it also provides for the minister to 
say: ``No, this is out of line. We are going to lower the rate''.
<P>
	That overriding power concerns me. I understand there is 
some need for that because in a business where there really is not 
enough open competition there could be a rise in tariffs which is 
not justified. There is a balance. It is tricky to find the balance, 
but I am just expressing some of my concerns.
<P>
	The third area I want to talk about today is bonding and 
licensing requirements and the proposed changes under this 
piece of legislation. A major change in the bill involves the clear 
legislative removal of any responsibility on the part of the 
Canadian Grain Commission and therefore the taxpayers, above 
the level of the bond that is posted by the Canadian Grain 
Commission to a licensed company. In the past, courts have 
required the  Canadian Grain Commission to cover losses above 
the bond level.
<P>
	Companies buy bonds to protect the customers they do 
business with against losses up to the bond level if they go out of 
business. In the past the courts have determined that somehow 
the Canadian Grain Commission and therefore the taxpayers 
have a responsibility to cover losses above the level of the bond.
<P>
	However in at least two cases over the past years taxpayers 
have also been forced to cover losses for companies which have 
not been licensed under the Canadian Grain Commission. 
Therefore, there is no responsibility on the part of the Canadian 
Grain Commission or the taxpayers. The Auditor General was 
very critical of the bailouts of these two companies which 
seemed to be politically motivated.
<P>
	With the changes that are made in this area there is no doubt at 
all that farmers will not be protected above the level of the bond. 
The courts will not be able to determine that taxpayers should 
somehow be held responsible for farmers and grain companies 
through funds from the Canadian Grain Commission.
<P>
	The Canadian Grain Commission does however monitor these 
bonds to try to determine whether the licensed companies are 
operating within the level of the bonds. This is a very difficult 
thing to do and it is very expensive. It is a function which does 
offer some degree of protection. At the same time while the 
monitoring is there, the grain commission is not responsible if 
the monitoring is ineffective. That is a concern.
<P>
	Once again the Canadian Grain Commission has the power 
but does not take the responsibility for its mistakes. It has the 
power to refuse to licence a company, to require expensive 
insurance and bonding. It spends the money to perform these 
functions, but again the only protection is provided by the 
companies and the protection is only up to the level of the bond. 
It is important that farmers know this.
<P>
	For this reason I believe that elevators and grain dealers 
should have the right to choose to opt out of this licensing and 
bonding requirement. This was the reason for my first 
amendment to Bill C-51, Motion No. 3, which was debated and 
defeated at report stage. That amendment would have allowed 
individual elevator companies, grain dealers, to choose to opt 
out of the licensing requirements under the Canada Grain Act.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	It is very expensive and very difficult for some small 
companies to provide the bonding and insurance the Canadian 
Grain Commission may require. In those cases these companies 
could have chosen to opt out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8871"> 8871 </A></B>
<P>
	The protection we offered to farmers and people doing 
business with these companies is that on the premises there 
would be a sign very clearly stating that the place of business 
was not licensed under the Canadian Grain Commission. As is 
done in other areas with this type of body, on the front of every 
contract it would have been required to clearly state that the 
company you were about to enter into a contract with was not 
licensed under the Canada Grain Act. That was the protection 
for farmers.
<P>
	As well, the amendment would have provided the flexibility 
so that when a company did opt out it no longer had to meet any 
of the requirements of the Canada Grain Act. This amendment 
would also have allowed companies, if they chose, to use the 
grading and inspection services that the Canadian Grain 
Commission provides, of course at a cost as is done now.
<P>
	There are a few other points that I want to raise. One further 
clause in this bill authorizes the Canadian Grain Commission to 
suspend licences of primary elevators where overages exceed 
allowable limits.
<P>
	Overage is just a difference between the amount of grain an 
elevator has in store compared to the amount it should have in 
store when looking at the records of shipments and receipts of 
grain. This is to offer some protection that in fact companies are 
paying their customers for what has been brought in and put 
through the facility.
<P>
	Another clause confirms the authority of the Canadian Grain 
Commission to require operators to fully insure the grain in their 
elevators. It requires that prospective licensees provide 
specified financial data which demonstrates their financial 
viability.
<P>
	What they are talking about here is a little bit closer 
monitoring of the bonds. While it is impossible to make sure that 
a company is operating within the bond level, it was pretty clear 
from what happened in the past when companies failed that the 
monitoring was not as good as it should be.
<P>
	A further step in this bill involves movement of grain within 
Canada. This may surprise some people although people who are 
knowledgeable in the grain industry know this, the legislation 
seems to grant free movement within the eastern division or 
within the western division, a line drawn just west of Thunder 
Bay. This is in clause 25 of this bill. My question is: Why should 
there be any restriction to interprovincial trade and grain in this 
country? Yet, there is.
<P>
	This legislation will allow free movement within the eastern 
division or within the western division but not between the two 
divisions. This seems absurd. To add further to that under the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act it is still against the law to transport 
grain from province to province even within a division. This 
seems absurd when you consider we are moving to more free and 
open trade with the world.
<P>
	A further change requires that licensed grain dealers use the 
Canada Grain Act grade names in all of their transactions with 
farmers and grant the authority of the Canadian Grain 
Commission to act against companies which illegally use them. 
This has almost been a normal practice in the industry and this 
change only legitimizes what is already happening.
<P>
	My concern is that dealers do not have the right to operate as 
unlicensed businesses. They may apply to the Canadian Grain 
Commission which may choose to grant them the right to 
operate without a licence but it is not a right. Of course my 
amendment which was defeated at report stage would have 
provided this as a right.
<P>
	I believe that farmers and dealers in the industry want a 
change which will allow a dealer to operate as an unlicensed 
dealer and choose to deal in either ungraded grain or grain which 
has been graded by the Canadian Grain Commission. They want 
the choice. Because farmers are paying for the majority of the 
operating costs of the Canadian Grain Commission, they should 
be provided with the choice.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, one witness in committee referred to the bill as 
the reregulation of the industry. The time has come for an open 
and honest evaluation of the role of the Canadian Grain 
Commission to determine what functions it should perform and 
how it should perform them.
<P>
	The evaluation must determine what farmers want in areas 
that affect them and what others in the industry want in areas 
that affect them. The role of the Canadian Grain Commission 
should be to provide no more or no less than what is wanted by 
players in the industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I reiterate the statements made by my hon. colleague 
from Vegreville. He made a very good speech on what this 
change to the grain commission act really is. I will add a few 
comments.
<P>
	As members of the standing committee on agriculture know 
very well, I am not a big friend of the Canadian Grain 
Commission. I was very close to the issue when Grandin wheat 
was smuggled into the country and put the reputation of our 
milling wheat at stake. The way the grain commission acted on 
the issue was really appalling. Not only did it not try to keep the 
grain out of the country but it more or less showed the 
smugglers, as I call them, how to get around the rules and 
regulations to bring it in and fill their pockets with wheat that 
was really not suited for our area.
<P>
	It makes me wonder: I see a bill like this one that says 
deregulation and then I see it is probably open to loopholes 
whereby small players could be put out of business in a very 
short time.
<P>
	When I look at small elevator companies with no terminals, I 
wonder how they will be able to compete with a very low tariff in 
the country. When grain is  shipped to the terminals of larger 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8872"> 8872 </A></B>
<P>
players they can be hammered with the tariffs and put out of 
business. That is not fair. The grain commission was put in place 
to see that everyone was treated equally, small players or big 
players.
<P>
	Why would large grain companies be worried about exporting 
grain if their terminal charges were so high they actually made 
more money by keeping it there than moving it once or twice 
during the year? It is a deterrent to exporting grain outside the 
country.
<P>
	We have small players in the grain industry like small seed 
cleaning plants. They are really the entrepreneurs in the special 
crops industry. They were the people who put at risk the bit of 
capital they had by experimenting with lentils and with peas. 
These small players are going to be licensed and regulated to a 
point where they cannot exist. I received a call from a small seed 
plant owner one day who said: ``Jake, to enforce the new 
regulations in the act it will cost me $20,000 extra for doing my 
books''. A chartered accountant will now do his books which 
were always done by him and his family.
<P>
	The accounting and the bonding are putting these small 
players out of business. Every farmer knows the reputation of 
the seed plants in their areas. They have been in business for 
years and have never defrauded anyone of a single dime. They 
are now going to be put out of business. That is wrong.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	Another thing that is wrong is that grain commissioners are 
paid by farmers; 90 per cent of their wages are from farm 
receipts. However what input do they have in who the 
commissioners are? This is a point in our democracy that must 
be changed. When a player pays he should also have the right to 
know whom he is paying.
<P>
	Clause 4 of the bill also bothers me. It would permit the 
Canadian Grain Commission rather than the governor in council 
to fix allowances paid to members of grain standards 
committees and grain appeal tribunals, removing the set of rules 
as far as payment is concerned one step further from the House. 
Before it was the governor in council and farmers who had some 
input. Now it is to be removed from the governor in council and 
given to commissioners to set wages for grain weighing 
tribunals or grading standards people.
<P>
	This is not very effective nor what farmers want. I do not think 
it saves the taxpayer money. I would equate that to putting the 
fox into the chicken coop instead of outside the door. It is 
dangerous and should not be allowed to happen.
<P>
	Clause 21 of the bill really bothers me. Under the clause 
process elevators, unlike primary elevators, would no longer 
have to perform weighovers to determine whether there is an 
overage or a shortage, a discrepancy between the amount a grain 
elevator has in store and the amount it really paid for. This is to 
recognize that process  elevators are not required to account for 
grain delivered by producers.
<P>
	Why should process elevators be treated any different from 
primary elevators? These are the elevators that are processing 
the special crops. These are the process elevators that really turn 
over the dollars, where the big bucks are. Very little overage or a 
shortage can increase their profit margins and it is all coming 
out of the pockets of farmers. It will open the door to more 
corruption and more lost revenue for farmers. If we want a bill 
that is fair to everyone, it should be on a basis where primary and 
processing elevators are treated exactly the same.
<P>
	My colleague touched on another item I do not like. Public 
carriers will only be able to transport grain in the west, not into 
the east or vice versa. It is another regulation that will hinder 
value added processing companies.
<P>
	Just this week a small miller in Manitoba tried to export to 
another province. He will be able to do so under this act into 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C. However he cannot 
go into Ontario and compete with the bigger processors or the 
millers. The country should be shared by everyone. We have 
agreed to the establishment of the World Trade Organization but 
we do not have free trade in our own country.
<P>
	There is so much to be said about the government that we 
could probably talk all day long. One of these days in the House, 
especially when we are not debating this bill, I will mention to 
hon. members what the old red combine did to my farming 
operation. We could probably debate a few matters outside this 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	When I commented in the standing committee that there 
should be a revamping of the Canadian Grain Commission I was 
not very far off. Farmers will very much support that idea, just 
like they supported the idea that the Grain Transportation 
Agency should be done away with.
<P>
	It amazes me that we can debate bills in the House and agree 
in committee 100 per cent, Liberals, Bloc and Reform, but 
legislation does not get passed. I would suggest very strongly to 
the House that if we want the farming industry to stay in 
business we will have to start making real deregulation, not 
superficial.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned the bill is giving the grain handling 
system the chance to increase its revenue without considering 
what it will cost farmers. We will not have the free movement of 
grain we should have. The bill will give us competition, but the 
competition will be limited. The amount of tariff that can be 
charged will be set by larger players with no regulation. That 
really bothers me. We have to start realizing that the primary 
producer should be protected by bills like this one, not the major 
players, the processors or the grain handling system.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8873"> 8873 </A></B>
<P>
	My colleague did a very good job on the other issue that is 
wrong with the bill. I wholeheartedly suggest to members 
across the way that if western Canada does not get a few fair 
shakes in some of these bills, maybe we will start seeing more 
grain moving to the south, which will be detrimental to the 
country.
<P>
	I am a Canadian. I like rules and regulations that benefit 
Canadians, but my children and my neighbours' children who 
are farming need to survive and have a profit. If we do not start 
drawing up bills to protect the farming industry, we are in big 
trouble.
<P>
	With that I will close my remarks and turn the debate over to 
someone else.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this

proposals of a group of students.
<P>
	Yesterday, the students' federation of the University of 
Ottawa was invited by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
to a public consultation on the social program reform. The 
minister remained silent throughout the hearings and did not 
take any notes. Moreover, the minister's assistant led students to 
believe that the discussion was being recorded. A verification 
revealed that no recording was made. This illustrates the federal 
government's real idea of what public consultation is.

are paving the way for a new tax increase affecting all taxpayers, 
thus reneging on the election promise made by the Prime

<P>
	Besides recommending this possible surtax, the Liberal 
majority on the finance committee proposes to increase the tax 
burden of the middle class by imposing a new tax on gasoline 
and by giving the Minister of Finance full scope to tax RRSPs 
and pension funds in particular.
<P>
	Moreover, by recommending additional cuts of $3.4 billion to 
social programs, the Liberal members on the finance committee 
confirm how despicable the Axworthy reform is, since it seeks 
to reduce the deficit on the backs of the unemployed, welfare 
recipients and students.

yesterday, during the debate on the Quebec referendum process, 
Bloc Quebecois members were quite surprised by the lack of 
historical perspective shown by Liberal members as a whole, 
and more particularly Quebec Liberal MPs.
<P>
	While they all were quick to condemn the regional 
consultation process on the draft bill regarding sovereignty, 
calling it illegitimate and undemocratic, they conveniently 
forgot that, in 1981, there was no consultation and no

Quebec National Assembly to the new Constitution.

<P>
	Northerners use a greater percentage of their disposable 
income for the bare essentials of food, shelter and clothing than 
do Canadians living further south. Northerners must pay more 
for food because it has to be trucked over longer distances. They 
pay more for fuel to heat their homes over the longer, colder 
winters. They pay more for medical care and education when 
they send their children south to specialists or universities.
<P>
	We know the Minister of Finance is looking for easy tax grabs 
to fund continued overspending. Although it does not begin to 
compensate for all the differences, the northern residence 
deduction helps offset some of these additional costs.

Mr. Speaker, on June 23, 1992 Bill C-7, an act respecting the 
status of the artist and professional relations between artists and 
producers in Canada, received royal assent.
<P>
	The government repeatedly promises to reform social 
programs and the economy to meet the needs of the new

has done nothing.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DRAFTBILLONQUEBECSOVEREIGNTY">DRAFT BILL ON QUEBEC SOVEREIGNTY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday during the debate on the Official Opposition's motion 
to recognize the legitimacy of the process initiated by the 
Government of Quebec to determine its political future, 
government members repeatedly referred to Quebec's initiative 
as illegitimate, illegal and undemocratic, while during Question 
Period, the Prime Minister referred to it as raising unnecessary 
complications.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister refer to the process initiated by 
the Government of Quebec as raising unnecessary 
complications, when it is essentially based on two components, 
a draft bill and a very comprehensive process providing for 
genuine consultations with the people of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in addition to the opposition in Quebec City, there is 
also the government right here, the federal Liberal Party, as well 
as a steadily increasingly number of people in Quebec who 
realize that this is not a normal process, that the dice are loaded 
and that 13 out of 15 committee members will be appointed by 
the government.
<P>
	We have a ``yes'' committee, financed by a government that is 
not financing any ``no'' committees. They do not need any 
committees or studies. Let them ask an honest question, no 
stratagems to confuse people but an honest question: Do you 
want to separate from Canada, yes or no? Not more than two 
lines, and the answer will be clear: Canada will win!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can 
the Prime Minister question the process initiated by the 
Government of Quebec, a process initiated by tabling a draft 
bill, when a similar procedure was used in 1980 by the Liberal 
government of Pierre Trudeau which included the Prime 
Minister, a government that tabled a resolution in this House to 
initiate the unilateral patriation of the Canadian Constitution?
<P>
	Why, when he was a member of that government, did the 
Prime Minister feel that tabling a resolution was acceptable, and 
why now, because the Government of Quebec is involved, does 
he no longer feel that this procedure is acceptable? Let him 
explain that, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are only asking them to be honest with the people. 
In 1980, all observers accused the government, and especially 
Mr. Morin, who was in charge of the step-by-step process, of 
hiding the question in a maze of 114 words.
<P>
	The government's draft bill uses 1,645 words to try and hide 
the truth from Quebecers. The truth is, they are all separatists 
but do not want to be labelled as such. They are all for separation 
but say they support sovereignty. Be honest. Say what you are. 
Say you are separatists and want separation. The people will 
vote, and Canada will survive!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
absolutely incredible to hear the Prime Minister criticize the 
Government of Quebec for setting out its plans for sovereignty 
in reasonable terms, when he and his colleagues keep saying in 
this House: Go ahead and tell us what your plans for separation 
are. Tell us what kind of Quebec you want. Tell us what kind of 
country you want. Today, however, the Prime Minister says: 
Make the question short. Do not bother to explain.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> If the Prime Minister takes this matter 
seriously, he will have to answer this question: How can the he 
question the legitimacy of the consultation process, when it is 
basically the same one used by the Bélanger-Campeau 
Commission that was set up by the previous Liberal 
government, a process in which the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs was a participant? It was all right for 
the Bélanger-Campeau Commission at the time, but not any 
more.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, turning up the volume does not make it a good 
question.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, when appointing the Bélanger-Campeau 
Commission, the leader of the government at the time consulted 
the opposition. Everyone was fairly represented. It was not 13 
against 2.
<P>
	Second, among the statements in the 1,645 words the draft bill 
contains, one says there will be an economic union with Canada. 
That is not up to Quebec to decide. Canada will decide. It says 
they will keep their Canadian citizenship. This is not up to the 
Government of Quebec to decide. The Parliament of Canada will 
decide. It says they will use Canadian currency. The Parliament 
of Canada will determine interest rates, not the Government of 
Quebec.
<P>
	So in a bill like this one where all the decisions will be made 
elsewhere, people should at least have a say, before concluding 
that one can become independent and stay in Canada at the same 
time.
<P>
	I am glad to see there has been some progress. This is the first 
time the word separation was used by the hon. member for 
Roberval. Bravo. At last the truth is out.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> I too, Mr. Speaker, 
have a question for the Prime Minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8878"> 8878 </A></B>
<P>
	The referendum debate has been initiated and the people of 
Quebec will soon be deciding their future democratically. In 
his autobiography, the Prime Minister says that he and others 
like him are betting on democracy, that they will set out to 
convince the people of Quebec to remain within Canada and 
win, and if they are not successful in their attempt, they will 
abide by the wishes of the people and go along with the 
separation.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister still stand by what he said in his 
biography and does he still recognize that the people of Quebec 
have the right to leave the Canadian federation if such is the 
democratic choice they make in a referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I made myself quite clear: all we want is that a 
referendum be held as soon as possible, with a plain and clear 
question.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	We all know what is going to happen. That is why they are 
trying to dilute their proposal with 1,600 words, when the honest 
question to ask would be: ``Do you want to separate from 
Canada, yes or no?''
<P>
	I do not even have to answer a hypothetical question. There is 
no doubt in my mind that Canada will win. Come on!
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister is three questions behind answering mine.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien:</B> Contrary to what the Prime Minister thinks, and 
considering that the consultation process gives the people of 
Quebec every chance to express their views not only on the 
content of the political proposal, but also on the referendum 
question, does the Prime Minister not recognize their right to 
decide themselves the wording of the question that they will 
have to answer in the referendum on their political future?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Quebec federalists have the right to have a say in the 
wording of the question, so that it is plain and clear. The rest of 
Canada is also entitled to a question that is plain and clear.
<P>
	Just think of the number of people who are presently refusing 
to participate because of the ambiguity, the trickiness; they are 
trying to trick people, they are using gimmicks. The Conseil du 
patronat, the Quebec chamber of commerce, the Quebec 
farmers' union, the Quebec manufacturers' association, and 
every federalist party in Quebec-and even Mario Dumont-do 
not want to participate because they do not want gimmicks, they 
want the truth, period.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Finance committee report which was tabled Thursday contains a 
number of proposals and recommendations for possible tax 
increases, taxes on gasoline, on lottery winnings, on businesses 
and on cigarettes.
<P>
	The deficit reduction surtax that is introduced would hit 
everyone who lives and breathes. Just to make good and sure 
that the report did not miss anybody the committee suggested 
going after dead people too by introducing an inheritance tax.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance distance himself from this grab 
bag of potential taxation measures and commit to tabling a 
budget which does not increase taxation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
knows that I will not comment on individual suggestions. He 
also knows that the government's budget will come down when 
it presents the budget.
<P>
	I would like to take this occasion to congratulate all members 
of the finance committee. They heard over 650 witnesses. I 
would like to also congratulate the witnesses who came forth 
and testified. I believe that the majority report will provide a 
very valuable contribution to the debate. An enormous amount 
of work went into it.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate our members on our side of the 
House. At the same time I would like to compliment the 
members of the opposition and the third party who put a great 
deal of work into their efforts. I assure members I will look at 
each and every suggestion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
appreciate the minister's comments with regard to the process. 
In that Liberal majority report there is a very important item. 
There is an indication that we could potentially have a $1 billion 
tax grab by an increase on gasoline taxes.
<P>
	One of the comments he raised as a challenge to the 
committee was when he said in determining which areas of the 
tax system should be scrutinized more closely, several 
principles have been adopted. Initiative should help make the 
economy more efficient. Initiative should improve the fairness 
of the system and broadening the tax base is preferable to rate 
increases.
<P>
	Does the proposed gasoline tax satisfy any one of these three 
principles?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
will-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

<HR>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> He was a minister. That is 
why his questions often make sense, unlike the vast majority 
of his colleagues.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	I think what the committee attempted to do was really deal 
with the unfortunate fact that when a government makes cuts, as 
the member will know from his previous experience, those cuts 
do not show up immediately, there is a lag time which must be 
taken into account.
<P>
	What was said in the report is that therefore certain tax actions 
may well be required. That is part of the balance and it is 
obviously the kind of thing the Minister of Finance and the 
government will have to take into account.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of 
those potential tax measures that may have to be taken in light of 
what the minister said is the deficit reduction surtax that could 
be used in an emergency contingency arrangement.
<P>
	As Reformers we believe that if there is any kind of a 
contingency plan in place it should be for expenditure reduction, 
not for tax increases.
<P>
	My question to the Minister of Finance is, having heard the 
anti-tax sentiment of a majority of the witnesses who appeared 
before the finance committee, can he support at this time 
increasing taxes in any way on every single Canadian before one 
dime is cut from the government's $1 billion boccie, 
incorporated infrastructure program as an example?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I understand, 
the members of the third party are going to be submitting their 
suggestions as to that whole segment of government spending 
that has not been dealt with yet in their report.
<P>
	I hope when they do that they will deal first with the impact of 
those particular cuts. I also hope that in terms of both segments 
of their report they will deal with the timing as to when the cuts 
will take place so that it can be dealt with on a rational basis.
<P>
	The member is nodding. I am sure they will do that and I look 
forward to receiving that report.
<P>
	In terms of the infrastructure program, having gone across 
this country, having talked to mayors in municipalities across 
this country and to all the Canadians who went back to work and 
seeing the effect on productivity of the very important reports, 
that infrastructure program is an essential part of the Canadian 
recovery.

<P>
	Several months ago, the Solicitor General asked the Security

is accused, among other things, of creating the Heritage Front

making it public in the light of the relevant legislation. I intend 
to make public as much of this report as possible, and I will 
make the necessary decisions as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Douglas Christie, a B.C. lawyer who defended 
members of the extreme right in 1989, has accused CSIS of 
inciting violence against Jews and of interfering in his clients' 
trials.
<P>
	Can the Solicitor General tell us if the recent investigation by 
the review committee also dealt with Mr. Christie's 
accusations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I just received the report about an hour ago. I did not 
have time to review it. However, I think that SIRC knew about 
Mr. Christie's allegations and I look forward to reviewing this 
report because, as I just said, I intend to make public as much of 
it as possible.

announced about an hour ago that Mr. Schelew, vice-chair of the 
Immigration and Refugee Board, had chosen to resign rather 
than face a judicial inquiry into his conduct. Government 
counsel accepted his resignation and recommended to the judge 
that the inquiry be halted immediately, saying that no public 
interest would be served by pursuing this matter further.
<P>
	Given the allegations of widespread irregularities in the IRB, 
why did the justice minister not recommend that the inquiry be 
expanded to include the entire operations of the IRB and what 
led to this investigation in the first place?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member will 
understand that the inquiry was directed under a section of the 
citizenship and immigration act which defines the proper ambit 
of the inquiry.
<P>
	Under that section a judge appointed for that purpose is 
directed to inquire only into the allegations with respect to a 
particular member of the board and is confined to making 
recommendations with respect to what should happen as a 
consequence of any findings. That is by statute. The terms of 
reference for the judge in question were dictated by statute and 
were provided accordingly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Immigration and Refugee Board has lost its legitimacy and 
credibility. I ask the minister again, in light of what he just said, 
given that inquiry is done with, will he now order a new inquiry 
to continue to get to the bottom of the allegations of impropriety 
in the IRB? If not, why not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

integrity of the board are not in question in these proceedings.

Speaker, in the finance committee's report, the Liberal majority 
suggests that the Minister of Finance increase the tax burden on 
all Canadian taxpayers by levying new taxes, including a 
temporary surtax which alone could  raise at least over a billion 
dollars for the federal treasury.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Finance promise in this House to reject 
any proposal for new taxes or charges that would affect mainly 
the middle class, including this ridiculous idea of a surtax?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

minority reports from the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, why does the minister not immediately rule out these 
suggestions for new taxes and why does he not make a solemn 
commitment to immediately attack the real issues, namely 
family trusts, tax shelters, the $6 billion in unpaid taxes, waste 
and duplication? That is what people came to tell the finance 
committee. They did not come to say to raise taxes, to cut social 
programs further, to attack the unemployed, the poor, students

away.

fields, even on the suggestions which the member just 
mentioned.

	That being said, I read the Bloc's report carefully and perhaps 
I would like to ask a question myself, Mr. Speaker. I definitely

Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has been asking for 
this measure for the last dozen years.
<P>
	The other point may explain why the hon. member is 
receiving complaints. Last night I received a petition from a 
colleague of the hon. member in his party, a petition signed by 
people who oppose registration and other features. The petition 
decried government legislation that would ban rifles and 
shotguns, impose a $100 per gun registration fee and put limits 
on the amount of ammunition that will be available for sale. 
Those have nothing whatever to do with the proposals that we 
have put before this House. I would sign that petition.
<P>
	I am here to say that people should be honest with the 
Canadian people about what these proposals are all about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if this government would come clean and explain 
exactly what registration is all about and what it would 
accomplish, we would not have these difficulties.
<P>
	The chief inspector and registrar of firearms in the state of 
Victoria in Australia recommended that its firearms registration 
be abolished after three years of trial in the 1980s because it did 
not control the criminal misuse and irresponsible use of 
firearms. If that were clearly communicated we would not have 
this problem.
<P>
	Does the minister have measurable objectives and what will 
he do when his registration system fails to reduce violent 
crimes? Will he abolish it like Australia did, or will he ban even 
more guns and place more restrictions on law-abiding, 
responsible gun owners?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when Canadians want 
advice with respect to their health they consult doctors. When 
we want to know how to reduce the crime rate in this country we 
speak to the police. The police in Canada, not in Australia, have 
for a dozen years been asking this government for gun 
registration. I suggest we take the advice of the experts and put 
registration in place.

	While the international community continues to drag its feet 
regarding the measures required to bring Bosnian Serbs to their 
senses, and now threatens to withdraw its peacekeepers, Canada 
does not seem to be making a significant contribution to the 
peace process. Yet, the Minister of National Defence clearly 
said that it was a shame that Canada was not part of the contact 
group,  adding that he hoped the Prime Minister would raise this 
issue in Budapest.
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister tell us if the Prime Minister 
raised this issue in Budapest, and will she confirm that Canada is 
still not part of the contact group?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, during his 
visit to the CSE conference in Budapest, the Prime Minister had 
a number of bilateral meetings with leaders from many 
countries, including those of the contact group.
<P>
	We have been assured that our views are being fully heard by 
the members of that particular group and that our input is 
valued. I think that goes some way to addressing the concerns 
that I outlined last week.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are 
we to understand from the minister's answer that Canada is still 
a powerless actor and is content to be a mere onlooker, at a time 
when negotiations are deadlocked? Is it not time for the 
Canadian government to propose concrete solutions to convince 
the Bosnian Serbs to accept a peace plan?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, events of the 
last week have shown that the efforts to achieve peace in the 
former Yugoslavia have broadened beyond any five countries 
that are now in the contact group. A number of countries are 
involved. I think the statements made by the Prime Minister 
publicly and the representations made by the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister privately should assure 
Canadians that Canada's voice is being heard.

	The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has 
asked that an environmental assessment panel be appointed to 
conduct a public review in the Lac de Gras area of the Northwest

question from the member for Brandon-Souris. I wish to 
inform the House that earlier today I announced the appointment 
of a four person independent panel to conduct a full public 
review of the BHP diamond mine proposal.
<P>
	The panel will start its organizational work immediately. It 
will make sure that all interested groups, individuals, parties 
and organizations will be provided with the opportunity to 
participate. It will ensure that any decisions on the BHP 
proposal are only made after a full open and fair consultation 
and consideration of environmental and socioeconomic effects.

	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Liberals have stood in this House and repeatedly 
stated that after an intense and lengthy consultation process they 
have compiled a list of handguns, the primary use of which 
could only be in the form of criminal activity.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Justice. How is it possible 
that the Shooting Federation of Canada that facilitates the rules 
and regulations of this type of firearm to be utilized in shooting 
competitions like the PanAm games and the Olympics was never 
consulted by anyone from this Liberal government over the 
practicality of banning these types of firearms?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the first place I met 
with representatives of that federation on more than one 
occasion. The most recent meeting was in my office here in 
Ottawa within the last six weeks.
<P>
	Second, all of the international legitimate competitions using 
handguns were considered. The conclusion to which we came 
was not that the handguns proposed to be banned are primarily 
used in crime as the hon. member stated. We concluded that the 
handguns proposed to be banned are not used in legitimate 
competition. If they have no legitimate use then the logical 
question is: Why are they in the hands of Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we telephoned the organization in question it said 
it was never consulted. It also suggested that because this 
particular gun is used by many people in the Olympics and in the 
PanAm games this puts the PanAm games in jeopardy because a 
full length of programs cannot be offered.
<P>
	Could the minister comment on the validity of those 
statements?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to 
speak with the hon. member and tell him about the particulars of 
my meetings with the shooting federation.
<P>
	The hon. member did not mention a particular handgun in the 
course of his question, but if he has a specific calibre or model of 
handgun in mind I would be happy to discuss it.
<P>
	I can say there is a handgun which is specially registered. A 
.22-.32 calibre interchangeable barrel is used in international 
competition. We have already made it clear that firearm will be 
permissible because it is indeed used in that sort of competition.

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. A few weeks after the 
Prime Minister's pompous economic mission to Asia, it is 
important to bring up the sad story of Tran Trieu Quan, a 
Canadian businessman held prisoner in Hanoi for over eight 
months without any charges being laid against him. This case 
could help us better understand the new attitude of a government 
that considers respect for human rights less important than trade 
relations.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Are we to understand that if the Prime Minister took such a 
timid stand for human rights in Asia, it was because of his 
inability to protect the fundamental rights of this Canadian 
prisoner in Vietnam?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to 
thank the hon. member for raising this very importance issue. I 
want to assure him that the Canadian government has raised the 
issue on several occasions, not only with the Vietnamese 
government, with whom we have had further talks, but also with 
various organizations such as the United Nations.
<P>
	I have noted his question and will get back to him as soon as 
possible, on this specific case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, seeing 
that the Canadian government is unable to resolve the Quan case 
and obtain guarantees for the safety of Canadian 
businesspeople, how can the Deputy Prime Minister pretend that 
business executives will accept such risks in their future trade 
relations with Asia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of International Trade explained quite 
clearly, the Prime Minister himself raised the issue when he was 
in Vietnam and he is pursuing the matter.

<HR>

<P>
	That being said, it should be emphasized, as indeed we did 
before the Prime Minister's Asian tour, that I have personally 
reviewed every comment made by the Premier of Quebec when 
he was the host of the governor of a Chinese province and, each 
time, he adopted the same policy as the Government of Canada.
<P>
	He stressed the issue intensely in private, but did not make 
public statements. The Premier of Quebec never made any 
public statement on human rights in China.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, </B><B>Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the hon. Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has stated that any new firearms 
legislation will apply equally to all Canadians. On the other 
hand, the Minister of Justice and the government have also made 
assurances that special gun control provisions will apply to 
Indians living in self-governed areas of Canada.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Justice today clear the air and tell this 
House if the government indeed is considering special firearms 
provisions for Canadian Indians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can say in response 
that we emphasized in the material tabled last week that there 
will be principles which govern firearms in Canada. They will 
be universal, invariable and will apply to all. We also 
emphasized that in their application we shall demonstrate a 
flexibility which reflects the unique circumstances in various 
regions of this country, including aboriginal communities where 
for example some people hunt for sustenance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, just as background, Bill C-34 permits 
self-governing bands in the Yukon to control or prohibit the 
possession and use of firearms. On October 4 the hon. Minister 
of Justice did say he would consider special legislation and will 
show respect to the Indian nations. Canadians are confused 
about the justification of statements like this when they consider 
themselves as responsible firearm owners as anyone else in the 
country.
<P>
	Would the minister clarify the issue today and tell Canadians 
if there will in fact be equality in the application of the new 
firearms legislation, or will special legislation regarding the use 
of firearms be extended to Canadian Indians in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the principles will be 
universal and invariable.
<P>
	I visited the Northwest Territories to speak to the residents 
about firearms. I visited a remote community and was told that 
there are eight official languages in that territory, 75 small 
communities, some of them hours apart. It became clear to me, 
as it should be to all of us, that the universal principles in their 
application to such communities must be flexible. We are not 
proposing special legislation but flexibility in the application of 
universal principles to the reality of local circumstances.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the hon. Parliamentary

<P>
	Yesterday Canadians were distressed by reports in the Toronto 
<I>Sun</I> that the department of immigration is browsing for 
technology to produce the new permanent resident's card in the 
United States. Say it ain't so. C'est incroyable. Surely it cannot 
be true that our hon. minister has become a cross-border 
shopper.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rush to 
reassure the hon. member that it ain't so. Indeed the minister is 
not only not cross-border shopping, he has been browsing and 
shopping where he should, in Canada.
<P>
	Two contracts have already been issued to Canadian 
companies. The first was awarded to Datacard Canada Inc. of 
Mississauga in the amount of $3,209,714 over a three year 
period. The other was awarded to Security Card Systems Inc. of 
Markham, Ontario in the amount of $1,608,500 over a three year

us if permission was given.
<P>
	Since a decision on this move must be made in the next few 
days, can the minister declare an appropriate moratorium, ask 
the department to provide a second assessment of the two sites, 
especially with respect to safety, from the Department of 
Transport so that the best possible decision can be made, and 
have the feasibility study sent to us?

<P>
	The hon. member should know that as a result of the white 
paper, with the reduction of the reserves from 29,000 to 23,000 
there will be some major changes as to how the reserves work in 
Canada. This may affect a number of communities across the 
country.
<P>
	No decisions have been taken. We are working on a plan of 
action to be fair to the cadet movement which we want to 
enhance and also to the reserves in general. Certainly we believe 
decisions that are taken must make operational sense.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
domestic violence is a serious problem in need of remedy, but 
increased gun control is not the answer. Less than half of all 
spousal homicides are committed with guns, whether they are 
registered or not. Domestic violence has been studied for over 
20 years. It has been studied to death and there has been no 
action.
<P>
	My question is for the justice minister. What specific plan 
does he have to address the root causes of domestic violence 
other than ineffective gun registration?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, every six days a 
woman is shot to death in this country. Seventy-five per cent of 
the female victims of homicide are killed in their home by 
somebody they know. By a margin of two to one the weapon of 
choice for such murders is a firearm. In 80 per cent of those 
cases that firearm is a rifle or shotgun legally owned. I cannot 
accept the premise of this question that gun control does not at 
least in part address the tragedy of domestic violence.

<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	For over eight years, since March 1986, a series of justice 
ministers have stood in the House and solemnly affirmed their 
deep commitment to amend the human rights act to end 
discrimination based on sexual orientation.
<P>
	In view of the fact that this minister has promised repeatedly 
to table this amendment by the end of the year, this month, how 
does he explain to lesbians and gay men that he may join 
previous Conservative ministers in breaking this promise and 
giving in to the Neanderthal McTeague 46 in his own caucus.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I regret the hon. 
member's reference to the Liberal caucus. The commitment of 
the government to the implementation of that amendment is 
unquestioned.
<P>
	Just the other day in the House I had the opportunity to 
reaffirm it. The Prime Minister, the deputy Prime Minister and 
this party stand firm with that commitment.
<P>

one that should be central. The question is one of principle and 
on that we are firm.

that the company's short, medium and long term use contact 
lenses sell for $10 for the short term to $200 for the long term. 
The problem is they are all the same contact lens.

against such deceptive marketing practices?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first may I assure the member that I am very concerned 
with the published reports that were in the newspaper this week.
<P>
	I have been advised that the Ontario College of Opticians is 
ensuring that their customers are aware of this. It is important 
that opticians make sure their customers see clearly the 
difference between these types of lenses and their cost.
<P>
	The bureau of competition policy, which administers the laws 
with respect to misleading advertising, dealt with over 10,000 
complaints of various sorts last year. As yet it has not received a 
complaint concerning this matter. They are very attentive to the 
situation and will deal with it accordingly.

<P>
	The petitioners pray and request that Parliament not amend 
the human rights code, the Canadian Human Rights Act, or the

service clubs in all communities.
<P>
	In recent years memberships of service clubs throughout the 
country have been declining. In these times of monetary 
restraint service clubs would find it easier to recruit new

Code (protection of children).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I thank members of the House for their 
consent to introduce the bill at this time.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to repeal section 43 of the Criminal 
Code allowing corporal punishment of children by parents and 
teachers.
<P>
	Condoning corporal punishment can lead to physical and 
psychological injury and death of children, contributes to 
violence in society, and is contrary to both the Charter of Rights

Child.
<P>
	Section 43 allows punishment causing bruising and 
contusions. It allows children to be struck with belts and other 
objects. It is the relic of a bygone age and has no place in a 
democratic society that respects and values children.
<P>
	Finally I would urge the section be repealed as part of the 
recodification of the general part of the Criminal Code. Several 
European countries have ended the legal approval of corporal 
punishment. I urge our government to uphold the rights of

the Criminal Code of Canada.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADAGRAINACT">CANADA GRAIN ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-51, an act to amend the Canada Grain Act and respecting 
certain regulations made pursuant to that act, be read the third 
time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to speak to third reading of Bill 
C-51, the Canada Grain Act amendments. At the same time I 
express to the minister of agriculture my continuing support for 
the Canadian Wheat Board. I point out to him, as I know he is 
aware, the results of the recent wheat board advisory committee 
elections.
<P>
	The minister must know by now that wheat board supporters 
won 10 of 11 seats, or perhaps I should say the supporters of dual 
marketing lost all but 1 of 11 seats up for election. As far as 
farmers and grain marketing are concerned it would appear that 
farmers think the Canadian Wheat Board is doing a fine job of 
marketing western grain and want it to continue doing a 
successful job.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	It is incumbent upon the government to accept the wishes of 
the western farmer as expressed by this vote, which was 
virtually a referendum on the issue of the future of the Canadian 
Wheat Board, and begin issuing statements in support of the 
board.
<P>
	This week in the House of Commons the minister of 
agriculture was given the opportunity to congratulate the elected 
members of the advisory board and to declare his personal 
support for the work of the board. Instead, he chose to repeat the 
line that he must continue consulting with farmers.
<P>
	Let me quote the minister from the December 7 edition of 
<I>Hansard</I>, as reported at page 8784. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I do not think it would be fair to say that the vote is the be all and the end all. I do 
not think it would be fair to say it is the absolute last and ultimate word. It is one 
very important piece of evidence which is clearly supportive of the Canadian 
Wheat Board.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I appreciate the acknowledgement of the evidence in front of 
the minister, but I believe the minister must accept the wishes 
put before him. Therefore I say the consultation must now be 
concluded. Farmers have had the best opportunity they will ever 
have to declare support for the board and they have taken it. 
They support the board. They have demonstrated they support 
the board. The minister must not now only acknowledge it; he 
must act on it.
<P>
	Today, however, we must also deal with the government's 
amendments to the Canada Grain Act. I express my support for 
the act and the amendments before us today, although there are 
additional amendments that could be made to further strengthen 
the act and how it applies to farmers.
<P>
	Basically the latest changes in the grain act were proposed in 
response to changing industry conditions and as a result of 
producer group recommendations. They also reflect the findings 
of the federal government's 1992-93 regulatory review that 
supported deregulation and a more market responsive grain 
industry, a review I have taken some issue with.
<P>
	Primary producers are becoming increasingly vulnerable to 
exploitation by various trading interests as protective 
legislation is systematically deregulated. Deregulation 
represents the transfer of power from the public to the private 
sector. A loss of public power means a loss of sovereignty, a loss 
of opportunity for redress when something goes wrong. The 
more deregulated the industry the more vulnerable we become 
and therefore ironically the more regulated we need to be. What 
a situation.
<P>
	As members are aware the Canada Grain Act is administered 
by a special operating agency, the Canadian Grain Commission. 
Its services are provided to clients on a cost recovery basis. It is 
responsible for establishing and maintaining grain quality and 
for regulating the grain handling system.
<P>
	The bill before us is designed to deregulate elevator operation 
charges, provide more flexibility to producers in moving their 
grain, and tighten licensing and liability provisions. It gives 
grain producers the primary responsibility for securing payment 
for their grain shipments from elevator operators and grain 
dealers licensed by the commission. It also imposes greater 
responsibility on licensees of the commission for making such 
payments.
<P>
	According to some who have studied the bill, it attempts to 
find a balance between promoting competitiveness and at the 
same time maintaining  quality. On the one hand, in attempting 
to streamline the inspection process the amendments reduce the 
regulatory power of the grain commission. On the other hand, 
the grain commission is able to prescribe more activities in its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8889"> 8889 </A></B>
<P>
role of protecting producers and grain quality. The grains 
industry in Canada has a long and arduous history.
<P>
	The bill in front of us is the latest in a long list of amendments 
that have come before parliamentarians over the years in many 
different attempts to improve the movement and storage of 
grain.
<P>
	For the record it is important for us to take a look at that 
history. Members of the House may find it interesting to note 
that the need for legislation was first recognized by a private 
member of the House and first presented as a private member's 
bill in 1898. Farmers represented a great power in the House of 
Commons at that time. When the private elevator companies 
were accused of cheating in weighing, grading and deducting for 
weed seeds, discriminating as to whose grain they accepted and 
of price fixing, it did not take long for Parliament to act.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	A royal commission was appointed in 1900. Later that year, 
on the eve of a general election, Sir Wilfrid Laurier's 
government enacted a majority of the commission's 
recommendations. The 1900 Manitoba Grain Act established a 
grain commission to license elevators, to bond elevator agents 
and grain buyers, to approve handling tariffs, to inspect records 
and to settle disputes.
<P>
	Is it not interesting that the need to regulate came at a time 
when the grain trade was dominated by competition from many 
grain companies growing like crazy and operating in a 
completely unregulated marketplace?
<P>
	Deregulation is a direction the previous Tory government 
wanted us to take and it seems to be the direction the current 
government wants to continue. However it is a direction fraught 
with danger and all of us must proceed with a great deal of care.
<P>
	The first amendments to the Manitoba Grain Act came in 1902 
in response not only to a good crop but to apparent blackmail 
from the railways that were not supplying grain cars to the 
elevators for the movement of grain.
<P>
	Another royal commission was called in 1906 in response to 
allegations against the grain companies. This commission 
verified the allegations and recommended 50 additional 
amendments to the act. These amendments include making 
elevator companies liable for damages for weight frauds, 
requiring samples of all bins to prevent grading fraud, paying 
farmers for the commercial value of screenings, and authorizing 
the grain commissioner to order equitable distribution of cars 
and to dismiss agents for fraudulent practices.
<P>
	Then again in 1908 Parliament gave the grain commission full 
control of the cleaning, binning and shipping of grain from the 
terminals and the power to inspect terminal records and receipts.
<P>
	The point of all this is that in the unfettered marketplace of the 
past farmers were being exploited or taken advantage of every 
time they turned around. If there is anything to be learned from 
our history, it is that farmers standing together with the help of 
their elected officials ensured that they received better and 
fairer treatment from the corporations then dominating the 
marketplace.
<P>
	In continuing to look at our history we see that the farmers' 
need to take on the elevator companies and the railroads did not 
end in 1908. There were more amendments in 1912 and again in 
1919 after the war when complaints over the handling and 
purchasing of grain again resurfaced.
<P>
	Another royal commission was established in 1921 because 
the complaints against the corporation persisted. More changes 
were made and finally in 1930 things stabilized. The Canada 
Grain Act continues to be the basis of Canada's reputation in the 
world wheat market as a supplier of reliable, clean and 
consistently graded grain.
<P>
	However, the political and economic struggle over grains did 
not end with the Canada Grain Act. The same forces which 
worked for greater farmer control in handling, storage and 
transportation also worked for control and fairness in 
marketing. The Prairie Co-Operative Pools were created in the 
1920s and, finally, in 1949 the Canadian Wheat Board was 
formalized with monopoly control over marketing of western 
wheat, oats and barley.
<P>
	Whatever changes are considered to the way in which grain is 
treated, it is very important to review history and take only those 
steps that acknowledge the lessons learned along the way.
<P>
	Today in agriculture there are numerous changes taking place 
not only within Canada but around the world. The government 
we are facing seems to be pushing farmers again into a world of 
a more market oriented privatized industry where the 
corporations dominate and the farmers must compete not only 
against other countries but against themselves to participate in 
the marketplace.
<P>
	In our fights to maintain a vision of a strong agricultural 
community with populated and productive rural areas, we find 
ourselves having to give up those things which make us strong.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8890"> 8890 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	The Crow benefit is under attack. The Canadian Wheat Board 
is under attack and certain protections offered by the Canadian 
Grain Commission are being discussed.
<P>
	Just as in 1898 the farmers of Canada and the communities 
they support today need the support of the Parliament of Canada 
to ensure they are, each and every one, treated fairly in the 
marketplace.
<P>
	There is a tremendous opportunity in the world today both for 
the export of bulk quality Canadian grain and in the process or 
value added sector. Canadian producers have to remain in the 
game through whatever tough times we have to face in order to 
be here when those opportunities come knocking at our door.
<P>
	I urge the minister of agriculture to ensure Canadian farmers 
remain in the game. Give us the opportunities we need to stay on 
the farm, to reap the rewards of the opportunities coming our 
way in the future. Give us the opportunity to continue to ship to 
port under the terms of the Crow benefit. Give us the 
opportunity to continue marketing our grain under enhanced, 
not reduced, powers of the Canadian Wheat Board and give us 
the quality protection we need under the terms of the Canada 
Grain Act to ensure our reputation in the world marketplace is 
protected.
<P>
	I believe the amendments put forward before us today in Bill 
C-51 allow us to provide some of the protections that are 
needed. That is why I will support the bill at third reading. I want 
to ensure the direction the government is taking in agriculture is 
changed to ensure that each of the farmers, each of the producers 
can continue to do the work they want to do for their families and 
their communities. I urge the government to take a strong look at 
our history and the value of the product coming off the farm to 
the future of our country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I felt I 
had to respond to the hon. member who has just spoken. My 
response is with regard to the Canadian Wheat Board advisory 
committee elections. I would like to talk briefly about the 
tradition of these elections, what has happened in the past, what 
the real issue was in the election this time and about some new 
abuses that came into the voting this time.
<P>
	The tradition of the Canadian Wheat Board advisory 
committee elections is that there is a very low turn out at the 
elections, this year under 40 per cent. The reason is that this 
advisory committee really has no power whatsoever in terms of 
the operations of the wheat board. It has no power so people tend 
to stay away when it comes time to vote.
<P>
	These elections in the past have been won in the garbage cans 
of post offices. There is no personal identification involved in 
the voting in these elections. There was not in the past, I am not 
sure about this last election. People who support a particular 
position strongly have gone to the garbage cans and picked out  
numerous ballots and mailed in a good number of ballots. I have 
seen this happen. I have talked to others who have seen it happen 
and have been involved in it. That is the type of process that has 
taken place in the voting in the past. To my knowledge this has 
not been taken out this time, but I cannot say that for a fact.
<P>
	There were some new abuses added to the election process 
this time. This is very important to point out. The board of 
commissioners, the commissioners who are government 
appointed, not elected, is supposed to oversee the election 
process. Therefore it plays a role very similar to Elections 
Canada in a federal election.
<P>
	In spite of that fact these same commissioners including the 
chief commissioner, Lorne Hehn, were out campaigning for 
those who were in favour of maintaining the Canadian Wheat 
Board monopoly-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Trying to protect his $175,000 a year job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Out trying to protect his job.
<P>
	We will see any monopoly and people involved in a monopoly 
out to try to protect their job and their personal interest. That is 
understandable except when this body is the body in charge of 
the administration of the election.
<P>
	This should never have been allowed to happen. It was very 
improper behaviour on the part of those commissioners and I 
believe they should do what is right and step down because of 
that.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	This kind of abuse is totally unacceptable in any kind of 
election, whether it is an important election or not. What this has 
shown is that there is a great concern on the part of these 
commissioners and those who supported maintaining the wheat 
board monopoly that things would not go their way. I think this 
is the reason that the commissioners, against all past tradition, 
have decided to get involved this time.
<P>
	Because of this involvement the issue changed from the issue 
of dual marketing versus monopoly, which was never the issue 
in this election. The real issue because of the way this was 
presented by the commissioners and others was. Do you want 
the wheat board or not? All of the candidates involved in this 
advisory committee election want the wheat board. To my 
knowledge they all support the wheat board. Yet that was the 
way the issue was presented by the commissioners and by others 
and through the farm media.
<P>
	This election was to determine whether farmers wanted the 
wheat board or not, except all of the candidates running wanted 
the wheat board. I believe probably 70 per cent to 80 per cent of 
farmers want the wheat board maintained.
<P>
	That is not the issue that is important here with regard to the 
wheat board. The important issue is whether the wheat board 
should be run by an elected board of directors or by government 
appointment. That is the key issue, should farmers get some 
control over their  organization, the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Farmers pay the total operating cost of the wheat board. The 
board supposedly exists for farmers. Why on earth will this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8891"> 8891 </A></B>
<P>
government and others not allow them to control their 
organization?
<P>
	The advisory committee has no power and therefore is pretty 
much unimportant in this whole process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have heard the hon. member's 
speech before. I did not hear a question in what he put. However, 
I do have a couple of comments to make in response to the hon. 
member for Vegreville.
<P>
	I could not help but think as he was speaking today and as I 
have heard him say in this House recently since the advisory 
board elections were completed that when you lose on substance 
you appeal on the basis of process.
<P>
	In this case the Canadian Wheat Board advisory elections, at 
least in my part of the country where I had the great opportunity 
to talk not only to the candidates running but to many of the 
farmers responding, were very much discussed on the basis of 
support for the monopoly powers and enhanced powers of the 
Canadian Wheat Board or dual marketing.
<P>
	Again, even in my own area the debate on the farm and in the 
coffee shops was not concerning itself with process but on 
substance. In the end when the ballots were counted the 
substance of the debate I think was quite clearly heard in that 
those who support the monopoly and enhanced powers of the 
Canadian Wheat Board were successful.
<P>
	The member for Vegreville indicated that in some cases less 
than 40 per cent of farmers voted. Certainly this is not a low 
number in terms of wheat board elections. This is a very good 
turnout in terms of the history of the Canadian Wheat Board 
advisory elections.
<P>
	I believe that every farmer had the opportunity to express an 
opinion and certainly those who did not quite often, as we know 
in politics, represent those who are satisfied. Only when those 
who are disgruntled vote in large numbers do we recognize the 
protest in their voices.
<P>
	A turnout of 40 per cent in which the majority supported the 
Canadian Wheat Board indicates that those who did not vote 
would also likely support the wheat board.
<P>
	I was concerned that the member for Vegreville indicated that 
he recognized improprieties in the voting. I am sure that on 
behalf of the minister of agriculture and all Canadians I would 
ask the member to name those he knows were involved in the 
improprieties and ensure that the elections are conducted fair 
and square and that those who are aware of the improprieties and 
problems that may exist within the system bring them forward to 
those who can act on them.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, concerning the 40 per 
cent, I only referred to that to show that it is not regarded as a 
valid body that is being elected.
<P>
	Does the hon. member feel that it is all right for the 
commissioners who are responsible to oversee the election, as 
Elections Canada is in a federal election, to actively campaign 
on behalf of one side in this election? It twisted the issue from an 
issue of dual marketing versus single desk marketing. They did 
it from their massive coverage in farm papers and local papers 
by twisting it instead to an issue of if you let the monopoly break 
the board will disappear, it will be destroyed.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member if he feels it is all right that the 
commissioners campaigned in that way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, very briefly, the message that the 
Canadian Wheat Board commissioners brought forward is the 
message that I was also discussing in my constituency and so 
were the candidates who were running for the advisory 
committee.
<P>
	I did not see the Canadian Wheat Board commissioners 
bringing forward any new information to the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to rise today to speak on Bill C-51, the amendments to the 
Canada Grain Act.
<P>
	This bill covers also the Canadian Grain Commission. It is 
designed to reduce the Canadian Grain Commission's 
responsibility in a couple of areas. Today I would like to focus 
my attention on government control over the whole grain 
industry, including that by the Canadian Grain Commission.
<P>
	We have one of the most controlled industries in the world, 
the grain industry. No other industry I know of has the level of 
government control this industry has. As an active farmer, I 
believe this is not in our best interest. I am going to be pointing 
out some of the reasons for that later.
<P>
	We also have a body, the Canadian Grain Commission, 
heavily controlled by the federal government but does not have 
the funding from the federal government. In other words, 92 per 
cent of the budget of the Canadian Grain Commission comes 
from producers. Only 8 per cent comes from the federal 
government, yet it wants to maintain in effect exclusive control. 
I do not think that is a good thing. We also have the same thing 
with the Canadian Wheat Board where it is a producer funded 
body and yet the Canadian government maintains control and I 
believe not in our best interest.
<P>
	I understand the need to maintain standards. Canada is one of 
the most reliable exporters of grain. It has a very high quality 
and we have maintained a very good standard, one that could 
easily be done by having the Canadian Grain Commission have 
exclusive control through an elected board of directors rather 
than appointed as they are now by the federal government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8892"> 8892 </A></B>
<P>
	If producers are paying the bill they should have control. 
They should have an elected board of officers. This could easily 
accomplish the same goals of trying to maintain very good 
standards in order to maintain our customers abroad.
<P>
	This bill reduces the responsibility of the Canadian Grain 
Commission in a couple of areas. Setting upper limits on tariffs 
is one area where it is going to be backing off on controls. The 
other is reduced payment of losses to the level of the bond of the 
Canadian Grain Commission on the companies that are required 
to post a bond.
<P>
	The Canadian Grain Commission by maintaining this system 
of bonds must maintain and monitor that these bonds are 
actually effective. When a grain company is required to post a 
bond, if it fails the Canadian Grain Commission's liability is 
only to the level of the bond.
<P>
	I have information from some industry people that grain 
dealers who post a bond only have to get back to that level at the 
end of every month. It is not uncommon for smaller under 
capitalized grain dealers to be four or more times over exposed 
to their bond level.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	What message are we sending out to producers? That these 
people have a bond which may be up to four times less than what 
is really required? We should be sending a message of buyer 
beware. They should check out these companies and see what 
their reliability is and not give a false sense of security to 
producers when they are dealing with companies by believing 
that there is a bond in place to take care of the problems should 
the company fail.
<P>
	In the past there have been cases where companies have failed 
and there has been heavy exposure by the taxpayer. That is not in 
our interests either. We need a situation whereby producers deal 
with companies based on their merit and historical performance. 
Let them know they have to check out these bonds. It does not 
have to be done by the Canadian Grain Commission. A false 
sense of security is being put in place.
<P>
	My main concern is that the regulation of our whole grain 
industry is far too high. I talked about the Canadian Grain 
Commission but it also applies to the Canadian Wheat Board. 
The previous speaker talked about the Canadian Wheat Board 
and how important it is. I agree. We are also calling for a 
democratic election to the board of the directors of the wheat 
board rather than appointments to the board. This would bring 
responsibility back to this body which is very badly needed.
<P>
	In this heavily controlled industry, including the Canadian 
Wheat Board, a farmer who is producing his own wheat is 
required to establish a mill on his farm to grind it into flour. The 
farmer has to buy his own wheat back through the Canadian 
Wheat Board and apply for permits to do that. This is ludicrous 
in a time when people are looking for opportunities to expand 
their business. This is the kind of heavy handed tactic we would 
see in Russia.
<P>
	The Western Grain Transportation Act is another area of 
overregulation in the industry. It is a heavy government hand 
where it is not required. Grain is being shipped to Thunder Bay, 
back to Regina and then south across into the United States. It is 
called backtracking. It costs the taxpayers hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to continue this practice just to qualify for 
the Crow benefit. It is absolute nonsense. We would have 
expected this type of thing in Russia 10 years ago.
<P>
	These are the kinds of controls we see on the Canadian grain 
industry. As a grain farmer I know others believe this is very 
much a business where we can compete very well by 
government getting out of our faces and letting us get on with 
our job. We will find the markets. We will find the most 
effective way of getting it there at the lowest cost.
<P>
	As long as we have a heavily regulated industry like we have 
in the three areas I can think of offhand, the Canadian Grain 
Commission, the Canadian Wheat Board, both of which by the 
way are undemocratic, and the western grain transportation 
authority, it shows that we have some serious problems. In fact 
we do not even comply with the new World Trade Organization 
regulations. There is a better system outside of our country than 
there is internally. Things have to be resolved.
<P>
	I want to take a moment to talk about the Canadian Wheat 
Board advisory committee and the recent elections. The member 
for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake talked about how this was a 
very important body. That is not how it is regarded in my 
constituency nor is it generally throughout the industry.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board advisory committee is just that. It 
is an advisory committee. It has absolutely no authority and no 
power. In the industry it is really seen as a very minor player in 
the whole scheme of things. It is seen as a public relations 
exercise for the Canadian Wheat Board. If the government put as 
much stock in the idea of having elections for the Canadian 
Wheat Board directors as it does for the Canadian Wheat Board 
advisory committee then we would be getting somewhere.
<P>
	We have to apply the same principle. How can there be an 
elected advisory committee and not an elected board of directors 
of the wheat board? I think some of the reason is that the 
Canadian Wheat Board commissioners do not want to open up 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8893"> 8893 </A></B>
<P>
the books, which is something that should be required. Let 
producers see what is happening in the Canadian Wheat Board, 
see if  there are any inefficiencies taking place or any areas 
where we can make some changes.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Producers do not want to get rid of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
What I have heard from many constituents is that they want to 
open up the board and have it elected, effective and accountable. 
That is the most important thing.
<P>
	When members talk about how important this election was to 
the Canadian Wheat Board advisory committee, that is certainly 
not what I am hearing throughout the country. Less than 40 per 
cent of farmers voted in this election. It was actually one of the 
higher ones, but generally it is not regarded as an effective 
board. People just take it as a joke and that is the reason we are 
not getting good turnouts. If we had an election for Canadian 
Wheat Board commissioners themselves I think we would see a 
very high turnout.
<P>
	I will close by saying that with this heavily regulated grain 
industry in Canada we have to ask the question: Who is asking 
for this? It is certainly not the farmers I am listening to. People 
are saying to open up the process. These producers want to do 
more than grow grain. They want to have more control in saying 
how this grain is marketed and transported. They do not want a 
regulated industry. They want deregulation.
<P>
	I believe that Canada and Russia passed in the night about two 
or three years ago. At least Russia is going in the right direction. 
It is trying to deregulate its industry while we are still going in 
the opposite direction. I encourage the government to open up 
the process or at least start by making these institutions 
democratic. That is the very least we can do.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-56, an Act to 
amend the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, be read the 
third time and passed.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, today we begin the last stage of the 
debate on the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. This 
debate has now been going on for ten years, a decade, and we are 
finally at its conclusion.
<P>
	During this decade, several eminent persons were involved in 
the debate on the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 
including the former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the 
Environment, Jean Charest, and the former Minister of the 
Environment, Lucien Bouchard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to do a thumbnail sketch of how we got from 
where we were in 1984 to where we are in 1994 on 
environmental assessment.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	Ten years ago the federal government of the day introduced 
guidelines to be followed in the environmental assessment of all 
projects which in one way or another involved the Government 
of Canada. The intention of those guidelines was undoubtedly 
good, but the result was chaos.
<P>
	The guidelines were vague and subjective. On the one hand 
they were incredibly complicated and on the other hand they 
were incomplete. The result unfortunately was arbitrary and 
haphazard decision making. That led to over 40 significant court 
challenges, probably the most famous of which would be 
characterized as the Rafferty-Alameda and the Oldman dam 
decisions.
<P>
	Business people were frustrated because they could not get a 
straight answer on whether their projects were environmentally 
acceptable or not. Environmentalists were frustrated because 
the cause of protecting the environment was lost under the 
weight of hundreds of thousands of pages of legal documents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8894"> 8894 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal and provincial governments were bogged down in 
legal battles on obscure points of interpretation. The people of 
Canada felt excluded from the environmental assessment 
process because, as individuals, they did not have the millions 
needed to become involved in such battles, even if these fights 
had a direct impact on their daily life, their immediate 
environment and their economic prosperity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All political parties in Parliament soon realized the need for a 
law clearly defining what constitutes federal responsibility in 
environmental assessment. After a number of years beginning 
with the then Minister of the Environment, Mr. Tom McMillan, 
through to Minister Bouchard through to Mr. Charest, 
Parliament passed that law with the support of every single 
party. Unfortunately, once the law passed for a number of 
reasons it sat on the shelf and was never actually brought into 
force by the previous government.
<P>
	During the last election, the Prime Minister promised that if 
elected a Liberal government would proclaim the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act. It would then introduce 
amendments to simplify, open up and strengthen federal 
environmental assessments.
<P>
	Two months ago I was pleased to announce in this House that 
we would keep the Prime Minister's red book promise and 
proclaim the act. At the same time I was happy to introduce 
amendments to make the act fairer, more open, more 
straightforward and indeed to make the decision making more 
public.
<P>
	With the passage of Bill C-56 the government will keep its 
red book promise. With the passage of this legislation 
Parliament, we the parliamentarians of Canada, will put our 
country at the forefront of nations in the world in approaching 
the extremely important issue of environmental assessment.
<P>
	As our Prime Minister leaves for Miami today for the 
hemispheric summit, one of the issues that underpins economic 
development around the world is the necessity for open, 
transparent and public environmental assessment. Certainly this 
legislation will indeed underline Canada's pre-eminent position 
as a country that respects the open public and transparent 
process before projects are begun.
<P>
	Environmental assessment must be a powerful tool for the 
future in which economic health, environmental health and 
human health are integrated. Indeed, that is one of the functions 
of the summit.
<P>
	With that understanding in mind my colleagues and I have 
spent the last year listening carefully to environmentalists, 
academics, community representatives, business, labour and 
other levels of government and indeed most important, 
individual Canadians. We want to make sure the amendments we 
are proposing will advance the cause of sustainable  
development in the best possible sense. There are three simple 
but key amendments.
<P>
	First, the federal government is implementing the principle of 
one project, one assessment for federal endeavours. We do not 
want a complicated process where there is a big assessment at 
the planning stage of a project, a second assessment at the 
implementation stage and then another assessment every time 
somebody decides to make a change. What is more, we do not 
want a whole group of federal departments and agencies 
conducting individual assessments on the same project. We 
want environmental assessments to be tough and fair. One 
comprehensive assessment of a project serves everyone's 
interest much better than several half-baked separate 
assessments.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Secondly, this bill guarantees the general public the right to 
participate in major environmental assessments by providing 
funding for their participation. This idea of involving the public 
was first proposed in 1987 by the former Minister of the 
Environment, the Hon. Lucien Bouchard, but was set aside in the 
bill passed in 1992.
<P>
	We always believed that it was a mistake to set the issue of 
popular financing aside. Today, we are pleased to be able to 
repair this deficiency in the legislation. It is all very well to say 
that everyone has a right to participate, but we must ensure that 
they have the resources required to really be able to do so.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is one thing to say that people have a say. It is another thing 
to give them the tools to exercise that right.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This amendment entrenches the public's right to really 
participate. It is the most basic common sense that those who 
have to live with a project have their say.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Third, Bill C-56 will take away the power of any individual 
cabinet minister to ignore or overrule environmental 
assessments produced by an independent panel.
<P>
	Recommendations of an individual panel can only be 
modified by a decision of the entire cabinet. Any changes to an 
independent assessment will require a written, detailed public 
explanation for those changes.
<P>
	This amendment ends the era of backroom deals made at the 
expense of the environment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am proud that our government has the honour of giving 
Canada a progressive, fair, practical, sensible environmental 
assessment system. It introduces a new way of thinking. From 
now on, we will make decisions with due consideration for their 
environmental impact. The environment completely disregards 
man-made geographical boundaries.
<P>
	The Prime Minister constantly repeats how important 
Canadians consider the environment to be and we must find 
answers together. Canada is working actively to harmonize 
environmental assessments throughout the world and will be 
pleased to sign agreements on this. I know that every one of us 
here in this House wants to protect the environment and that no 
one wants to act against the environment for short-term gain.
<P>
	I hope that our efforts to achieve positive results throughout 
the world will have the same results here in Canada. We must 
work together to avoid duplication and overlap.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have demonstrated our willingness to co-operate on 
environmental assessment by signing harmonization 
agreements with two provinces already. We are a few months 
away from signing harmonization agreements with two other 
provinces. We are actively negotiating comparable 
comprehensive agreements across the country.
<P>
	We want to show that Canada's federalism can be flexible. We 
want to show that at the federal level we are doing everything we 
can to make Canada work better for the environment, for 
individual Canadians, for the protection of the heritage of our 
children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Unfortunately, one government recently decided to boycott 
the harmonization discussions: the Quebec government.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	All those interested in protecting the environment must ask 
the Quebec government if it really wants to avoid duplication 
and overlap. Come back to the negotiation table; come back to 
talk to us. We are not only prepared to speed up the 
harmonization process, but also to meet Quebec's officials to 
improve our environment. When it comes to the environment, 
no one must act alone.
<P>
	Sustainable development is a common goal for all; it is 
everyone's responsibility and it knows no frontier. It is 
important not to get involved in jurisdiction battles, so as to 
ensure the best possible environment for our children.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The amendments before Parliament will not create 
environmental paradise on earth overnight. They will, however, 
produce a solid, thoughtful and democratic foundation for 
environmental assessments and for making sure that 
environmental thinking is a central  component of planning. 
That is what sustainable development is all about, making the 
right decisions before the fact instead of cleaning up after the 
fact.
<P>
	Future decision makers, the young people of today and their 
children, will have to think differently than the way we thought 
in the past. Thanks to this legislation we believe they will have 
the tools necessary to translate environmental goodwill into 
every day decision making.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The new Canadian Environmental Assessment Act is 
extraordinary in that it changes our way of thinking. We must 
think before we act. We must think about sustainable 
development and we must think about the fact that the 
environment knows no borders.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One project-one assessment, public involvement, 
government accountability are three simple principles 
translated into reality by today's amendments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are ready to translate into reality the principles stated by 
the former Minister of the Environment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With these three measures we will finally be ready to move 
forward in January with the proclamation of the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act and the agency. We can finally 
move forward to a new and wiser generation of environmental 
assessment.
<P>
	It has taken us 10 years to reach the point where finally we are 
ready to move ahead. I want to thank the thousands of people 
who participated in that process.
<P>
	In absentia, I would like to thank the Leader of the Opposition 
who was one of the first thinkers of how we could remake 
environmental assessment. I want to thank the former Deputy 
Prime Minister of Canada, the Minister of the Environment. He 
supported this new process of environmental assessment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to thank the thousands of Canadians and Quebecers 
who understand so well that the environmental assessment 
process affects everyone's life, and that we not only have a right 
but a duty to participate in it. We hope that the three simple 
amendments which we propose-one project, one assessment; 
public financing, and participation of every minister in the 
decision-making process-will improve the process set in place 
by the Hon. Lucien Bouchard.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the House. I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to speak on this bill today.
<P>
	Bill C-56 proposes amendments to three sections of the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. The basic principle 
behind environmental assessment is addressing concerns in the 
early stages of development in order that action can be taken 
before the project is too far along. This is a relatively new 
process at the federal level.
<P>
	A number of years ago EARP, the environmental assessment 
and review process, was introduced with guidelines. Not until 
CEAA was passed by Parliament in June 1992 did we have any 
meaningful legislation at the federal level. The Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act replaces the EARP guidelines 
and provides for a new process of federal environmental 
assessment.
<P>
	It has taken two years for this bill to be proclaimed into law. 
Although the bill was tabled two years ago the regulations were 
only published two months ago.
<P>
	The minister has stated that the amended act will be 
proclaimed into law by January 1995. Once CEAA is proclaimed 
federal environmental assessment will be legislatively 
entrenched.
<P>
	As this process is still quite new at the federal level, there are 
still many bumps to be ironed out. The amendments to the act 
contained in Bill C-56 attempt to address some of the problems 
already encountered with federal environmental assessment.
<P>
	Bill C-56 proposes to amend the act in three ways. First it 
requires participant funding be established by the Minister of 
the Environment. Second, it encourages, where possible, that 
one federal environmental assessment be carried out per project. 
Third, it requires cabinet approval instead of ministerial 
approval of responses to panel recommendations.
<P>
	At first sight these three recommendations appear quite 
positive. However a closer look at these amendments reveals 
that they represent few initiatives on the part of the government. 
These three amendments do little to change the status quo. 
Further, they are inadequate in living up to what they attempt to 
accomplish.
<P>
	During the course of the subcommittee hearings we heard 
from several environmental experts regarding this bill. Many of 
these presentations expressed a common concern that Bill C-56 
does not live up to its expectations. Amendments to the act to 
guarantee intervener funding, to broaden the scope of decision 
making authority and to reduce timely and costly duplication, to 
guarantee one assessment per project have been requested since 
consultations on reforming the act began seven years ago. These 
are worthy goals that need to be addressed but the goals are 
simply not realized in this bill.
<P>
	I would like to address each of these three amendments in 
turn. The first clause amends section 4 of the act and adds a 
clause which emphasizes the need for responsible authorities to 
carry out their actions in a co-ordinated and efficient manner 
with a view to eliminating unnecessary duplication in the 
environmental assessment process. This clause has been 
referred to as the one project, one assessment clause.
<P>
	As I mentioned during second reading of this bill, the 
harmonization process simply does not go far enough. Although 
the possibility for more than one federal assessment is reduced, 
the fact remains there is still duplication of the federal and 
provincial assessments as well as the possibility for federal 
duplication between various departments.
<P>
	Theoretically the amendment for one assessment per project 
minimizes the potential for duplication of federal activities. 
Where more than one department is involved, federal authorities 
are to attempt to co-ordinate environmental assessment 
activity. However I want to make it clear that this legislation 
does not mandate one assessment per project. This amendment 
merely makes it mandatory to take into account existing 
assessments.
<P>
	The bill changes the assessment process so that departmental 
assessments should occur simultaneously rather than 
sequentially. In other words, there could be simultaneous 
co-ordinated effort but there will still not necessarily be one 
assessment.
<P>
	If decision making triggers occur at different points in time, a 
single project may still endure more than one assessment. 
Therefore multiple federal assessments are still possible under 
the act as long as there are different federal triggers for any 
project.
<P>
	It is well understood that the single most critical issue to 
industry is the length and the uncertainty of the assessment 
process.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Although I am pleased that this government is taking into 
account the need to co-ordinate the efforts, this bill lacks teeth. 
It lacks the teeth it needs to give it some meaning. We simply 
must stop duplicating our efforts and this bill does not 
decisively address that concern.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8897"> 8897 </A></B>
<P>
	As it stands the bill still fails to live up to Canadian 
expectations for one assessment per project. The process needs 
to be co-ordinated to ensure there is no duplication between 
federal departments. This legislation would be improved if a 
lead responsible authority could assist in ensuring that one 
federal assessment is carried out. This would be a particularly 
good role for the agency. Such a responsibility would give the 
agency a greater role in the assessment process and would assist 
government in streamlining its functions and ensuring that one 
assessment per project becomes a reality, not just a 
consideration.
<P>
	The agency could be given the responsibility to notify 
departments of their potential involvement in an upcoming 
environmental assessment, thus streamlining and co-ordinating 
the process. The agency could be the most effective body to 
ensure that the principle of one assessment per project truly 
becomes a reality.
<P>
	We must not only deal with duplication between federal 
departments but also address the duplication between federal 
and provincial governments. At present we currently have two 
federal-provincial harmonization agreements in place, one with 
Alberta and one with Manitoba. Bilateral agreements as the 
minister mentioned between federal and provincial 
governments are being negotiated at other levels and they are 
intended to reduce duplication by allowing for a co-ordinated 
process.
<P>
	We should be working toward a common set of environmental 
standards and goals for both federal and provincial levels of 
government. Federal-provincial harmonization agreements 
need to be worked out and signed by the provinces and the 
federal government to ensure that we truly have one joint 
assessment per project.
<P>
	Let me remind the House of the horrendous cost for 
duplication. Forty-five per cent of federal programs 
representing expenditures of $40 billion overlap and compete to 
varying degrees with provincial programs. That comes straight 
out of the Treasury Board. Canadians simply cannot afford this 
costly duplication of services.
<P>
	The second amendment to the act seeks to ensure that 
responses to public panel recommendations are decided by 
cabinet. This means that the decision to act or to reject on a 
panel recommendation is not made solely by the Minister of the 
Environment but by the cabinet. This amendment broadens the 
decision making authority to include more members in the 
decision. However, it simply does not go far enough.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the spirit of this clause is to ensure that 
responses to public panel recommendations are decided by 
cabinet, but cabinet remains undefined. Cabinet could be a few 
ministers or it could refer to the full cabinet. The term cabinet is 
very loose. Cabinet has many versions and it can be many 
things. There are inner cabinets, outer cabinets and committees 
of cabinet. The  term cabinet is simply too loose. As it stands, 
important environmental decisions can still be controlled by two 
or three ministers with their own agendas.
<P>
	Current government amendments represent only a small step 
forward and they change very little. If we are to ensure that the 
assessment process is fair and democratic this clause must be 
amended to replace cabinet or governor in council by order in 
council.
<P>
	Not all responses by governor in council are orders in council. 
Order in council responses are more formalized and must be 
published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> and tabled in Parliament. This 
amendment, which would have improved the procedure, I 
proposed during report stage and was unfortunately rejected by 
the government.
<P>
	Another problem with this bill is that there are no guidelines 
on how or when cabinet review will be undertaken. There are no 
guidelines which spell out which projects will be assessed or 
which assessments, once completed, will be forwarded to 
cabinet for review. I would hope guidelines for environmental 
assessment procedures would make it very clear to all 
participants exactly what the rules are.
<P>
	As it stands, there is nothing to prevent cabinet from reading 
the report and ignoring important recommendations. There is 
nothing to prevent a few members of the cabinet from rejecting 
panel recommendations purely on a political basis.
<P>
	In addition, it is not clear whether the cabinet would be able to 
change either a panel's recommendations or a mediator's report. 
There is no clear definition of what the cabinet can or cannot do. 
This must be clarified in the regulations that guide the 
assessment process, otherwise we are no farther ahead than we 
were before.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-56 is yet another example of this government's failure 
to live up to its red book promises. Bill C-56 effectively takes 
decision making authority from the minister and gives it to an 
undefined cabinet. What it does not do is give authority to the 
agency or panels as promised in the red book.
<P>
	The Liberal red book promises to amend the act to shift 
decision making powers to an independent Canadian 
environmental assessment agency subject to an appeal to the 
cabinet. The agency's relationship to government would be 
roughly similar to that between the CRTC and the cabinet.
<P>
	This agency simply has none of the powers of the CRTC as 
promised in the red book. For example, this bill does not entrust 
decision making powers to an independent Canadian 
environmental assessment agency subject to an appeal to 
cabinet.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8898"> 8898 </A></B>
<P>
	The head of the agency is not independent from the minister. 
The minister appoints this person to the position, which again 
makes it more of a patronage appointment than an independent 
agency. In no way is this agency at arm's length from the 
government.
<P>
	Section 7 of the CRTC legislation gives the commission 
licensing powers which are essentially final decision making 
powers. There is clearly no similar commission being proposed 
in this act. The panel or the CEAA is not given decision making 
powers or powers as responsible authority.
<P>
	In addition, the CRTC under the Broadcasting Act has all the 
powers of the superior court. This is not the case with the 
assessment agency.
<P>
	The CRTC is a quasi-judicial commission. This is also not the 
case with any of the decision making powers under the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act.
<P>
	The principles of fairness of decision making which are 
required for the CRTC are not required for the process of 
decision making under the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act.
<P>
	During the hearings on this bill several witnesses presented 
concerns that Bill C-56 does not give the agency or the panels 
the power to make decisions with an appeal to cabinet. This bill 
as presently drafted fails to address these concerns.
<P>
	Clearly responsibility for environmental assessments are not 
in this act vested in an independent agency as promised in the 
red book and the relationship of the CRTC to government bears 
little relation to that between the agency and government.
<P>
	Yet when a motion was put forward during report stage 
amendments to recognize the agency as an independent body, 
the Liberals voted it down and in doing so voted against their 
own red book promise. We hear so much about the red book, yet 
here we have the government not only ignoring a promise, but 
actually voting it down in the House.
<P>
	There appears to be a great discrepancy between government 
promises in the red book and government actions in the form of 
legislation.
<P>
	In Ontario the assessment process has been amended to make 
all decision making by an environmental board binding unless 
appealed to cabinet. In practice most decisions are final. This 
process works, plus it saves time and money.
<P>
	I would now like to move on to the third and final amendment 
of this bill dealing with participant funding. Section 58(1)(i) of 
the act currently enables the minister to establish a funding 
program to facilitate public participation in mediation and 
assessment by review panels. Bill C-56 proposes to repeal this 
measure and replace it with a new section that requires the 
minister to establish a participant funding program rather than 
leaving it up to the minister's discretion as is currently the case.
<P>
	Of all the stakeholders in the environmental decision making 
process, ordinary Canadians are those most directly affected by 
the environmental impact of projects. Participant funding is an 
important tool as it enables stakeholders to participate in the 
decision making process.
<P>
	As I mentioned in the House on second reading, regulations 
are needed to guide the amount and distribution of participant 
funding. I recommend that the government broaden the scope 
when developing these regulations. The participant funding 
program will not be up and running until criteria are set up. 
Regulations could take as long as a year before they are brought 
into force which means that it will be some time before the 
participant funding program becomes a reality.
<P>
	Participant funding regulations should ensure that those 
people directly affected by a project have an opportunity to 
participate. However, there must be guidelines to ensure it does 
not become a growth industry, funding courtesy of the taxpayer.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	We do not want to start an intervener industry. Funding would 
be at a level to allow effective participation by those who can 
demonstrate they will be affected by a project. Guidelines for 
participation should consider whether the applicant represents a 
clearly ascertainable interest that should be heard at the hearing 
and whether separate representation of the interest would assist 
the panel and contribute to the hearing.
<P>
	Guidelines should also take into consideration whether the 
applicant has attempted to bring other related interests under an 
umbrella group that would facilitate the retention of common 
experts and council and whether direction is included that only 
those costs that are directly related to the preparation and 
presentation of a submission are recoverable.
<P>
	Regard should be given to whether there is a requirement for 
submissions and presentations to be conducted economically 
and last, whether a special power is required to deny costs in 
cases in which a submission or presentation is unnecessary, 
irrelevant, improper or the cost claim is excessive.
<P>
	Alberta currently has established criteria in place for 
participant funding and could serve as a guide when regulations 
are drafted. According to Environment Canada sources the 
amount of participant funding is limited to $1.2 million per year 
and comes from the green plan. Although funds are currently 
limited by the budget, the number of dollars is open ended as the 
government can decide to increase or decrease these funds in 
future years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8899"> 8899 </A></B>
<P>
	One proposed amendment which I brought up in committee 
and which I feel still merits consideration for this act is that 
of proponents paying a portion of the intervener funding. How 
much the proponent would pay could be at the discretion of the 
minister or included in the regulations.
<P>
	Some of the witnesses on C-56 raised concerns that 
intervener funding tends to be quite small, sometimes to the 
point of undermining the usefulness of having any critique 
whatsoever. As long as the funding comes only from taxpayers, 
funding will be less than if the proponent paid for a portion of 
the fund.
<P>
	Let me make it clear, however, that I am not suggesting 
proponents should be forced to pay for every interested critic of 
a project. Guidelines would need to be quite specific in this area 
to protect from abuse. Several of the witnesses also suggested 
the agency be granted the authority to award participant funding 
under ministerial guidelines rather than vesting the authority 
solely with the minister.
<P>
	This suggestion should be looked into either as an amendment 
to the act or as a regulation guiding the participant funding 
regulations. This amendment to the act would allow the agency 
to be empowered with some decision making powers, decision 
making powers that the agency is sorely lacking at present.
<P>
	Participant funding regulations need to identify what the 
money can be used for and accountability must be assured. This 
amendment as it stands does not ensure that all Canadians and 
interest groups can participate equally in a full and meaningful 
way in all phases of various environmental assessment 
processes. This is beyond the scope of the bill. However, some 
choices must be made in the regulations which will ensure there 
is a selection process to ensure those parties that play a 
significant role have adequate funding.
<P>
	In addition, attention must be paid to the fact that funds are 
not endless, nor are the timeframes for the assessment process 
without some constraints. It is not fair to subject one project to 
an endless tirade of inquiries. There must be a balance in the 
process to ensure a fair and reasonable assessment takes place.
<P>
	In concluding I wish to take the opportunity to highlight 
another problem with this bill. During second reading I raised 
concerns regarding the amount of ministerial discretion allowed 
in the act. I noted the minister may or may not call for a review, 
and the fact that the minister appoints the mediator or panel 
members. These concerns were also raised by a number of 
witnesses.
<P>
	Panel members are appointed by the minister. Therefore there 
is no permanent body that one could refer to as an agency that 
decides who will staff a particular hearing. The panel approach 
is hardly an independent agency, as members can be appointed 
at the whim of the minister to suit particular cases as the  
minister sees fit. This has direct influence on the outcome of any 
panel decision.
<P>
	As well, during second reading I addressed concerns about the 
exclusion and inclusion list that makes up the regulations 
guiding what is and is not to be included in the assessment 
process. In addition, the fact that there are no regulations 
regarding the transport of hazardous waste still concerns me.
<P>
	It is with regret I note the government has shown little 
initiative with the bill. The act as it stands remains virtually 
unchanged. We desperately need to move forward on 
environmental issues. There is little point in spinning our 
wheels for the sake of appearances. The bill requires reworking 
before it will begin to live up to the spirit that was intended. I 
have suggested some improvements for the bill, including my 
motion to change the final decision making authority from 
cabinet to order in council.
<P>
	In conclusion, the government had the opportunity to move 
legislation that would have had a substantial impact on how 
environmental assessment is carried out in Canada. 
Unfortunately it failed in the attempt.

	The House resumed from November 1 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to speak today to Motion No. 257 under Private 
Members' Business. The motion seeks to recognize the efforts 
of certain important Canadians both in Lower Canada and in 
Upper Canada. I applaud the initiative because it is important 
for us to recognize the efforts of those important figures in our 
history.
<P>
	It is important to recall the efforts of such people as William 
Lyon Mackenzie, the great Liberal leader who was the 
grandfather of a great Liberal Prime Minister, William Lyon 
Mackenzie King. It is very important to recognize the leadership 
efforts of Louis-Joseph Papineau, an important reform leader in 
Lower Canada. I applaud that initiative.
<P>
	Unfortunately where I take some exception to the motion is 
that it is somewhat incomplete. It ignores the efforts of some 
important Canadians from the maritime region or Atlantic 
Canada, most notably the great leader from Nova Scotia, Joseph 
Howe, who was very instrumental in helping to achieve 
responsible government in the country. It is absolutely silent on 
the leadership efforts of Canadians such as Mr. Howe.
<P>
	One would have to question somewhat the historical accuracy 
of the motion as I see it before me. It speaks of the Patriots of 
Lower Canada and the reformers of Upper Canada. Then it 
equates those to geographic regions as being Quebec and 
Canada. For those of us who have had an opportunity to study 
Canadian history that is historically inaccurate. The then Lower 
Canada is roughly equivalent to the province of Quebec, which 
has geographically grown many times since becoming part of 
Canada or since 1867.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	To equate the then Upper Canada with Canada is somewhat 
misleading. One would conclude that it is the Canada of today. 
Indeed that is very inaccurate. It ignores the Atlantic provinces, 
the two founding members of Canada, Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick. As we know, under Confederation we had four 
founding provinces. This particular historical equation ignores 
Atlantic Canada and all provinces that subsequently became 
members of Confederation. It is somewhat historically 
inaccurate.
<P>
	Its intention is probably good, but it is important that we 
recognize in as total way as possible the efforts of all Canadians 
such as Mr. Howe and others.
<P>
	I have some difficulty supporting the motion. I can support its 
main thrust but having noted its inaccuracies I just spoke to and 
the incompleteness of the motion I would like to move the 
following amendment. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all of the words after the words 
``democratic government''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It then becomes more accurate historically. It then addresses 
the concerns I raised about ignoring the efforts of certain very 
important Canadians in the fight for responsible government, 
particularly those from Atlantic Canada and most notably Mr. 
Howe. I submit that my amendment is an improvement upon the 
member's motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> While the Chair is waiting to examine 
the amendment, we might continue with the debate and the 
ruling will be made in due course as to the receivability of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to discuss the 
motion put forth by the member for Verchères. It would have the 
government officially recognize the historical contribution of 
the Patriots of Lower Canada and the reformers of Upper Canada 
to the establishment of a system of responsible democratic 
government in Canada and in Quebec, as did the Government of 
Quebec in 1982 by proclaiming by order a national Patriots day.
<P>
	It is extremely troubling for me to stand before the House and 
unequivocally support a motion dealing with an issue that 
historians have not even settled on. The hon. member is asking 
us as parliamentarians to stand and officially recognize the 
contribution of the Patriotes and reformers. That point is clear. I 
cannot.
<P>
	This is an issue which Canadians will have to make an 
individual value judgment about and the appropriateness of 
recognizing the extent of the contributions of the Patriotes and 
reformers. It would be wrong for parliamentarians as a whole to 
make a judgment about an event in history that is still 
controversial in the minds of many Canadians.
<P>
	In fact what lies at the heart of the controversy is the methods 
used by the Patriotes and reformers. To some they are 
considered to be great Patriots. Yet to others they are considered 
to be nothing more than traitors who deserved what they 
received.
<P>
	I also state unequivocally that the Patriots and reformers have 
some legitimate concerns which need to be addressed. I am sure 
that everyone, and not only in the House but all Canadians, 
would agree with that.
<P>
	However we would be doing a great disservice to the idea that 
it is possible to have the freedom to debate ideas and achieve 
things through peaceful means, while at the same time lending 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8901"> 8901 </A></B>
<P>
credibility to the notion that the end  justifies the means, that it 
would be all right to raise arms against the state when there is a 
dispute. By no means do I support the idea that violence is a way 
to achieve a political end.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Support for the motion would then also be essentially a stamp 
of approval for the violence which took place during the revolts 
of 1837 and 1838. There were many deaths during those 
quasi-revolutions and I would certainly not want to suggest this 
is the proper way to bring about change.
<P>
	Let us now take a moment to look at a few of the major players 
of the Patriote and reform debate, because I feel it is important 
sometimes to look at the past as if the lessons learned are 
forgotten. We are doomed to relearn them.
<P>
	I also believe there are a number of similarities between the 
Party Patriote and the Bloc which need to be highlighted. In fact 
Papineau as Speaker of the House had no qualms about 
pocketing a large government salary while at the same time 
plotting his revolution. Interestingly enough we have seen much 
of the same during this 35th session of Parliament.
<P>
	Papineau was also quite happy to extract harsh levies from the 
habitants living on seigneuries in the Ottawa Valley and 
allowing English merchants to do the same.
<P>
	Papineau, through his charisma, focused habitant grievances 
against the English and reflected the fury of the francophone 
professional class who, as they saw it, had been systematically 
denied government advancement.
<P>
	He also headed a party which demanded economic 
development at the local and regional level. Their concerns 
seem to be much of the same type of rhetoric to which many of 
us have listened every day in the House.
<P>
	It is extremely important to illustrate that the lower Canadian 
revolution failed not only because of the division of the province 
into French and English but because of the divisions among the 
French themselves and of the type of men who attempted to 
make it. To upset a regime requires more than oratory, more than 
a prophetic fanatic such as Papineau was. It requires the support 
of the masses. The Patriotes had none of this.
<P>
	Joseph Howe was primarily responsible for the election of a 
majority of reformers in Nova Scotia. He managed to bring 
about political change and bring about responsible government 
without having to resort to violence. This would be a good 
lesson for everyone to remember.
<P>
	There is a more subtle lesson to be learned from all this, that 
the politicians might think they know what is best in terms of the 
best interests of society and those who encompass it, but it is 
ultimately up to the citizens of that society to determine what is 
best for them. Politicians better start listening to the people and 
not their own rhetoric.
<P>
	Another key problem with the motion is the narrowness of its 
scope. It does not even attempt to recognize that a lot of people 
have made significant contributions to responsible government 
in the country other than simply the Patriots and reformers, 
many of whom are from western Canada. These other 
individuals would include William Aberhaart, Ernest Manning 
of the Alberta Social Credit and Agnes Macphail of the 
Progressives who was the first woman ever elected to the House 
of Commons. Let us not forget about the contributions of Henry 
Wisewood of the Alberta wing of the Progressives during the 
1920s.
<P>
	A final problem we see with the motion is the fact that we 
already celebrate the contributions of Canadians from the past 
on Canada Day. It is a time when Canadians can look back and 
reflect on all those individuals who contributed in some form or 
another in terms of greater representative democratic 
governments.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will not impugn any motive or agenda beyond 
the motion. Yet many people feel that the motion appears to be 
the legitimization of a rebellion in the dismantling of the state 
apparatus, the legitimization of the use of force. Therefore I 
cannot support it.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier the reformers, Patriots and all their 
followers certainly have enriched Canada's history. In opposing 
the motion I do not want to belittle their contribution in any way. 
However I am concerned that if we legitimize the actions of 
those such as the Patriots we will be sending out the wrong 
message to those Quebecois who are sovereignists.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	The PQ seem to be using the battles of 1837 and 1838 to 
legitimize its struggles against Canadian federalism. A Patriotes 
in Quebec has become anti-English, anti-federalist. The 
original Patriots fought for responsible government while the 
PQ Patriotes seemed to be fighting for the demise of this great 
country.
<P>
	It is for these reasons I urge all the members of the House to 
vote against Motion No. 257.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before recognizing the hon. member 
for Richmond-Wolfe, I wish to say that the amendment 
proposed by the hon. member for London-Middlesex is in 
order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As it is in order it is therefore an amendment on which we will 
vote next week.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first I would like to say to the member of the Reform Party who 
just spoke that we recognize English Canada and anglophone 
culture. They are our friends. And now, I welcome this 
opportunity to take part, at the request of my party, in the debate 
on the motion presented by the hon. member for Verchères, a 
motion that reads as follows: That, in the opinion of this House,  
the government should officially recognize the historical 
contribu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8902"> 8902 </A></B>
<P>
tion of the Patriotes of Lower Canada and the Reformers of 
Upper Canada to the establishment of a system of responsible 
democratic government in Canada and in Quebec, as did the 
Government of Quebec in 1982 by proclaiming by order a 
national patriots' day.
<P>
	The dramatic events known as the Rebellion of 1837-38 have 
often been depicted in textbooks and travel guides as the actions 
of a band of criminals who challenged the established order. The 
purpose of the motion submitted by the hon. member for 
Verchères is to rectify this perception and to recognize officially 
the historic contribution of the Patriotes of Lower Canada and 
the Reformers of Upper Canada towards establishing genuinely 
democratic and responsible government in Canada and in 
Quebec.
<P>
	Perhaps I should make myself clear at this point. We are 
talking about recognizing the merits of the Patriotes, not about 
rehabilitating them or obtaining a pardon, as though they were 
criminals. In fact, we think it is high time the federal 
government recognized the fact that these events were part of 
the historic current of social and political unrest that affected 
both the colonies and their mother countries in the 18th and 19th 
centuries.
<P>
	In Canada these events, which occurred at a time of great 
political upheaval in Western Europe, were centred in Ontario or 
Upper Canada, in Quebec or Lower Canada, and in Nova Scotia. 
The goals of the Patriotes of Lower Canada and the Reformers of 
Upper Canada were threefold. Basically they were fighting for 
civil and political rights, for the establishment of truly 
democratic and responsible institutions, and for the 
emancipation of their respective nations.
<P>
	Above all, they were seeking recognition of the people of 
Lower and Upper Canada as nations capable of taking control of 
their own future. Any colony hopes one day to become the 
master of its own political and economic destiny. In 1840, the 
Act of Union completely denied our existence, ``a people 
without history'', it was said. The confederative pact of 1867 
seemed to want to establish a relationship based on the equality 
of two founding peoples, but in the history of this country, the 
francophone nation of North America has been confined to the 
status of an ethnic group, only a little harder to assimilate than 
other immigrants.
<P>
	The Patriotes reflected the awareness of French-speaking 
Canadians that they were a different nation. They wanted to 
obtain recognition of this fact from London and the other 
citizens of Canada. However, the definition of Canada in the 
Constitution Act, 1982, still does not reflect the reality of two 
founding peoples in Canadian society.
<P>
	The second goal was the establishment of truly democratic 
institutions. More specifically, the Patriotes demanded the 
establishment of the principle of responsible government or, in 
other words, the creation of an executive consisting primarily of 
members of the House of Assembly and responsible to it, that is, 
accountable to the people rather than to the British Crown.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Thanks to the action of the Patriotes and Reformers, we have 
inherited a system of responsible government as well as 
democratic institutions and traditions of such great value to the 
Western world.
<P>
	Finally, the third reason for the Patriotes and Reformers to 
revolt was, in large part, the civil, political and economic 
liberties that several nations were starting to exercise. These 
were commendable motives that left their mark on 19th century 
history. In fact, the late René Lévesque wrote, in a letter dated 
November 21, 1982, that the 1837-38 events and all the years 
leading to these events were undeniably motivated by a genuine 
and powerful democratic surge, coupled with a stronger than 
ever national assertiveness.
<P>
	Arguments against recognizing the Patriotes of Lower Canada 
and the Reformers of Upper Canada do not hold water. It was 
first argued that adding another public holiday to the calendar 
would be both costly and unjustified. Allow me to point out that, 
in the mind of my colleague from Verchères, there was never any 
question of adding a public holiday or establishing a national 
patriots' day in Canada. It was for information that the hon. 
member for Verchères referred, in his motion, to the national 
patriots' day proclaimed by the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	They then said that the violence associated with the 1837 
rebellion should not be condoned. Fine, but we must remember 
that the Patriotes and Reformers expressed their grievances and 
demands in pamphlets, newspaper articles, mass 
demonstrations, pleas and speeches in the House of Assembly 
for many years before some of them took up arms. This motion 
is not intended to justify or legitimize the 1837-38 rebellion but 
simply to pay tribute, regardless of these violent events, to these 
men and women who believed in the need to establish a system 
of responsible and truly democratic government.
<P>
	Some of my colleagues rightly pointed out that the Patriotes 
and Reformers are not the only ones who helped establish a 
system of responsible government in Canada. Although the 
Patriotes and Reformers are certainly not the only architects of 
our system of responsible government, their very significant 
contribution should not be ignored.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8903"> 8903 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why we, in the Official Opposition and the Bloc 
Quebecois, are proud to support the motion of our colleague 
from Verchères and to ask this House to approve it without 
reservation.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As no one else apparently wishes to 
speak, I recognize the hon. member for Verchères.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity to go over the comments made 
during these three hours of very useful and informative debate.
<P>
	It is my responsibility to conclude the debate on this motion, 
which I had the honour of tabling in this House, and which 
merely seeks to recognize the undeniable historical contribution 
of the Patriotes of Lower Canada and the Reformers of Upper 
Canada to the establishment of a system of responsible 
democratic government in Canada and in Quebec.
<P>
	Although I am a sovereignist, I have no intention of rejecting 
our common values and experiences. And the chapter of our 
history which saw the emergence of the patriot and reformer 
movement is part of those common experiences.
<P>
	I would like to read you an excerpt from a letter sent to me by 
a government member from Ontario. I do not think he will be 
upset, because I simply want to show to what extent these events 
are part of our common history.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	He writes: ``If there was a time in Canada's history when 
French-speaking and English-speaking people joined together 
to defend democracy, it was definitely during the 1837-38 
rebellion which shaped the country as we know it today. The 
violence which occurred in Upper and Lower Canada was 
minimal and short-lived, compared to what happened in just 
about any other country that experienced similar incidents. 
Since then, Canadians have resolved their differences through 
debate, rather than with arms. This explains why a separatist 
party is now the Official Opposition in Parliament, something I 
am proud of''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this was made possible essentially by the actions 
of the Patriotes of Lower Canada and the Reformers of Upper 
Canada.
<P>
	Contrary to what the Reform Party member claimed, 
Quebecers are not using the Patriotes to denigrate their 
English-speaking comPatriots. Some prominent Patriotes and 
Reformers were English-speaking, and we are proud that they 
participated in the Patriotes movement.
<P>
	My first speech in this House was to explain the relevance of 
this motion. This second opportunity allows me to correct a 
number of objections made by members of the other political 
parties in the more than two hours of debate on this motion.
<P>
	The first objection was that the Patriotes and the Reformers 
were not the only ones who contributed to the establishment of 
responsible government. We were reminded, and rightly so, of 
the invaluable contribution  of the Hon. Joseph Howe, a 
politician from Nova Scotia, who also contributed greatly to the 
establishment of a system of responsible government in Canada, 
and we recognize it. However, that does not mean that we should 
not also recognize the value of this structured movement which, 
for years, conveyed the aspirations of many people in Lower and 
Upper Canada.
<P>
	The Patriotes and the Reformers were, first of all, honest 
citizens-business people, politicians, farmers, 
professionals-who, before some of them opted for armed 
struggle, had tried to make their point democratically.
<P>
	We do not deny that they were not the only ones to whom we 
owe responsible government, but their very significant 
contribution cannot be ignored. Does the fact that we recently 
honoured the Canadian heroes who fought on the beaches of 
Normandy diminish in any way the merit of those who 
distinguished themselves at Vimy, Dieppe and Monte Cassino? 
Of course not, Mr. Speaker. It is self-evident.
<P>
	Then, honouring Patriotes and Reformers will in no way 
diminish our gratefulness to persons like Joseph Howe, 
something I wanted to stress in this House.
<P>
	Second objection. It has been said that it would be costly and 
unjustifiable to add a new legal holiday. We never said we 
wanted a legal holiday. We wasted almost an hour debating this, 
when it is not even in the motion.
<P>
	With your permission, I will quote from the presentation I 
made to the Sub-Committee on Private Members' Business, on 
May 11, to make sure that this motion was deemed votable. 
Allow me to quote myself: ``-the motion I am presenting to you 
is not aimed at establishing a national statutory holiday in 
honour of Patriotes and Reformers''.
<P>
	That is to say that, even before this matter came to the House 
of Commons, I had clearly stated that the motion was not 
intended to establish a national statutory holiday to honour 
Patriotes and Reformers. Of course, it will be up to the 
government of Canada to decide how it wants to celebrate and 
recognize the priceless contribution of the Patriotes and 
Reformers.
<P>
	This argument can be explained two ways, it is either due to a 
blatant ignorance of the facts and of the meaning of the motion, 
or to a deliberate manoeuvre to derail the debate, something I 
am not accusing anybody of doing.
<P>
	As I was saying, it has always been very clear in my mind, and 
that of my colleagues, that it is up to the Government of Canada 
to make the final decision, once the House adopts the motion, on 
how it intends to honour and recognize the historical 
contribution of the Patriotes and Reformers.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	Third objection. We were told that the violence of the 
rebellion of 1837-1838 could not be condoned. Fine, but it must 
be recognized, as my colleague for Richmond-Wolfe so rightly 
pointed out, that for years, Patriotes and Reformers had 
expressed their point of view, their opinions, in speeches at the 
House of Assembly and at public meetings, as well as in 
newspaper articles. That is how Patriotes and Reformers had 
presented their views.
<P>
	In remembering the Patriotes' actions, one should not choose 
to recall only the violence some of them ultimately resorted to.
<P>
	The purpose of this motion is not in any way to legitimize or 
justify the rebellions of 1837-38. Of course not. As my 
colleague from Richmond-Wolfe mentioned, the motion 
simply seeks to pay tribute to the men and women who, 
notwithstanding these violent protests, believed it was 
necessary to have a truly responsible and democratic 
government in this country.
<P>
	Of the people who believed and took part in this movement, 
some entered public life and are still highly respected today for 
their convictions, like Louis-Joseph Papineau, 
Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, Robert Baldwin and 
George-Étienne Cartier, to name a few.
<P>
	After the first hour of debate, which was rather deplorable, I 
might say and where all kinds of objections were used to 
sidetrack the debate, I sent all members of this House a letter to 
clarify the situation concerning the three objections that were 
raised.
<P>
	In the second hour of debate, we heard new objections. First, 
we heard mainly from our colleagues in the Reform Party that 
the bad sovereignists of today are using the actions of the 
Patriotes and the Reformers to justify their claims. This 
argument demonstrates a poor knowledge of our history.
<P>
	I will remind the members that the Reformers, who would be 
Ontarians today, are included in the motion. It has absolutely 
nothing to do with the sovereignist movement. That is not why 
we are presenting this motion. We want to recognize the 
contribution of the Patriotes and the Reformers to the 
establishment of a system of responsible democratic 
government.
<P>
	I must also remind hon. members of something I mentioned in 
the first hour of debate, namely that there are groups in Ontario 
which support our initiative and encourage us to bring the House 
to recognize the invaluable contribution of the Patriotes and the 
Reformers.
<P>
	Let us not forget that the Right Hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau 
even went to Australia to unveil a plaque honouring the Patriotes 
of Lower Canada and that another Canadian government official 
unveiled a similar plaque in Tasmania to honour the Reformers 
of Upper Canada. There has never been formal recognition from 
the government, and that is what we are seeking.
<P>
	Of course, it is possible to make a connection between the 
actions of the Patriotes and the actions of today's sovereignists. 
But if we had wanted to give that meaning to the motion before 
us today, we certainly would have excluded any reference to the 
Reformers of Upper Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Southeast said in her speech, 
and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If this House is seriously fighting for a strong Canada, it would be hypocritical 
for its members to vote in favour of this motion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What a pity to make such a narrow and restrictive 
interpretation of the motion before the House. I say to her that if 
this House rejects this motion, it will be more than hypocritical. 
Not to admit a historical reality for purely partisan reasons is 
beneath the dignity of this House.
<P>
	During the second hour of debate, the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell presented a new objection to the 
motion. He opposed the wording of the motion where it says the 
Patriotes of Lower Canada and the Reformers of Upper Canada 
contributed to the establishment of responsible government in 
Canada and in Quebec. Using a geographical subterfuge, it was 
argued that we could not talk about Canada and Quebec since we 
were talking about Upper Canada and Lower Canada and that we 
should therefore talk about Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	I would simply like to say to the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell that, putting aside the matter of 
Ontario and Quebec, we must admit that the action of the 
Patriotes and the Reformers was such that we can now enjoy 
freedom everywhere in Canada and a democratic and 
responsible government. The action of the Patriotes and the 
Reformers cannot be limited to Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
	The question I asked myself was this: Why then, if he really 
intended to support the motion-because I must recognize in all 
honesty that the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
agreed with the substance, the principle of the motion, though he 
was worried about its wording-why then did he not support the 
motion? He had the right to do so. Our colleague has just 
proposed an amendment which after all does not change the 
meaning of the motion.
<P>
	We would have been very disappointed if our colleagues 
opposite had continued to oppose this motion only, it seems, 
because of its wording. We are happy to see that we may come to 
an agreement so that this House finally recommends that the 
government recognize, more than a hundred years later, the 
historical contribution of the Patriotes and the Reformers to the 
establishment of responsible government, of which we are so 
proud.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8905"> 8905 </A></B>
<P>
	If they had continued to reject this motion only because of 
its wording, they would have disappointed many groups in 
Ontario and Quebec as well as elsewhere in Canada that have 
been supporting us in this process from the beginning.
<P>
	If they had continued, for disgraceful and base partisan 
motives, to try to deflect a supposedly level-headed debate on 
the recognition that is more than due to the Patriotes, Liberals 
and especially Reformers would have shown how low they could 
go. But, fortunately, government members are much more open 
today.
<P>
	Refusing to recognize the invaluable contribution of the 
Patriotes and the Reformers to the establishment of responsible 
government, something we are so proud of today, is an insult to 
the memory of great men like Louis-Joseph Papineau, 
George-Étienne Cartier, William Lyon Mackenzie, Robert 
Baldwin and Louis-Hyppolyte Lafontaine. Not all Patriotes 
took up arms but we owe it to all of them that we live today in a 
free and democratic society today.
<P>
	I would invite hon. members, my Reform and Liberal 
colleagues, to reflect on this before voting on this important 
motion.
<P>
	I would like to conclude very briefly by thanking members 
from all sides for taking part in this debate. I would also like to 
express my particular thanks to Mr. Onil Perrier, of the Patriotes 
du pays, provided food for thought, and research material 
throughout the process.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to thank-and I am sure that you will 
agree with me-my assistant and colleague, Catherine Beaudry, 
who did most of the research. I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that you 
agree with my words of thanks to her.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, since the right of reply 
closes the debate, I must put the question to the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question is on the amendment. Is it 
the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the amendment 
will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the yeas have it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> On division.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare the amendment adopted.
<P>
	Amendment agreed to.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question is now on the main 
motion as amended. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will 
please say yea
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the yeas have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to the order made earlier this 
day, the motion stands deferred until Tuesday, December 13 at 
5.30 p.m.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of 
order. Would it be possible, since we have already gone through 
the procedure and voted on division, to go back and ask for a 
recorded division?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair has a duty to be fair to all 
members. I know, as the hon. member just indicated, that there 
are certain rules. It seems to me we have already had a division. 
When I put the question, I was told they intended to rise.
<P>
	Since they did, I must be fair to all members. They are entitled 
to ask for a division, and as the hon. member just said, I think 
they intended to do so.
<P>
	Any further comments on this point?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It being 2.10 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday 
at 11 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.10 p.m.)
