</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, pursuant to 
Standing Order 83(1), I wish to table a notice of ways and means 
motion involving amendments to the Excise Tax Act, including 
explanatory notes.  I ask that an order of the day be designated 
for consideration of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments to the Excise Tax Act deal with encouraging 
rental housing, with giving a competitive edge to our Canadian 
manufacturers who import and export, and with multi-employer 
pension funds.  This is very worthwhile legislation that has come 
forth from members of the House acting on behalf of their 
constituents.  We expect speedy passage of the legislation.

I have the honour to present a petition which has been signed by

urgently the de-linking of economic from military sanctions and 
to rapidly lift economic sanctions in order to improve 
significantly the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people. I

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—ELECTORAL REFORM 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK17">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House strike a 
special all-party committee to examine the merits of 
various models of proportional representation and other 
electoral reforms, with a view to recommending reforms that 
would combat the increasing regionalization of Canadian 
politics, and the declining turnout of Canadians in federal 
elections. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the 
opportunity to kick off this important debate this morning on 
electoral reform.  I would like to indicate at the outset that I 
will be splitting my time with the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity to congratulate the member 
for Regina—Qu'Appelle for his dogged, persistent, stubborn 
determination in pushing forward with electoral reform that is so 
badly needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk a little bit about the problem that we believe very 
much needs fixing and I will also address some of the ways in 
which we can do that.  We are all familiar with the expression, 
“if it ain't broke don't fix it”, but in this case there is 
something broken and there is a problem that we need to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  There is nothing to fix. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  The member just said that we do not 
need to fix it.  It speaks to the problem that we have too many 
government members who agree that our electoral system creates 
distortions, divisions and undemocratic results in terms of the 
composition of parliament, but in the same breath they ask what 
could be wrong with a political system that produces three 
majority Liberal governments in a row.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an electoral system based on a first past the post 
system.  The problem with that is that the electoral system 
leaves too many people feeling that they do not have any way to 
make their vote count.  They feel they may as well not vote 
because they know perfectly well that if they do not support the 
majority view then their view does not count at all and they do 
not have any way to influence the composition of parliament so 
that important, significant minority views are fairly and 
proportionately represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a problem that our first past the post system creates 
distortions and that kind of unrepresentativeness.  It is equally 
a problem, perhaps even more of a problem, that it creates a 
winner takes all mentality.  That is the seed of the kind of 
arrogance and unresponsiveness that comes from majority 
governments that are over-represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know some people say that the NDP keeps pushing for electoral 
reform because it believes that if we had an electoral system 
that included a proportional representation element that it would 
likely end up with more seats in parliament.  With many elections 
that is true, but even over-represented Liberals must recognize 
that it is a problem when we have an election in which, for 
example, the Liberals win 50% of the vote, but they win 97% of 
the seats as they did in the most recent election in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just about the over-representation of Liberals, which 
is the problem with the winner take all mentality of the Liberal 
government.  It is also about other distortions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give another couple of examples.  In the 1997 election 
the Reform Party got 19% of the vote.  The Progressive 
Conservative Party got 19% of the vote.  Did it have roughly the 
same number of seats?  No, the Reform Party won 60 seats in the 
House of Commons and the Conservative Party won 20 seats in the 
House of Commons.  Some may ask what is wrong with that because 
that is the system?  They say that is just what it means to be in 
a democracy where the winner takes all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  At least in a Canadian one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague for 
Winnipeg—Transcona has exactly made the point with his comment. 
Canada is very much in a minority among democracies in the world 
in perpetuating this undemocratic electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of fact not a matter of rhetoric that Canada is 
one of only three remaining democracies in the world that has a 
population of over eight million people that persists in a winner 
take all, first past the post electoral system.  Every other 
democracy in the modern world with a population of over eight 
million people has incorporated some element of proportional 
representation into their electoral system 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very good reason for that.  We know the Liberal Party 
and its members do not know what the problem is because they like 
the results.  The problem is that it does not work for the 
electorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have watched a steady decline in the number of Canadians 
participating in election campaigns.  Back in 1958, 75% of 
eligible citizens voted.  In the most recent election, 58% of 
Canadians who were eligible to vote actually cast their vote. 
People want to know what is wrong with members of the public who 
do not get out and vote.   I know what is wrong.  They are 
correct when they feel that getting out and voting, if they do 
not embrace the majority view of the government in power, it 
means that their voice does not really get heard and their views 
do not get expressed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem.  The good news is that we know what to do to 
fix it. It is not a question of it being a pat formula.  Let me 
make very clear what the motion is that we are putting forward 
today as our official opposition business because we think it is 
that important.  Canadians want to see some leadership from all 
sides of the House on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion says that we need to have a debate, not just a debate 
in the House but a debate that will involve getting out and 
talking to Canadians about what the various forms of proportional 
representation could be; what it would actually mean for Canada; 
what a system of proportional representation would do to 
strengthen national unity so that we do not end up with regional 
divisions in the House which threaten the unity and future 
strength of the country; and what it would mean to ensure that 
caucuses are more representative and that in every caucus there 
would be some representation that would allow for a more national 
view of what the country is, what people want to see in their 
parliament and what they want their government to do on their 
behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an easy problem for us to deal with as 
parliamentarians.  To people who are hard pressed to pay their 
increasingly costly fuel bills, who are forced to choose between 
paying for their groceries or their prescription drugs because of 
broken promises by an arrogant Liberal government, the notion of 
electoral reform and proportional representation seems a bit 
abstract and esoteric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think our challenge, not just New Democrats who are pressing 
for electoral reform but all parliamentarians, is to talk to 
Canadians who properly expect and demand leadership about the 
issue of electoral reform to allow them to understand the 
problems they are struggling with, whether it is health care, 
inadequate income, the difficulty of paying for an education or 
whatever their bread and butter daily struggles, and why a more 
representative parliament would speak more concretely and 
effectively to their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me finalize my comments by quoting a Chinese proverb: “If 
we do not change the direction we are going, we are likely to end 
up where we are headed”.  Too many citizens in the country do 
not feel they are represented in the House and we have a 
responsibility as parliamentarians to fix that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the opening 
remarks of the leader of the New Democratic Party.  In spite of 
her belief that proportional representation is a cure-all for our 
political system, probably just as many Liberals stayed home in 
the last election as supporters of the opposition. Even if we had 
proportional representation we may well have ended up with the 
same results.  I know she would not appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about proportional representation in areas where 
it has been used exclusively.  I am thinking of Spain before 
Franco where there were 100 parties and Ukraine where there are 
60 parties because they had proportional representation. 
Basically proportional representation would assist regionalism in 
Canada.  It would allow for a multiplicity of political parties 
representing every little interest, every little farm community 
and so forth across the nation.  It would weaken our form of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the NDP talks about strengthening national unity. 
I think it is a panacea for creating a weakened federation and a 
weakened government in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the leader of the NDP wanted to talk about people who are 
concerned about relevancy, rather than bring an issue like 
proportional representation to the floor of the House of Commons, 
why did she not talk about health care?  Why did she not talk 
about child poverty?  Why did she not talk about the environment? 
Those are things that mean something to people, not proportional 
representation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to say that it 
is extremely depressing.  There is a call by the Canadian people 
to do something about the fact that they are losing confidence in 
their parliamentary institutions.  It is utterly irresponsible 
for any member of the House, and I do not care in which caucus, 
to stand and talk about something as absurd as going to a total 
PR representation system and creating 100 political parties. They 
should not insult the Canadian public like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be some reason every parliamentary democracy in the 
world with a population of over eight million has said that it 
needs to be more reflective and more representative of the people 
and that it has a responsibility to explore the options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many different formulas for proportional 
representation, but in the name of heaven let us not misrepresent 
what is being proposed.  Let us not display ignorance about why 
other democratic countries have moved to embrace some elements 
and formulas of proportional representation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for Halifax mentioned that 
there are only three countries left in the world which 
exclusively have the first past the post constituency system, but 
she failed to name those three countries and I will name them for 
her.  They are Canada, the United States and Britain, the three 
oldest democracies and the three most successful democracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is important to have 
this debate because of the amount of self-serving representation 
that people will make.  Let us be clear about something.  Canada 
is not the only country with a crisis in terms of the decline of 
voter participation.  The United States is in an even greater 
crisis in terms of the erosion of the participation of the 
electorate in the political system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.K. is the second country.  In the U.K. today the 
parliaments of Scotland, Ireland and Wales are all elected with 
an element of proportional representation.  The government of the 
U.K. has also launched a process of electoral reform and 
indicated it is prepared to have a referendum on the issue of 
proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with members to take the opportunity today, a day we 
have chosen as our opposition day, to have an informed, earnest 
and sincere debate.  We chose today not to make it a votable 
motion but for the reason of opening it up to thoughtful debate. 
We are not asking people to commit to the bottom line.  We are 
saying we should have a reasonable debate about the problems we 
have and about the solutions we know are at hand. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say a few words about this subject today.  I 
appeal to the Liberals opposite to look seriously at the merits 
of changing our electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada today there is a real crisis in democracy and I think 
we are sleepwalking toward that crisis.  If we look at the 
turnout in the last election, fewer than 60% of the people voted. 
In 1997 it was 67%.  Years ago it was 75%, 80% or 85%.  People 
are being turned off by the political system and by politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we walk down the street in any town or city in Canada we find 
people who are alienated from the political system.  Part of the 
reason is that when people elect parliament their votes are not 
mirrored in the composition of the seats.  That is one of the big 
problems we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Liberal Party received around 40% of the vote 
last November.  Only about 60% of the people voted.  Therefore 
the Liberals received about 25% of the support of the electorate. 
About a quarter of the people have elected a government that will 
govern constitutionally for some five years.  That is a problem 
in terms of the credibility of the House of Commons and the 
credibility of parliament.  That is why we should seriously look 
at changing our electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing.  Those of us who come here, come through the 
first past the post system.  The last time there was a vote in 
parliament on proportional representation was before you were 
born, Mr. Speaker.  The year 1923 was the last time there was a 
vote in the House of Commons on PR.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall my private member's motion was drawn and declared 
votable.  We had one hour of debate and the election came before 
we had a chance to vote on the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that we should strike an all-party committee to 
look at the merits of the various forms of proportional 
representation that might be incorporated in terms of an element 
into our electoral system.  We must have a debate on the issue. 
It is a fundamental issue which we should be facing but 
parliamentarians are refusing to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is growing interest across the country in the whole idea 
of changing our electoral system.  There is an organization 
called Fair Vote Canada.  There are other organizations out there 
promoting a change.  I will be hosting a conference in Ottawa on 
March 30 and March 31 at which all five political parties will be 
speaking to and supporting the idea of looking at the kind of PR 
that might be relevant to our country.  I call upon the 
Parliament of Canada to join the cause of looking at changing our 
electoral system into something that is more relevant to the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system is outdated.  There are now only three countries in 
the world with more than eight million people that do not have 
some form of PR.  They are India, the United States and Canada. 
Britain, the mother parliament, has an element of PR in the 
Scottish, Irish and Welsh parliaments.  All other members from 
Britain are elected to the European community by PR.  In the 
election after next England will probably have a measure of PR in 
terms of what the Blair government is planning.  Canada will be 
one of only three countries in the world without some element of 
PR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem with the lack of PR in the first past the post 
system is that a lot of people feel their votes are wasted.  Many 
Canadians vote for people who are not elected to the House of 
Commons because of the winner take all political system.  If we 
had a system of PR people would be empowered and included because 
their votes would be reflected in the House of Commons.  If we 
received 20% of the votes we would have roughly 20% of the seats. 
That is not the case in the House of Commons today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a very unfair system.  Let us look at the last 
election.  The party to my left over here, the Conservative 
Party, required 130,000 votes to elect a Conservative member of 
parliament while the Bloc Quebecois required 36,000 votes to 
elect a member of the Bloc Quebecois.  That is how distorted our 
political system is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes it works in favour of one party against another, but 
the first past the post system always distorts the outcome of 
elections.  What we see in the House of Commons does not reflect 
the way Canadians are voting.  That is why the political system 
must be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the Conservative Party got 19% of the vote and the 
Reform Party got 19% of the vote.  The Conservatives got around 
19 seats and the Reform Party got around 60 seats.  The NDP and 
the Bloc each had 11% of the vote.  We had 21 seats and the Bloc 
had 44.  The Liberal Party, with just 38% of the vote, won a 
majority and can constitutionally govern for five years.  That is 
not fair.  That is not just. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Ontario we would think everyone is Liberal. 
In the last campaign the Liberals won about 50% of the votes and 
97% of the seats.  In 1997 they had fewer than half the votes, 
49.6% or 49.7%, and had all but two members of parliament from 
the province of Ontario.  The electoral system distorts the way 
Canadians think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same in the west.  People might think all but a few 
people in the west vote for the Reform Party or the Alliance 
Party.  In the campaigns of 1993 and 1997 the reform alliance was 
a minority party in western Canada.  It received 40% plus of the 
popular vote, yet it won the absolutely overwhelming majority of 
seats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the unfairness of the system.  Other countries have 
remedied the unfairness by bringing an element of PR into their 
electoral systems so that people's votes are counted in 
parliament.  It is about time we caught up with the trend in 
terms of modernizing democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the whole question of national unity and 
regionalism.  We are seeing more of a regional Canada all the 
time.  We are seeing it increasing day by day.  I am thinking in 
terms of the politics of the Harris government, of the Klein 
government and of the Parti Quebecois that regionalize Canada. 
That is now reflected in the House of Commons where we have in 
essence five regional political parties representing one or two 
regions of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had a system of PR, all parties would be forced to think 
of the country as a whole, of a national vision of what is best 
for Canada, because a vote in Newfoundland would have the same 
power as a vote in rural Saskatchewan or Montreal or Vancouver. 
It would force all political parties to have a national vision to 
knit and pull the country together.  That is not happening today 
in terms of our first past the post political system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the whole question of empowerment.  People feel 
excluded from the electoral system.  If we had an element of PR 
in the electoral system everybody's vote would count.  Nobody's 
vote would be wasted, not just on election night but throughout 
the term of the parliament. 
It would mean a radical change in the Parliament of Canada.  It 
would mean almost certainly that most governments would be 
minority governments.  It would force a radical thing upon the 
Parliament of Canada.  It would force politicians to work 
together to come up with a consensus like most countries in the 
world.

of the people.  There were Mackenzie King in 1945, John 
Diefenbaker in 1958 and indeed Brian Mulroney in 1984 who, with a 
big sweep, had about 49.9% or 50% of the votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again we are electing a parliament with a 
composition that does not reflect the voting pattern of the 
people of Canada.  What we are saying today is that we should 
strike an all party committee to look at the various types of 
proportional representation that might be relevant to this unique 
federation of Canada and make a recommendation back to parliament 
as to the best type of system for the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People talk across the way of Israel and Spain and many years 
ago.  There are all kinds of proportional representation systems. 
We are saying that we should bring an element of PR into the 
Canadian system.  We are not specifying as to what that element 
should be, that is for the Canadian people to decide.  It is the 
unique federation.  Perhaps we could look at a model that is 
similar to Germany.  It has half the members chosen on a riding 
by riding basis and half of the members chosen through the 
proportional representation of the parties.  It has what is 
called the mixed member proportional system which seems to have 
worked very well for Germany as a federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of other examples.  Some countries have 15%, 
20% or 25% of their members elected by proportional 
representation and that may also work well for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the things we should be considering in 
reforming and changing our electoral system and making it more 
fair, more just and more reflective of how the Canadian people 
vote.  People are losing confidence in the political 
institutions, in politicians and in the very democratic practice 
of voting by itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also saying in the motion today that we should look at 
other various electoral and democratic reforms as well.  The time 
has come, for example, to abolish the unelected, undemocratic and 
unaccountable Senate.  I would abolish it and bring those checks 
and balances into the House of Commons by way of stronger 
committees, more independence for committees, less power for the 
Prime Minister's office and better reflection of the regions 
through proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others want to elect the Senate, but either way we look at it, 
all the polling shows only about 5% of Canadians support the 
existing Senate.  Yet members of parliament decade after decade 
support keeping the other place the way it is.  No wonder 
Canadians are losing confidence in the people elected to the 
House of Commons.  This is another reason why we have to change 
the electoral system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is up but I want to move the following amendment.  I 
move: 
<A NAME="LINK21">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by inserting the word “immediately” 
after the word “House”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The amendment proposed by the member 
for Regina—Qu'Appelle is in order.  Debate is on the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was obviously interested in what the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle had to say.  I know he has worked on this 
issue for a long time.  It is too bad that in the last parliament 
we did not get to vote on his private member's bill having to do 
with proportional representation.  It was also raised in the last 
parliament by myself.  I remember asking a question to the Prime 
Minister.  We got the usual sort of partisan trivia from the 
Liberal front bench.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked, on behalf of the NDP for an all party committee, 
for what is being asked for today, not for a particular solution 
but for a process by which these concerns of the Canadian people 
could be taken into account, the response of the Prime Minister 
was that because the NDP lost elections and they won them that 
was why it wanted an all party committee struck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it seems to me, if I heard the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle correctly, we are talking about the country, 
not about the NDP, Tories or the Reform.  We are talking about 
the political fabric of the country and the way in which certain 
fault lines are developing, both in terms of voter confidence and 
regional division, as a result of the first past the post system, 
the way in which it tends to throw up a homogeneous image of 
particular regions.  As the member said, it looks like everybody 
in Alberta is a reformer, everybody in Quebec is a sovereignist, 
everybody in Ontario is a Liberal or whatever the case may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member elaborate on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the first past the post 
system tends to really distort the composition of the House of 
Commons.  If we look at election after election we can see good 
examples of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of 1993, for example, when the Conservative Party was 
wiped out.  One would have thought that nobody voted Conservative 
in the country.  The party had two members, the member for Saint 
John and Jean Charest.  However, the Conservatives received some 
17% of the vote.  It took over a million people or thereabouts, 
if my recollection is correct, to elect a Conservative member of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as I opposed the Brian Mulroney government, we should 
have had an electoral system that gave that party some 
representation which would have reflected the proportion of the 
vote in the country.  What has happened now is even worse than 
that.  We have the regional divisions that are setting into the 
country where we have people in the various provinces and regions 
voting as a block for their particular party.  We come to 
parliament now with five regional parties.  The Liberal Party 
itself is basically a regional party centred mainly in the 
provinces of Ontario and Quebec.  That is not good for the unity 
of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had PR it would force all parties to address the regional 
issues.  It would force Liberals, for example, to address the 
issue of the farm crisis in the prairies, which they are not 
doing now because they do not have any members of parliament from 
there.  It would force my party, the NDP, to address the issues 
of Quebec because a vote in Quebec would be worth as much as a 
vote in Regina.  That is not happening in the current political 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing it would do is radically change the voting 
patterns in the country.  People could afford to vote NDP in 
rural Alberta, Liberal in rural Saskatchewan and Reform in 
Newfoundland and the votes would count.  That would change the 
voting pattern in Canada and the Canadian people would all of a 
sudden find a parliament that reflected the way they felt in 
terms of the common good of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in spite 
of the comments of the member from Halifax, who I think said my 
comments were somehow ignorant and that we would have an 
intellectual discussion, I refer her to the fact that my 
political science professor was Dr. Pauline Jewett. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle made two what I think are 
conflicting statements.  First, he went through a dissertation of 
majority governments in Canada and said we would never have a 
majority government had we had proportional representation.  That 
is the very point I am was trying to raise: we would never have 
majority governments in the country, which would basically weaken 
the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said the individual opposition parties would have a great 
national vision.  Why should they when 40,000 votes from anywhere 
in the country would give them one seat?  We would not have five 
political parties over there, we would have about 30 or 40. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Pauline Jewett was my 
seat mate in the House, so I am wondering whether or not he 
really understood her lectures or knew Pauline very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about 40 or 50 different political parties. 
There are many countries in the world that have PR, like Germany 
which has very few political parties.  There are different ways 
to model a PR system.  Some countries have a threshold of 5%. 
Some countries have a threshold of 3% or 2%.  These are different 
things we can do to model the proportional representation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of majority governments, I said we would have very few 
majority governments likely in a PR system.  We have only had 
three majority governments elected by a majority in the last 75 
or 80 years.  What is wrong with that if that is the way the 
Canadian people vote?  If Canadian people want minority 
governments or even, dare I say it, a coalition government or 
government that works together with opposition parties, that is 
what they vote for.  We want to elect a parliament that is 
reflective of how people vote.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on 
the motion moved by the hon. member for Halifax, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House strike a special all-party committee to examine 
the merits of various models of proportional representation and 
other electoral reforms, with a view to recommending reforms that 
would combat the increasing regionalization of Canadian politics, 
and the declining turnout of Canadians in federal elections. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened attentively to the hon. member for Halifax and to the 
hon. member who spoke afterward.  I must say that I am not at all 
convinced by these proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our election law is fundamental to our system of parliamentary 
democracy.  Since confederation our electoral system has been 
based on geographically bound constituencies, each generally 
electing a single member to the House of Commons.  This provides 
a clear chain of accountability from an individual member of 
parliament to his or her constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go to my constituency office, I am the person who was 
elected by those people to represent them, not chosen from a 
list, not knowing whether I was the first, second, third, fourth, 
fifth or whatever on that list of preferences.  The elector, of 
course, has a right in a subsequent election to directly remove a 
member if such is the wish at that time.  That is direct 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, and on a grander scale, Canadians can remove the 
government and replace it with another government if they chose 
to do so at a particular point of time, as the Canadian 
electorate so wisely did in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the sole representative of his or her constituency, a member 
of parliament is directly responsible to his or her constituents 
on any issue with which parliament may be dealing.  Our current 
arrangement is such that an MP is exposed to a broad range of 
issues and does not merely speak for his or her party.  As the 
sole representative for an area, he or she must seek redress for 
all matters or grievances and take into account the concerns and 
views of all constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of this House, including me, spend a considerable 
share of time responding to specific interests within a 
constituency on issues ranging from immigration to agriculture to 
everything else.  I held constituency office yesterday morning 
before coming to Ottawa to discharge my functions both as an MP 
in this House and as a member of the Canadian cabinet. 
Consequently, an MP is encouraged, in very practical ways, to 
fulfil the basic requirements of any political system and that is 
the reconciliation of the wide variety of interests within each 
constituency and then right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Canadians want to be represented by someone from 
home, someone who knows them and someone they can talk to and see 
in the House of Commons.  If such was not the case, why do people 
who do not come from the particular constituency or from a 
district or from a city, in the case of an urban area where the 
boundaries are a little hard to determine, or from the riding 
have a much more difficult time getting elected than those who 
are?  It is because people want to be generally represented by 
someone they know.  That is only normal and, as far as I am 
concerned, that is only appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member across the way indicated, proportional 
representation raises many issues.  Our current electoral system 
allows much greater scope for the voters to judge the merits of a 
popular candidate than do countries with a proportional 
representation system where in some cases, and granted I will 
agree not all cases, voters have little choice but to support a 
party list as presented.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is political stability.  We have seen examples in 
countries with proportional electoral systems where, after an 
election, it has taken weeks to form a government.  After the 
government is formed, a coalition often involves narrow special 
interest parties and the government is often unable to continue 
to maintain the confidence of the legislature.  That has been the 
case many times in places like Israel and Italy and in France, 
where they had a system like that which they later abandoned. 
France of course did away with proportional representation 
several years ago and, as far as I know, at the national level 
there is little appetite to bring it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proportional electoral systems frequently require the formation 
of a coalition between parties of different political 
allegiances.  As a result, proportional representation can mean 
that the government is formed by coalitions made through backroom 
political negotiations rather than through the ballot box.  I 
believe that is a far less appropriate way of governing than the 
system we have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proportional representation therefore allows small one-issue 
parties to become kingmakers of a sort, which enables them to 
sometimes force their own agenda on a nation as a whole, again, 
as has happened in some cases recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some countries have found that proportional representation 
exacerbates regional differences and cleavages within society and 
makes it more difficult to reach a national consensus on key 
issues. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proportional representation can also reduce MPs' independence 
and of course their ability to serve their ridings.  Our first 
past the post system, however, encourages the formation of major 
parties around a coalition of members representing different 
regions, different language groups, different ethnic groups and 
so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his motion the hon. member claims that a system of 
proportional representation would remedy voter apathy.  Where is 
her proof of this?  There is none, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decline in voter turnout in Canada and other western 
democracies, for this is not a solely Canadian phenomenon, relates 
to a number of factors.  We are not the only ones to have seen 
such a decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, it is obvious that there is no proof that 
proportional representation would have any effect on voter 
turnout.  I am not aware of any country that has adopted 
proportional representation and seen an immediate improvement in 
voter turnout.  Personally, I would venture to say that it might 
reduce participation, as I have already said.  Proportional 
representation is bad for political stability and parliamentary 
effectiveness, and particularly bad for MPs' accountability to 
their electorate.  There is no doubt that this is the price to 
be paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devotees of the proportional representation system have 
maintained, and continue to maintain, that it favours 
representation of the major segments of the population or of 
certain groups, such as women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what certain people have stated, international 
experience has demonstrated very clearly that such an 
improvement is the result of the adoption of quotas, for example 
parties setting themselves the obligation to increase the 
participation of women or some other specific group.  This 
improves the participation of women candidates or candidates 
from other target groups in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, our electoral system is characterized by direct 
suffrage.  All that the voter needs to do is indicate his or her 
preferred candidate.  That is it.  Nothing complicated.  The 
voter participates, makes his choice quickly, and that choice is 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system makes it possible to reduce the number of invalid 
votes.  As well, the votes are counted quickly in Canada.  In general, 
Canadians know, within hours of the polls closing, who will form 
the government and who the opposition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind the House that last fall there was an election in 
Canada and another country at the same time. In Canada, 17 
million ballots were opened in the space of 90 minutes, or so. 
We knew the first and second place winners, the losers, and so 
on.  This was done in 90 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A democracy south of us with a system that is not proportional, 
but is much more complicated than ours, took over two months to 
establish the winner in its election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to conclude that our system is better than many 
others.  Of course, it may not be perfect, but it is better. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A paper on electoral reform released today by the Institute for 
Research on Public Policy notes some of these problems that other 
countries have experienced.  IRPP still concludes that 
proportional representation, in its opinion, is a good idea, but 
even it argues that, and I will read from its press 
release, “the chief downside” of proportional representation is 
that large multi-member electoral districts “would be less 
suited to constituency work as Canadian MPs have traditionally 
practiced it”.  So even the group that likes proportional 
representation thinks that it is less accountable than what we 
have now.  I believe that to be a major downside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, the IRPP paper understates the serious problems that 
other countries have had with proportional representation.  It 
downplays the negative impact although it even states that there 
are some.  It ignores the fact that there is little interest 
among Canadians for proportional representation, and let us not 
forget that either.  It was not exactly an issue raised during 
the last election campaign as I canvassed door to door.  As the 
hon. member for Durham said so astutely earlier, Canadians were 
asking about health care, child poverty, taxes, agriculture and 
so on and so forth.  Very few people, I do not remember any, have 
raised with me the issue of proportional representation in 
Glengarry—Prescott—Russell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The paper also states that there is no consensus among academics 
as to how to implement a proportional system. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, even the best of systems has faults, including ours. 
We must not forget, however, that Canada may be proud of having 
one of the most stable and democratic political systems in the 
world, a system that is used as a model and has in fact been 
exported to a number of other democracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian International Development Agency, Elections Canada 
and others—even parliamentarians in this House—have been involved 
in forums on democratic process around the world.  We all have, 
of course, in the belief that our system is the right one, and I 
think so too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our electoral system has stood the test of time, being 
sufficiently flexible to allow us to change it as circumstances 
required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, the Lortie commission, the Royal Commission on 
Electoral Reform and the Party Financing, recommended that the 
existing system of single member constituencies be retained.  So 
this is not just anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of the proportional representation and of the 
entire electoral system is of course a difficult and complex 
one.  However, caution is at the heart of courage, especially 
since the public has shown almost no interest, as I mentioned, 
in proportional representation and since a national system of 
proportional representation would necessitate all sorts of 
changes, including changes to the Constitution. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I thank the hon. member for bringing this issue 
to public attention.  However, I do not share her enthusiasm for 
proportional representation.  Our current electoral system 
provides for clear accountability at constituency and national 
levels.  It has a proven track record that is recognized around 
the world and it allows members of parliament to represent a 
specific and identified group of constituents, those living 
within the geographical boundaries of the area they represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, having listened to the speech from the member across 
the way, I note that it has as a premise that each party purports 
to want to be a national party.  That is not always the case. 
There is a case of a political party in the House of Commons, the 
orientation of which I do not share, which wants to represent a 
region, not the entire country.  The Progressives of Manitoba did 
at some point in the past.  The United Farmers of Ontario and a 
number of others wanted, by definition, to be regional parties. I 
do not share that view, but it is certainly their right to think 
so and to run with that premise if that is what they want to do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is to say that I believe we should continue to 
modernize our electoral system, as we did in the last parliament 
with the adoption of the new Canada Elections Act.  The House 
will be doing more of that this Thursday when it responds to 
election law pursuant to a court decision.  Probably later in 
this parliament we will have another bill pursuant to the 
contributions of the chief electoral officer, which he always 
does before the committee, and we will strive to modernize our 
election laws again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's gradual modernization of our election laws is, 
in my view, a prudent and balanced approach to a complex issue 
that is at the heart of our system of democracy.  I believe it is 
the course that Canadians wish all hon. members to support.  That 
is why I cannot agree with the motion put before the House today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the government House leader for his comments and 
want to refer to a couple of things he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that people want someone from home to represent them.  I 
do not disagree with that.  There are PR systems in the world, 
like Germany's for example, where there are single member 
constituencies with half of the members elected riding by riding 
and half elected according to the party's PR vote.  In Germany, 
for example, when they vote they get two ballots.  They vote for 
their local MP and their party of preference.  They have what is 
called a mixed member proportional system, which compensates for 
these vagaries and distortions in the electoral system.  In many 
ways they get the best of both worlds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even now I would argue that electors do not always get a member 
from home.  The member's own leader, the Prime Minister, 
occasionally names candidates to run in various ridings, so we 
already have a system in which the party leader can refuse to 
sign the nomination papers of someone who is nominated in a 
particular riding and can parachute in a certain person.  That 
has happened.  I remember sitting on that side of the House when 
it happened.  It has also happened on this side of the House and 
it happens today, so I do not think that is an argument pro or 
con a PR system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point is the whole question of regional parties.  I 
agree with the minister across the way.  I like to have broad 
national parties with a national vision.  I think it is good for 
the country in terms of knitting the country together, but a PR 
system could easily be designed, particularly in a federation 
where we can have regional parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have PR done on a region by region or province by 
province basis.  I would not want to have a PR system where we 
took the vote of the country as a whole and apportioned parties 
in accordance with the national vote.  My own preference would be 
the German type of system, which is a mixed member proportional 
system, doing it region by region or province by province.  We 
could still have the United Farmers of Ontario or the Bloc 
Quebecois.  We could still have a party in western Canada.  What 
is wrong with that?  We could design a PR system that fits that 
criteria as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government House leader across the way why he would 
not be in favour of striking an all party committee to at least 
look at the merits of PR and the kinds of PR models that might be 
relevant to our country.  Almost every democracy in the world has 
PR of one sort or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a crisis in the country in terms of falling voter 
turnout, alienation toward the political system and a parliament 
that is very distorted in terms of its composition compared to 
how people vote, so why not take a look at this?  Let us have a 
true political democracy wherein members of parliament can debate 
the real issues of the day.  Is there any greater issue than the 
fundamental issue of democracy and voting?  I do not think there 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This also leads to all kinds of other issues, so why not have a 
parliamentary committee look at this issue, look at the various 
models and then make a recommendation?  We have not done that in 
this country.  If we do it, I would argue that we would be doing 
the Canadian people a great service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I profoundly disagree with 
what the hon. member says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, he and his leader have stated that Canada is only 
one of three countries with a population threshold of above eight 
million—I do not know why that number is important—which, she 
says, does not have a proportional representation system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.K. does not have a proportional representation system.  As 
far as the argument about Wales, since when is that a national 
government?  I would hope that is not what she is suggesting on 
the floor of the House of Commons.  France does not have a 
proportional representation system.  Actually it probably has the 
closest to the reverse of that anywhere.  It has a second round 
to weed out even someone who had 49% of the vote. That system is 
the opposite of what she says.  It simply does not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is arguing that a modification of the proportional 
representation system on a region by region or province by 
province basis is really what he wants.  That is the opposite 
proposition that was raised by his own leader about an hour ago 
in the House when she argued that this would be a way to have 
representation from across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is now advocating that this is a way to ensure that 
regions would have a higher proportion of people who purport to 
represent that region rather than the national interest.  That is 
the opposite proposition which has now been raised.  It is not 
the same at all.  As a matter of fact I agree with him.  His 
proposition, although undesirable, is probably what would result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member cites the German example where the greatest virtue is 
that half of the MPs have no riding.  Half of the MPs are elected 
per riding; the others are proportional.  The translation is that 
half of them do not have a riding.  I do not want a system where 
half of the MPs do not have a riding, where they represent no one 
except the whip of their party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there has been criticism around this place that party 
discipline is too strong, could we imagine what it would do to 
have people whose names would go up and down on the list only 
based on whether or not the officials of their party would like 
them?  That is what we would have:  no riding for half of the 
members and, on top of that, chosen from a party list according 
to the whims of someone who has nothing to do with what the 
electors want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that supposed to be better than what we have? I do not think 
so.  Our system may not be perfect, but it certainly will not be 
improved by advocating a policy like that one.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was following the debate and I will start off by saying that I 
was a little concerned by the reaction of the leader of the NDP 
to my colleague, the member for Durham, who laid out some points 
of view to his best knowledge.  The leader of the NDP decided 
that he was ignorant, arrogant and a few other words that she 
used.  That represents intolerance, which is exactly what 
Canadians do not want.  I think the member should accept that we 
have to be open to ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to ask the member a question.  Would he explain 
whether or not the proportional representation typical model the 
NDP is advocating would mean that a party could designate a 
region where a person could come from and deem him or her to be 
representative of the region simply because it does not have an 
elected member there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is difficult to say. 
I suppose it would depend on what model we would adopt, but 
presumably that is exactly why this system is wanted.  In other 
words, a party that would not win the seat in a first past the 
post system would have a second crack at it to take people from 
its list and make them responsible or somehow the spokesperson 
for the particular area of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if that is bad per se.  I do not believe that part 
is inherently bad.  I suppose all political parties where they 
are not represented in the country have their shadow critics 
visiting the area or they twin with another riding.  They do all 
these things right now.  This is something that is done 
informally by probably most caucuses in the House, save perhaps 
for the Bloc Quebecois.  Because of its particular orientation 
that is not something it wants to do.  I accept that, but for 
most others that would probably be the case at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in itself is not what is wrong.  It is the whole business 
of having MPs, who are not elected directly by anyone and who do 
not represent ridings, sitting in the House with us and having 
the same kind of participation as the rest of us even though no 
one directly voted for them.  To me that is not democratic.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some perhaps would say, and it is arguable, that a second round 
is an idea.  Of course that has nothing to do with proportional 
representation.  It is actually the reverse of it.  It is a 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the issue of proportional representation, particularly 
when tampered with in the way that it was advocated in some of 
the speeches, is a form of proportional representation that is 
not really proportional anyway.  We kind of wonder what it is 
supposed to achieve.  If it is moderated by all these factors 
then it ceases to be proportional.  We have all of the negative 
effects from it and presumably none of the benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is my first opportunity to give a speech in the 
House since the last election, although I did ask a question a 
week or two ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the time is appropriate to thank my constituents for 
sending the Liberal appointee in my riding packing.  My vote 
percentage went up again for the third time, so that was pretty 
good.  The appointee in my riding, an NDPer who switched horses 
in the middle of the NDP's mandate in B.C. to join the Liberals, 
was sent packing with a lower percentage of the vote than the 
previous Liberal candidate, so that was pretty good too. Actually 
NDP members provincially are jumping ship at an increasing rate 
because there is an election any day and the NDP are expected to 
go down in a massive defeat in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the motion and the amendment we are debating today: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House immediately strike a special all-party committee 
to examine the merits of various models of proportional 
representation and other electoral reforms, with a view to 
recommending reforms that would combat the increasing 
regionalization of Canadian politics, and the declining turnout 
of Canadians in federal elections 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is really about fairness, despite all the words we 
heard from the minister just a few minutes ago.  Frankly it is 
hopeless talking to the minister about fairness or about the idea 
of proportional representation, because after all his party has 
100% of the power with considerably less than 50% of the popular 
vote.  Why would he be the slightest bit interested in any 
fairness?  He has well under 50% of the vote and 100% of the 
power.  What could be better for them?  It is not surprising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  That is democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Somebody yelled out “That is democracy”. 
How in anybody's mind could it be democratic that they have 100% 
of the power with less than 50% of the votes? It just does not 
make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the minister say a few minutes ago that he does not like 
the idea of any type of proportional representation because there 
is no consensus on how to go about implementing it.  New Zealand, 
the country that I am originally from, gave us a wonderful 
example of how to go about doing it.  In 1994, I think it was, 
there was a referendum in New Zealand that asked the people 
whether they wanted to change the system.  That is democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of New Zealand decided they did want to change the 
system.  Over the next 12 to 18 months elections New Zealand, or 
whatever the body responsible for elections in New Zealand is 
called, set about informing the people of New Zealand of the 
alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every home in New Zealand received a booklet of about 28 to 30 
pages describing the various forms of proportional representation 
and the likely outcome in an election.  I have a copy of it in my 
office.  At the end of that period there was a second referendum 
where the people of New Zealand chose the system they favoured. 
They chose mixed member proportional, which is similar to the 
system in Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within that system there are many variations: how the list is 
appointed and whether they are elected or appointed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the minister to stand there and say that there is no 
consensus on how to proceed is silly.  Frankly, I am surprised 
the minister would be that silly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the motion is non-votable, so we all know that it 
is pretty much meaningless to have this day of debate.  It is sad 
to say it but that is the reality.  I heard the minister himself 
say that it was like shovelling air.  That is true.  What a 
disgrace that we can spend a whole day here debating and giving 
careful thought to this topic but at the end of the day we cannot 
even vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize the NDP members have the opportunity to choose which 
of their motions will be votable and which will not, but I put 
the question forward:  Why should there even be any non-votable 
motions?   Why should anything in this place where there has been 
a debate be non-votable?  It defies logic to have a whole day of 
debate in this place at a cost of hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to run this place every day and not even be allowed to 
vote on the issue at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same logic applies to private members' bills.  I spoke this 
morning with a member from the Liberal side of the House who was 
very disappointed that his private member's bill was made 
non-votable.  He had the feeling that it was because of 
opposition members on the committee that his bill was not made 
votable.  The fact is we should not be facing this sort of 
position.  All private members' bills should be votable, just 
like government business is votable in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad that we have a motion that is non-votable, but on top 
of that we have a motion that the NDP members already raised in 
this place less than a year ago.  It puzzles me why they would be 
revisiting something that we already debated less than a year 
ago.   Why did they not use their day on a votable motion about 
parliamentary reform?   Goodness knows there is plenty that needs 
to be done in this place to make it more democratic.  Why on 
earth did they waste a whole day debating something they already 
thrashed in private member's business a year ago? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the subject of the motion, I constantly hear the NDP 
members bleating about the growing gap between the rich and the 
poor.  I hear them talking about child poverty, about NAFTA and 
about the need for more social programs.  Why have they not 
brought any of those issues forward today instead of bringing 
forward something they already debated 12 months ago? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate illustrates the reason why the NDP is in decline. 
There is no new thinking there.  There is nothing stimulating 
about what it is doing.  No wonder it is in decline.  I guess 
because it never wants to be the government it can pretty well 
say anything it wants to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  During the election campaign I was at 
an all candidates debate at Capilano College in my riding, which 
is a well known hotbed of socialism in my riding.  The NDP 
candidate for North Vancouver was unable to come, so the member 
for Vancouver East filled in that day.  I must say that I do 
enjoy debating the member for Vancouver East.  It is always very 
entertaining for both of us and for the audience as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case, the audience at Capilano College was 
entirely on the side of the member for Vancouver East.  The 
member for Vancouver East promised anything.  The students could 
have free tuition as much as they wanted.  They could have 
interest free student loans.  They could have their student loans 
waived.  They could have gay marriages.  They could have anything 
they wanted.  Everything they asked for she said an NDP 
government would give them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the students were in tears.  They were so happy at what 
they were being promised by the NDP they were sobbing in their 
seats.  Of course I got the thumbs down.  I probably got a two 
pointer out of ten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the NDP members are out of touch.  They know 
they can promise anything to any special interest group and never 
be faced with having to enact those measures in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One NDP member has talked a lot about parliamentary reform.  One 
way those members could have contributed would have been to have 
proposed a motion today about parliamentary reform and what needs 
to be done differently in the House.  We could have even 
re-debated the child poverty issue.  They even get their own 
history incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A motion was introduced and debated in the House on November 24, 
1989. Every November we get regurgitated throughout the country about 
how parliament promised to get rid of child poverty by the year 
2000 and the NDP rush around the country saying that it promises 
to get rid of child poverty by the year 2000.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that is not what the NDP motion said in 1989.  I can 
read the exact wording.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House express its concern for the more than 1 million 
Canadian children currently living in poverty and seek to achieve 
the goal of eliminating poverty among Canadian children by the 
year 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not to get rid of it but to seek to achieve it.  The 
reason it was worded that way is that it was the last day in the 
House for Mr. Broadbent, the leader of the NDP at the time. It 
was a votable motion and the whole place wanted to send him off 
on a high note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was of course a motherhood and apple pie motion that would 
seek to achieve and to try to eliminate something at some time in 
the future, and everybody voted for it.  Since then the NDP has 
regurgitated the motion every February by promising to get rid of 
child poverty by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, if the NDP can point to a country anywhere in the world 
that has managed to do that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I hate to interrupt the hon. member but there is such a 
thing as a rule of relevancy.  We have a motion before the House 
on parliamentary reform for proportional representation.  I 
wonder, Mr. Speaker, whether you would ask the member speaking to 
be more relevant to the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I am sure at some point 
in time the hon. member for North Vancouver will tie everything 
that he has said to date to the motion that is before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course I am tying it to 
the debate.  What I am trying to point out is that the members of 
the NDP had a wealth of subjects that it could have debated today 
and I am trying to assist them.  If they had debated something a 
bit different, the benches above us would be filled with the 
media wanting to report it.  Instead there is not a single person 
from the media in this place today.  I would be willing to bet 
that there will be nothing, not a word, of a report in a 
newspaper anywhere about what has happened in the debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I trying to do is help members of the NDP to see that 
perhaps they could have got more bang for their buck if they had 
discussed one of their critical issues instead of talking about 
something we already talked about and got nowhere on less than a 
year ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the parliamentary reform aspects, if we had truly 
meaningful free votes in this place, the first past the post 
system would not be as critical.  It would not matter so much. 
If each of us was truly representing our constituency views and 
voting that way in this place, it would not matter that we were 
elected by first past the post because representation would be 
the key issue not how we got here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, as the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle knows, I 
and my party are supportive—and the critic will be speaking 
about this in more detail later—of the general thrust of the 
motion.  We spoke in favour of it in past times when he brought 
this issue forward.  The issue is not whether we are in favour of 
the motion, it is whether they are getting a good bang for their 
buck today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk a bit more about parliamentary reform that they 
could have introduced, quite apart from free votes.  If the 
private members' business was all votable then it would be 
meaningful to bring back this motion in a votable form and during 
private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have the ability to vote from our ridings when we are 
there on business, as is done in some other countries.  In this 
day of technology, why do we actually have to be physically here 
to stand in our places and vote on an issue, which we fully 
understand and which we have been following?  Just because we are 
in our riding for a day should not exclude us from the ability to 
vote.  That is not democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are systems available now.  We could even have fingerprint 
recognition where we would put one of our digits into a little 
machine which would recognize us in our riding.  There is no 
reason that we should not be able to vote remotely.  When we are 
away on parliamentary committees or overseas on some important 
issue to do with parliamentary business, why should we be 
deprived of the ability to represent our constituents by voting 
in this place?  It just does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only reason we are not moving toward some of these reforms 
is the intransigence of the minister opposite.  He is not willing 
to accept anything that represents a greater degree of democracy. 
He talks the good talk about modernizing the elections act but 
when push comes to shove he is not interested in doing that. 
He had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the bill that he 
tabled this week to change the Canada Elections Act to allow 
parties with 12 candidates to have their names on the ballot 
during elections.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the new elections act came through this place several 
months ago and the small parties, including the Communist Party 
and the Green Party, came to Ottawa to give committee evidence, 
they all said that the 50 candidate rule was unfair.  I agreed 
with them.  We worked out a compromise; 12 candidates, the number 
that is recognized in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went to the minister with that compromise and he said no. 
What happened?  He got involved in an expensive court case which 
was won by the Communist Party of Canada.  The court ruled that 
two members were sufficient to constitute a party and insisted 
that the minister come back to this place and fix the problem 
before February 15.  The day before the deadline he introduced a 
bill to change the number to 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister argued that he was trying to improve democracy by 
modernizing the bill but he had to be dragged kicking and 
screaming to that point, only to accept the number that was 
proposed in a compromise nine or twelve months ago.  In the 
meantime, he spent huge amounts of taxpayer dollars defending 
that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would predict confidently that he is into the same problem 
with the Canada Elections Act, with the challenge by the National 
Citizens' Coalition over third party advertising.  He will spend 
a fortune, probably millions of dollars, challenging it in the 
courts only to have it struck down as unconstitutional as it has 
been three times previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the sorts of issues, if the NDP really wanted to be 
forward thinking and creative, that would have moved us forward 
from where we are.  We should be talking about the things that 
would make this place work better for the people we represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another modernization we could do is, if the government would 
not accept absolutely total outright free votes, maybe we could 
agree that if, say, 30% of the total membership of the House, 
which would be about 60 members at the moment, demanded a secret 
ballot, that we would do something completely different.  Let us 
get outside the box.  If 60 members in this place demanded a 
secret ballot on a private member's bill or on a government 
motion or a government bill, then we have a secret ballot.  I 
know the minister would argue immediately that we could not do 
that because our constituents want to see how we voted.  There is 
some validity to that sort of statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the fact is that sometimes democracy would be served by 
having a secret ballot in this place.  The example I just gave, 
of the 12 candidate rule, is a good example of where a secret 
ballot could have fixed the problem.  That side of the House was 
compelled to vote for something that the courts were saying was 
wrong.  In a couple of weeks time they will vote 180 degrees 
opposite for something completely different because they are 
whipped into voting the way they are told, instead of voting with 
common sense.  There are good debates in the House where common 
sense prevails.  Members from the opposite side have told me that 
they liked the idea I had talked about with a proposed bill but 
that they could not vote for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong with our democratic process when we 
have that state of affairs in the House of Commons, where people 
on the government side know that they should not be voting 
against something but they are compelled to vote against it by 
the whipping on that side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could achieve a lot with a decent piece of parliamentary 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from parliamentary reform, members of the NDP could have 
talked about other issues. I mentioned child poverty.  They are 
always on about taxing the rich and that corporations do not pay 
enough income tax or that 1,000 corporations did not pay any 
income tax this year.  I have been in at least three public 
debates with the member from Vancouver East where she has spouted 
the usual rhetoric about corporations that do not pay income tax. 
I have challenged her on all three occasions to name the 
companies that did not pay the income tax and to tell me why they 
did not.   She has never come up with a list and has never come 
up with the reasons.  I know why.  As soon as she gets the names 
of the companies and looks at the reasons, she will see there are 
very good reasons for not paying the income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Royal Trust, I think, was used as an example 
one time.  It is a subsidiary of another company.  It transferred 
its profits to the parent company which then paid the income tax.

order.  There is such a thing as a rule of relevancy.  No wonder 
people do not think much of the institution.  We have a debate on 
a specific topic, PR, and we have a member who is hardly talking 
about it at all.  Mr. Speaker, I would like you to call him to 
order and get him to address the motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Of course we are all 
expecting the hon. member for North Vancouver to indeed tie up 
his remarks to the subject at hand.  On the other hand, if the 
hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle has questions or comments, he 
should feel free to stand up and I will recognize him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as you know, I always manage 
to tie it into the topic in the end and I certainly will in this 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was stating, this day could have been used to debate 
critical NDP issues, such as corporations that do not pay any 
taxes.  I am sure that at least half of the reason the member 
wants to keep stopping me is if there are NDP members watching 
today all manner of myths are being dispelled about the rhetoric 
that is handed out to them on a daily basis.  Whenever I have 
these people approach me in my office I always ask for examples 
of the corporations that did not pay taxes and the reasons they 
did not.  When they do the research they find out that it is all 
nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP members could have used their day today for these other 
topics and we could have talked about these critical key issues. 
Instead of that, we are stuck with an issue that we have debated 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other members of my party will say, we do support the thrust 
of the motion.  If it were votable today, we would be voting in 
favour of it.  Unfortunately, it is non-votable.  That is just an 
example of how undemocratic this place really is.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I commend the member opposite for his 
remarks, particularly as they are aimed at the issue at point, 
proportional representation.  I would like to ask the member a 
somewhat delicate question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He alluded in his remarks to the possibility of being able, with 
electronic voting, to vote from one's constituency.  I would like 
to ask him a question.  Does he feel that an MP's primary 
responsibility should be to be at parliament, on this hill at 
least if not in this Chamber, when parliament is in session?  In 
other words, do his voters not actually expect him to be here in 
Ottawa, at parliament, when the House is sitting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a great question from 
the member on the Liberal side:  Do the constituents expect us to 
be here in parliament when the House is sitting?  That is a wide 
ranging question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my experience, I have found that most people do not even know 
when parliament is sitting, for a start.  In the summertime, they 
quite often ask when we are going back to parliament.  I would 
expect the hon. member probably gets the same sorts of questions. 
People do not even know when parliament is sitting.  However, 
they also recognize, certainly in the west, that this place is 
not terribly relevant to the process of governing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, because of the lack of democracy in this place, 
they know that the outcome of every vote is known before the 
debates begin.  They know that today when I stand here and give a 
20 minute speech and answer questions it will not make one bit of 
difference to the outcome of today's business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, I made a promise to my constituents, and I repeated it 
in writing in the <I>North Shore News</I> four days before the 
vote in the election of 2000.  I promised that while parliament 
was in session that I would be here three days and in my riding 
two days.  The reason for doing that is so that I can meet with 
my constituents and deal with their concerns, assist those who 
want to come here to give evidence before parliamentary 
committees, talk about the bills that are before the House and be 
available because, frankly, many of us would recognize that a lot 
more can be achieved dealing with our constituents than can be 
achieved in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many surveys that have been done in Canada by 
Ipsos-Reid and other polling companies that have discovered that 
the longer a person is in this place as a member the more 
emphasis he or she places on helping constituents because it is 
the one area where there is satisfaction, and virtually nothing 
in this place gives satisfaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the voting from the constituency, of course at any 
time while parliament is in session there are always large 
numbers of people away on committee travel and overseas travel. 
Those people should be able to vote remotely.

at first on an experimental basis and made permanent a year 
later.  Up to 20% of the caucus of each party can be absent at 
any time and the whip votes by proxy for that 20%.  That gives 
flexibility for people to be away on committee travel or overseas 
travel and yet there is 100% attendance all the time.  Some may 
argue it is cheating the system, but it is really no different 
from being able to vote from the riding.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member who just spoke has been fighting the B.C. 
election that is going to come in a few weeks' time, and I find 
it very strange that he would also talk about why we are once 
again putting the motion forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Library of Parliament tells us that the last time there was 
a vote on PR in this parliament was in 1923.  The last time it 
was debated as a private member's initiative prior to last fall, 
when I had a motion that was votable before the House, was in 
1979 when Jean-Luc Pepin, who was a Liberal member at the time, 
had a non-votable motion on looking at the wisdom of the PR 
system being part of our electoral system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall my Motion No. 155, which was votable and was similar 
to the motion today, asked to strike an all party committee to 
look at the wisdom of looking at elements of PR for our system. 
This initiative has hardly ever been discussed in the Parliament 
of Canada, so I am very surprised the member would be criticizing 
us for putting forth an idea that has hardly ever been talked 
about before.  Just last week the member's own party had a motion 
in the House dealing with the ethics counsellor.  That was a 
repetitive thing too because that was a promise of the Liberal 
Party in the 1993 red book.  The argument he is making is a 
rather strange one indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the hon. member specifically about proportional 
representation.  He has studied the New Zealand system and I 
would like to have him tell the House what kind of model of PR he 
would think is relevant for our country.  We are a unique 
federation.  We have the uniqueness and distinctiveness of 
Quebec.  Geographically we are the second largest country in the 
world outside of Russia.  We have very diverse histories and so 
on.  What kind of a model would he suggest we look at if indeed 
we did have an all-party committee to take a look at this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind the House that I think the chief electoral officer 
has a mandate in which he could look at PR.  Therefore all we 
need to do is strike a committee to look at various electoral 
systems.  I wonder what contribution he would make in regard to 
the kind of model if we indeed had such a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would first say that the 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle should not be complaining that we 
have not had a vote in this place since 1923 when he has made the 
NDP's own motion today non-votable.  If NDP members wanted a 
vote, why did they not make it votable today?  Why use today for 
a non-votable motion if they only get one votable motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone is laughing.  Is that not a sad commentary?  This is 
what I said earlier.  Why on earth are these motions non-votable? 
It is an affront to democracy and everyone in this place should 
be absolutely ashamed that it even happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of our motion last week, which was votable, I think the 
member would have to agree there was good bang for the buck in 
that one.  The Liberals voted against their own policy.  The 
newspapers and the media were very happy to talk about that one. 
It is a shame that there will not be any coverage of today's 
discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the system I would support myself, as the member 
knows I have been the critic for direct democracy right up to the 
last election.  I always took the position that I needed to be 
neutral because people tend to be wedded to one form or another 
of proportional representation.  I always felt it would be 
difficult for me to continue in my role as critic if people felt 
that I was predisposed toward one system or another.  I would 
prefer to retain that neutrality at this time just on the off 
chance that we ever get that all party committee.  I would like 
to be sitting on the committee with people knowing that I am 
taking a neutral stand.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
find it interesting that the member refers to the issue of the 
1989 resolution of parliament with regard to child poverty.  I 
think his recollection is quite right.  In fact, it was a Friday, 
there were only 25 members in the House and there was no vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, the member did make a statement which I think is 
heard in this place often enough, and maybe it deserves the 
question.  The member said that this place is not relevant 
because the results of most votes are known even before they are 
held.  The member is probably right.  It is reflective of the 
fact that there are 172 members of the Liberal Party out of 301 
members of parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the member would like to tell the House what 
number of members a government needs to have to be able to win a 
vote.  Does it require 90% of the seats in the House and 90% of 
the votes?  Would that be acceptable to make it relevant?  At 
what level would he deem it to be relevant when there is a vote 
in the House and there is a majority government?  There must be a 
point somewhere.  If 100% of the seats were held by one party and 
there was a vote, would it be relevant?  I would really like to 
know whether or not the member has a position in regard to at 
what point the result of a vote of democratically elected members 
of parliament has relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the fact that we know the 
outcome of votes in this place before the debates begin is not 
reflective of the fact that the government has 172 members out of 
301.  It is reflective of the fact that there are no free votes. 
The fact is that because there are no free votes in this place we 
know the outcome of every vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asks me what numbers the government needs.  If this 
were truly a democratic place, the number the government would 
need is the number it could convince to vote for its measure, so 
that we could have meaningful debates here and meaningful input 
at committees because the government would be challenged with the 
task of convincing every member in this place that it was a good 
measure.  Each one of us would have a lot more power to 
influence, to tweak and to make minor adjustments.  Earlier today 
I gave the example of the 12 candidate rule; it never would have 
wasted millions of dollars of taxpayers' money because it could 
have been solved right in this place with a free vote.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since the core issue being debated today is democracy and how it 
is exercised in Canada, allow me to first congratulate the 
Speaker of the House on his election, since I had not yet had 
the opportunity to do so. Mr. Speaker, I also congratulate you 
on your appointment to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the people of Verchères—Les-Patriotes 
who, for the third time, in November 2000, elected me to 
represent them in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now turn our attention to the motion before us. The 
Canadian Alliance member who just spoke seemed surprised that 
the media will not be reporting on today's proceedings in the 
House in the news at midday, this evening or tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on what I have heard so far, I personally am not surprised 
that the media are not interested in reporting such debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the New Democratic Party brought forward this motion in 
favour of a system based on proportional representation. Then, 
the government House leader rose and, for all sorts of 
reasons—some legitimate and others totally fallacious—opposed any 
form of proportional representation. 
He went so far as to say “We do not even want to debate and 
discuss this motion”. Finally, the member of the Canadian 
Alliance member got up and said “This may be an important issue, 
but you should have discussed this or that other issue instead”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit to member of the Canadian Alliance that 
this is none of his business. It is not up to him to decide 
which issues other political parties may wish to debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party is perfectly entitled to choose 
whatever issue it may want to submit to the attention of this 
House, without having to put up with criticism from other 
political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, when the Canadian Alliance member said that the 
debates in the House were utterly pointless because they were 
not put to a vote, I think that he is underestimating or 
trivializing their importance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, it would be eminently desirable for every debate to 
be followed by a vote so that parliamentarians' intentions could 
be put on record.  But I think it is pretty insulting to us as 
parliamentarians to say that the discussions and debates we have 
in the House are pointless, to say ,if I may take the logic to 
its ultimate extreme, that freedom of expression is basically a 
waste of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that we have this privilege of full free freedom of 
expression here in the House especially.  In no way would I want 
to see us attempt to trivialize the opportunity we have to 
express our views on a whole range of public interest issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier and I repeat, it would be eminently 
desirable for us to be able to vote on each subject debated, but 
the fact of the matter is that this is not now the case.  While 
we are on the topic of the whole issue of electoral reform, we 
should perhaps in fact look at a parliamentary reform that would 
eventually result in votes on all issues that attract the 
attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address more specifically the New Democratic 
Party motion, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House strike a special all-party committee to examine 
the merits of various models of proportional representation and 
other electoral reforms, with a view to recommending reforms 
that would combat the increasing regionalization of Canadian 
politics, and the declining turnout of Canadians in federal 
elections. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of elements of interest in this motion. 
First, in connection with the statement about the desire to 
create an all-party committee to examine the merits of various 
models of proportional representation and other issue of 
electoral reform, I do not feel it is heretical in any way to 
state that it would be desirable for all parties to meet 
together in a committee to debate such issues. The matter of 
striking a committee is, I believe, an idea that merits looking 
at, merits examination and analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now some may claim that there is already a committee in the 
House mandated to examine all matters relating to the electoral 
system, the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the government, for one reason or another, as seems 
likely to be the case, for there will be no vote on this, decide 
not to follow up on the wishes expressed by the New Democratic 
Party for the striking of a special all party committee to 
examine matters of electoral reform, perhaps the procedure and 
House affairs committee, which is made up of representatives of 
all parties in the House, could decide to act on this wish. This 
could be done as a follow up on the report the Chief Electoral 
Officer must file on the last federal election and to ensure that 
we are able to make some amendments to the Elections Act in 
order to modernize it and bring it more in line with the 
expectations of Canadians and Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another very important element in this motion: the 
consideration of various models of proportional representation—I 
will come back to this in a few minutes—and other forms of 
electoral reform.   Naturally, since the start of the debate, 
the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance have taken some care to 
limit the discussion to the question of proportional 
representation.  However, I draw to the attention of the House 
the fact that the NDP motion is also intended to make us think 
about other potential or foreseeable electoral reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another part to the motion.  Reference is made to 
committee deliberations leading to a way to combat the 
increasing regionalization of Canadian politics and the 
declining turnout of Canadians in federal elections.  I will 
return to this in a few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, though, I would say quite simply that it is a 
simplification to claim that the growing regionalization of 
Canadian politics and the declining turnout of Canadians in 
federal elections is the fault solely of the current electoral 
system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1145

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that there is a host of reasons behind these two 
phenomena, and I think that it would be simplistic to say it was 
the fault of the electoral system alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to say a few words on proportional 
representation itself.  Naturally the system of proportional 
representation appears attractive from several standpoints and 
would modernize the Canadian electoral system, since most 
democracies in the world have either integrated an element of 
proportional representation or have adopted the system of 
proportional representation in its entirety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some significant benefits. 
Proportional representation, or at least the integration of a 
proportional component, could ensure better representation for 
minority groups such as cultural communities, the disabled and 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Political parties could decide to strike a balance between the 
number of women and men in the House of Commons and ensure that 
a larger number of women are on party lists, so as to increase 
women's representation. The same would go for young people. When 
it comes to representation, there are a number innovative 
solutions to be considered here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very important and interesting factor with a system that 
is fully or partially based on proportional representation is 
the idea that parliament would better reflect the various 
ideologies among the public, that the House would better reflect 
these ideologies. This would allow the small political parties 
that have a difficult time getting candidates elected under a 
single constituency single ballot system to have a voice in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, if Germany's electoral system did not have a 
proportional component, the Green Party would never have been 
represented in the Bundestag. Therefore, it is very important 
for small political parties to have a system based on 
proportional representation, so that they can be heard in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proportional representation would also eliminate the inevitable 
distortions of the first past the post system.  In a system such 
as ours, it is paradoxical that a government elected with 38% or 
40% of the vote can run the country and have almost 100% of the 
power concentrated in its hands.  With a system of proportional 
representation, the distortions inherent in the present system 
could be avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was pointed out earlier, a system of proportional 
representation would result in greater co-operation among the 
various political parties in the House, since the very survival 
of a government, or its composition, depends on co-operation and 
even coalitions between various political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In countries with proportional representation, there is less of 
this very rigid dichotomy between the government, which has all 
the powers and sees itself as being in a position of almost 
dictatorial authority for four years between elections, and the 
opposition, which does its best to represent the public interest 
to the fullest extent possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain disadvantages to the system of 
proportional representation.  Thought needs to be given to how 
proportional representation can eventually be incorporated into 
the existing system while trying to avoid those disadvantages. 
We need only think of the instability to which a system of 
proportional representation can lead.  We have seen this 
especially in countries with a pure representation by population 
system, such as Israel.  This gives rise to a certain 
instability. Governments are not in power for long and depend on the 
co-operation of the various parties forming a coalition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was talk of a pizza parliament here, with five political 
parties.  What sort of parliament would there be with seven, 
eight or nine parties? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would definitely be problematical and the situation will 
have to be addressed within a study of electoral and 
parliamentary reform.  There could eventually be more than five political 
parties.  The rules would have to be changed to accommodate that reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Government in the House of Commons has raised 
the problems connected to integrating proportional 
representation with a first past the post system, in Germany for 
example.  To all intents and purposes, this leads to the 
creation of two categories of MPs. 
How can the two categories be reconciled: those elected by a 
riding and those elected from a list put forward by their party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This takes us to another problem we will eventually have to 
address: to whom MPs are answerable in a pure or mixed 
proportional representation system.  To whom are they 
answerable?  If elected by the population of a riding, we tend to 
think they are answerable to the people who elected them.  If elected from 
a list provided by the party, are they still answerable to the 
people, or to the party?  There is a problem here.  How are we 
going to reconcile all this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can foresee another really serious problem with the 
proportional representation system, for the same reasons as were 
just given by the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle relating to 
the opportunity the various regions and components of a 
federation would have to make their voice heard, if the 
electoral system tends to uniformize expectations and programs 
countrywide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle has said, a vote in 
Newfoundland has the same importance as a vote in British 
Columbia, Saskatchewan or Quebec.  Obviously, for members of a 
federation who have particular needs and expectations and wish 
to make these known through a federal parliament, a proportional 
representation system can be somewhat problematic.  I am, of 
course, referring to the very specific case of Quebec's position 
within the Canadian federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could we, if the system of proportional representation is 
intended to give a platform to the most isolated ideas, give a 
platform in a system such as this to a province that is, to all 
intents and purposes, isolated within a federation, because it 
is the only province with a francophone majority?  Clearly in 
our case this could create fairly significant problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us talks as well of examining other forms of 
electoral reform.  I would not want the government to close the 
door on this idea of the NDP simply because it does not share 
the view that there should be proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, a system is in place in Canada, and, as we know 
full well, it has certain imperfections.  Winston Churchill said 
that democracy was the least perfect of the political systems. 
Our elections act, however democratic it may be, contains 
certain imperfections and warrants a look. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last election showed us just how many gaps there are in the 
current elections act.  It needs corrective measures.  If there 
is one thing the all party committee should consider with respect 
to the Elections Act, it is first and foremost applying 
corrective measures immediately to the existing act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need think only of the issue of the appointment of returning 
officers. In the latest election, a number of incidents occurred across 
Canada arising clearly from the inexperience and, in certain 
cases, I would even say the incompetence of returning officers 
in a number of ridings.  Why is this the case?  Simply because 
returning officers are appointed not for their ability but 
because of their partisan allegiance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition parties are not the only ones to be concerned. The 
Lortie commission, which the government House leader quoted 
extensively earlier, wrote the following on page 483 of its 
report, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cornerstone of public confidence in any democratic system of 
representative government is an electoral process that is 
administered efficiently and an electoral law that is enforced 
impartially. Securing public trust requires that the election 
officials responsible for administration and enforcement be 
independent of the government of the day and not subject to 
partisan influence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not from mere opposition members. 
It is from the report of the Lortie commission on electoral 
reform and party financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also mention a statement made by the chief electoral 
officer himself, Jean-Pierre Kingsley, when he appeared before 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, on 
October 28, 1999. He said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—when I go out on the international scene I do not recommend that 
the Canadian system be emulated where it comes to the 
appointment of returning officers. I clearly indicate, as I do 
in Canada, that the present system is an anachronism. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some changes could definitely be made to the existing 
Elections Act regarding the appointment of returning officers, 
the financing of political parties, the cap on contributions and 
the restrictions as to their source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that it is wrong to think or to 
suggest that all the problems referred to in the motion, whether 
regionalization or the declining interest of Canadians in 
institutions and policies, are only due to the electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only has to think about the government's ethics to see why 
the public is losing interest, or why the Canadian federation is 
dysfunctional when it comes to regionalization.

that it is simply a matter of reforming the Elections Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Betty Hinton (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to 
the comments made on both sides of the House.  The proportional 
representation being discussed today is very valuable, and it 
should have been raised.  I appreciate the fact that everyone has 
been able to comment on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some things that were said that I take exception to 
though.  One came from my colleague in the Bloc who paraphrased 
my caucus colleague's comments as freedom of expression is a 
waste of time.  That is not the case at all.  That is not what he 
was saying.  He was saying why raise the expectations of the 
House if there will be no a vote on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I find very offensive is that part of this is 
saying there should be quotas.  I do not accept quotas in any 
form.  I do not think people should be put in the House of 
parliament based on their gender, disabilities or anything of 
that nature.  People are put in the House to represent the public 
based on merit.  That is the way it should stay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also took exception to some comments that were made by the 
government House leader when he said “force their own agenda on 
a nation as a whole”.  I believe that is what we are talking 
about when we talk about having some sort of reform. There are 
people in parts of this country who rightly believe that they 
have had the agendas of one party forced on them.  Any sort of 
parliamentary change that could lead to more freedom across the 
country would be a benefit to all of us. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her 
comments.  First of all, I must say that I tend to agree with 
her last comment regarding the intrinsic merits of parliamentary 
reform, of electoral reform or of reform of our democratic 
institutions in general and of its impact on the public good.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, like to make two points with respect to my 
comment on freedom of expression.  For the benefit of the 
Canadian Alliance member, I did indeed understand that the point 
she was making was simply that there is not much use raising an 
issue in the House if it is not put to a vote.  I have already 
said that I agreed with this point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, and contrary to what she said, I am far from 
thinking that what we are doing here today is a pointless waste 
of time.  In this regard, I pointed out that, if we took logic 
to its ultimate extreme, we could conclude that freedom of 
expression is a waste of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the issue of quotas, I do not know if she was referring 
to my own speech, but I did not advance the suggestion that 
there should be quotas for youth, the disabled, cultural 
minorities and women, far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I merely said that, in a system of proportional representation, 
political parties could increase the representation of women, 
youth, the disabled or cultural minorities simply by selecting 
those whose competence is beyond reproach and who also meet 
these other criteria, if I may say so, by putting them on their 
lists for proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reply to my colleague's question with respect to quotas, that 
was what I was talking about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to ask a question of the hon. member of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I recall correctly, some time ago, when he was the Premier of 
Quebec and leader of the Parti Quebecois, René Lévesque was in 
favour of proportional representation.  I am certain that all 
members of the Bloc Quebecois share Mr. Lévesque's point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Bloc Quebecois whip in favour of a particular model of 
proportional representation? This is my first question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second relates to Australia, which has the same system for 
the House of Commons and also a Senate that is elected by a 
system of proportional representation.  That would be another 
way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are having a discussion just on the principle of 
proportional representation. 
There are, however, a number of models of this, including the 
Italian, German, Australian, and English models.  There are a 
variety of models, therefore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had an agreement in principle to use certain elements of 
this system here, we could have an important discussion on the 
which model we could have in Canada.  This is why I have these 
questions for my friend and colleague from the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he in favour now of a model for the system of proportional 
representation and what does he want to see done with the 
Senate, which is not elected?  Do we need to have elections for 
the Senate?  What could we do about that other institution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that my colleague is 
quite right to point out that, like the Parti Quebecois, the 
Bloc Quebecois came out at its last convention in support of the 
idea of proportional representation in an independent Quebec. 
There is not a shadow of a doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I explained earlier that, within the present federal system, for 
the reasons he gave regarding the protection of smaller or less 
important groups, we have 
some concerns about the application of a system of proportional 
representation across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also expressed other concerns and reservations with respect to 
the system of proportional representation, but generally we 
recognize the advantages of such a system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, to respond to my colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle, I 
return to the wording of the motion, which invites us to examine 
various models with a view to defining what would be most 
desirable for Canada and, more broadly, and not simply with 
respect to proportional representation, what electoral reforms 
would be appropriate for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I agree entirely with the idea of creating such 
a committee, or of giving such a mandate to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
Generally speaking, the committee's mandate is to oversee the 
reform, if necessary, of federal parliamentary structures and 
procedures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Senate, Canadians' lack of interest in federal 
politics in general, which is growing as we saw during the last 
federal election, since the participation rate was among the 
lowest in Canadian history, relates, as I said earlier, to this 
whole issue of rather opaque transparency, if I can use that 
expression, on the government's part, to its control over the 
affairs of the state. The government's ethics are questionable, 
to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do think that the Senate is itself a perpetual irritant to the 
collective psyche of Canadians and Quebecers, who do not see the 
need, in a modern world, for such an archaic institution. If the 
Senate must be reformed, then so be it. But as I think the 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle said, I feel that we should consider 
abolishing it instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that in the current context the Senate, in its 
present form, does not arouse, if I may use that expression, the 
interest of voters in federal politics. Rather, they feel that 
an old system is being perpetuated, a system that no longer 
matches the new realities, a transparent democratic policy, an 
exemplary public policy of integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of our fellow citizens, as we know, see the Senate 
as a house of patronage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to share my time with this handsome young man, the 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us calls attention to the serious problem 
confronting the Canadian system of government.  I congratulate 
and thank the New Democratic Party for bringing forward the 
matter for debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system of government and the means by which we are elected 
are in crisis.  This is a horrible situation brought about by 
voter cynicism and apathy.  I need not tell the House that voter 
turnout rates have been declining.  Everyone has been talking 
about it.  There is a marked sense that it does not matter if I 
vote or not.  That is what I hear back home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about the fact that many of the backbenchers on the 
government side have to do what they are told.  They have to vote 
the way they are told.  People have lost faith in the 
parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is insufficient for us to examine only the problems facing 
our system if we do not take a critical look at ourselves to 
determine what has caused this dark shadow which has cast itself 
over our democracy.  While we do not as yet have the official 
report from the chief electoral officer on the 2000 general 
election, it is clear that there is a growing indifference toward 
the political system across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are opting for single issue groups instead of 
political parties as a place to voice their concerns.  We see it 
every day on the Hill.  People come up here to protest because 
they feel that their voices are not being heard in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Yours is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  I am glad to hear that.  The Liberal 
member just said that my voice is being heard.  I would like my 
people back in Saint John to know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the motion points out, there is disturbing evidence of 
continued regional alienation.  That is a sad thing.  Today we 
see a five party system in the House of Commons.  Before 1993 we 
did not see that.  This has caused a great deal of problems in 
the House.  A government that makes light of regional differences 
and whose Canada is the Canada of the sixties and seventies has 
created part of that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem is the abuse of the trust and authority vested 
in us as members of parliament and in the members yonder who have 
formed the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall's election was totally unnecessary.  It was called 
early, not out of conviction but out of convenience for the 
Liberal Party.  Calling an election when the opposition was not 
yet prepared was about politics and not about principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elections Canada has suggested that the federal election cost 
taxpayers over $200 million.  Let us imagine what incredible 
benefits we could have received by using that $200 million in 
other ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think of the ever present crisis in the health care 
system.  If we assume an average of $150,000 for a doctor, we 
could have afforded 1,274 more family physicians.  We could have 
had over 5,000 more nurses.  We could have funded a four year 
medical program at Dalhousie University for over 6,000 students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine the appreciation of the Canadian people had the 
federal government invested in 80 MRI units at a cost of about 
$2.5 million each instead of wasting $200 million.  St. Joseph's 
Hospital and the Saint John Regional Hospital in my riding would 
have been eternally grateful if the federal government had 
invested in new equipment for our hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have chosen to give that money directly 
back to Canadian taxpayers.  If it wanted to give a GST rebate on 
heating oil, it could have provided all Canadians with it, not 
just those who are in jail.  This would have cost a total of $118 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have provided a $500 tax credit for 
emergency service volunteers, such as our brave volunteer 
firefighters.  The excise tax on diesel fuel could have been 
eliminated.  This is a tax that is crippling our trucking 
industry for the same $200 million that the government instead 
chose to spend on an exercise in personal ambition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifteen minutes ago I was passed a document which states that 
Canadian government officials suggest that the monetary funding 
of the Kosovo project for the RCMP and the police forces for 
budget years 2001-02 and 2002-03 will suffer significant budget 
cuts.  This is once again because the money was wasted. This is 
not what the people of Canada want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to tell members that there are many in our country 
who are far less fortunate than we are.  A $200 million 
investment in our food banks could provide well over 36 million 
meals, 2 million food baskets for families in need or could fund 
610 food banks for a full year.  The possibilities are endless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three areas where that money could have been spent that are 
close to my heart include fully compensating the merchant navy 
veterans, putting that money directly into new equipment for our 
armed forces, or even the establishment once and for all of a 
national shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians see such government waste, when they see so many 
missed opportunities, is it any wonder why they have lost faith 
in parliament?  It distresses me greatly that our people are so 
indifferent to who now forms the government of our country that 
they are unwilling to vote.  In the process they elect officials 
by default. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP motion suggests that one option might be some form of 
proportional representation but it also allows for other 
electoral reforms.  The door is open to other potential avenues 
of change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election the PC Party platform recognized the 
importance of electoral reform and promised to examine a number 
of possible changes, including proportional representation in run 
off elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recognize that many people are happy with the status 
quo.  We do agree that there needs to be a full and open debate 
before any change can be contemplated.  We must gauge whether 
there is an appetite in the country for the kind of dramatic 
changes to our basic principles of government that might well be 
needed to set our system straight.  The motion agrees with our 
position and calls on the House to begin a serious study of all 
the alternatives that are worthy of our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reaching back through our PC heritage, I must caution members of 
the perils of opening what are really constitutional questions. 
There are always difficulties in the details.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Discussions of that kind have always brought with them a 
balanced share of both unity and division.  I believe we all 
agree in the House that one thing our country does not need is 
further division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party has proposed that we restore the value of our 
parliament for Canadians to have faith in their system of 
government.  The onus is on us to make the system worthy of their 
pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the restoration involves our giving power back to the 
people and the elected representatives who they send to Ottawa, 
not only the Prime Minister or those he chooses for his cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our American neighbours elect a president and I am thankful to 
the Fathers of Confederation that they resisted the temptation to 
forge our country in their image.  Simple matters of compassion 
and common sense have become issues of competence in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know of examples when members of the governing party have 
wanted to vote against their party's stand but have been 
intimidated and threatened until they have literally broken down 
into tears or they have been forced to sit on the opposite side 
as an independent.  This was the case with respect to child 
pornography, hepatitis C and the ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to praise those precious few members on 
the other side who have had the courage in the past, some even in 
the recent past, to challenge their government when they believe 
it to be wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day the challenges we must overcome as a 
parliament are varied and wide ranging, so too must be the 
options we examine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say again without hesitation that the New Democratic Party and 
the member for Halifax should be commended for bringing the issue 
to the House for debate.  Whatever the solution to our problems 
may be, it is only through reasoned debate in this great House 
and in the homes of Canadian families that we will arrive at it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to make a comment in terms of our electoral 
system compared to the rest of the world.  I have a list of 98 
countries that have a proportional representation system or a 
semi-proportional representation system in their legislatures 
dependent on whether they are a unicameral state or, in the lower 
house, of a bicameral state like we have in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also countries that have proportional representation 
in the second House.  Australia, for example, has first past the 
post in the lower house and they have proportional representation 
in the senate.  Most countries in the world do have a system that 
has PR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a minute to place on the record some of the 
countries that do have a PR system.  They are:  Australia, 
Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, 
Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, 
Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, and 
Venezuela, just to mention a few.  Since PR— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do protest.  This is a 
debate in the House on an issue that the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle has told us he thinks is important. Reading a 
list into the record is not part of the debate nor relevant to 
what we are discussing.  I would suggest that he should go on 
with his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  This is not really a 
point of order, but I would ask the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle to come to the point, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this period of time is 
for either questions or comments.  I said I had a comment.  This 
demonstrates the need in our country when there are 100 countries 
in the world that have an element of PR in their lower houses or 
in their house if they are a unicameral system.  Other countries, 
like Australia, have it in the other house, the senate, where all 
the members are chosen by PR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is extremely relevant in terms of looking at what we want 
and perhaps learning a little bit from other countries around the 
world.  We may not have all the solutions in Canada. Perhaps the 
Germans, the Scandinavians or others have some answers to the 
questions we are looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member for Saint John like to comment on the fact that 
so many other countries have at least an element of PR? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree that there are 
other countries with PR.  When I was mayor, I was asked to go to 
Germany to look at unification.  I met with many of the 
representatives of the German government while I was there.  I 
have also had the opportunity to do that in St. Petersburg, 
Russia and in other countries.

has voted against the government on major legislation at least 
four times and countless times on private members' legislation. I 
do not feel torn.  I feel that I am still a valued member of this 
side.  The reality is that we always, as MPs, have the option of 
voting as we think it is necessary, not just for our constituents 
but for the issues as we understand them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not noticed many instances where her party members have 
actually voted against their party's position on any major 
legislation.  I would ask the member for Saint John to comment on 
that.  Does she apply free votes only on the government side or 
would she see them on her side as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the hon. 
member has raised this point.  In 1993 when I was elected and 
Jean Charest was the leader of our party, he told me that he 
wanted me to stay.  I told him that I would stay but I told him 
never to tell me how to vote, and he never ever did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then on this side of the House we have had the freedom to 
vote on all the moral and major issues.  When the Liberal member 
said he voted against his government and that he is still sitting 
there, I wonder whatever happened to poor old Nunziata after he 
stood up and voted against the government. They told him to go 
over there and sit in the corner somewhere, but he could not vote 
again with the Liberals.  He was gone.   We have a lot of free 
votes and we will continue to have them because we—

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to take part in the debate on 
what is a very important issue and again to echo the comments of 
the ever loquacious and relevant member for Saint John, New 
Brunswick.  She has pointed out that the NDP has brought forward 
a motion that is very much relevant and very much on the minds of 
many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened with interest to the comments of the government 
House leader that this was not something he encountered during 
the past campaign.  He did not feel that the majority of 
Canadians were bursting with enthusiasm for any sort of 
parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the outcome of the election is what highlights the 
importance of this issue.  As we saw in previous elections, for 
example in 1997, we had a majority government elected by 38% of 
the Canadian electorate, which resulted in a disproportionate 
majority government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  You wouldn't say that if it was a 
Conservative government, would you? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when in opposition the 
member opposite like most Liberal members used to rail against 
the government and the need for proportional representation.  We 
have seen this kind of pliable stance taken time and time again 
by not only that member but the government House leader saying 
that things had to be changed and that a new system has to be 
brought about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they sit pretty.  They sit in an opportunity before 
Canadians with the chance to bring about real parliamentary 
reform.  Will it happen?  Absolutely not.  Will they give lip 
service to it?  Will they talk about ways to modernize 
parliament?  Yes, they will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will talk to Canadians endlessly about the pressing need 
for electronic voting and try to pass it off as electoral reform. 
It is absolute nonsense.  It would allow government members to 
stay away from the Chamber and it would allow voices of the 
opposition to be further muted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen an unprecedented period in the last seven to eight 
years of Liberal administration where the government has done 
everything in its power to mute the opposition.  It has done 
everything to essentially take away methods by which the 
opposition could raise relevant issues, important objections to 
whether it be government legislation, policy direction or 
legitimate issues the opposition has heard from its constituents. 
We have seen systematic efforts to emasculate the opposition in 
that regard.

special all party committee to examine the merits of various 
methods of proportional representation.  It also does not limit 
the debate to just proportional representation.  It is a broad, 
all encompassing, all inclusive motion that calls upon all 
members of the Chamber to take part in the debate, to flesh out 
the matter and to give it some substance.  We know that is the 
last thing the government wants to do and the last thing we will 
see.  The simple reason for that—and the member opposite may 
holler his righteous indignation—is that it is not in the 
government's interests to change a system that rewards it.  There 
is no appetite to bring about a change that will undermine the 
current government's ability to be elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was demonstrated in the past, by low voter turnout and the 
proportionately low electoral support, there is no interest in 
changing the system that might eke away or somehow result in the 
government not being re-elected.  That is not in the interests of 
the current government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The temptation in the debate will be to focus on proportional 
representation but I do not believe that is the intention or the 
fashion in which the motion is before us.  It mentions 
proportional representation but it leaves the door open to look 
at other methods of electoral reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going outside the traditional party parliament system is a way 
in which this place can gain greater relevance in the hearts and 
minds of Canadians.  Empowering individual members of parliament 
is also a very important part of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The faith that Canadians have in their representatives is at the 
very root of this issue and is at the very heart of what should 
be accomplished throughout the debate and throughout future 
debates if this motion were to pass in a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that Canadians understand the significance of 
committees.  Committees go on sometimes out of the glare of the 
media.  They are without the partisan tone that we all tend to 
fall into in the Chamber.  Committees are where legitimate work 
can be done, the heavy slogging, and where the opportunity exists 
to hear from impartial stakeholders in matters such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committee work is crucial to the inner workings and the success 
of parliament.  On the one hand it is unfortunate that the public 
does not have access to all of that work, but it is important 
that it is done in a forum where real ideas can be discussed 
without the sometimes poison partisanship that ekes into the 
public debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been mentioned as well that much of the power that is 
lost by members of parliament has been consumed by lobby groups 
or interest groups that take a particular position on any given 
issue.  That is fine.  That is a natural system that has evolved 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, lobby groups that have access or trade on access to 
government becomes a little more troubling.  When power is 
increasingly concentrated, as we have seen under the Liberal 
government, in the PMO and those who surround the Prime Minister, 
either by favour or appointment, this is where it becomes 
undemocratic.  It becomes most troubling when people trade on 
access and when people can bring about and effect decisions 
because of a personal or past connection, whether it be former 
cabinet ministers or otherwise.  This is where democracy starts 
to come undone.  The erosion and the rot sets in when individual 
members are not feeling empowered to the extent that they feel 
they have legitimate input into our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again in the House of Commons, the practice of 
this government has been to make public announcements, important 
shifts in policy, important public pronouncements in the press 
gallery across Wellington Street as opposed to standing here 
before Canadians and displaying respect for not only their own 
colleagues but for opposition members who carry the same burden, 
and I do not say burden in the negative sense, but carry the same 
responsibility of being elected by Canadians. 
Those announcements are not made here.  They are most often made 
across the way in front of the press or they are leaked.  The 
trial balloons are sent out prior to the announcements actually 
being made public.  That practice has to stop.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to the issue of committees.  There was a recent 
opportunity to empower and put greater faith in committees by 
giving them the opportunity to elect chairmen, but again this 
would not be consistent with the PMO's reign of power, with the 
hold on those committees to control the agenda and to control the 
membership.  If one is representing the PMO, one does not want to 
have a rogue chairman who might somehow be out of step or out of 
line with the PMO's thinking on any given issue.  The government 
completely passed up this opportunity, displaying once again my 
point that this talk of parliamentary reform, this lip service 
that we hear from the government, is really just that.  There is 
really no genuine intent to reform this place, because it would 
undermine, undercut and erode the ever increasing concentration 
of power that we have seen in the Prime Minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not take my word for it.  Do not take any member of 
parliament's word for it.  History will bear this out. 
Professors of politics have repeatedly suggested that this is the 
case in the country.  It is well documented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is brief.  I want to again suggest that we have 
an opportunity here to take part in a very meaningful debate to 
discuss ideas about parliamentary reform and electoral reform.  I 
very much associate those two because it lends greater legitimacy 
to parliament if we have a system in place in which Canadians 
have faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle has listed at length the 
number of countries—100 plus—around the world that have 
embraced a system of proportional representation or a derivation 
thereof.  This is an opportunity for Canadians to learn more 
about what sometimes is seen as an overly complicated system but 
is not.  There are systems that working very effectively in 
places like Australia and Ireland and in places that have a 
history of democracy much longer than our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to partake in the debate, although 
I do not appreciate the endless hyena heckling that is coming 
from across the way.  This debate once again demonstrates that we 
in this place have an opportunity to say what we have to say on 
an important subject such as this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the debate with 
great interest.  I have studied this from time to time, maybe not 
as much as the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, but I have been 
very interested in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member a question.  You mentioned the 
fact that the Liberals formed a government with 38% of the vote. 
That too was a regionalized vote.  How would proportional 
representation affect or change the position that I find my 
constituents in, where we have two government members elected 
from the province and some 16 or 14 more from across the west? If 
we had proportional representation, you still would not find a 
member of the ruling party standing on his or her feet and 
speaking out for the constituents who are going downhill very 
quickly.  Proportional representation might change the 
composition, but in a country as wide as Canada I still think we 
would fail to get regional issues addressed by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present Saskatchewan has two Liberal members.  Never once, 
going into my second term, have I seen anyone on that side of the 
House standing up in support of true agricultural reform that 
would benefit the people in western Canada.  Look at what 
happened in the November election.  Could the hon. member tell us 
how proportional representation would benefit my constituents and 
put them at ease that their voice was going to be heard by the 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Before I give the floor 
to my colleague, I would like to remind members to address their 
comments and questions to the Chair, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to respond directly to the 
question, I think there are two issues that the hon. member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain has pointed out.  There is the issue of 
whether there would there be more opposition, as opposed to 
whether the members elected under the current system in 
government would have a greater say or a greater ability to speak 
out for regional issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that there will always be regional 
issues that arise.  I am very proud of the province that I come 
from and of that region in northern Nova Scotia of 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and all that it has accomplished 
and will accomplish.  I bring those issues forward on behalf of 
my constituents, as does the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two separate issues here.  One is the issue of having 
a voice in government, and the effective individual ability to 
raise regional issues or issues of importance also on a national 
scale is something different.  The dynamic that exists within the 
current government does not speak to that.  It does not encourage 
that.  It does not embrace individuality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue about how it would result in a change in the 
current dynamic or the current makeup of the House is that under 
proportional representation, for one thing, we would not have a 
majority government.  Second, I would suggest that there would be 
greater representation under that system in terms of it really 
expressing the will of the people.  For example, if we had not a 
first past the post system but a system of runoff, we would not 
have these types of anomalies whereby members of parliament are 
elected with such a low proportion of the vote.  I think that is 
how the dynamic might differ if we had a system such as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for his question.  I know that he is 
engaged and interested in this issue as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is always 
very interesting when new ideas such as these are advanced.  The 
danger, however, comes when they are taken to extremes.  A 
politically correct attitude can go too far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked in a party that talked about proportional 
representation.  One thing led to another and suddenly all sorts 
of minorities—visible and invisible minorities, women, sexual 
dissidents—wanted to be represented in parliament. 
The result would be that one person could have four votes: one by 
virtue of his citizenship and three more by virtue of his other 
attributes.  Is this not a danger? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the issue is not 
to rush towards judgment in changing our system.  No one is 
advocating that.  Even the mover of the motion has suggested that 
we go about this in a very pragmatic and practical way, which is 
to have an all party committee look at different forms of 
potential proportional representation or other changes to the 
electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that minority rights are always important.  That is very 
much a part of this debate.  I am encouraged by the level of 
interest of those who have taken part in the debate today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad that the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough is encouraged by the level of 
debate because to some extent, although I was encouraged by the 
level of debate coming forward from the Progressive Conservatives 
on the issue, I have not been encouraged by the level of debate 
coming forward from some quarters of the House.  I think the 
attitude of the Liberal members on this has generally been far 
too defensive and not open and exploratory enough as to how we 
might address some agreed upon problems in our electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with 
the hon. member from Winnipeg North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed in the defensiveness of the Liberals on the 
motion.  We made this a non-votable motion for a reason.  We 
thought that we might create an opportunity for non-partisan 
debate in this place.  There are legitimate arguments to be made 
in favour of incorporating some element of proportional 
representation and there are legitimate criticisms of 
proportional representation as it has been implemented in many 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been nice to have had that kind of debate.  We 
were trying to transcend the sort of cheap shot culture that 
sometimes develops in the House.  Some members who I sometimes 
associate with a higher level of debate have disappointed me 
today by being so ready to partisanize the debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, I want to pick up on the point made by the member 
for Souris—Moose Mountain.  He was a member who did try to 
engage the topic and I thought he asked a good question of the 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  He said that even if 
there were more members from the west on the government side, he 
had no confidence that they would be saying what he wanted them 
to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is to miss the point.  It is to miss the point 
that regions have diverse points of view.  What the problem is in 
our current system the way it has developed is that it creates 
the impression that regions only have one point of view:  that 
there is only one point of view from Alberta, the Alliance point 
of view; that there is only one point of view from Ontario, the 
Liberal point of view; that in the last two parliaments there has 
been only one point of view from Quebec, the Bloc point of view. 
The list goes on and on of times in which it seems, if we look at 
parliament, that there is only one point of view from a 
particular region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. member from Moose Mountain that his question 
is a good example of the problem.  He assumes that there is only 
one point of view from the west.  Indeed, I think that is a 
characteristic of his party, which I sometimes find offensive, 
that is, the fact that it sometimes pretends to speak for all of 
the west in the way that western Progressive Conservatives once 
did.  Even when there were three NDP governments and NDP members 
of parliament galore in western Canada, there was still this 
pretension, particularly on the part of right wing western 
Canadians, that somehow they spoke for the west.  They speak for 
one point of view in the west, but they do not speak for all 
westerners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to see is a parliament in which that diversity of 
views that exists within regions, not between regions, is 
reflected here in the House of Commons, not just for the sake of 
accuracy, but because we believe that would lead to a parliament 
and a political culture that would be less divisive, that would 
tend more toward national unity, that would create fewer 
opportunities and less temptation for political parties to 
exploit regional perceptions, regional hostilities and regional 
grievances, both real and perceived, in order to obtain electoral 
success, electoral success in a particular region but often at 
the expense of a more national political success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when we are talking about national unity in Canada, as 
we always are, I suppose we could say, at a time when western 
alienation is in the headlines and of course at a time when 
Quebec separatism is still in the headlines, it would be very 
important for us to at least consider—and this is all the motion 
asks parliament to do—setting up a process by which we could 
consider ways in which we might, through electoral reform, 
alleviate the problem that I have just identified.  We would then 
stop having, as I tried to say earlier in a question and comment 
opportunity, an electoral system which throws up, no pun 
intended, these homogeneous regional identities that mislead 
Canadians and lead Canadians into a way of looking at political 
parties and the political culture in their regions that denies 
the heterogeneous as opposed to the homogeneous nature of their 
regions when it comes to politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If only, and I say this partly facetiously, all provinces could 
be like some provinces that tend to have a diverse political 
culture and elect members from all political parties.  I am 
thinking of my home province of Manitoba as a province that does 
so more consistently than others.  There are other provinces like 
Nova Scotia which will do that, although sometimes a certain 
party gets blanked out there as the Liberals did in 1997.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is this, without wanting to get into the sort of 
parliamentary and political trivia of who got elected where and 
when, we have a serious problem in Canada in terms of the 
regionalization of our politics and the regionalization of our 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the motion is asking the House to do could be done if there 
was consensus, but obviously there is not.  We were wise on two 
counts.  We rightly predicted that if we moved a votable motion 
it would lose because the government has demonstrated no interest 
in this project.  We wanted to make it non-votable at this point 
because if there was a consensus we could move by consensus or by 
unanimous consent.  We wanted to make the point that we should be 
having this debate in a non-partisan context with the best 
interests of the country in mind, rather than the best interests 
of the Liberal Party in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not make any apologies for being partisan.  I have seen the 
smiles on the faces of the Liberal members.  They are basically 
saying what the Prime Minister said to me last year when I asked 
him a question based on this very same idea.  I asked him whether 
or not he would consider agreeing to an all party committee that 
would look at proportional representation. He said “the NDP 
always lose, no wonder they want a different system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we always lose, that is fair enough, and the Liberals 
always win, or so they think they do, and most often they do. It 
is a very successful political party.  Surely there is a 
responsibility on the part of a political party with so much 
responsibility to ask itself just every once in a while, or on a 
day like today on a non-votable motion, whether or not there is 
not something that might be in the interests of the country which 
is not in the short term interest, or for that matter the long 
term interest, of the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals are interested in the whole question of majority 
and minority government, which is another thing talked about, I 
do not take it for granted that whatever system we might come up 
with will always produce minority governments.  Some studies have 
been done that showed how one could have an element of 
proportional representation but would also still ensure 
majorities, except that those majorities would be more 
representative.  Canadians would know that the people who were in 
that majority caucus were from right across the country and not 
exclusively from one particular region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the majority-minority hang up is the Liberal hang up, take 
that hang up into the all party committee meeting and look at 
models that might be designed to address that concern, rather 
than dismissing out of hand the idea that this would be a good 
thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed in the government's response today and in 
the response of some members.  However, all in all it has been 
partly the kind of debate that we had hoped to achieve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague who is a 
long time veteran of the House of Commons.  He has been pushing 
reforms like this in a very even handed manner.  He is not saying 
that it will benefit strictly our party or diminish another 
party.  He is basically saying is we need this debate for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for him would be how do we translate the debate 
today into the average Canadians' lives to make it relevant so 
that they can push their members of parliament to have this 
debate in the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one thing that would be 
nice is if this particular debate was being covered more 
thoroughly by the media.  Maybe it is being covered remotely, 
anonymously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes we are criticized in this place because all we do is 
engage in scandal mongering and partisan activity.  When a 
political party brings forward a motion that tries to elicit an 
intelligent, constructive debate on a topic which elsewhere in 
the country is being discussed in an intelligent, non-partisan 
way and to the extent that we have, but not totally, I would hope 
this would be the kind of thing that would be covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a concern that goes right across the political spectrum. 
I say this particularly to the member for North Vancouver who 
spoke on behalf of the Alliance Party.  I am told he was not at 
his best in contributing to the debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of issue that brings together a Judy Rebick on 
the left and a Walter Robinson on the right, the National 
Citizens Coalition.  I guess where it does not have any 
resonance, or so it would seem today, is in the so-called centre, 
the Liberals.  I say so-called centre because the Liberals really 
are as right wing a party as we would ever want to find on most 
issues.  They see themselves as exercising the modern equivalent 
of the divine right of kings to govern.  It is that sense that 
comes from the Liberals that somehow they have this divine right. 
It is such an illegitimate divine right.  It is a divine right 
that comes from very seldom obtaining a majority of the votes in 
any given federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the question, we need to get out there and talk to 
individual Canadians about the need for electoral reform and 
for proportional representation so that they can make their vote 
count.  That might not always be helpful to the NDP.  I do not 
think we should assume that.  There are people who would like to 
vote for the Green Party, for instance.  They vote NDP now, where 
the NDP is competitive or either the incumbent is NDP or is seen 
to be a possible winner, because they see the NDP as being more 
of an environmental party than the other parties.  However, if 
they could vote green and make their vote count, in terms of 
getting Green members into the House of Commons on the basis of 
proportional representation, that might be harmful to New 
Democrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will all win and lose in various ways depending on the 
various permutations and combinations at any given proportional 
representation system and any given election.  However, the real 
winner, if we do it right, would be Canadian democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to commend the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona for what I 
think is his hallmark to make an appeal to all members to rise 
above the short term considerations, to rise above the partisan 
considerations and think about what the objective of this 
exercise is and what is the objective of the debate is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member for North Vancouver used up half his time 
beating up on the NDP because we did not make the motion votable. 
We brought in motions that have been votable in the past.  In 
fact, we had some success in getting the government to support 
some of our votable motions.  For instance, we had motions on 
banning bulk water exports and advancing the Tobin tax.  These 
have been helpful as a way of registering support but they do not 
necessarily get the job done.  We get the support on the motion 
but the object of the exercise is to engage parliamentarians in 
doing what is right for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is an opportunity for us to advance that and for us to 
work together, not just opposition parties against government but 
hopefully all parliamentarians who understand that we have a 
crisis in terms of the low voter participation and in terms of 
how regionalized our politics are.  One of the things that is 
very disappointing is that the Alliance Party says it supports 
the notion of proportional representation but what did the 
Alliance spokesperson do?  He spent half his time beating up on 
the NDP for things that have nothing to do with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a brief question of the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona.  Frankly, it arises from a well known 
Canadian political scientist by the name of Henry Milner who said 
“It is one thing to lament polarization; it is another to insist 
on maintaining the very institutions that exacerbate it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member elaborate on how the kind of polarization 
we have seen in the last few years, that is surely tearing the 
country apart and taking us away from the focus on moving 
forward, could be cut down by a system of proportional 
representation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if we incorporated some 
element of proportional representation into our system and 
incorporated it in a way that would led to the regions being 
better represented in all caucuses and led to less temptation on 
the part of all political parties to play regional cards in their 
politics, we would have a country much more inclined to national 
unity in its politics rather than to national or inter-regional 
hostility in its politics.

have been an opportunity for them to bring forward some of their 
proposals.  Instead, we get the kind of performance that we got 
from the member for North Vancouver. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to follow my colleague, the 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona, in discussing this very serious 
proposal before parliament.  I share the member's comments and 
concerns about how members of the Liberal Party and the Alliance 
caucus have treated this motion with so much disdain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who better than the member for Winnipeg—Transcona to 
acknowledge the problem that that creates for the future of this 
place and for democracy in this country.  The member from 
Transcona has served this place for almost 22 years.  That kind 
of service certainly gives him the right to speak in this place 
with force.  He ought to be listened to by all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that after representing a constituency and 
serving in this place for some 22 years, one would get stuck in 
one's ways, get hung up on tradition and not be willing to look 
at new innovative approaches.  Well, that is not always the case. 
In fact the opposite is the case for the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona who has continued over the course of those 
years to respect the traditions of this place while at the same 
time fighting for innovations and improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for our colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle, another 
longstanding member of the House who has for many years 
persistently raised the idea of electoral reform and proportional 
representation in this place and everywhere possible across the 
country.  That should be a lesson and a model for members of the 
government side, at least, who have members who have served this 
place for great lengths and who should be reminded about how 
important it is to get out of the rut and look at new innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same cannot be said for the Alliance.  The most recent 
political party on the scene seems to be the most resistant to 
change and the most contrary to any kind of cross party 
productive debate and dialogue on the part of parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members in the House will see the seriousness of this 
motion and look at it in terms of what we can do to make a 
difference in this place in addressing a very serious problem in 
Canada today.  Let us remember, this motion is about a problem we 
have in Canadian society and is proposing a way to solve the 
problem.  It is not coming forward with a set prescription and a 
fixed idea but is proposing that parliament look at the problem 
and come up with solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is quite simple.  It is something each and every one 
of us deals with on a day to day basis, and that is the growing 
sense from Canadians that they feel helpless and hopeless in this 
political system and in this changing global economy.  If we stop 
and think about the apathy, the cynicism, the doubt and despair 
that people feel about our political system and about some of us 
as politicians, is that not enough of a reason to look at an 
alternative to how we elect our members? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just members of the New Democratic Party who are 
proposing this.  This is not about what is good for the NDP. This 
is, as my colleague said, something that is about the future of 
the country and the health of democracy. 
I want to quote from a reputable organization, the Centre for 
Research and Information on Canada, and refer to the January 18, 
2001 issue of <I>Opinion Canada</I> where it is clearly stated 
that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a profound political malaise in Canada.  It has 
developed gradually.  There have been various signs of it, which 
when viewed in isolation, mean little.  When taken together, 
however, a disconcerting reality emerges. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely this accurate description of the political malaise in 
Canada ought to be taken seriously.  Surely every issue and idea 
that is put on the table to deal with the malaise ought to be 
taken seriously and not just dismissed out of hand, as members of 
the Liberal party are wont to do today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from my colleagues about why the motion is before 
us.  We have heard from many members about why proportional 
representation needs to be considered in the context of the 
political malaise and of voter apathy.  We have heard from 
members that reform needs to be considered because of Canada's 
Balkanization along regional lines.  Surely that kind of 
devastating and disastrous development ought to be redressed as 
soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another reason that we need to look at proportional 
representation.  I refer to a left-wing magazine, <I>Canadian 
Dimension</I>, and to an article written by Denis Pilon in its 
November-December 2000 issue.  Mr. Pilon says that Canada needs 
proportional representation to deal with Balkanization and the 
fact that our electoral system has become inherently perverse in 
terms of reflecting the will of voters.  He also suggests that we 
need to look at PR as a way to deal with the fact that our 
electoral system has become dominated by spin and media.  He goes 
on to talk about the money driven politics of media and spin. He 
refers to some of the long term structural changes in campaign 
finance, voter contact and political communication that have led 
to Canadian politics becoming more media dominated and more open 
to spin and the tools of commercial advertising than ever before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another reason we need to look at proportional 
representation.  It is another justification for opening up 
discussion on this very important matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Denis Pilon in that article also suggested: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly needed to adopt some form of PR.  By doing so we will open up 
more democratic space for new ideas, new representational 
concerns and even new parties if that is what Canadians want.  At 
the same time, PR will contribute to a different kind of 
democratic process.  Election results will be more transparent 
and less open to spin and horse race coverage.  Majority 
governments will likely result from a coalition of parties, and 
media will have to comment on the deliberations and negotiations 
with more than just sound bites.  Money will still make itself 
felt in the political process but it will have to work harder and 
longer.  PR will open more space to resist its machinations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is another very important reason for looking at a complete 
revamping of our electoral system and for considering 
proportional representation or a mix of our present first past 
the post system and the PR model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The malaise I talked about is serious.  It is not just a result 
of our electoral system and the way we elect members, although 
the first past the post system is a significant part of the 
growing cynicism and apathy among Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as important is the way our present election system works 
against people.  Many members have commented before and during 
the debate about the serious disenfranchisement people feel and 
have experienced in terms of the way our present elections are 
run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many have commented on the damaging consequences of the 
permanent voters list in terms of denying low income Canadians, 
students and people who must move regularly, the ability to 
exercise their democratic rights and freedoms.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Palliser, has described the impact 
of the permanent voters list on Canadians as rank discrimination. 
I cannot agree with him more coming from a constituency where 
some 40% of the people live below the low income cutoff line.  If 
time permitted I could describe in great detail how these people 
felt about being left off the voters list, about the difficulty 
they had getting on the voters list and about their sense of 
being completely disenfranchised from the democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The double whammy comes from an electoral system that does not 
reflect the majority will of Canadians.  It comes from a system 
that makes it very difficult for people to get on the voters list 
and exercise their right to vote with as few barriers as 
possible.  Those things have to be addressed, and that is the 
purpose behind the motion today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a very important issue, especially in a system 
like ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned that she is supporting proportional 
representation.  Some countries in the world, especially east 
European countries, have such a system.  Some countries have a 
mix of PR and first past the post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If proportional representation is NDP policy, would it consider 
adopting it in the two provinces that have NDP governments?  It 
could be tested at the provincial level before being tested at 
the federal level.  If PR is that party's policy, perhaps it 
should consider adopting proportional representation in a 
province where it has control.  We could then see how the public 
would react, and perhaps it could then be adopted federally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is an 
interesting proposition on the part of the Liberal member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party prefer to show leadership at the 
federal level.  That is why we have the motion before the House 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the federal New Democratic Party's policy to pursue the 
idea of proportional representation and to ensure that the 
necessary changes to our electoral system are made so that people 
would not feel disenfranchised and would believe the votes they 
cast actually counted and made a difference.  That is the kind of 
leadership we would like the federal government to show. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with this place taking the lead and providing 
direction for the rest of the country?  What is wrong with this 
place having dialogue on the merits and possibilities of 
electoral reform and proportional representation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question skirts the issue at hand, which is why Liberal 
members today have been dismissive of the motion, a motion that 
simply calls for a dialogue on the possibilities and merits of 
proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have a serious problem of political apathy and cynicism, 
it surely must be taken up by the federal government. That is 
where we must begin.  That is what Canadians are counting on us 
to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member as she talked about 
leadership.  I do not see this as a question of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a rural area in southwestern Ontario.  I am of the 
view that my constituents elected me to represent them.  I have a 
lot of concern with the idea of proportional representation 
because it means that the party will choose the people it wants 
to run.  I believe in the democratic principle that we are here 
as the result of the work we do in our ridings and as a result of 
every person in my riding having the ability to run for 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this is a question of leadership, as the hon. 
member has tried to say.  I think there are differing opinions in 
the House and from across the country on that.  We in rural areas 
are scared to adopt such a system because of our small numbers. 
There are a small number of people in agriculture, and we 
understand how important the crisis in agriculture is.  If we 
adopt a system of proportional representation, as it exists in 
certain other countries, I do not think will not have the same 
representation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to the hon. member that it is not only a question of 
whether the government wants to show leadership.  I suggest to 
her that in many ways we have shown leadership in the House on 
this issue, particularly with regard to electoral reform and 
making changes to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying we could not do more.  I would invite a debate 
on that.  However, I would say to the member that there are real 
feelings of differences in the country, which have nothing to do 
with the politics of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree 
with my colleague from the Liberal Party that there are different 
views in the House, but that is the very essence of the motion 
that is before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion recognizes that there is a looming crisis of 
political legitimacy.  It points to, what we all talked about and 
heard about, the problems with our electoral system, with 
parliamentary reform and with providing real ways for citizens to 
participate and to believe that their actions make a difference. 
If that is the case then surely the member can support the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I refer the member to one comment in the January 
issue of <I>Opinion Canada</I> which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electoral reform has been described as “the plaintiff chorus of 
the perennial losers.”  However, a study commissioned by the 
Privy Council Office and conducted by C.E.S. Franks, a noted 
Professor of Political Science, pinpointed several aspects of the 
political system for reform.  Among them was the suggestion 
that— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I have been as 
generous as I think the Chair can be.  There may be an 
opportunity to conclude those remarks at another time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a very good and very personal 
reason for being opposed in principle to the idea of proportional 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That reason is simply this.  If this parliament had proportional 
representation I would not be here.  You can hear the applause, 
Mr. Speaker.  It is true that some on all sides of the House, my 
own side as well, and a number of special interest groups out 
there in the community would be probably quite delighted if I 
were not here, but in fact I am here and I am here because of the 
first past the post constituency system that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to explain to the Canadians who may be watching a 
feature of proportional representation that tends to be 
overlooked in the debate, and that is that no matter what version 
of proportional representation we have, one way or another the 
leader, or the party leadership, gets to choose who sits in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way it works is that if it is a percentage system, and 
proportional representation is a percentage system, if the 
particular party gets say 10% to 20% of the vote, then that party 
is entitled to have a proportionate number of seats.  What 
happens in all systems of proportional representation is that in 
one way or another the party leader or the party 
leadership—sometimes it is the party leadership rather than just 
the leader himself—gets to decide after the election who gets to 
sit in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, Mr. Speaker, I can assure you in the very first place that 
I would never have been even allowed by my party to even stand a 
chance, because in 1993 when I first ran for election I was an 
unknown in the Liberal Party.  I had never had anything to do 
with the Liberal Party.  When I ran for my nomination in my 
particular riding of Hamilton-Wentworth, as it was called at the 
time, the party backroom people had decided on an entirely 
different person.  The only reason I won the nomination and 
arrived here in this House was because I had been born and 
brought up in the community and I was able to produce more 
memberships and get more votes at the nomination meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am here is because I had grassroots support, not 
from the party, not from the party leader at the time, who was 
indeed our present Prime Minister, but from the people in my 
community.  That is one of the great strengths of the first past 
the post system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on, if I may say so, because I think it is very 
important for people to understand that proportional 
representation, rather than enhancing the opportunities of people 
to be represented, or of MPs in this House, it actually 
diminishes it because proportional representation, which gives 
such power to the leader to choose who sits in the House, makes 
it very impossible to have the kind of healthy dissent that 
indeed we do have on this side of the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, I recall very vividly when the election was on in 1993, 
I ran a campaign that presented myself as a Liberal certainly, 
and a Liberal I am still, but as a very independent minded 
Liberal. In my own campaign brochure I announced that I was 
against the red book plan for a billion dollars to be spent on 
national day care.  I thought that was the wrong thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also said in my brochure that I was against the funding of 
multicultural groups for organizational assistance.  I am 
certainly in support of multiculturalism in general, but I do not 
think organizations need government largesse in order to exist. I 
ran that in my brochure during the 1993 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were people, Liberals in the riding, who were very unhappy 
with the fact that I had won the nomination because I was not the 
chosen person and they reported back to party headquarters that 
they had this renegade during the election campaign.  I got an 
amusing call from a person right in the middle of the campaign, 
who identified himself as somebody called Paul Martin and 
apparently this Paul Martin, I did not know him from Adam, was 
one of the architects of the red book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other end of the phone he said “Well, this is Mr. Martin 
calling”.  You will find out, Mr. Speaker, that this was before 
anyone was elected.  This Mr. Martin was on the end of the line 
and he said “Well, Mr. Bryden, I understand you have trouble 
with our red book”.  “Well, Mr. Martin”, I said, “I do. There 
are a couple of things in it that I disagree with very strongly 
and in fact would not go down in my riding really; they just do 
not work”.  He said “Do you not feel a little uncomfortable, 
you know, saying these things during the election campaign?”  I 
replied “Mr. Martin, do not worry, when I get elected I will 
come back up to Ottawa and I will persuade the Liberal Party not 
to go ahead with these programs”.  Because, of course, I felt 
very strongly then, as I do now, that they were not the best 
policy planks for the red book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do point out to you, Mr. Speaker, that the government never 
did actually proceed to spend a billion dollars on day care and 
there has been enormous efforts over the years to rein in 
government spending without accountability.  There is a lot of 
progress to go into that department but I feel very confident 
that as a backbench MP who was not afraid to speak out against my 
party, not “against” my party, speak out independently of my 
party, independently of the leadership, and have my own voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In proportionate representation, it is that kind of independence 
of members of parliament that would not exist.  First of all, Mr. 
Speaker, you would not even get there because no leader would in 
his right mind accept somebody who already at the very beginning 
says that he does not agree, I do not agree, with all the aspects 
of the basic platform of the party and yet I and so many in that 
election of 1993 did come to this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is because we represent our constituents, and it is 
not proportionate representation, that we have been tremendously 
successful in changing the whole attitude, the way this 
parliament, at least on this side, operates because I would 
observe and you, Mr. Speaker, are a person who has a long memory 
of this House, you will appreciate that there have been more 
votes against government policy on this side of the House than 
has ever occurred in parliamentary history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Cambridge and I were talking together during the 
debate and I was observing to him that I believe I had voted 
against the government on major policy legislation four times. 
The member for Cambridge, who sits just not very far from me, he 
went a little crimson, a little embarrassment there, because he 
had to admit that he had voted against the government even more 
often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still valued members of this party and we have never had 
any hesitation to stand up in this House and speak our minds, no 
matter what these people on the opposition say from time to time. 
We have made changes when we have spoken our minds.  I point out 
that as recently as the opposition motion of last week, four 
members of this side voted against the government.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is we consider very carefully and the reality, when 
we talk about free votes in the House, the reality is that any 
member on any side of the House does not have the time to examine 
every issue in the kind of depth that we would all like to 
examine every issue.  In fact the reason why the ability to vote 
independently, not freely, is important is when you have studied 
an issue very carefully and you want to send a message to your 
government, you do that by standing in the House, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have done that on four occasions.  The one most important to 
me, and very successful, was about five years ago the government 
was introducing a piece of legislation pertaining to electronic 
monitoring of people who were accused of sexual stalking.  The 
government's legislation proposed that this electronic bracelet 
would be put on the individual based simply on an information to 
the police authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt very strongly that this was contrary to the fundamental 
human rights of the accused.  We are not supposed to be subject 
to arbitrary arrest.  Even if it was an electronic bracelet 
operated by global positioning, if it was applied to an 
individual involuntarily in my view it was a fundamental breach 
of the rights of the accused and the presumption of innocence. I 
failed to persuade my government in caucus and I failed to 
persuade the minister of the day so I wound up standing alone in 
this House.  Mr. Speaker, you just try it; you try standing alone 
in this House when everyone is supporting the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it happened, I just happened to be the person who had studied 
it in depth that I knew it was a fundamental issue.  I am happy 
to report that the government paid attention and in the end it 
made the amendments that eliminated this offensive clause. Mr. 
Speaker, you do have this opportunity in this current system, but 
you have this opportunity because in the end you are not 
nominated because of your party loyalty.  You arrive in this 
place in our system because of the will of your constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end you are answerable to your constituents.  In the end 
the Prime Minister, no matter what he wants in this House, has to 
always allow for the fact that everyone in this House, on this 
side and that side are ultimately answerable to their 
constituents.  In the end if the government leadership steps out 
of line, the members on this side along with the members on the 
other side can get rid of the government like that, one vote of 
confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said, I think quite correctly, that the Canadian 
parliamentary system concentrates more power in the House of 
Commons and in the leadership of the party, the governing party, 
than any other parliament or democracy in the world.  It also 
provides for the instant dismissal of that government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the dynamic is over on this side, and I have to allow for 
the fact that the opposition parties, particularly the NDP and 
the Bloc Quebecois and the Canadian Alliance, but particularly 
the NDP, have never had the experience of being on the government 
side, so they have no idea of the dynamics that operate with the 
members here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that the Prime Minister always 
has to take careful account of what is happening in the opinion 
that exists on this side.  We always want to support the 
leadership. We always want to give the leadership the benefit of 
the doubt, and that is the correct thing to do, but it is still 
at our discretion, not at the leadership's discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the fundamental differences between the 
constituency system and the proportional representation system, 
because the proportional representation system gives the 
discretion to the leader or the leadership.  They get to say 
whether you are nominated or not.  They get to say whether you 
sit in the next parliament.  So if you do not mind your <I>p</I>s 
and <I>q</I>s with your leadership, you stand a good chance of not 
being named under proportional representation to the following 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very strong system.  It is not a system that does not 
need reform.  I would agree that there are things that need to be 
done, but the one thing we do not need to do is convert to 
proportional representation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also, just in passing, make the observation that the 
opposition movers of this motion, in counting all the countries 
that have proportional representation, conveniently ignore the 
fact that the four countries that retain the first past the post 
system are the most successful and oldest democracies in the 
world.  At least the top three are the oldest democracies in the 
world.  They are Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom 
and, as we learned earlier, India as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to you, Mr. Speaker, that in three of those cases 
these are countries of enormous land mass.  We cannot possibly 
hold together in a democratic system spaces that go from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, that are as enormous as Canada and 
India with its one billion population, and the United States, 
which is the fourth largest country in the world.  The three 
largest countries in the world, three out of four, are the ones 
that have the first past the post constituency system.  There is 
a reason for that.  The reason for it is that it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had minority government after minority government, as 
happens with proportional representation, I do not think we would 
last more than two decades.  We just could not last.  We could 
never tolerate what goes on in the parliaments of Israel or the 
parliaments of Italy and many other countries in the world in 
which small interest groups, which may have only 5% or 6% of the 
proportion of MPs in parliament, actually control the debate.  We 
would then be held to ransom by small special interest groups. We 
have to have a system, and we do have a system, that one way or 
another creates as many majority governments as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not our fault, it is not parliament's fault, and it is not 
the system's fault that at this moment in time the opposition is 
fractured into four parties.  I would venture to predict that in 
the next election that will change very dramatically, because the 
natural balance in the Canadian and the British parliamentary 
systems is to have two parties or three parties at the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very unusual situation, but it is only a matter of the 
Alliance and the Conservatives getting together plus the NDP 
finding a life.  I do not know where the Bloc are going to go.  I 
suspect we will see more Quebecers realizing that the Liberal 
Party is a better future for the people of Quebec than the 
separatist Bloc Quebecois, but I do not want to make this into a 
partisan dissertation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject, though,  of the power of MPs on this side to 
make their presence felt, I would like to take advantage of the 
fact that the motion is phrased widely and the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle talked about the Senate.  I would like to just 
extend it a little bit, too, and talk about electronic voting, 
because that is an issue that is very relevant right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go on record right at this moment for my 
opposition colleagues to say that I am totally opposed to 
electronic voting.  I have been arguing against it in principle 
for several years.  Obviously I am not winning all of those 
arguments on this side.  I feel that electronic voting, the 
danger of it, is as the member for Vancouver Island North 
mentioned in his speech as a positive.  He said “Look, what can 
happen is that I can press a button and vote from my constituency 
and I would not even have to be here”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we talk about maintaining the relevance of parliament and 
maintaining the abilities of members of parliament to influence 
the course of politics in this country, to influence the 
government, we have to be here in this Chamber.  The terrible 
temptation of electronic voting is to do precisely what the 
member for Vancouver Island North suggested.  We could have 
electronic voting only in this Chamber and require the presence 
of everyone, but that has its flaws as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back to the dynamics of what happens on this side as 
government MPs.  It becomes terribly important whether or not you 
stand with your party or you do not stand with your party.  Prior 
to 1993 the tradition in this House among all the parties was 
that if members did not agree with their parties, whether it was 
in the opposition or on the government side, they would just 
refuse to come into the Chamber.  Some of us after 1993 took 
issue with this, and I have to admit that I am very much an 
original mover in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said to my constituents and I say to them now “You voted for 
me to come here to vote, not to hide”.   So when a vote comes 
that I do not like, I am going to rise here in my place against 
the government. 
I cannot help it.  It is important for me to show how I vote.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trouble with electronic voting is it takes away that 
privilege.  I would be able to sit in my place and press a button 
and no one would know.  The beauty of that is that the government 
would never have to experience the difficulty of feeling the 
pressure of the backbench behind it not in agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a bill last year in the previous parliament that dealt 
with pension reform and the rights of same sex couples.  I 
believe about 16 members of the Liberal side stood against the 
government on that.  Mr. Speaker, that is healthy democracy. That 
is important because it shows all Canadians everywhere in the 
country that we are independent and that we do vote our 
consciences.  I regret that I cannot say the same for the other 
side because too often they have not stood and voted against 
their own party lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rarely, Mr. Speaker, rarely do we ever see the NDP, the 
Conservatives or the Bloc Quebecois stand against their own 
party's position.  Never, Mr. Speaker.  Occasionally with private 
member's bills but never with their opposition to government 
bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I do not know why it is that we cannot as 
parliamentarians realize that this country is 134 years old, with 
a democratic system that has stood the test of time and is one of 
the oldest in the world.  It is one of the best in the world and 
I do not think it needs the kind of fundamental change that this 
motion is talking about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member made a minor factual error when he cited 
the number of countries of large geographical size in the world 
that have the first past the post system.  He mentioned two of 
the top three.  Russia and China are both larger than the United 
States. Therefore, strictly speaking, it is two of the top four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leaving that aside, he also made the observation that it is 
difficult to maintain the unity of a continent sized country, 
such as Canada or the United States, without a first past the 
post system.  I would dispute that and then invite his comments 
upon the observation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Australia, where I lived for several years, does not have a 
first past the post system.  It has a single transferable ballot 
at the level of the house of representatives, its equivalent to 
our House of Commons.  The Australian system has not created any 
form of disunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the level of its senate, Australia has a system in which each 
of its six states has 12 senators.  The senators are elected 
through a form of multiple voting in which each elector gets to 
choose 12 candidates from a list which can have, depending upon 
the state, as many as 100 or more candidates for office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some problems can be pointed out in the Australian system, which 
I will return to later in the debate, but it causes no national 
unity problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first past the post system has had splendid success in other 
countries.  However, we should consider our unity problems, the 
current ones, as well as the more spectacular conflicts of the 
late 1970s and the early 1980s when there were only two Liberal 
members west of the Ontario-Manitoba boundary and only two 
Conservative members between 1979 and 1980 in Quebec.  We see 
therefore that the first past the post system has served our 
national unity very poorly indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States is one of the most spectacular failures of 
national unity in the world.  Its first past the post system 
ensured that the democrats would dominate the south prior to the 
civil war and that a variety of parties, first the whigs and then 
the republicans, would dominate the north.  That was one of the 
primary reasons for the tremendous split in the U.S. congress, 
and particularly in its senate, which was one of the fundamental 
reasons for its civil war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking at the spectacular record of failure, would the 
member be willing to consider the possibility that there are 
alternatives that perhaps create a superior sense of national 
unity in large, ethnically diverse and geographically dispersed 
countries such as Canada, Australia or the United States? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know that 
Australia is really a fair comparison in any event because it is 
a much smaller country than Canada.  It is in isolation and it is 
not anywhere near as ethnically diverse as Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few countries in the world are founded on two great 
cultural and linguistic roots, as is Canada.  I point out in 
Canadian history that up until the creation of Canada, the French 
and British cultures had been at one another's throats since 
1066.  The traditional enemies in Europe are the English and the 
French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet through our democratic system, and we were one of the very 
first democracies, Mr. Speaker, who brought in the parliamentary 
system as you see it, we are one of the first just after the 
United States and after Britain.  We have managed to keep this 
country united, and I just do not understand where the member is 
coming from, because we have held together one of the largest 
land masses in the world and one of the two most distinct 
populations in the world, the French and the British.  That is an 
incredible success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad he raised the point, though, because I think one of 
the reasons why it is successful is because everyone in this 
country, including my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois, 
including my colleagues from Quebec or Nova Scotia or Acadia or 
New Brunswick, do have the option of representing their regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the very gift and genius of this country.  It would be 
absolutely dreadful if some leader came along and said to the 
Bloc Quebecois, or because he was a Bloc Quebecois leader, said 
“Well, you have to have a representative in Vancouver”.  That 
would be crazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, Mr. Speaker, we are on the right track with this.  I 
congratulate Australia on its limited success, but it is not 
better than what we are doing here in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, I have a couple of comments.  The hon. member said that 
never has a member of the NDP or the Conservative Party voted 
against the party stand.  If we look at history that is not the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980 I was the constitutional critic for the party.  When Mr. 
Trudeau tried to unilaterally repatriate the constitution, I 
resigned as critic.  There were four of us who voted against the 
stand of the caucus at the time.  There are many cases throughout 
history where that has happened, and in the Conservative Party as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to ask the member about majority governments.  He said 
one reason he wants the status quo is that he likes to have 
majority governments.  I could also make the assertion that many 
of Canada's minority governments have been very productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lester Pearson was never the leader of a majority government. He 
became prime minister in 1963 with a minority.  He won again in 
1965 with a minority and he stayed on as a minority prime 
minister until he retired in 1968.  That was probably one of the 
best periods in Canada's history in terms of good progressive 
government that reflected the country as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Trudeau government between 1972 and 1974 was also a minority 
government.  The most productive of the parliaments that Mr. 
Trudeau led was probably 1972 to 1974.  One reason was that there 
had to be some give and take and consensus with the opposition 
parties to reflect the country as a whole better than a majority 
government often does when it is bulked up in certain regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I wanted to ask the member about was the Senate. 
It is an institution that is, by definition, not democratic. What 
will we do about the Senate?  Only about 5% of Canadians who have 
been polled support the existing Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, all I can say is that I 
only go back to 1993, not to 1980.  I can assure the member 
opposite since 1993 I have not seen any.  I do not think I can 
remember a single instance of NDP members voting against their 
own party on a policy issue in the House of Commons.  I have not 
seen much action in that direction with the Conservatives, 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the question of minority versus majority governments in 
Canada, I think the key word with our system is not a question of 
whether the government is a minority or majority; it is 
decisiveness.  What our system provides for is a decisive 
government rather than indecisive government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have a system where we would have small parties of 
five or six that come up and hold the balance of power.  So when 
we have a minority government, it is still a decisive government 
in our system.  In the proportional representation system, you 
could have the potential for a lot of minority parties and 
consequently when you have minority governments, they would be 
indecisive governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Senate: I have had to change my mind about the 
Senate quite a bit because I have watched what has happened in 
Ontario.  In Ontario there is no Senate obviously at the 
provincial level.  The Ontario government last year sat only 40 
days of the year.  We will sit 135 days this year and we will 
discuss legislation back and forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens in Ontario is the Ontario government rockets 
legislation through that is poorly conceived and it is suddenly 
passed into law.  Where I see the advantage of the Senate is the 
Senate really is a potential check.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When this House, be it a private member's bill or a public bill, 
if it goes through the House too fast, and it is possible for us 
all to get onside and send it through too fast, is that the 
Senate is an important check, and the evidence of that is what is 
happening in Ontario now where laws are being passed that really 
need a second thought. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was very impressed with the hon. member opposite.  I 
have been impressed with him before because he is a very deep 
student of democracy and democratic behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was struck by three words he kept repeating about halfway 
through his speech, “in the end”.  I wondered when he was going 
to come to the end.  He did come to the end of his speech, but he 
also suggested that, in the end, he and every elected member here 
is responsible to their constituents.  I could not agree with him 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He actually said something sensible about the other place just a 
moment ago.  That is good.  If he would now only add that we will 
elect those people as well, he would really be in the good books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a question I want to ask the hon. member.  I believe he 
was elected on the promise that the Government of Canada and 
parliament would appoint an ethics counsellor who would report to 
the House and to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed when I looked at <I>Hansard</I> and at the voting 
record of the hon. member that he voted nay on that issue.  Whom 
was he representing:  himself, his constituents, or the Prime 
Minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do wish the member had 
taken the time to look at my speech as well as my voting record, 
because he would have seen that I made the argument that indeed 
we kept that red book promise because that clause in the red book 
only referred to public officials and lobbyists.  It did not 
refer to members of parliament, so there was no reason.  I regret 
to say that I did not feel that those members on this side of the 
House who felt that they had to vote against the government on 
that issue were correct.  I thought they were incorrect.  The 
promise was fulfilled. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take the opportunity to read the motion 
once more. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House strike a special all-party committee to examine 
the merits of various models of proportional representation and 
other electoral reforms, with a view to recommending reforms that 
would combat the increasing regionalization of Canadian politics, 
and the declining turnout of Canadians in federal elections. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I address this question I will talk about not only 
proportional representation but electoral reforms of other sorts 
as well, and some of the issues that go along with those 
considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by making the objection that the system in Canada 
really is broken at this point.  We saw that in 1997 a 38% vote 
of the Canadian people gave the Liberal Party a majority 
government.  In 1993 a 41% vote gave the Liberals 60% of the 
seats in this place, whereas the Tories got 16% of the vote and 
less than 1% of the seats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario 2.3 million votes in the 2000 election gave the 
Liberals 100 seats.  By contrast, one million votes gave my 
party, the Alliance, two seats, one of which I hold.  While I am 
honoured at the thought that I represent 500,000 Ontarians, I 
think it is an incorrect assumption to look at the results and 
think it is an acceptable system when 98% of the seats go to a 
party that had only about half the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is about democracy.  As we talk about democracy and 
democratic reform we must think as well about other related 
issues of importance which tie in with the question of electoral 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to run through some of these by way of suggesting that we 
have a problem that goes far beyond the mere problem of an 
inadequate electoral system.  We have a serious problem, as my 
hon. colleague from the New Democrats pointed out, with the 
Senate.  He proposes abolishing the Senate.  That is certainly an 
alternative. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own party has proposed a triple E model for the Senate.  We 
have suggested an elected Senate as opposed to an appointed 
Senate and a Senate that is equal in representation, at least 
more equitable in representation and a great deal fairer than 
what we have right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite as examples of countries with pure triple E senate 
models, Australia and the United States.  Switzerland has 
something close to a pure model.  Some of the smallest cantons 
are referred to as half cantons and get half representation, but 
otherwise there is full equality.  It provides for some kind of 
representation for those more peripheral areas of the country and 
prevents the kind of inner Canada, outer Canada phenomenon that 
we see here occurring there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very least one would think that there would be some form 
of regional equity which would ensure that British Columbia, for 
example, would have a substantially larger number of senators 
than New Brunswick.  This would make sense given that British 
Columbia has a much larger population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the spirit of our original plans for the Senate, going 
back to 1867, that there should be some form of regional equity. 
In 1867 there was equal representation for the maritime region, 
which consisted of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and for Ontario 
and Quebec.  Those were the three regions of Canada at that time. 
That was a good system and we favour some kind of return to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reforms should also take place for the rules that govern this 
place.  This House was intended to be a legislature in a country 
which was, while nominally a monarchy, a republic in the 
Aristotelian sense of the term;  that is, a country which had an 
equal balance of the democratic, oligarchic or aristocratic and 
monarchical elements in its constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In practise, what has happened is that the Prime Minister has 
become our real monarch and the House sits, not as a legislature, 
but as an electoral college in perpetual session and required 
periodically, frequently in fact, to give its assent once more to 
the king continuing to sit in his place reigning over us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This form of elected dictatorship is completely unsuitable and 
needs to be reformed.  There are many reforms that could take 
place, but I will simply mention one or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, secret ballots for the election of committee chairs just 
as secret ballots are used for the election of the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, more free votes, and a simple change to the rules of the 
House would accomplish this goal.  Many other proposals have been 
made by a number of scholars, commissions and committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reforms to the Election Act would also make a substantial 
difference.  I cite, as an example of us going in the wrong 
direction, clause 11 of the government's proposed act to amend 
the Canada Elections Act, which has the effect of depriving small 
parties of access to the voters list.  This is a very 
undemocratic move in the wrong direction and something that needs 
to be stopped in order to ensure that we continue to be 
democratic in our elections, elections that bring people here, 
even if we cannot function democratically in how we act within 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note as well that clause 17 of that proposed act would deprive 
independents and small parties of access to free broadcast time 
in order to spread their message and educate the public, which 
after all is the function that these parties see for themselves, 
small parties like the Green Party, the Canadian Action Party and 
so on, as well as many independents.  Many of these parties and 
independents who realize they will not be elected, see the 
election as an opportunity to spread what they believe to be 
important truths.  It is also the only time when they have the 
public eye and they deserve that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recall is another measure that could accomplish a great deal. If 
members of a constituency had the right to petition for their 
members to be forced into a byelection situation, a number of 
very undemocratic and unpopular measures could never have made it 
through the House.  The GST, the Meech Lake accord and many other 
measures would not have been approved.  Many members would have 
considered very carefully whether they could continue to support 
the kind of action that occurred the other day when the 
government voted against its own 1993 red book promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electronic voting could take place.  Citizen initiated 
referendum is another possibility that would do substantial 
things to change the way in which Canada operates as a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn now to the question of proportional representation and to 
the question of what type of proportional representation is most 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take it from the language of the motion that the New 
Democratic sponsor of it feels that democratic reforms to the 
electoral system, other than actual changes to the manner in 
which individual members are chosen, is something the New 
Democratic Party would support.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fixed election dates as something that would perhaps be 
beneficial and that they would perhaps support as we do on this 
side of the House.  That would prevent the sort of nonsense that 
goes on where the Prime Minister consults the polls and tries to 
arrange to hold an election when the governing party is in fact 
at the top of the polls.  This has been unconstitutional in the 
United States for two centuries and something that other 
countries, which have a system similar to our own such as 
Australia, have tried to restrict by having shorter periods 
between elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that there are several different proportional 
representation models and in the remaining time I will go through 
them very quickly.  Our party does not favour any particular 
model.  We think that the first past the post system is broken 
and is probably not acceptable to most Canadians.  We also think 
the decision on whether the system should be replaced is one that 
should be made by the Canadian people by means of a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have turned to our friends in New Zealand and would like to 
follow its model.  They held a referendum on whether in fact they 
should abandon their first past the post system.  The people 
advised them that they wanted change.  Then a commission 
travelled across the country, consulted widely, proposed several 
models, and the people selected the multi-member proportional 
system which is not the only system that could have been chosen. 
It is the one that appears to have made New Zealanders happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure that model would work here.  I am not sure it is 
my business to say it is the model that would work.  I cite as 
another possible example the pure list system.  I am not a 
particular fan of that system but it is used in Israel and has 
been used in Italy. In addition to New Zealand a somewhat 
different version of the mixed member proportional system has 
been used in Germany.  In Australia, which is my former home, I 
observed that there are several different systems at work at 
different levels of that country's government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The house of representatives, as I mentioned when questioning 
another member earlier, uses a single member system but a 
transferable ballot so that a more consensual process goes on in 
selecting a member in an individual district.  Its senate uses a 
12 member system.  Each state chooses its members at large and 
each voter can choose their 12 top choices from a list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tasmania uses yet another system for its house.  It has a system 
whereby there are districts with five or six members.  The 
Australian capital territory has selected yet another system 
which I think would not be appropriate for Canada but reflects 
the fact the particular jurisdiction has an evenly spread highly 
homogeneous population.  They had the danger of perpetually 
electing all members of one party over and over, and so they had 
to choose some other method to assure that there would be some 
form of genuine democracy, opposition and debate within their own 
legislature.  This has been very successfully accomplished there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore put before the House the suggestion that what ought 
to happen in this country is that there should be a vigorous 
debate as our friends in the New Democratic Party are suggesting 
and that in the end the people be the ones to make the decision 
on what is in fact the best approach. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I believe the member supports the motion introduced by 
the NDP.  He addressed the question of regional issues in this 
Confederation, but I am sure he knows that the headquarters of 
the Alliance Party is in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could he claim the Alliance Party is a national party when 
its headquarters are in Alberta?   Would this be supporting 
separatist concepts in the west, or is he talking about moving 
the national headquarters of the Alliance Party from Alberta to 
where it belongs in Ottawa? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.  I am not exactly sure how the hon. gentleman feels 
that having one's headquarters in Calgary constitutes support for 
western separatism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that were the case, surely when the federal government made 
the decision in the 1970s to cast its own votes as a partial 
shareholder in Sun Life, in favour of Sun Life keeping its 
headquarters in Montreal, that was in fact hidden support for 
separatists in Quebec.  I cannot give any other interpretation to 
that bizarre assertion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Having widespread representation for members of all parties in 
all parts of the country, unless the party is completely 
unacceptable to voters, is something that is profitable.  Almost 
any system other than the current one does a better job at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I look at the example of Ontario.  We know that in 1998 
Ontarians did not vote 97% in favour of the Liberal Party but in 
fact 100 of 103 members came from Ontario.  That block then 
dominated the House.  Under the leadership of the Prime Minister 
it had 100% control of all legislation that came out here.  There 
is spectacular insensitivity to the regional concerns of many 
regions, the west being one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see perpetual lack of concern about the interests of Quebec, 
which is the reason Quebec separatism over 30 years of almost 
perpetual Liberal administration has risen from being a 
fractional concern to being a movement that almost split apart 
the country under the watch of the Prime Minister.  We see 
Premier Hamm of Nova Scotia being essentially told to hit the 
road when he comes forward with very intelligent proposals for 
equalization changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just cannot see how anything the hon. member has said adds to 
the debate.  It is just typical of the kind of arrogance we see 
from some members of the Ontario caucus of the government. That 
is most disappointing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member who has just spoken, my colleague from 
Windsor—St. Clair and another member of the Reform Party 
represent almost half of the voters in the province of Ontario 
and 100 Liberals represent the other half, which shows the great 
distortion in our electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make a couple of other comments and ask for a response 
from the member from Ontario.  In terms of referenda, I think we 
should use them very sparingly in our political system.  My party 
and I would only use them for great issues of the day such as a 
constitutional issue and maybe one or two other exceptions.  I 
think we could have too many referenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the power of the Prime Minister's Office is much too 
strong, with the power to appoint by himself or herself all the 
judges, the head of the military or the RCMP and other major 
appointments.  Many of these should be vetted by a parliamentary 
committee that is relevant to the issue being discussed.  I also 
believe that we should have fixed election dates constitutionally 
to take away that power from the premiers and the Prime Minister 
both at the federal and the provincial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should have fewer confidence votes in the House of 
Commons and stronger parliamentary committees with more 
independence to set their own legislative timetable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the other reforms that should go along with 
the idea of looking at proportional representation and getting 
rid of the unelected Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with just about 
everything that the hon. member has said.  I personally think 
there should be a somewhat broader scope for referenda, 
particularly for citizen initiated referenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would probably agree with me that the system used in 
Switzerland and Australia, whereby the people have to approve any 
form of constitutional amendment, has been profitable in those 
countries and might likewise be profitable here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we disagree a little over the Senate, but I think hearts 
are in the right place in his party when they say that there 
really needs to be change to that dysfunctional institution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I now 
have in my possession a document that details in unprecedented 
terms the horrible conditions to which our soldiers are being 
subjected in Bosnia.  It is a letter to the Minister of National 
Defence, dated February 8, from the Dominion President of the 
Royal Canadian Legion, Mr. Barclay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Barclay writes of the conditions witnessed by a concerned 
legion funded group that travelled to Bosnia.  The shocking 
details of that report compelled Mr. Barclay to contact the 
minister directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report details in critical terms the “poor state of morale, 
tattered and unsightly clothing and equipment deficiencies that 
were experienced”.  On the issue of clothing alone, the observer 
reported “worn, threadbare, stained and patched combat clothing, 
and a lack of uniformity among Canadian soldiers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Geneva convention requires us to treat enemy forces better 
than we appear to be treating our own soldiers.  This is totally 
unacceptable.  How can the minister possibly account for these 
disgraceful standards?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE ECONOMY

<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on Friday the Deputy Prime Minister 
admitted after weeks of denial that we are into an economic 
downturn.  Yesterday the finance minister admitted after some 
denial that we need a financial update and that he will be 
bringing one in.  I am encouraged by that because overcoming 
denial is the first step on the road to recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the Minister of Finance asked for our suggestions, in 
his mini budget he said that he would lower some marginal rates 
but would not increase either personal exemptions or spousal 
exemptions.  Will he do that to take thousands of low income 
workers off from paying any federal income tax at all? 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member knows full well that we are raising the 
threshold.  It was this government that brought in indexation 
which makes sure that it happens automatically each and every 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply ask a question of the hon. member.  If the hon. 
member wants to cut taxes, which I understand is his point of 
view, will he also at the same time have to cut spending in order 
to pay for those tax cuts?  If he is to cut spending, does he 
think that cutting government spending will add stimulus to the 
economy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are asking the questions here. 
That is why we need to see that financial update.  Since he will 
not do anything— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  We will hear the question. 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition is asking a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, since he will not 
indicate that he will help low income workers, will the minister 
take a look at the corporate tax rates because our corporate 
taxes, our business taxes, are higher than the average of 
countries with which we trade at the OECD? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he accelerate his indicated reduction of those taxes, the 
28% to 21% reduction, to reflect his confidence in the economy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I might as well ask the questions as well as answer 
them.  Somebody had better ask decent questions in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member ought to know that as a result of our tax cuts 
our corporate taxes will be five percentage points lower than 
those in the United States.  Our capital gains taxes are now 
lower than those in the United States.  Our treatment of stock 
options is now lower and more generous than that in the United 
States.  As a result we have the largest fiscal stimulus ever 
brought in by a Canadian government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister well knows that the 
ratio of taxes vis-à-vis the GDP is 43% in Canada and 31% in the 
United States.  He should keep that in mind. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought the Minister of Finance was being sincere yesterday in 
asking for our suggestions.  Today, I do not know.  Can he at 
least assure workers that his economic statement will announce a 
cut in EI contributions from $2.25 to $2? 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
we became the government, we have reduced contributions to 
employment insurance by over $6 million.  Again in November, we 
made another 15 cent cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already indicated our intention to lower taxes and 
contributions and to encourage the Canadian economy.  That is 
why we are going to get by despite the downturn in the United 
States.  That is why Canada is going to have the best growth 
rate of all G7 countries this year.

Mr. Speaker, one little fact the finance minister forgets to 
mention is that with his CPP tax hikes there will actually be an 
increase in payroll taxes this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his political statement in the fall the finance minister 
projected growth at 3.5%.  Then the Governor of the Bank of 
Canada said 3% in January.  His parliamentary secretary 
speculated about growth as low as 2% last week.  I was on a show 
yesterday with the member for Markham who speculated about a 1.5% 
growth.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Among all these incredible shrinking growth projections where 
does the finance minister stand?  What does he believe growth 
will be in Canada this year?  How will he incorporate that into 
his fiscal plan? 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member knows we operate on the basis of the 
consensus of private sector economists and that consensus will be 
out somewhere near the end of March.  The hon. member also knows 
that in October we set in place a substantial contingency reserve 
and prudence to cover exactly the kind of slowdown we are now 
seeing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another question, if I might.  When the hon. member 
refers to the Canada pension plan premiums, is he referring to 
the Canada pension plan premiums which we and the provinces, me 
and the then treasurer of Alberta, the current Leader of the 
Opposition, increased?  Are those the ones that he is referring 
to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I know there is a lot of 
exuberance in the House today but we are losing time on the 45 
minutes for question period. 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I can understand the exuberance when this tax on the 
CPP represents one of the largest tax increases in Canadian 
history. It was opposed by this opposition.  The Alberta 
government sought a way to treat Albertans through a separate 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I can tell the finance minister is that we continue to have 
a tax burden which is 12% higher as a percentage of our GDP than 
that of the United States.  How can he stand in this place and 
tell Canadians who are leaving this country in the brain drain 
that our taxes are lower when every available statistic 
demonstrates that our tax burden is substantially higher than 
that of our major trading partner? 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, and our health care system is a lot better.  I want to 
go back to the Canada pension plan.  To the best of my knowledge, 
at all of the federal provincial meetings that I was at, 
including that with the then treasurer of Alberta, there was 
support for the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it now the position of the Alliance that it is against the 
Canada pension plan?  Is it the position of the Alliance that it 
would renege on the unfunded liability? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Alliance saying about the Canada pension plan, which 
is one of the pillars of our retirement system?  It is one that 
all Canadians believe in.  The hon. member ought to stand now and 
tell us if he supports it or if he does not.

that members of congress are bound by a confidentiality rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the Minister for International Trade is: Does he

Mr. Speaker, while it is no bombshell, it is no secret that the

years. By coincidence, of course, the better the hotel did the 
better the golf course did next door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of competing hotels in town: the Prime

anyone guess where his staff stayed, though, to the tune of 
$33,000?  It was at the Grand-Mère, of course.  Over at the 
Gouverneur less than $300 was spent, although it was far more 
convenient for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is, what could it be that draws the staff of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, problems like 
those currently being experienced in relation to negotiations on 
the free trade area of the Americas have already arisen, when 
the multilateral agreement on investment was being negotiated. 
Why?  Because of the same desire as today to keep everything 
secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government was asked what was going on, its answer to 
us was “Everything is fine.  Trust us.  There is no reason to be 
afraid”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the texts became known, we realized that we were headed for 
catastrophe and that a good portion of what is known as the 
Quebec model would have been passed over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand today that the minister is again asking us 
to place blind trust in him as far as the free trade area of the 
Americas is concerned?  Is this what we are to understand? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we have undertaken to negotiate is on 
the Internet.  We have made our position absolutely public in 
the tables available there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate entrusted to me by the Canadian government is known. 
The positions have been discussed with the provinces.  Each 
province has access to the Internet site in question and is 
providing us with its position on each of the points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We held a federal-provincial conference here on February 5, and 
there were discussions precisely on this matter.  I can assure 
the House that Canada is going to play an important role in 
Buenos Aires. 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the 
minister appears not to understand is that the Canadian 
positions cannot be evaluated if we do not know the positions 
that are on the table being negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister understand that more and more bodies in civil 
society, in all communities throughout Canada and Quebec, are 
mobilizing against this negotiation?  Does the minister not 
recognize that his lack of transparency and his close-mouthed 
attitude are responsible for this mounting public opposition? 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are going to respect our partners in the 
hemispheres of the Americas.  We are going to continue to ask 
them to be so kind as to make these texts public, because they 
should be and we want them to be.  Canada will not do so 
unilaterally, however, out of respect for the other countries 
with whom we are in negotiation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Minister of National Defence tried to 
pretend that Canada's coastal defence is not compromised despite 
the cut in Aurora flying hours to 8,000.  His air force chief 
disagrees.  We have a document signed by General Campbell warning 
that any cut of Aurora flying hours below 11,500 would seriously 
impair the ability of the air force to protect Canadian 
sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this warning from a soldier who ought to know, why has the 
minister pushed for these cuts? 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is in fact what General Campbell and the air 
force staff have recommended.  They are saying that because we 
can invest more in upgrading our equipment and putting better 
technology into the equipment so that we can get more efficiency 
out of it, we will get a better quality product and be able to do 
just as much patrolling as we were been able to do before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where they will save money and time is in the fact that they 
will do more on land simulation to train people in terms of 
flying. This will cut down on the number of hours that the 
aircraft are needed in the air. 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have the document right here.  They are either in the 
air or they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals took office in 1993 annual Aurora flying hours 
were 19,200.  Now the minister wants only 8,000 hours.  Yesterday 
the minister denied these numbers but we have the proof right 
here.  General Campbell thinks this 58% cut will have an 
unacceptable impact “on border protection”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we trust a career politician instead of the expertise 
of a career soldier? 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, again I repeat that this is not something that comes 
from me or from the government.  It is a recommendation from the 
air force.  It is a recommendation from General Campbell and 
others in the air force who feel that they can operate this in a 
more efficient fashion and that we should put more investment 
into upgrading equipment, and that is exactly what we are doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the hon. member that we are very happy with the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ):</B> Mr.

<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to determining minimum operational requirements,

<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I indicated previously, the recommendation does 
not come from me.  The recommendation is bottom up not top down. 
It comes from the air force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Have you not read it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton:</B>  They frequently get all their research 
wrong, and I am sure I will find out where they got it wrong on 
this one as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, they are wrong to say 19,000 because it is currently at 
11,000.  We are talking about an 8,000 difference.  However the 
difference will be in terms of a more efficient training system, 
not in terms of any fewer patrols to ensure the security of the 
country.  That will continue to be maintained.

to be brought to Parliament Hill by autoclub tow trucks because 
the military truck wheels are unserviceable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, operational readiness is at a low ebb and has little

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that the government is replacing or upgrading every 
piece of equipment in the Canadian forces.  In fact, I was just 
over in Eritrea, Ethiopia.  Our troops are raving about the new

my question is for the trade minister.  Yesterday Metalclad

a toxic waste dump in Mexico, which ignores the health and 
environmental concerns of elected local and state governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the federal government has intervened in this corporate

sympathies to the Sandhu family on this tragic accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should know that rescue diving is not a core 
mandate of the coast guard.  In fact it is a mandate of the 
Department of National Defence.  However, the coast guard has had 
a pilot project which it assessed over the last six years.  As a 
result of the comprehensive assessment it decided to discontinue 
that pilot project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was an operational decision by the experts.  Judging from 
the question the member asked earlier, I think he wants—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister's own advisory committee 
advised and recommended against this move.  The coast guard 
rescue team was implemented in 1994 because there was a pressing 
need, and there still is.  The rapid response of the Sea Island 
hovercraft and the diving team create a unique capability that 
cannot be matched by DND or the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has cancelled this against the recommendations of 
his own advisory group.  Why is the minister saying no when his 
experts are saying yes?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me repeat for the hon. member that 
rescue diving is not a core mandate of the coast guard. This is 
consistent with the U.S. and British coast guard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a pilot project for six years started by this 
government.  There was a comprehensive assessment of the pilot 
project.  As a result of that assessment the experts decided on 
an operational basis that this could not be continued, but I can 
assure the member that the Department of Defence will continue to 
provide the excellent service that it has in rescue diving.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  Yesterday 
a delegation from Canadian Auto Workers, led by Buzz Hargrove, 
met with the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Industry and 
members of the caucus to discuss the current situation of the 
Canadian auto industry in the light of the end of the Canada-U.S. 
auto pact.

be in the context of NAFTA following the expiry of the auto pact?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Brampton Centre for his 
question.  There is no doubt that Canada has been extremely 
successful in the auto business in North America.  In fact, we 
make two cars for every one we sell in this country, so we have 
done very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the CAW visit was to say that it is important to 
look to the future.  We agreed to re-establish the auto industry 
advisory panel.  We agreed to look at the possibility of R and D 
investment to keep Canada competitive and to ensure that 
innovation is very much present in the sector.  We agreed to 
continue to work with members of parliament, such as the hon. 
member, who represent their constituents in this area and who are 
very concerned about ensuring that our competitive edge is 
maintained in this country.

Speaker, the Cheviot coal mine in my riding is still waiting for 
an answer from the government with regard to environmental 
assessment.  It has been waiting for five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was approved in 1997.  Appeal after appeal has delayed it, so 
much so that the buyers now have torn up their contracts and have 
gone elsewhere looking for coal.  Twelve hundred jobs have been 
lost in my riding.  It sets a bad precedence and puts a chill in 
Canadian development.

to the Cheviot coal project.  It determined that there were 
likely to be none that could not be mitigated or compensated for. 
Obviously in the meantime the company involved has taken some 
other decisions with respect to its future business plan.

Speaker, this is an interesting day.  We blew it on Cheviot, but 
it is our lucky day because we have another chance.  Just up the 
road from Cheviot there is the Grande Cache coal mine that is 
going through exactly the same thing in trying to reopen an 
existing mine and trying to complete an environmental study at 
the same time so that miners can go back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a chance to streamline that process and give 
a good project the Canadian advantage.  Will the government show 
some leadership and get rid of the red tape so that Canada is 
open for business in the 21st century?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in a number of cases that involve complexities with 
respect to regulatory procedures we have made some very good 
progress in recent years.  I think, for example, of the 
development of diamonds in the Northwest Territories, the Cheviot 
case that was referred to earlier, and some of the activities 
offshore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of regulatory agencies that are engaged in 
these projects.  Some of them are federal.  Some of them are 
provincial.  We always do our very best to streamline the 
processes so there can be a very definite beginning, a clear set 
of rules, an end and a decision that investors can rely on.  We 
will continue our efforts to make that system better.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—ELECTORAL REFORM 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK181">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is a fairly substantial amount of activity going on around 
here, but I will try to focus on this particular debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing about this motion in one sense is where it 
comes from.  The motion comes from the New Democratic Party, 
which all of a sudden, in this place at least, seems to have 
discovered something on the road to Damascus:  that perhaps there 
is a better way of getting elected.  I can certainly understand 
why the NDP would want to look for a better way to get elected 
given the lack of success that it has endured over the past many 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with 
the hon. member for Parkdale—High Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand why the NDP would want to make changes and I 
can understand why members of the official opposition might want 
to support those changes.  This issue of representation and how 
people arrive at this place is something that generally occupies 
the minds and time of those who cannot succeed under the current 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof of that would seem to be in the fact that when the New 
Democrats have enjoyed power for some number of years in British 
Columbia there is no talk of proportional representation or 
changing the system.  I suspect that after the next provincial 
election the NDP will be reduced to a rump of their current 
status and of course the first thing on their agenda will be to 
change the way the NDP gets elected in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other example would be the province of Ontario, where Bob 
Rae enjoyed five years in office.  The rest of us did not, but he 
did.  During that five year period when I had the challenge, 
shall we say, of serving in opposition with the Liberal Party of 
Ontario, I do not recall the government of the day, the New 
Democratic government of the province of Ontario, leaping 
forward, standing up and shouting that it would have to find a 
new way to get elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly this only occurs when someone is either bitter or 
confused or is looking for something that might work because the 
current system simply will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue that I find curious coming from opposition 
parties is this constant feeding frenzy about reform in the 
House.  The denigration of members of parliament, particularly on 
the government side, I personally find offensive.  I know the 
great work that many of my colleagues have done and continue to 
do.  I have talked about it in this place so I will not go there 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that is another example of the bitterness that a 
political machine or a party has when it arrives in this place 
and realizes that over 90% of the Canadian public did not vote 
for it, that it is not the government and that it does not get to 
make the decisions about how the country runs, whether it is the 
budget or whatever it happens to be.  These parties can only try 
to put some pieces of metal into the spokes of the wheel of the 
governing party to see if they cannot trip it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly that is what is happening here.  This is the second time 
we have had an opposition motion.  We have not had a motion here 
that deals with the substantive issues Canadians are concerned 
about, such as the changes in our health care policies that are 
occurring at the provincial level, such as upholding the Canada 
Health Act and the role of the national government.  I have not 
seen a position come from the opposition saying that the 
government should do that, even though that indeed is what we do. 
I have not seen concern expressed by the opposition with great 
indignation about the two tier health care systems that are on 
the verge of occurring in the province of Alberta and, who knows, 
possibly even in the province of Ontario.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see an opposition motion coming forward dealing with 
the recent decision that perhaps should be debated in this place, 
the decision of George W. Bush to bomb Iraq.  I do not see 
anything coming forward.  That is an issue that I think Canadians 
care about.  Canadians care about what is happening in that part 
of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see an opposition motion coming forward to deal with 
the government's recent announcement to put $120 million into 
clean air in the province and the country to meet the standards 
we committed to at Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we hear from opposition members?  We hear them saying 
let us find a different way to get elected, because it did not 
work in 2001, it did not work in 1997 and it did not work in 
1993.  All they want to do is talk about how they can change the 
electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are perhaps some areas where reform could and should be 
looked at.  The Lortie commission was started by this government 
and reported here.  There were bills adopted and there were changes 
made.  It makes sense.  We should not just say everything we do 
is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely to goodness there are other areas of concern that 
parliamentarians should be putting their minds to.  I am sure 
that the Canadian Alliance would get somewhat nervous if we were 
to have parliamentary reforms that dealt with the referendum 
policy we all heard about with such fondness during the last 
election, about how if 3% of the people would submit a petition 
there could be a referendum on any particular item.  Then the 
leader of course distanced himself from that particular issue and 
said it was not necessarily 3%, that it could be greater, that 
the party members were not sure.  In fact at one point, I think, 
they were going to conduct a referendum on what the percentage 
should be so that they could then determine when and where they 
should hold a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we should have a look at reforming policies like that, at 
reform in the electoral system and making it more transparent. 
How about releasing the names of people who contribute to 
leadership campaigns?  Would that not be interesting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do that.  We have no difficulty with it.  Members opposite do 
not seem to want to do that, yet we see as recently as yesterday 
and today the Leader of the Opposition trying to respond, in a 
rather feeble way, to questions put by the media about a $70,000 
contribution to the Canadian Alliance Party made by a member of a 
law firm that was paid some $300,000 or $400,000 to defend the 
Leader of the Opposition in his defamation suit.  Interestingly 
enough, the payment of that $300,000 or $400,000 came from 
Alberta taxpayers.  Maybe there should be some way for us to 
investigate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it appropriate in electoral reform that when a leader of the 
opposition or a leader of any party in the House is elected at a 
party convention that the party then has the moral and legal 
authority to write a cheque for $50,000 to a sitting member so 
that person will vacate a safe seat, in the case of the Canadian 
Alliance, obviously, to allow the leader to run in that seat?  Is 
it proper?  Is that appropriate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Why don't you talk about the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B> Is that not something the member 
chirping over there thinks is the kind of electoral reform we 
should undertake?  I would have no difficulty with that.  I do 
not think it is not right to pay off a sitting member to vacate 
his seat so that the leader can simply come walking in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Canadian Alliance, like its predecessor, the 
Reform Party, simply wants to adopt the American system.  I have 
heard some rumours the Alliance is going to take a committee of 
its own down to Florida to learn how to count in the electoral 
process.  We have— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Lanark—Carleton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is 
my understanding that the rules of the House require that all 
speakers actually address the question at hand, and I can see 
absolutely no connection between what the member is saying and 
the matter at hand.  It is a partisan rant.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The motion before the House deals with 
electoral reform.  The hon. member for Mississauga West, the last 
I heard, was addressing the question of adopting an American 
system, which I assume he was going to say dealt with elections. 
Perhaps it was a bold assumption on my part.  The hon. member for 
Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the Alliance 
members do not like it when people bring up the problems they 
have within their own organization, I understand that.  However, 
it is about electoral reform, there is no question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion here is that the NDP members wants to change the 
system so they can get elected a little easier and in greater 
numbers than they have been able to up to now.  If we are going 
to do electoral reform, should we look at what does it mean to 
get elected as a leader in a party structure?  I think that is 
relevant to this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot get to this place until we are nominated and elected 
by the party, either to be the candidate in a given riding or to 
be the leader of the party.  Do we want to just talk about what 
they want to talk about or do we want to talk about the entire 
issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying we have to compare apples to apples.  If 
we are going to reform the system then we have to look at some of 
the mistakes and the unusual circumstances that have been going 
on across the way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to also 
join in on the NDP motion that the House strike a special all 
party committee to examine the merits of various models of 
proportional representation and other electoral reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to participate in the debate because in the last 
session I had the opportunity to discuss the whole issue of 
proportional representation and proportional electoral systems in 
Alberta.  I was there as the federal representative to the 
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is the only 
parliamentary association in Canada which actually has separate 
provinces as its members.  Once a year, I, my colleagues from the 
other provincial legislatures and members of the federal branch 
meet to discuss topical issues.  We did so in Alberta.  It 
provided for lively debate but we could not reach consensus.  It 
was a very emotional debate.  People felt strongly one way or the 
other way.  However, we could not arrive at consensus, not only 
at the federal level but also looking at it provincially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this matter was actually the subject of an international 
conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association two 
years ago in New Zealand, when the member for 
Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant was the chair of the CPA.  Again we led 
an all party delegation and again no consensus was achieved at 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the motion in the context of whether or 
not the proportional system works best as far as women are 
concerned.  Does it increase women's participation in the 
political process?  Does it actually increase the number of 
elected women? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago another parliamentary association, the 
Inter-Parliamentary Union, released a global analysis of what has 
worked for women in politics and what has not between the years 
1975 and 1998.  It also surveyed all of its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the questions addressed was “Which electoral system 
works best for women”.  Was it the majority system, was it a 
proportional system, was it a mixed system?  Interestingly 
enough, the IPU's world inquiries led one to be rather prudent in 
its conclusions.  While it found that the proportional system may 
be the most conducive to the election of women, it was only 
conducive provided there were a number of safeguards that were 
applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safeguards included, for example, including at least one 
woman or giving a percentage of women in each electoral list and 
including at least one woman in an elected position in every 
closed list.  It found that it worked well if it alternated 
between men and women in every list.  Also, it needed to 
establish that a certain percentage of lists would be headed by 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues to be dealt with in putting women on a list or people 
on a list are quite complex.  In addition, quite surprisingly the 
study found that a proportional system, even with the safeguards 
that I just talked about, was only a temporary measure for a long 
existing imbalance. 
We still have a long way to go to ensure that the House of 
Commons is represented 50:50, that being 50% women, 50% men, 
which reflects our population.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While at first glance one might argue that the proportional 
system assists in increasing the number of elected women, I would 
respectfully submit that the proportional system does not in 
itself ensure the increased participation of women in politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are the important things that have to be decided.  Who 
decides whose name appears on the list?  Who decides how many men 
will appear on the list?  Who decides how many women will appear 
on the list?  Who decides what percentage of women will appear on 
each electoral list?  More important, who decides what percentage 
of the list will actually be headed by women? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not our riding associations or constituents at grassroots 
who decide who is going to be on those list.  It is the political 
parties and the people in power who decide.  The grassroots, the 
constituents and the riding associations have no input whatsoever 
into those lists.  However, they are the people to whom we are 
all accountable, not the powers that be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to share with my 
colleagues what has recently transpired in France.  The last two 
or three weeks the front page story of the <I>New York Times</I> 
has been about France's new parity law.  Last year France passed 
a law which requires all political parties to field an equal 
number of male and female candidates in almost all elections, 
starting with the municipal elections which are coming up in 
March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first country in the world that has actually 
required this and I would submit that the jury is still out on 
it.  We do not know what will happen and how this will increase 
women's participation in the political system or being elected, 
but it is a novel way.  Again, it is not just a proportional 
system.  Where there is a list it requires 50:50 parity.  It is 
an interesting experiment and is something we should all watch 
very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the Inter-Parliamentary Union study of what 
has worked to increase the number of elected women, which has 
nothing to do with the proportional system.  The study found that 
women's chances of getting nominated are higher when their party 
has realized that women can be and are an electoral asset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It found the success higher if the party had incorporated the 
gender dimension in taking on a number of steps, be it 
establishing a committee on gender equality, or gender focal 
point with a mandate to scrutinize the party's policy in that 
connection, or re-orienting the party's women's wing so that it 
promotes women's vision and it secures support for women within 
the party, not just offering women support to the party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also found it was important that the parties reviewed rules 
and practices for internal elections to ensure equality of access 
by women and men to the leadership positions in the party and to 
local and national elected mandates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, today I was speaking to my colleague, the member 
for Scarborough—Rouge River.  He said that he just had his 
annual meeting of his riding association and the majority of 
people on his executive are women.  I do not believe it had a 
list at that time or that it was done on a proportional basis. 
Again, it goes to how the party promotes from within and how the 
party values its women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study also interestingly found that quotas established by 
law did not work.  It found that quotas do not permit the 
development of a real political space for women.  That is 
something that we as parties have to deal with ourselves. 
Moreover, requiring political parties to have a given percentage 
of women candidates failed because there was no sanctions for 
failing to meet that type of quota. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the study found to be most effective was self-imposed 
quotas.  The self-imposed quotas result from recognition that 
women are not only an electoral asset, but that women's full 
participation in all aspects of the political process is not only 
essential for the good of society but is also an essential 
ingredient of democracy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witness the leadership of the Prime Minister and his commitment 
to ensure the full participation of women in Canada.  It was our 
present Prime Minister who appointed a woman, Canada's first 
chief justice of the supreme court, the Right Hon. Beverley 
McLachlin, an appointment that was applauded, not just by women 
or by members of this party, but by the legal community across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was our present Prime Minister who also appointed the first 
woman commissioner of official languages, Madame Dyane Adam.  It 
was the Prime Minister who appointed the Right Hon. Adrienne 
Clarkson as the Governor General of Canada.  Also, since taking 
office our Prime Minister has indeed made sure that half of all 
Canadians appointed to the Senate are women and one-third of the 
Canadians appointed to our judiciary are women as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, this is a leader who leads by example.  He shows us 
the important role that women play in our society, within our 
party, within our major institutions and within our government. 
This is a man who understands, and I am proud to be part of that 
team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last but not least let us not forget, as I said a few weeks ago 
in the House, that our Prime Minister made history once again on 
January 15, 2001 when he appointed the first woman to occupy the 
position of chief government whip, the hon. member for Ottawa 
West—Nepean. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was a truly, 
legitimate, well thought out and excellent speech as compared to 
some of the other speeches we heard today.  She spoke clearly and 
honestly.  I appreciate that very much and so will Canadians who 
will be reading this and perhaps viewing this today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said the magic word quotas at a certain point in her speech. 
I am just curious as to why.  Having an all-party parliamentary 
committee looking at some aspects of electoral reform, is it 
possibly a bridge to the kind of reforms that she is looking at 
about opening up a system to have more access for women as she 
described?  There is no reason why that could not be included in 
this exact motion, or that this motion could not be an avenue to 
precisely that kind of reform that she is concerned about.  That 
could be contained entirely within this motion as well.  The fact 
that she speaks against the motion is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also notice that, just like some of the previous speakers, she 
took the issue of proportional representation and grossly 
oversimplified it.  She analysed the issue of proportional 
representation in the macro level quite well, then tried to apply 
it vis-a-vis concerns about having more women candidates and a 
more proportional voice in the House for women.  That is fair 
enough.  However, the oversimplification of proportional 
representation being just this sort of big balloon that she pops 
from the one angle of having more women in this place does not do 
this debate justice.  It does not do the issue of proportional 
representation justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all sorts of models of proportional representation out 
there.  I personally do not happen to be a fan of proportional 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of questions for the member.  She spoke of the 
need of political parties, maybe her own, to have a quota system 
for candidates, that 50% of candidates should perhaps be women. 
Some political parties have that.  For example, the NDP in 
British Columbia has that in its platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure if she thinks that candidacies for political 
parties should be prorated on some other physical 
characteristics, for example, income.  Should we have candidates 
of different brackets of income?  Some political parties and 
political scientists have seriously advocated that.  Should we 
have candidates for political parties who represent a wide 
variety of people with disabilities?  Should we have political 
candidates who represent or are prorated on a wide variety of 
ages?  Different people have advocated that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If she is willing to bend on this one principle that we ditch 
equality and prorated candidates based on physical 
characteristics when it comes to gender, is she willing or 
interested in doing the same thing with some other 
characteristics that people have and people are concerned about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to this Chamber having replaced a Liberal member of 
parliament.  Prior to that member of parliament, there was a 
female candidate who represented my constituency of Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam.  Her name is Sharon Hayes. 
She represented my constituency very well.  She is a woman of 
honour and class.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked her what was her greatest frustration as a member of 
parliament.  She said it was her inability to stand up and say 
what was of concern to her constituents, to have tangible 
legislative powers at the committee level, to have tangible 
powers in the House of Commons and to have real reform 
possibilities in this place.  She said those powers are not there 
because the government, and it is a long entrenched history, does 
not allow people to stand up for what they believe and that 
affects everybody, men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member please address the issue of quotas and other 
aspects?  Could she please address the issue of allowing this 
place to allow more members to have more power and how that 
affects women? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know if I have 
enough time to answer all the questions but I will certainly try. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I looked at the whole issue of proportional 
representation in the context of getting more women elected to 
the House of Commons or to government.  There seems to be this 
belief that by having a proportional system we are automatically 
going to get more women into the House of Commons.  That is too 
simplistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My whole point in raising this issue is that it is incumbent 
upon all parties to encourage women to participate in the 
political system.  Twenty-one per cent of the House is composed 
of women members of all parties, yet women represent 50% of the 
population.  It is important that we encourage more women to 
participate in politics so they have a say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the great and wonderful things about being a Liberal 
member of the government, and in being a woman, is that this is a 
party that encourages women to participate.  It encourages us to 
stand up, to be heard and to speak on behalf of our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this is the hon. member's first term, but I hope he 
will be able to watch me.  As I did in the last term, I stood up 
many times and spoke on behalf of my constituents.  I watched the 
concerns that I brought to the House finally take place in the 
form of legislation and policy by the government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is my first speech House in the House since 
the November 27 general election. I have risen to speak at other 
times but not on a motion. I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank the voters of 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans for showing 
their confidence in me for the third time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate them for their wise judgment 
in being able to separate in their minds the work of an MP and an 
issue that was really not pertinent to this election, namely the 
whole matter of municipal mergers.  As we know, certain of my 
colleagues were defeated, unfortunately, because of the Liberal 
party's special knack of deflecting attention from real issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having made this point, I am pleased to speak to this motion by 
the New Democratic Party calling for the striking of an all party 
committee to examine the merits of various models of proportional 
representation and other electoral reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by stating that no one can oppose what is 
right. I believe that there is some merit to having committees 
address certain methods of representation.  We would respectfully 
submit, however, that what lies behind all this, whether general 
elections or voting, is the entire issue of democracy.  It is a 
matter, above all, of the exercise of democratic rights.  It is a 
matter of democratic institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before thinking about creating an all party committee, it would 
be a good idea, in my opinion, for the government to focus some 
effort of reflection on certain aspects of the electoral process. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, for the purposes of the debate, I would 
like to raise three questions.  Let us ask ourselves, and I think 
that this concerns those watching these proceedings at the 
moment, if democracy can be improved.  Is the electoral process, 
whether we mean a uninominal single ballot system or a 
proportional system, a component of democracy?  Third, is 
proportional representation a means of improving the democratic 
process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I do not have enough time allotted me, I will not be able to 
answer each question in detail. However, I want to make it clear 
in my remarks that we must consider this question a lot more and 
in much broader terms than by just looking at the way the 
representatives of the people of Canada are chosen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, and it would have been useful for the NDP to 
mention this, we should look at the whole question of corporate 
funding of political party coffers.  Today, we note, and I think 
the report of the chief electoral officer is clear, contributions 
by individuals and we see those of the major corporations, which 
contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars to party coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the six major banks, which had profits of some $9 
billion last year, if we looked at their contributions to the 
traditional parties, such as the Liberal Party or the Progressive 
Conservative Party, or at those of the oil industry lobby, which 
contributes happily to the election fund of our colleagues in the 
Canadian Alliance, we would see that there is a sort of 
two-tiered funding in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, there are the big contributors representing 
corporations, to the detriment of mere voters.  When I say “mere 
voters”, members will of course understand that I do not wish to 
minimize the importance of a middle class worker who supports a 
particular party and who calls his MP or candidate to tell him: 
“I have studied your party's platform.  You have been my MP for <I>x</I> 
number of years.  I have looked at what you are doing, the 
stands you take, and I think that you are representing me well. 
It is with pleasure that I am sending you a cheque for $20 or 
$25”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that members understand very well that my remarks are 
not intended to pass the same judgment on all contributors to 
campaign funds.  I think that there is a difference between a 
major bank or a large oil company or multinational that is going 
to invest several hundreds of thousands of dollars in a party 
seeking office. Naturally they will expect the favour to be 
returned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I say that we have a two tier funding system in 
Canada.  When one has funded an election campaign such as the one 
last fall, when we had people giving us $2, $5, $10, $20 and 
sometimes, if we were luckier, $50 or $100, to whom is one 
accountable when the election is over?  We are accountable to the 
ordinary members of the public who funded the election campaign, 
and not big companies and powerful lobbies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point that this motion should address is the whole issue 
of how election officials are appointed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timing is good, because we just finished an electoral 
process. The 301 members who are here were elected by the people. 
I do not think that any of those who voted in Canada did so with 
a loaded gun to their head. Members of parliament were 
democratically elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could ask ourselves, however, why voter turnout was so low in 
the last election. Why? This reflects a lack of democracy system 
that is becoming increasingly more serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that even though you are now the Speaker of the House, 
you are back in your riding of Kingston and the Islands on the 
weekends. You can see that, unfortunately, a percentage of the 
population has totally lost confidence in the political system 
and in politicians. This is a realistic conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, the 301 elected members of the House of Commons, should 
wonder why some people have lost their trust in democracy. Why 
are some people telling us “We do not want to be bothered 
anymore. You are all the same. It is all the same. You are trying 
to fill up your pockets. We see you during election campaigns, 
but once you are elected, you ignore us”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Félix Leclerc lived on Île d'Orléans, which is in my riding. In 
one of his songs, he said “On the eve of an election, he'd call 
you son. 
The day after, of course, he had no clue what your name was”. 
This song dates from the 1950s and I think it is as current today 
as ever.  Why did people not put themselves out to vote on 
November 27?  Because of cynicism, if not outright disgust, with 
politicians.  In a democracy, that is cause for alarm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The candidates for all parties who were defeated and the ones 
who won seats, as the 301 of us here in the House of Commons did, 
have experienced the process.  We had to deal with a 
government-appointed electoral machine as far as the returning 
officers went, reporting to the Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. 
Kingsley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the Bloc Quebecois is going to be to ensure 
that the government reaches a decision on specific improvements 
to the Elections Act and to the electoral process, including the 
whole matter of how election workers are appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 36th parliament, we had the opportunity to introduce 
some amendments in committee, because we believed that the 
government was not contributing to democratizing the electoral 
process.  Far from it.  It was our opinion, our firm opinion, in 
the Bloc Quebecois, that the government is leaving an 
unacceptable degree of power with the governor in council when it 
comes to the selection of election workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does governor in council mean for those watching, who are 
not familiar with this jargon?  It means that the Prime Minister, 
with his cabinet and caucus, makes the appointments, and only 
rarely are these appointments not partisan.  We need only look at 
the returning officers in each of our ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals are in government, these are the people who 
have been very good Liberal organizers, who have done things in 
the Liberal association.  When the Conservatives were in 
government, returning officers were Conservatives.  This is known 
as the theory of Tweedledum and Tweedledee.  Under the Liberals, 
they wear red, under the Conservatives, they wear blue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, some of the members, such as the one for 
Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, who changed from blue, to independent, to 
red, will perhaps be wearing green on the eve of St. Patrick's 
Day on March 17. Who knows? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois propose that the appointment of the 
Chief Electoral Officer be made by a resolution of the House of 
Commons approved by the opposition parties and not just the party 
in office.  At the moment, the Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. 
Kingsley, was appointed by the party in power, after it had 
informed the opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is worth while looking at what is done elsewhere. 
The large number of very competent researchers put at our 
disposal could check to see how these appointments are handled in 
the Quebec National Assembly, and also in other parliaments and 
provincial legislative assemblies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about a legislative assembly I am more familiar 
with. In the National Assembly, important appointments require a 
two thirds majority and sometimes even a unanimous vote, whether 
it is for the position of ombudsman, chief electoral officer or 
other senior public positions whose duties require a very high 
level of credibility and impartiality. We are far from such an 
appointment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking is simple. We want the federal Elections Act 
to be transparent and we want to ensure there is no appearance of 
conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the appointments of returning officers, 
that is those responsible for the voting process in the ridings, 
are partisan appointments. This is why the Bloc Quebecois is 
asking that officials and returning officers in the ridings be 
appointed following a public, official, open and transparent 
competition, as is the case in other jurisdictions. Again, I 
would ask our researchers to look at what is being done in the 
National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, in his reply to the NDP motion, the government 
House leader referred to the Lortie commission, formally known as 
the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing. 
That commission addressed the need for the independence of 
election officers. On page 483 of its report, the Lortie 
commission reached the following conclusion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cornerstone of public confidence in any democratic system of 
representative government is an electoral process that is 
administered efficiently and an electoral law that is enforced 
impartially.  Securing public trust requires that the election 
officials responsible for administration and enforcement be 
independent of the government of the day and not subject to 
partisan influence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Canada's chief electoral officer, Jean-Pierre Kingsley, in 
his appearance before the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go out on the international scene I do not recommend that 
the Canadian system be emulated where it comes to the appointment 
of returning officers. I clearly indicate, as I do in Canada, 
that the appointment of returning officers under the present 
system is an anachronism. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is a concern. When Canada's chief electoral officer, 
Jean-Pierre Kingsley, is in other countries, he recommends that 
they not use the Canadian model to appoint returning officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we know that Canada likes to give lessons on democracy in 
many countries and to monitor elections in Zimbabwe, in Haiti, 
and all over the world.  It likes to pass itself off as the 
guardian of democracy and a model to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that some serious questions are in order when we see 
that Elections Canada is disavowing this system, that the chief 
electoral officer describes it as an anachronism.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, still on the issue of transparency, there is the major 
point of identifying voters.  During consideration in the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, the Bloc 
Quebecois asked that a voter identification process be included 
in the legislation.  The primary objective is to prevent a voter 
from usurping someone else's voting right.  Once again, the 
government turned down this request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might wonder what the government has to hide. Why is it 
against transparency? Why is it against a system that would 
improve democracy, with one person one vote? What is the 
government trying to hide? There is cause for concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois was asking for a new appointment process for 
at least the chief electoral officer, who is more or less 
responsible for the enforcement of the elections act, in order to 
reduce the government's control over this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that the chief electoral officer is appointed 
by at least the majority of the opposition members. If we, in the 
opposition, were to take part in the appointment process, then we 
would not be able to criticize the government, because we would 
have given our support. Members on both sides of the House would 
have to agree on the qualifications required of the incumbent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I would like to say that, whatever happens, if we 
can make democracy more transparent by dealing with the flaws in 
the current system, we might then be able to consider other 
options of representation, including proportional representation. 
The government still has a lot of work to do before we can 
get to that point. I have discussed this issue with some Liberal 
members and I know they also expect some improvements to the 
electoral system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to draw attention to the work of my colleague.  When 
he says that there is always room for improvement, he is right. 
In fact, many members of this parliament want to see the 
electoral process improved by being made more transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two expressions heard very often from members of the 
Bloc Quebecois: more transparency, more democracy.  We need to 
check that we do not have a beam in our eye, before trying to 
remove the mote from our neighbour's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague referred to electoral democracy.  It is always a 
good thing to stick to the things one knows best.  In the last 
election, in my own riding, as was reported in the media, the 
Bloc Quebecois had trouble accepting a profoundly democratic 
process. One of their top members for the past 10, 15, maybe 20 
years sold 600 membership cards in order to gain eligibility for 
the fine position of official candidate to run against André 
Harvey in the last election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as members are aware, this was against the most 
elementary rules of democracy.  a candidate was refused access to 
a convention that seemed above-board in everyone's eyes. Those 
who claimed in the House of Commons to be profoundly democratic, 
highly respectful of the basic rules of citizen participation in 
the elector process, got pushed around, shunted aside, by their 
leader.  The leader of the Bloc Quebecois arrived with his 
parliamentary leader, the ineffable member for Roberval, to 
announce “You no longer have a spot, so move over”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members have seen, two days before the election, the 
Bloc Quebecois leader was in my riding, both times proclaiming me 
the winner.  So sure was he of my victory, perhaps, that he 
decided to ignore the elementary rules of democracy and did not 
even nominate a candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before thinking about reforming the entire world, what does my 
honourable colleague think of each of the parties in our own 
ridings?  a young fellow sold 600 memberships, yet he could not 
even take part in a convention, because the Bloc Quebecois had 
decided that a certain person was to be the candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Chicoutimi—Le 
Fjord has really mastered the art of dodging. That would make him 
a very good boxer, except that he does not know how to throw a 
good punch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with him that Sylvain Gaudreault was an excellent 
candidate. There is no question about that. The best proof that 
the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord has a natural tendency to 
exaggerate is when he says that that person has been a very 
active supporter of the Bloc for 15 or 20 years, when we all know 
that the Bloc will be celebrating its 10th anniversary on May 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, that man was 
so loyal to the Bloc that he was an active supporter of that 
party even before it was formed. That is loyalty for you. To 
support a party 10 years before it is formed, it takes some 
extraordinary powers and a good crystal ball. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a few 
things that happened on his new side of the House. We could ask 
the people of Markham how they felt about having the former chief 
economist of the Bank of Montreal being forced upon them as a 
candidate. Were they happy about that? We see these kinds of 
things everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some unfortunate events. There may be different ways 
of doing things, but that is not the issue. The member for 
Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, from 1997 until the 2000 election, did not 
base his campaign on the merit of his own candidacy, but rather 
on internal divisions, on other parties' problems. Good for him 
if he can do that. I wish him a lot of success in his career. He 
will probably be appointed Minister of Transport because he is 
certainly a good candidate to become a member of the cabinet.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> He will build roads and he will build

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil (Beauharnois—Salaberry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to this debate on the motion by the NDP on 
proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always like to speak following a member of the Bloc in the 
House of Commons.  It is rather amusing to see how these people 
demean democracy.  They are very good in speeches, but in 
practice, they do not necessarily serve as a model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say “Why have voting percentages dropped in the country as 
a whole?” This sort of speech, where they say any old thing, 
contributes to people's impressions that politicians do not in 
fact have much to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on the plus side of our democracy—I will use the Bloc 
Quebecois member's example—who elected our candidate in the 
riding of Chicoutimi—Le Fjord?  The people did.  They decided 
André Harvey was the candidate they wanted to represent the 
people in that riding.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>André Harvey appeared to be the most competent person.  So, 
democracy as such always finds expression in our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us return to the NDP motion.  The question that perhaps 
should be put at the outset is, why are we questioning our 
electoral system in Canada?  There is always some reason for 
doing so. I have never seen a party in government advocate 
proportional representation.  It is always the opposition parties 
that do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could refer to Quebec.  Between 1970 and 1976, there was a 
party called the Parti Quebecois advocating proportional 
representation.  When it was in office, between 1976 and 1985, 
nothing more was said. 
In 1985, it was back in the opposition and began talking about 
it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, this is an issue that was discussed by the Bloc 
Quebecois. At one of their conventions, they even considered 
including it in their platform. But I think they were told by 
their head office in Quebec City to take it off the agenda as 
quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proportional representation has a beginning and an end. But in 
fact there should be no limits regarding proportions, because we 
are talking about numbers of parties and numbers of votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, my colleague also mentioned the lists of candidates and 
the proportion of women on these lists. That could also apply to 
ethnic groups. It could apply to the number of women from each 
ethnic group. It could apply to languages. 
It could apply to a number of elements. Therefore, this concept 
should not be restricted to proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental question is: Why are we proposing to establish a 
multi-party committee to take another look at the possibility of 
establishing a new electoral process whereby anyone in this 
place may speak on the behalf of whom? The majority, the 
minority, the minorities of the minorities? This is what we must 
ask ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is basically what it is all about. This is a problem in 
just about every house of every legislature. Studies are 
conducted, usually after each electoral process. 
Commissions are set up, and committees do studies, organize 
public hearings, and consult the parties in the House and the 
public.  After every election, the same conclusion is always 
reached here in Canada, and that is that the Canadian electoral 
system, our electoral system, is perhaps not perfect, but that 
so far—as Churchill said—none better has been found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system of proportional representation has also been tried in 
other countries, and people went back and changed their system. 
Why always go back and keep asking the same question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does our electoral system allow all citizens to express their 
views in an election?  I can compare two electoral laws. 
I can compare the electoral laws of Quebec and of Canada.  I was 
pleasantly surprised to see how Canada's law encouraged 
Canadians to vote.  If an individual citizen does not wish to 
vote in Canada, and does not vote, it is because they have 
decided not to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People can register at any time.  They can register when they 
arrive at the polling station.  They have only to show 
identification and say “I am a Canadian citizen; I live at such 
and such an address; here is my identification” and they are 
registered and allowed to vote.  This is not the case with 
Quebec's electoral law.  It is more limiting in this regard. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, as far as the Elections Act is concerned, I find that our 
legislation is a model compared to other democracies around the 
world.  Let us draw a parallel with the election of the U.S. 
president, where there is no popular vote per se.  The president 
is never elected directly by popular vote, but rather by an 
electoral college.  In this country, however, the people decide 
who is going to represent them in the Quebec National Assembly, 
or in the House of Commons in Ottawa.  Thus, anyone can vote, 
provided he or she is a Canadian citizens with identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Elections Act, therefore, is not restrictive.  In fact, it 
is extremely permissive. 
We are going to refer to those who administer it, and say it is 
up to the returning officers in each area, because they are the 
ones running the show. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had experiences.  As far as I know, I represent the 
Liberal Party of Canada, but the person in charge of the 
election, the returning officer for the riding of 
Beauharnois—Salaberry—I do not know what happened on election 
day—did not rule in our favour on many points in applying the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone is appointed to this position, on the face of it, 
that person is objective and has only to apply the legislation. 
Overall, this is done in a highly satisfactory manner.  Often, 
when there is a problem, it is with the political organizations 
and the riding level, not with the administration of the act 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then this idea of proportional representation?  I keep 
coming back to this point. 
Our electoral system allows all citizens in all ridings 
throughout the country to voice their opinion on the candidates. 
There is no limit on the number of candidates in one riding. 
In some ridings, we can find up to 12 names on the list of 
candidates and on the ballot.  So anyone, if a citizen, is free 
to run for election.  There is no limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can say today that, obviously, only one person per riding 
will get elected. That person is usually chosen by the majority 
of the voters in his or her riding. A person is elected when a 
majority of voters decide to vote for the candidate of the 
political party whose message and agenda appeal to them, and this 
is true right across the country. A majority elects a candidate 
who is part of a team representing a political party and its 
leader. Of course, a political party is made up of many 
supporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the results of the last election, we see that the 
Liberal Party of Canada was elected in all the provinces. 
Liberal candidates were elected in Alberta, Saskatchewan, the 
Yukon, the Maritimes, British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, 
everywhere. The question is, and that brings me back to the 
motion before the House, why should we once again examine the 
merits of proportional representation? What political party is 
raising this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To promote democracy and to provide a greater choice to the 
people, maybe the political parties should ensure that their 
agenda is for all the people of Canada. We are elected by the 
people of Canada. That is what it is all about. Is our message 
reaching everyone in Canada or is it heard only by the residents 
of a particular region? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results lead to the conclusion that some political 
parties are regional whereas others are national. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, we must work with the various political 
parties to help them develop a message or a platform for all 
Canadians. If the majority of Canadians across the country decide 
to choose a particular political party, it should be because 
their analysis showed that the platform put forward by the 
Liberal Party of Canada best responded to their needs. Other 
parties may have more specialized platforms that are more 
responsive to the needs of a particular region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we think about changing the mechanism or the structure, 
or the electoral process, we should reflect on what we stand for 
as individuals and also on what each political party stands for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, there are more than 30 members of the Bloc Quebecois. 
However, that party's platform does not respond to the needs of 
Canadians in general nor is it accepted by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have an even more democratic system in Canada—and I should 
not say more democratic—we could say in the Canada Elections Act 
that any political party that wants to be active on the national 
scene must have a federalist vision and not a separatist vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can see how far democracy is applied in Canada.  Even 
those parties whose goals oppose the Canadian federation are 
allowed to take their place on the Canadian chessboard.  Let us 
see whether, in other countries, such parties, within a federal 
system, are allowed to take up a position on the national 
chessboard.  It is fairly peculiar to Canada to allow a party, 
whatever its origins or its vision, to become part of the 
Canadian electoral process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I think we have done enough studies in the past 
20 or 25 years.  Reports have been prepared and tabled, 
softcover reports and others in five volumes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should first encourage parliamentarians or the 
members of political parties to give more thought to what they 
represent, to the message they want to get across to the people 
of Canada.  Let us allow the people, the population as a whole, 
to decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our principles is to let the people in a riding decide on 
the candidate to represent them in the House of Commons.  They 
voted for that person.  It must not be a question of mathematics 
applied after the fact because a political party obtained a 
percentage of votes and must therefore then be allotted a 
representative or two.  This is not quite how our House should 
be organized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always say that, when a member speaks in the House, it is on 
behalf of the people in his or her riding.  This is why as well 
ridings are set up with a percentage, an almost identical number 
of voters.  There are a few exceptions, but on the whole there 
are approximately the same number of voters, give or take 10,000 
federally, because the ridings are very large compared to the 
provincial ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I rise in the House, I represent my fellow citizens, not 
just those who voted for me, but all of them, all the voters 
whose names were on the voters' lists. Such is the principle 
that guides us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea is not to develop new rules that would allow just about 
anyone to create a political party and to be here in the House 
because he or she represents 1% of the population. That is not 
the idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system works well since there is a rotation. The problem may 
be that some political parties in this House convey a message 
that does not meet the expectations of all Canadians. That, in 
my opinion, is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The party in office changes the moment another party carries a 
message that better reflects the views of the majority of 
Canadians. 
We must develop national messages and programs, not regional 
ones.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, a good friend of mine, Michel Bélanger, who is no 
longer with us, held prestigious positions in Quebec, both in 
the banking industry and in the Quebec government. He was 
involved in the referendum. He left a message that his son read 
in church, at his funeral, in which he said “What is feasible 
is not necessarily desirable”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to end on this note, but before I conclude, I would 
like to pick up on a few points raised by Bloc Quebecois members 
when they spoke about party financing.  Quebec has its own 
legislation on party financing, but so do other countries. 
Canada's system allows political parties to receive donations 
from individuals and from corporations, but this should apply to 
all political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me smile to hear members of a political party 
criticizing this form of financing while they use it indirectly. 
During the last election campaign, the Bloc Quebecois invited a 
minister of the Government of Quebec, who was bound by the 
legislation prohibiting corporations from making campaign 
donations, to a fundraising dinner as a guest speaker. Honestly. 
They sometimes take a pretty ambiguous stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by quoting the headline of an article in <I>La 
Presse</I>, which read “According to Michel Gauthier, the Bloc 
Quebecois must disappear”.  This would perhaps be a little more 
in line with our electoral process, the representation system we 
have developed in the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on the fact that he 
presented his speech without notes from government officials but 
regret the fact that his remarks were so redundant and circular 
in nature.  In particular, it seems like this was a pretty 
fatuous effort simply to defend the status quo, which is after 
all the driving motive of force of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggested that the opposition parties support the 
motion in principle because they fail to garner the support of 
most Canadians for their programs.  Would the hon. member not 
admit that the party of which he is a member has failed to obtain 
the support of most Canadians in each of the last three 
elections? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two elections respectively, the Liberal Party earned 
38% and 41% of the popular vote, which was far short of majority. 
Yet, with roughly 60% of Canadians opposing its program, it 
managed to completely monopolize political power in the country. 
Does he think that is in the best interest of democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, does he not think it would be helpful to national 
unity if the composition of parliament in some way reflected the 
diversity and plurality of political views which we find in the 
regions?   Would he not think that the 25% of the voters of my 
province of Alberta who voted for Liberal candidates should have 
a larger representation in this place than they currently have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he not similarly concur that the 1.5 million Ontarians, 
the 25% of Ontarians who voted for the Canadian Alliance, should 
have more than 1.5% of the representation of this province?   Is 
he not at all disturbed that roughly half of Ontarians have 
virtually no voice in this place in terms of their partisan 
choices? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he have any regard at all for the fact that Canada is now 
the only multiparty advanced democracy in the world that has a 
system of voting designed in and for 16th century England when 
candidates really were non-partisan candidates elected for the 
purpose of representation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he not concur with me that we should be mindful of the 
many international precedents in other parliamentary systems, 
such as sister Commonwealth countries including Great Britain 
which has adopted a form of modified PR for its regional 
assemblies in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member could address these points.  Does he not 
think that a greater reflection of the plurality of views in 
different parts of the country would be healthy for democracy? 
Does he apologize at all for the fact that his government 
shamelessly exercises completely uncontrolled power, even though 
it is opposed in elections by 60% of Canadians?  Does he think 
that every other complex multi-party democracy in the world has 
it wrong and Canada alone has it right? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have managed to drive voter turnout down to 60%, 
does he think that is a record of success and vibrancy in our 
democracy? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, if my approach is 
circular, it covers all of Canada.  It goes beyond a regional 
vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election, the Liberal Party of Canada won 41% of the 
vote, the Canadian Alliance 26%, the Bloc Quebecois, 11%, the 
Progressive Conservative Party, 12% and the New Democratic Party, 
9%.  So the people spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Italy has an electoral process.  It has approximately one 
government a year.  It is therefore always dealing with 
coalition governments. 
I think a government should not constantly be blocked by silly 
games being played in the House because when a political party 
goes to the people it presents a platform and makes commitments. 
If it is elected with a majority, it has four or five years to 
honour those commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having a majority government gives that party a better chance of 
honouring its commitments and following up on its platform. That 
means it is also assessed on its platform at the end of its 
mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we ignore that? The electoral process has evolved both at 
the federal and provincial level. I remember when candidates 
could run in two or three ridings during a campaign. That has 
changed. Now there is one candidate per riding. No candidate can 
run in more than one riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when candidates could be both a member of 
parliament and the mayor of a municipality at the same time. 
Today, the system has been changed so a member of parliament can 
no longer hold any other position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian electoral and parliamentary systems have evolved 
over the centuries as a result of pressure coming from the 
people. It is not only because of individuals expressing ideas 
here and there. It is often when these ideas are accepted or 
assimilated by the general public that our system starts to 
change gradually. That is something we can see in the provinces 
as well as here, in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always come back to the expression “What is feasible is not 
necessarily desirable”. 
It should be demonstrated that the present system does not meet 
the aspirations of Canadians. Canadians should be asked if they 
want changes in the parliamentary system because, if they can 
vote, they can say what they want.

1993;. How have the people in their riding benefited from 
Canada's economic growth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back home that was our priority during the election campaign. 
People realized that the economy was growing in Quebec and in 
Canada, but that they had yet to reap any benefits in their 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would go even further than that. 
I even challenge them to read all the speeches Daniel Turp, the 
Bloc member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, made in this House.  I 
challenge them to find in all his speeches in his three and a 
half years here the number of times he mentioned highway 30, used 
the words “riding of Beauharnois—Salaberry”, “of my fellow 
citizens”, “at home”.  I would like that.  This is where the 
difference lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about home.  And, here in the House of Commons, I 
will talk and represent the people of my riding.  I will 
represent all Quebecers.  I will defend their rights.  I will 
defend Quebec's interests, but I will not represent the 
separatists.  I will represent all of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear them saying all the time in the House and everywhere in

barely 36% of the vote compared to the federalists, who got 64% 
of the vote.  And, in the case of the Quebec provincial election 
of 1998, the Liberals in Quebec got 200,000 more votes than the 
PQ, and yet they are still saying they speak on behalf of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for Canadians watching the debate I 
would like to indicate that every so often opposition parties 
have an opportunity to set the subject for debate during a 
particular day.  Today the New Democratic Party has set the 
subject for debate with the following motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House strike a special all-party committee to examine 
the merits of various models of proportional representation and 
other electoral reforms, with a view to recommending reforms that 
would combat the increasing regionalization of Canadian politics, 
and the declining turnout of Canadians in federal elections. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others before me have given some statistics about the 
regionalization of this place: most government members are from 
one province of the country; other parties mostly draw their 
members mostly from a particular part of the country; and voter 
turnout in the recent election fell somewhat dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has taken the following position with respect to 
electoral reform.  We have long argued that the Canadian 
political system has a long way to go to achieve the standards of 
democracy, openness, representativeness and accountability that 
we have set for ourselves as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance takes the position that elections must be 
conducted in a way that best allows the people to express their 
will, not only about the person they wish to represent them in 
Ottawa but on the kinds of policies they wish their national 
government to pursue.  We also take the position that another 
vital principle is that elections must be held in the most open 
and fair manner possible so that Canadians will feel absolute 
confidence that there is no manipulation of the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go in a number of directions in expanding on those basic 
positions of the Canadian Alliance Party, but I should like to 
spend some time on the issue of proportional representation, the 
one issue of parliamentary reform specifically mentioned in the 
New Democratic motion.  It is fair to say that the New Democrats 
have a particular interest in this kind of reform.  If the seats 
in the House were allocated strictly by proportional 
representation, instead of 13 seats the New Democratic Party 
would have 25 seats given the percentage of popular support that 
it garnered in the last election. 
Members can see why the party feels somewhat cheated in that the 
results of the popular vote are not reflected its proportion in 
the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party struck a task force on democratic reform a little 
while ago.  It was a very good task force because it had as one 
of its members my colleague from Lanark—Carleton.  It came down 
with a report on a number of issues.  I should like to read to 
the House and to Canadians watching some of our observations 
about the matter of proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle is that representation in parliament of groups of 
like-minded voters is in proportion to the groups' voting 
strength.  For example, if a party wins 40% of the popular vote 
it obtains 40% of the seats.  Proportional representation, says 
the task force, is sort of like ice cream.  It comes in many 
flavours and colours and includes everything from the Italian and 
Israeli variety, which has some downside, to the mixed member 
proportional system used in Germany and New Zealand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proportional representation principle ensures fairness to 
parties because no party is overcompensated or under-rewarded. In 
addition, the PR principle aims at fairness for voters in that 
few votes are wasted.  Election results under proportional 
representation are more truly shaped by the voters and hence 
produce governments that are more accurately representative of 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voter turnout was highlighted in the New Democratic motion 
today.  Voter turnout under proportional representation is 
between 8% to 11% higher.  In addition, when few votes are wasted 
voters need not resort to strategic voting.  Voters can be true 
to their own honest beliefs without the worry that their vote 
will be wasted or that they will inadvertently elect the least 
desirable party. That is particularly the case in the province of 
Quebec, to which the previous speaker alluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under proportional representation the allocation of seats in 
parliament would more accurately represent the political 
diversity which exists among Canadian voters.  No party is likely 
to hold a majority of seats.  The result would be a fundamental 
realignment of power within parliament, breaking down Canadian 
practices which have excessively concentrated power in the 
executive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Especially beginning with this parliament there has been much 
gnashing of teeth about the centralization of power in the 
executive in the Prime Minister's Office.  Proportional 
representation would be a fair and obvious way to address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is asserted by some, rightly or wrongly, that our country is 
run out of the Prime Minister's Office by a handful of mostly 
unelected political appointees.  The concentration of power leads 
to abuse of power.  The House of Commons is unable to fulfil its 
function, which is to hold the government responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have already heard, Mr. Speaker, points of order and 
questions of privilege in which members have expressed concern 
about not being able to do their job, to be heard in this place 
or to hold the government to account.  Combined with party 
discipline such parliamentary majorities permit Canadian prime 
ministers to be elected dictators.  Those are strong words, but 
some members feel there is a strong reason to use them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A proportional representation voting system would eliminate such 
dictatorial tendencies and redress the imbalance of power within 
parliament.  How is that?  It is because no party could enjoy a 
majority, or rarely in any event.  Proportional representation 
would transform parliamentary practice from an adversarial 
confrontational style which concentrates power and excludes most 
MPs from participating to a practice of inclusion, rule by 
consensus and meaningful participation by all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you would hear a lot fewer howls of outrage and 
heckling because under proportional representation members would 
have a more meaningful role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is strong evidence suggesting that a less adversarial 
style of governing, aimed at the long term public good rather 
than short term partisan interests, results in a more efficient 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conventional wisdom among political scientists is that the 
British Westminister responsible government model delivers strong 
government while proportional representation, coalition 
consensual governments are weak, was turned on its head by the 
findings of political scientist Jankowski who devised a study to 
measure economic results and efficiency under different voting 
systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jankowski's study encompasses 12 democracies over a 100 year 
time span and measured per capita gross domestic product.  His 
conclusion was that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistical evidence rejects the responsible, or Westminster 
political parties argument.  Strong, centralized two-party 
systems do not promote economic efficiency... Westminster parties 
actually reduce economic growth relative to weak, or multi-party 
systems. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there is much circumstantial evidence that Japan, 
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg and the Scandinavian 
countries each have educational systems and economies that out 
performed or did as well as Canada's throughout the last 40 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most governments cannot resist influencing the economy for 
purely political reasons.  They inflate the economy before 
elections and deflate the economy after elections.  I find this 
hard to believe, Mr. Speaker, and I am sure you do to, but this 
is the finding of the task force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Academic Edward Tufte studied the frequency of this self-serving 
practice and found that all but eight democratic governments 
worldwide were guilty.  Each of the eight exceptions have a 
proportional representation system.  The opportunity to 
manipulate the economy for short term political gain is less 
likely when power is shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force also concluded that Canada has precisely the 
wrong voting system for its social realities and regional 
differences.  Countries such as Belgium, Switzerland and South 
Africa have successfully incorporated differences more numerous 
and more pronounced than Canada's.  These countries have 
proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force made a number of findings that proportional 
representation would be a much better way of dealing with the 
national unity issue, and I know other speakers have elaborated 
on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the task force found that proportional 
representation has the potential to give fair results to parties, 
give voters more choice, waste fewer votes, bring greater 
political diversity into parliament, build national unity, weaken 
the power of the Prime Minister and cabinet, increase the power 
of parliament, encourage responsible government, render 
government more responsive to changing public demands, deliver a 
more efficient government, connect the government to the people, 
and foster a political culture of democratic participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be wonderful if we had even half of those changes 
in our particular democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there are advantages and disadvantages to be weighed 
and different approaches to proportional representation, I 
believe that the NDP's motion, if we were to support it in the 
House and set up a committee to conduct such a study, would serve 
the interests of Canadians.  It would further the democratic aims 
and objectives of our country and be a positive step for us to 
take.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, my colleague from Fraser Valley has over the last 
several months spoken a great deal about other democratic reforms 
we believe the House should pursue:  that there be free votes in 
the House; that the ethics counsellor become an officer of 
parliament rather than an employee of the Prime Minister, which 
we debated and voted on in the last few days; that there be a new 
standing committee on privacy, access and ethics; that 
appointments for officers of parliament be made more 
democratically; that there be more restricted use of closure and 
time allocation; and that there be more spending accountability 
on the part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of scope for us to move forward in our democracy 
by examining those measures.  I support the motion by the New 
Democratic Party.  I also urge other members of the House to 
support the very sensible step of actively and vigorously 
examining these measures, hopefully with a view to reinvigorating 
and re-democratizing the institutions that serve Canadians from 
coast to coast. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the comments she made about 
the motion before the House today.  She pointed out the need for 
a committee to look at proportional representation, an idea whose 
time has come.  Most countries have an element of PR in their 
systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to hear the member comment on other kinds of 
electoral and parliamentary reforms that we should perhaps look 
at.  It seems to me that the Senate must be reformed, elected or 
abolished.  Very few Canadians, about 5% according to the 
polling, actually support the unelected, unaccountable and 
undemocratic Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power of the Prime Minister's Office under the constitution 
is much too great in terms of its ability to appoint so many 
people without a proper vetting of his appointments by the 
appropriate parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also have set dates for elections, throne speeches and 
budgets so that we can properly plan those important events. The 
power of timing should be taken out of the Prime Minister's hands 
and indeed out of the hands of the premiers who enjoy similar 
powers under the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there should be fewer confidence votes and more free 
votes in the House so that we can reflect on what is best for the 
country, for the common good for Canada and for all their 
constituents.  It goes without saying that House of Commons 
committees should have more power and independence in terms of 
initiating and timetabling legislation and in the free vote of 
committee chairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are just some of the things that are important.  Added to 
that is the motion the other day by the Leader of the Opposition 
to have an independent ethics counsellor reporting to the House 
of Commons and not to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the sort of package my party and I look at in terms of 
providing a bigger democracy and more democracy in terms of our 
electoral and parliamentary systems.  In addition, we need more 
economic democracy in terms of the power that transnational 
corporations take away from ordinary people and from governments 
in trade deals and the like.  However that is another issue for 
another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member sum up her vision or her party's vision of 
a bigger democracy in terms of our electoral and parliamentary 
systems? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, our party, the Canadian 
Alliance, has a complete section in its policy book on democratic 
reform.  We have a section on economic principles.  We have a 
section on social principles, and we have a whole section on 
democratic governing principles and democratic reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our policy book includes many of the measures the hon. member 
just mentioned, such as free votes in the House of Commons, fixed 
election dates, looking at proportional representation, and 
putting more power in the hands of people to hold their 
government and elected members accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member mentions, most democratic countries have moved 
toward proportional representation.  Of thirty-six liberal 
democracies with over two million people only three have still 
not implemented proportional representation.  They are Canada, 
the U.S. and Jamaica.  Britain, Scotland and Wales brought 
proportional representation to the political table and their 
discussions began in 1999.  Canada is a bit behind the curve in 
looking at more democratic ways to arrange its electoral affairs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area where I disagree with the member who asked the question 
is in the whole area of abolishing the Senate.  I think that 
would be a big mistake, unless there are some electoral reforms 
made in the way the House operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate represents regional issues as opposed to the one 
person one vote way of representation that this Chamber 
represents.  If the Senate were abolished there would be 
imbalances and regional inequities, which are reflected in this 
Chamber where the governing party comes mostly from one province, 
the province of Ontario.  There would be much less of a voice and 
much less vigour in defending and representing the views of other 
parts of the country.  If that were the only arrangement whereby 
issues could be dealt with, there would be a real imbalance in 
the way regional interests were handled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because we have a Senate that regional issues have a 
fighting chance of being properly considered in the second 
chamber.  I urge the member to think about the implications of 
abolishing the Senate because of the need to reflect more 
properly and more truly regional interests. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the New Democratic Party 
bringing this proposition before the House today.  It would have 
a little more credibility if the New Democrats had tried this 
kind of system in provinces where they have been in power.  As 
far as I know the NDP has not tried that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance has a lot of time for this proposal.  It has a lot 
of friends in Alberta and as far as I know Alberta does not use 
the PR system.  It is still very much using the first past the 
post system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have to say is nothing new.  I am sure the member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill knows that the first past the post system 
gives a much better chance of a majority government.  From a 
majority government there should be more accountability and more 
focus on responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, when Bill Clinton came to the presidency in the 
White House back in January 1993, in his campaign throughout 1992 
he had more or less promised a public health care system across 
the United States.  We all know what happened to it.  It did not 
happen mainly because he could not get the support.  He could not 
strike up a coalition among fellow democrats and republicans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Mr. Clinton had been a prime minister with a majority under a 
parliamentary system, he could have got that kind of proposal 
through.  That speaks well of a parliamentary system and it 
speaks well of a system that very often produces a majority 
government.  Would the hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill like to 
comment on that aspect? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member raises a 
very important point.  His argument, as I understand it, is 
essentially that a strong majority government which does not have 
to compromise or be diluted with input from other groups is able 
to push an agenda through more vigorously and more effectively 
than a government that has to be dependent upon the support and 
concurrence of more groups than just its own members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at how effective that system of government has 
been in Canada.  In my short time in the House, which has been 
just over seven years, I have personally seen the effective input 
of members and the opportunities to hold the government 
accountable and have a system of checks and balances on what 
government wishes to do significantly eroded.  Committees now are 
simply run as closed shops by a particular department. 
The ministers do not really have to answer to committees or 
change their legislation because of committees.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think dictatorship without a lot of checks and balances is 
an effective way to go, perhaps we should go all the way toward a 
totalitarian state.  Then the governing head of state could do 
whatever he or she wishes to do.  However, we would argue that 
according to democratic convention that is not a desirable way to 
run a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly be aghast if the member suggests that we need 
to go more in the direction of unchecked majority power and less 
on the need to build consensus and support to bring a broad 
coalition of thought and support behind a particular initiative. 
I reject the member's premise and I think if he is a democrat he 
should too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before we resume debate, it is my 
duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows:  the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester, Foreign 
Affairs; the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre, Health. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington.  Today the opposition motion concerns the 
issue of striking an all-party committee to look at various 
models of proportional representation and other parliamentary 
reforms.  It also concludes or hypothesises that it would combat 
the increasing regionalization in Canadian politics and the 
declining turnout of Canadians in federal elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important motion.  I listened to much of the debate 
today.  I listened to the lead speech by the leader of the New 
Democratic Party.  I was confused why the New Democratic Party 
did not want to have a vote in the House on the motion.  It seems 
strange since one of its strong points is that the matter has not 
been voted on in the House since the 1920s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a broad motion.  It is a broad issue.  It raises some 
interesting points that I think members have spoken about quite a 
bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proportional representation is probably a concept which is 
foreign to Canadians generally because it is not simply defined. 
There are various models, as members have noted in their 
speeches, such those in Israel, Russia or Germany.  However there 
is one principle that is characteristic to all of them: Should a 
party that receives 20% of the votes in an election also have 20% 
of the seats in the parliament as a reflection of that support in 
the national vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle Canadians would probably agree that the 
representation within a parliament should be fairly reflective of 
their views.  However in our parliamentary system votes are not 
split riding by riding in the same proportion, which raises some 
interesting questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most members have not talked today about the practicality or the 
implementation of such a plan and what it would mean to 
parliament.  I tried to think about it a bit.  Today we have 301 
members of parliament representing each of the 301 
constituencies. There are some 30 million people, which means 
that on average we each represent about 100,000 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the parliamentarian is extremely important.  Most 
members would agree that serving the needs of their constituents 
is probably one of the most important and relevant activities 
discharged by a member of parliament.  It is a difficult job 
because in most ridings members of parliament do not get elected 
with much more than 50% of the vote.  Many in fact get elected 
with only 40% of the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have five official parties.  In most provinces there are at 
least four candidates representing official parties and many 
other candidates representing other parties that are not as well 
known.  It does mean that we do have representation by members 
who do not have the majority of votes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we go across the country and look at who is first past the 
post, in the last election the Liberal government elected 172 
members of parliament.  That represents a majority government. It 
is interesting to consider that although members of parliament 
would like to think we are elected substantively on our own merit 
they are running on behalf of a party with an election platform 
and with a foundation of policy and a philosophy of party 
structure that have evolved over long periods of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electors have many reasons for voting for a particular member of 
parliament representing a party and a platform.  I would think 
that a large majority of them would say that they vote for the 
party first, maybe for the platform and then for the leader.  If 
they still have some doubts they might look to the candidate. 
Others are so dedicated to and such great fans of their members 
of parliament that they would look to them as long as they are 
pleased with the representation they give and trust that they 
will use their best judgment in all matters before the House. 
Some experts have suggested that members of parliament could be 
worth as much as 10% of the vote in most ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system of proportional representation is an attack on the 
accountability of parliamentarians in this place.  We are elected 
to represent constituencies with defined boundaries.  We are 
elected, not so much on what we promise to do but on what we have 
done.  Canadians would find that the common bond of association 
we have in this place is that we have all been very involved in 
our communities through charitable work, volunteer service and 
other levels of representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of it was done on a voluntary basis, much of it without 
compensation and much of it because we were involved and love our 
communities. We wanted to make them better places for our 
families.  Those kinds of things distinguish members of 
parliament in this place.  It is what they have done, not what 
they promise to do.  There is an integrity issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proportional representation basically says that we want to add 
another class of parliamentarian.  Many basically say they want a 
list of people particular parties would like to have. In the 
event they have a greater percentage of the vote and get a 
greater percentage of seats, they would like some of the members 
on their lists to become members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure how we could pragmatically implement it in Canada. 
I am not sure which ridings they would represent.  I am not sure 
whether constituents would have a place to go to talk to them.  I 
am not sure whether or not they would be people who could be 
elected if they actually ran in an election.  I am not sure they 
would reflect the quality of people who Canadians would like to 
see in their parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It raises some questions.  There are some very good people out 
there, but can we imagine having another class of parliamentarian 
in this place?  One would be elected by the constituents of a 
riding and the other be slotted in or deemed to be here simply 
because the party as a whole somehow got a few more votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of the pitfalls of proportional 
representation.  Let us imagine an area in the country where some 
group was able to organize itself and to make outlandish promises 
that very enticing and alluring but knew it would never have to 
deliver because it would never form a government.  Could we 
consider a party that said it would come in here and eliminate 
the GST, reduce income taxes by another 20%, give every Canadian 
$500 a year in heating rebates or take care of our families?  The 
list could go on.  A lot of these things would be nice to have 
but fiscally imprudent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it possible that a group which could lay out a very alluring 
and enticing platform could in fact get 10% of the vote across 
Canada?  I have a feeling that it is possible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, what would happen in this bizarre case would be that 
10% of the members in this place would not be elected in any 
riding but would be here simply because of their party, which had 
an imprudent platform, and then they all of a sudden would be 
members of parliament in this place.  That is what I characterize 
as the affront to democracy and the affront to members of 
parliament and the accountability and integrity members bring 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I do not know what would happen, for instance, if 
you were to have 20 more members of parliament in this place. 
Would that mean that we would have 20 more seats in here, which I 
am not sure would be a great platform to run on, or would it mean 
that existing members of parliament would have to represent 20% 
more people?  There are a lot of implementation problems with 
such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just suggest to members that these kinds of ideas, 
although they have been operating in other countries, all have 
had significant problems.  What I do know is that people across 
Canada, riding by riding, know, respect and care for their member 
of parliament, because I think all members here legitimately do 
the best they can to represent the best interests of their 
constituents.

Mr. Speaker, I know that the hon. member does do the best he can

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when we face a situation in which some members, and I 
use my own example, are elected with pluralities that are far 
lower than an absolute majority of constituents—in my case 38% 
of the vote and in the case of one of my colleagues on this side 
of the House when he was initially elected less than 30% of the 
vote—it is hard to say that we have a system that is genuinely 
representative of the well-being of all of the constituents, no 
matter how hard that member tries to do his or her best on behalf 
of those constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads to curious cases.  In one riding I know of, in 1993, 
a riding moving from the New Democrats to the Reform Party, as it 
then was, based on a very small shift in votes in what was 
essentially a four way race, there was not a dramatic ideological 
shift from left to right among constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one way to overcome this that I think might address 
some of the concerns the hon. gentleman raised and I wonder if he 
would consider this as a possibility.  It is to use the model of 
the single transferable vote.  I do not think that falls outside 
the suggestions made by the New Democrats.  It has been used 
successfully in a number of jurisdictions.  Again, I cite my own 
experience in Australia watching elections being held on this 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a transferable ballot, one member per district, 
voters have the opportunity to cast their ballot for their 
preferred choice as candidate and then for a second and third and 
so on down the list.  If they have someone they particularly 
dislike and think is inappropriate, they can mark that person at 
the bottom of the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consensus candidate tends to emerge, so that in a very real 
sense everybody except those who absolutely put that candidate 
last can say that to some degree he or she is being represented 
by that member and that member has the obligation to do so. 
Indeed, if he or she wants to get elected he or she must respect 
that breadth of wishes.  A more consensual candidate tends to get 
elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would that kind of proposal perhaps accomplish some of the goals 
that the hon. member has brought up in some of his concerns? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is one of the many 
models that the NDP is suggesting we consider.  There is no 
question that we do have colleagues in this place who did not get 
50% of the vote—some got as low as 30% and maybe even in the 
low 20% range in some parliaments—but that is part of democracy. 
I think there are well over 150 official registered parties in 
Canada and that is part of our democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may very well mean that we will not have high numbers, but 
generally speaking I believe that the vast majority of members 
here have earned sufficient support within their ridings to do a 
good job.  We will never get 100% of the vote and we should not 
be naive enough to think that is what we should be striving for. 
What we should be striving for, once elected here, is to do the 
best job possible and remember that we are part of a party 
system, that we ran on a platform and that when we are elected to 
come here we should be supporting what we ran on.  We have to do 
that, because if we cannot support our party's platform then we 
should resign from our own caucus and sit as independents.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some fundamental principles here which members tend to 
forget sometimes in the heat of debate:  that we have been 
elected for certain reasons and that when we vote, even as a 
group, it is not because of any reason other than it is what we 
ran on in front of our constituents. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to make the same point the member from Ontario 
just made.  The member across the way talked about certain MPs 
just being slotted in.  I would certainly oppose that.  It would 
be like the present Senate where senators are slotted in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we could look at making as democratic as possible the 
single transferable vote, which is what I certainly favour as a 
member of the House, or a preferential ballot.  We used that, by 
the way, in Saskatchewan for the NDP leadership vote about a 
month ago where there were seven candidates.  People could mail 
in a ballot and choose their candidate among one, two, three, 
four, five, six or seven.  A real consensus candidate emerged 
from the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can use that as well in terms of PR.  For example, in 
Saskatchewan right now we have 14 MPs.  We could have seven 
ridings and have seven people elected riding by riding.  We could 
have the other seven elected from democratically chosen lists and 
allow the voters to vote in terms of a single transferable 
ballot.  I think that would be real democracy.  I wonder if the 
member across the way would be open to that kind of idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member's 
speech this morning as well.  I understand that there are a 
number of models.  However, I think the experience that Canadians 
have had over history has shown that we have a stable system of 
parliament.  In fact, our first past the post system tends to 
produce majority governments, which allows governments to 
implement the platforms they run on in elections.  That is a very 
important part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I noted in the NDP leader's speech this morning that 
she tends to think this would improve regional representation, 
but what the member described to me will not increase regional 
representation, simply because in the case of a party such as his 
own there are not many spaces open considering the popular 
support that his party received. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a great honour to speak 
to this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin my comments by saying that our country, Canada, 
has over time developed a very strong and good electoral system. 
I think it is fair to say, too, that people across the country 
have supported it and have cast their ballots accordingly.  I 
think it is democratic in the sense that it underscores the very 
foundations and values of Canadians, wherever they are in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that it seems to me that other 
countries have emulated Canada when it comes to our electoral 
system and that is something worth noting.  It is also worth 
noting that with our electoral system as it is we have a kind of 
built in flexibility which enables us, then, to do the kinds of 
things that are necessary, especially in a country as growing and 
dynamic as Canada.  That too is worthy of note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it a little bit ironic that the New Democratic Party has 
this motion before us today.  After all, 91.5% of Canadians voted 
against it.  Under proportional representation it would fall from 
being the fourth party to the fifth party.  It has no members in 
the territories.  It has no members in a number of provinces.  It 
had a chance under a number of provincial governments, quite 
frankly, to implement proportional representation and it did not 
choose to do it.  Typical New Democrats:  always talk a good line 
but never quite follow through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also find it a bit interesting that when it comes to 
regionalization, New Democrats are going down this path as well. 
I find it a little hard to take, but after all, they are like 
that.  They like to kind of tinker around and make grandiose, 
grandstanding kinds of comments, but when it comes time to 
deliver they cannot quite seem to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I should add that in the New Democrats' electoral 
platform there were maybe one or two lines about proportional 
representation, so yet again there they go.  They did not really 
give it the prominence that they pretend to give it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to say is this:  we have over time had our critics 
on our electoral system, but I think it is important to note that 
at the end of the day it has been a very good system which has 
benefited Canada.  While all the systems fall under the heading 
of proportional representation in other parts of the world that 
have it, it seems to me that they vary enormously as a result and 
there are different approaches used as a result.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just outline a couple of them.  First is the preferential 
ballot, whereby voters rank candidates in order of preference 
with votes for low-polling candidates being transferred to 
remaining candidates according to voter preference.  Another 
point is the pure proportional representation system, where the 
entire country is treated as one constituency and members are 
selected from party lists based on the percentage of the popular 
vote received by the parties.  Finally, there is another system, 
a mixed system, whereby some members are chosen on the basis of 
first past the post contests while others are chosen from party 
lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, this is a complex issue and a number of 
alternatives are presented.  I might point out that there are 
advantages and disadvantages to each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the members of the Alliance heckling me.  It is 
interesting that they would heckle.  As we start into electoral 
reform, remember their referendum question where they were going 
to have 3% of the voters across Canada triggering a referendum? 
Can we imagine the ludicrousness of that kind of situation, where 
3% could change a motion on major issues?  That is how out of 
touch those members are with what Canada wants and what people 
see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if electoral reform went down the path of asking, for 
example, whether or not parties should release the names of 
donors who donated to political leadership campaigns?  We did 
that.  Why does that party not do it?  Or what about making 
payments to former MPs?  Was it not $50,000 for Jim Hart's seat 
so the leader of the loyal opposition—yes, loyal, let us think 
about that for a while—could take his seat?  Why do we not 
examine that under electoral reform?  What about checking out and 
auditing the Gaspé in terms of people on the list?  Remember that 
boondoggle in the Gaspé when those people, those reformed 
Alliance people opposite— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe the member for Waterloo—Wellington is steering 
dramatically far from the issue at hand, which is proportional 
representation.  He is talking about all sorts of issues that 
have absolutely nothing to do with the motion at hand.  Frankly I 
think it is not showing the due respect that the motion deserves. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Harvey):</B> I would ask members to limit 
their comments, as much as possible, to the subject matter of the 
motion now before the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am dealing with electoral 
reform because the motion actually calls for a review, an all 
party committee to examine various models. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted to say that the committee, in its wisdom, could 
broaden into looking at those kinds of issues.  This is part of 
the give and take of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee could take a look at whether or not it is 
legitimate, for example, for a leader to spend $800,000 of 
taxpayers' money and then have Mr. Britton, a lawyer in the firm 
of Bennett Jones, turn around and cut a cheque for $70,000.  That 
is real electoral reform.  Perhaps the spotlight should turn on 
the Alliance people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note with great interest that the motion deals with 
regionalization of Canadian politics.  What better way to try to 
regionalize than the member for Okanagan—Shuswap and the member 
for Wild Rose going to the separatist meetings in Alberta?  Boy, 
there is division for you.  There is a chance and an opportunity 
for people to sew the seeds of regionalism, in this case, western 
separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the member who is the leader sanction that?  He certainly 
did not rebuke them and quite frankly I think he should have.  He 
should have rapped their knuckles in the interest, as they point 
out, of preventing regionalization of Canadian politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me, as is the case with their national counsellor 
who went to the east and said that all easterners are lazy and 
always want a handout and other things, that the Alliance Party 
is trying to have it both ways as usual.  It is unbelievable to 
hear about the kinds of things it is doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get back to the point at hand with respect to what we are 
dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listen to them.  They can always give it out but they cannot 
take it, those holier than thou sitting over there. It just goes 
back to the whole point about the fact that they will talk as 
they did last week about ethics, morality and all the kinds of 
things that they claim the moral high ground.  They preach with 
their evangelical zeal and on they go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the leader spent $800,000 of taxpayers' money on a 
court case that he could have settled for $60,000, and $70,000 
was kicked back by way of Mr. Britton of Bennett Jones.  It is 
outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
During the rhetorical flights of fancy from the member opposite, 
I noticed he was actually in his own seat, which is unusual. 
Normally he would be behind a minister looking for a free camera 
shot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once I heard him refer specifically to this bill and that is 
unusual for him because normally he is completely irrelevant.  I 
wonder if he could just once keep with the topic at hand and 
perhaps finish the debate off in style, for a change.  It would 
be unusual for him but I wonder if he could do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to continue and 
speak from this great seat her as the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who are irrelevant are those Alliance people, those 
people who are hypocrites, those people who, with great 
duplicity, end up always taking the moral high ground.  However, 
when it is really down and dirty, the Leader of the Opposition is 
there taking a $70,000 handout from Britton, the man who is part 
of the law firm of Bennett Jones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  I rise on a point of order.  Mr. 
Speaker, no wonder this institution is being degraded.  There is 
irrelevancy, there is a motion before the House, the speaker must 
speak to the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry to tell everyone on either 
side of the House but the time has lapsed and we are now into 
questions and comments.  I am sure the questions will be very 
relevant.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will assuredly give my friend from 
Regina—Qu'Appelle time because he is the mover of this motion. 
I just want to recognize his determined advocacy of electoral 
reform and a principled advocacy it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the pleasure of speaking with his former leader, Mr. 
Broadbent, about this issue and agreed that, in principle, we 
could join in common cause from left to right across the 
political spectrum to advance the cause of democracy in the 
country.  I am disappointed but not the least bit surprised, and 
nor were any of my colleagues opposite, with the kind of partisan 
rant which just came forward from the member opposite, who has a 
reputation about his seating patterns, as well as other things. I 
see the Minister of Finance has almost put that member in a 
camera angle.  It is amazing, he just attracts cabinet ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member care at all about the fact that Canadian 
electoral turnout has gone down to 60%, the lowest percentage in 
history?  Does he care at all that Canada is now the only complex 
multiparty democracy in the developed world which still relies on 
a 15th century voting system designed for medieval England?  Does 
he care at all that 60% of Canadians in the last election voted 
against his government's program and yet the government holds 
100% of the political power? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he have the capacity for one moment to transcend 
partisanship and his government's defence of the status quo to 
suggest that yes, perhaps this place, the voice of the people, 
the place where we speak, parliament, should consider an 
electoral system which allows the plurality and diversity of 
political views to be properly reflected in this, the people's 
House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is so nice to see the 
member oppose in the Chamber for a change.  He has been most 
invisible recently.  I guess he is feeling the heat a little out 
of that disastrous election campaign his party ran.  In fact, he 
was in my city, Kitchener, when he made that big brouhaha about 
having two tier health care.  It went all downhill from there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say this, I care passionately about Canada. 
Despite what the presumptive finance critic opposite, who has 
never met a payroll in his life, would tell us, we on the 
government side have a very dynamic electoral system in place. 
We will stand by a system that makes sure that Canadians, 
wherever they live in this great country of ours, are well 
served.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the government side will continue to present that kind of 
good peace, order and good government which is the very 
foundation of this country.  Why?  It is because of the values 
Canadians cherish very much.  We will ensure those values, unlike 
the Alliance people who flip and flop and say one thing and do 
another.  They say things with great hypocrisy and duplicity. 
They are all over the map.  Their leader gets $70,000.  They are 
the holier than thou.  They just cannot seem to get their act 
together.  It is unfortunate, but Canadians have ruled and they 
have spoken very loudly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
want to compliment the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle who has 
dedicated much of his career to the topic of electoral reform. At 
the end of the last parliament he saw fit to bring forward a 
private member's bill which stimulated a great deal of interest 
and debate.  He is now using our opposition day motion to debate 
this same important issue of electoral reform in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why reform our electoral system?  Our system is outdated and 
needs to be amended.  It needs to be put back into a condition 
where it actually works for Canadians.  It has to be a living 
institution.  As our country evolves and grows our system needs 
change.  We have been saddled with an outdated system that is not 
serving our needs.  Low voter turnout, which speaker after 
speaker has pointed to, is the most graphic illustration of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1968, 80% of Canadians voted.  There are those who argue that 
during good times people do not bother going to the polls.  The 
economy was fairly buoyant in 1968 as well and 80% of Canadians 
chose to exercise their franchise and cast a ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the most recent election about 60% of Canadians voted.  Sixty 
percent of those who were registered voted.  Fifty percent of all 
eligible voters actually voted.  This is a horrific record.  It 
is as bad a level of disinterest as in the United States.  That 
is what we see with our partners to the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people have given up on the idea that the electoral process 
is some way they can get satisfaction.  Many people are 
completely disillusioned with the electoral process that they do 
not bother to exercise their right to vote.  That is a serious 
problem.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the state 
of democracy today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the full range of debate from the sublime to the 
ridiculous today.  The most poignant thing about the debate that 
I heard, especially from the government benches, is their 
complete unwillingness to revisit the issue in any kind of a 
serious way.  It makes us wonder what they are afraid of.  Why 
would they not embrace the idea of being able to reach more 
Canadians and have more Canadians play an active role in the 
political system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most interesting points raised during this debate was 
made by the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle in his argument, and an 
argument that I accept, that some form of PR would help foster a 
greater sense of national unity.  What could be of more interest 
to the people in this room than some way to bring the country 
closer together? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The logic he used was that under PR to win seats in a federal 
election the political parties would have to run on platforms 
that would appeal to citizens right across the country.  In other 
words, if my only interest was representing the interests of my 
home province of Manitoba, I might be able to get elected on that 
basis by being a booster for the home team.  Under PR I would 
also have to have a platform and a campaign that addressed the 
issues in various regions.  One would think that that in itself 
would be a good enough reason to seriously visit the idea of 
introducing proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way things are now, unity is not served because there really 
are no truly national parties.  We take care of our base of 
strength.  The Liberal Party takes very good care of the province 
of Ontario.  The Bloc Quebecois does an admirable job 
representing the interests of the province of Quebec.  The 
Albertans have their party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem that if we are serious about threading the country 
together with some real vision of national unity, one of the 
elements has to be reforming our electoral system.  I believe the 
PR system is the way we can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason many people are not voting today is because they are 
concerned that their vote is wasted.  Under PR every vote weighs 
equally.  Even if one is an NDPer living in downtown Edmonton, a 
person could cast a ballot for the party of choice knowing it 
would do some good.  It would not be a throwaway vote.  That 
makes some sense in the interest of fairness and in the interest 
of balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a person is a reformer in Newfoundland, the person could have 
the confidence that his or her vote would not be meaningless. 
That is a positive thing.  I do not know what the resistance was 
to this idea from the opposite benches.  I find it frustrating 
that they would not at least seriously entertain the idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also seeing part of the cynicism about Canadian politics. 
Low voter turnout stems from the messaging that is going on in 
federal elections today.  There is a growing awareness.  The 
pollsters, the Hill and Knowltons of the world et cetera, will 
advise political parties that the lowest 15% or 20% income 
bracket do not really vote.  Why would someone bother addressing 
messages to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the people who actually need representation the 
most and arguably need the services of strong advocacy in the 
House of Commons, do not bother to vote at all.  Frankly, at the 
other end of the political spectrum, we all know how the top 15% 
or 20% of the economic scale vote.  There is no point in 
addressing our messages to them either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the messaging goes to the middle class band.  It is a 
homogenizing of the political messaging because those are the 
people we have to reach.  Even there voter turnout is tragically 
poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to move forward as a country we have to engage 
more of the population.  The most basic way we can do that is by 
having them take part in the political process, which is 
obviously a gift in a free society.  To not exercise their right 
to vote is an absolute shame as there are places in the world 
that do not have those rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have nothing but admiration for the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle for his dedication to this cause.  He is doing 
a great service to all Canadians to try and move this issue 
forward.  If we could have a proper and an honest debate, nobody 
could guess what the outcome would be.  However, the motion does 
not try to dictate any particular solutions.  It only calls for 
the creation of a committee to review the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who knows what kind of positive outcomes we could have if we 
embraced this idea in a fair and honest way and visited it 
without all the rancour and some of the parry and thrust that we 
have heard today.  That dialogue deviated so far away from the 
actual issue at hand that it did a disservice to all of those 
people listening and the people who would benefit very much if 
Canada adopted something along those lines of PR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other frustrating thing is that the people who need the 
representation the most are now the least likely to vote.  Those 
are the people that we have an obligation to address, to reach 
out to, to engage and to ask them their opinion.  Under this 
system of PR their opinion would weigh just as much as our 
opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we all know that something is fundamentally wrong 
with the democratic process and the state of democracy in Canada 
today when only 50% of all eligible voters bother to come to the 
polls.  We could give them a new confidence if we seriously 
embraced the idea of proportional representation and increased

the contributions that Canadian Sikhs have made to our 
country, and that this House also recognize the importance 
of the five K's:  the KIRPAN—a sword representing 
indomitable spirit; KES—unshorn hair, representing a 
simple life, saintliness and devotion to God; KARA—a steel 
bangle worn as a sign of the eternity of God; KANGA—a 
wooden comb worn to represent a clean mind and body; and 
KACHA—short breeches, representing hygienic living. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me today to 
bring this motion before the House for debate and hopefully even 
for passage at the end of the hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion that is before the House today is a motion that was 
originally passed by the Manitoba legislature on July 13, 1999 
with the support of all parties in that house.  It was with the 
intention or the hope that this motion might also pass this House 
that I brought it forward at the request of the Sikh community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was with that in mind that I sought to have this motion made 
votable when I appeared before the subcommittee on private 
members' business.  However, since it was not chosen as votable, 
now we are only debating it.  I am still hopeful that perhaps we 
might find our way to passing the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three dimensions to the motion.  The first one is 
recognizing the importance of April 13, the festival of 
<I>Vaisakhi</I>, which is the anniversary of the creation of the 
<I>Khalsa</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second dimension is recognizing the contribution of Canadian 
Sikhs to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third dimension is recognizing the importance of the five 
K's: the <I>kirpan</I>, the <I>kes</I>, the <I>kara</I>, the 
<I>kanga</I> and the <I>kacha</I> to the Sikh community.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin with April 13, the anniversary of the day in 1699 when 
Sikhism's last guru, Guru Gobind Singh created the brotherhood of 
the Khalsa.  The brotherhood was built on the sense of community 
that Sikhism's first guru, Guru Nanak, established much earlier 
when he started among other things the tradition of the community 
kitchen, or the Langar which continues to this day.  The Langar 
is such a great practical symbol of the egalitarian spirit that 
permeates the Sikh tradition.  It is a spirit of equality that 
extends to men and women and which distinguished Sikhism from the 
values of the caste system long before it became popular to do so 
in any modern sense of the word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story of Sikhs in Canada, according to a book I am reading 
about Canadian Sikhs and written by Narindar Singh, probably goes 
back to Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee in 1897 when Sikh 
regiments passed through Canada on their way to London.  They 
passed through again in 1902 for the coronation of Edward VII. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By 1903 Sikh immigration to Canada had begun.  Between 1903 and 
1908 nearly 6,000 Sikhs entered Canada, most of them travelling 
directly from their village in the Punjab to British Columbia. 
Unfortunately, their arrival in B.C. was greeted with opposition 
in many quarters.  There were Vancouver members of parliament and 
the mayor of Vancouver who called for a ban on further 
immigration of Sikhs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1907 Sikhs were denied the right to vote in B.C. and 
laws were passed prohibiting Asians from entering the 
professions, serving on juries, obtaining government contracts, 
and buying property in some parts of Vancouver.  The recently 
arrived Sikhs were included in this category and therefore these 
laws also affected them, although they were not directed only at 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make a long story short, Sikhs were eventually prevented from 
entering Canada by virtue of the continuous journey mechanism 
that flowed from the then deputy minister of labour, a man by the 
name of William Lyon Mackenzie King.  The consequence of this was 
that Sikh immigration did not resume until the late 1940s with 
the exception of the wives and children of people who were 
already here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sikhs were employed in many jobs, but they were employed mainly 
in the sawmills of British Columbia.  An almost exclusively male 
community until 1920, they maintained their sense of community 
and tradition by living together, supporting each other and 
gathering in their gurdwaras or temples.  I am pleased to now 
have two in my riding, the Khalsa Diwan Society Temple and the 
Guru Nanak Darbar Temple.  The Khalsa Diwan Society was formed in 
B.C. in 1907 for the protection of Sikhs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1913 the worst incident of anti-Sikhism in Canada occurred 
when the ship the Komagata Maru arrived in Vancouver on May 21, 
1913 and was kept from landing for two months and then was 
eventually sent away.  This is a story that I do not have the 
time to tell in great detail, but the details are both 
fascinating and embarrassing in this day of multiculturalism, 
human rights and racial and religious tolerance and pluralism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this early experience of Sikhs in this country, we should 
be all the more pleased with the attachment that so many Sikh 
Canadians feel today for Canada.  We should be all the more 
pleased to recognize, through the passage of this motion and 
speaking to this motion, the great contribution they went on to 
make to all of Canada, as Sikhs immigrated to provinces other 
than British Columbia and made their mark in many Canadian cities 
in all walks of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly in my own city, the Sikh community has made a 
tremendous contribution to the growth, development and the nature 
of the city of Winnipeg.  Winnipeg is a city that has always 
prided itself on its diversity.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sikhs in Winnipeg have certainly enriched and enhanced that 
diversity by bringing to it the values that emanate from their 
way of life and their religion:  the values of equality, social 
responsibility, community service and the importance of family. 
It is an ethic that resonates with the values that Canadians want 
to uphold as Canadians, no matter what their origin or religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this spirit that I urge members of the House to 
contribute their own comments to the debate on this particular 
motion and to consider whether or not at the end of the debate we 
might find our way through to passing the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to take up all my time because I believe there 
should be an opportunity for as many members as possible to 
contribute to this particular debate.  I will finish by reciting 
words often heard in gurdwaras across the country and which I 
have had occasion to utter myself when speaking to Sikh 
congregations in my riding:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with great 
pleasure that I participate in tonight's debate on the motion of 
the member of parliament for Winnipeg—Transcona, Motion No. 32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sikh community has made many contributions to Canadian 
society.  The success of the Sikhs in participating in the 
political process is increasing in all levels of government. 
This success should be applauded as the experience and knowledge 
within the Sikh community brings another perspective to the 
Canadian political stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sikh community, along with Canada's other ethnic and 
cultural communities, not only contributed to the diversity of 
the nation but also helped to challenge and change Canadian 
society through mutual understanding.  Canada's experience with 
diversity distinguishes it from other countries.  Our 30 million 
inhabitants reflect a cultural, ethnic and linguistic makeup 
found nowhere else on earth.  Approximately 200,000 immigrants a 
year from all parts of the globe continue to choose Canada, drawn 
by its quality of life and its reputation as an open, peaceful 
and caring society that welcomes newcomers and values diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill of rights in 1960 barred discrimination by federal 
agencies on the grounds of race, national origin, colour, 
religion or sex.  Changes to Canada's Immigration Act in 1962 
specifically stated that “any suitably qualified person from any 
part of the world could be considered for immigration to Canada, 
without regard for his race, colour, national origin, or the 
country from which he comes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence, Canada's immigration policies gradually became 
less European and the mix of source countries shifted to nations 
in Southern Europe, Asia and the West Indies.  Substantial 
increases during the 1970s and 1980s in the number of immigrants 
admitted as refugees under humanitarian and compassionate grounds 
further diversified the ethnocultural origins of newcomers to 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has learned a great deal from its diversity.  Accepting, 
and then coming to value the differences between our peoples, has 
changed and continues to change Canada, making our country a 
better place.  However, as Canadians look to the future it is 
clear that new pressures will make balancing diversity and unity 
even more challenging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through practice we have come to understand that the differences 
between us do not have to divide us.  This encourages citizens 
who face common challenges to step forward and claim their right 
to full participation in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence, Canada's concept of what constitutes diversity 
is constantly expanding.  Diversity is moving beyond language, 
ethnicity, race and religion to include cross-cutting 
characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation and range of 
ability and age.  The same approaches that have helped Canadians 
develop into a bilingual, multicultural society are now helping 
to bring down other barriers that prevent individuals from 
reaching their full potential.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lessons learned through experience with bilingualism and 
multiculturalism have taught Canada that acceptance and 
understanding of differences between peoples make collective 
development possible.  However, experience with diversity also 
shows that inequities must be acknowledged and addressed for a 
diverse people to move forward together. This is sometimes a slow 
and sometimes a painful process, but it is essential if all 
Canadians are to enjoy the same sense of belonging and attachment 
to their country.  It also serves to familiarize Canadians with 
the history that they share and the obligations that their 
history confers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making equality of opportunity meaningful in a diverse society 
requires more than constitutional measures and legislation.  All 
levels of government in Canada deliver programs that mobilize 
communities to promote dialogue and help people overcome barriers 
to their participation in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with official languages and multiculturalism, Canada has 
learned that constitutional measures and legislation alone are 
not enough to assure equal opportunity in a diverse society.  To 
contribute fully and achieve their full potential, all peoples 
must have a voice in society and a chance to shape the future 
direction of the country of which they are part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's future depends on maintaining and strengthening its 
capacity to bring together peoples with many differences, even 
grievances, and building an inclusive society where no one's 
identity or cultural heritage should be compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's approach to diversity is based on the belief that the 
common good is served when everyone is accepted and respected for 
who they are and that this ultimately makes for a more resilient, 
more harmonious and creative society.  This faith in the value of 
diversity recognizes that respect for cultural distinctiveness is 
intrinsic to an individual's sense of self-worth and identity, 
and a society that accommodates everyone equally is a society 
that encourages achievement, participation, attachment to country 
and a sense of belonging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has embraced diversity, or cultural pluralism as some 
people refer to it, in both policy and practice.  It is viewed as 
one of Canada's most important attributes, socially and 
economically.  Canadians value diversity for enriching cultural 
expression and making daily life more varied and interesting. 
Businesses and employers recognize that diversity in the 
workplace promotes innovation, stimulates teamwork and creativity 
and helps expand markets for goods and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the diversity of the population expands, new links are forged 
with the world at a time when Canadians recognize the increasing 
importance of having a credible voice in international affairs 
and strengthening our advantages in the global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada stands as proof that it is possible for women and men of 
the world's many races, religions and cultures to live together. 
We admit our problems and we work across our differences to find 
solutions.  We show the world that different people can accept 
and respect one another and work collaboratively to build one of 
the most open, resilient, creative and caring societies on earth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as a Sikh member of parliament and as the chief 
critic for multiculturalism for the official opposition of 
Canada, I am very pleased to speak in favour of Motion No. 32: 
that this House recognize the importance of April 13 to all Sikhs 
and the contributions that Canadian Sikhs have made to our 
country, and that this House also recognize the importance of the 
symbols of the Sikh religion called the five Ks, which I will be 
talking about later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate and appreciate the efforts of the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona in tabling this motion.  In 1999 the Manitoba 
legislature recognized a similar motion to commemorate the 300th 
anniversary of the birth of <I>khalsa</I>, the pure Sikhs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important that one should respect all religions, 
irrespective of one's own faith. 
According to Sikhism, a Sikh should try to become a better Sikh, 
a Hindu a better Hindu, a Christian a better Christian, a Muslim 
a better Muslim, a Jew a better Jew and so on.

with the services for the Swissair tragedy at Peggy's Cove by 
asking them not to refer to Jesus in the prayers in services,

</I></B></P><P align=left>Surrey Central, the largest constituency in Canada in 
population, has a large population of many ethnic communities, 
with a huge majority of Sikhs.  In fact, the highest 
concentration of Sikhs in the world outside India's Punjab state 
live in Surrey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sikhs are basically inhabitants of Punjab, which has about 
3% of the area and 2.5% of the population of India.  That state 
of Punjab produces over 70% of the food in the country.  Sikhs 
participated in large numbers in the British and Indian armies. 
Their contribution in the great wars, World War I and World War 
II, has been recognized by the Queen.  Of the total sacrifices 
made to get freedom for India, 97% were made by Sikhs.  Their 
contribution to the Indian Olympic teams has also been very 
significant.  Lastly, according to a recent congressional report 
in the U.S. senate, Punjabis have the highest per capita income 
and the highest per capita education level of any ethnic 
community in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of Sikhs in Canada is about 100 years old.  During 
this period, Sikhs have contributed in the making of railway 
tracks and in work in the sawmills and have made professional 
contributions in the fields of medicine, law, education, 
engineering, et cetera.  Sikhs own big businesses and industries 
and of course contribute in politics, as we see by their 
contributions in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sikhs all over the world have been renowned for their hard work, 
great courage and enterprise, but a big scar in Canadian history 
is the <I>Kamagatamaru</I> ship incident, as the hon. member from 
the NDP mentioned.  Most of the passengers on that ship were 
Sikhs who were fighting for human rights and freedom.  Because of 
their country of origin and their race, the Liberal government 
did not allow them to land on Canadian soil.  Upon the ship's 
return to India, most of the passengers were killed by the 
British army. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of Sikhs is about half a millennium old.  It starts 
with the birth of the first guru, Guru Nanak Dev Ji, who was born 
in 1469.  On April 13, 1699, at a huge gathering, with a 
glittering sword in his hand, the tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh 
Ji, gave a call for those who would protect the truth and live 
the faith even at the cost of their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first five who offered themselves to the guru were called 
<I>panj pyaras</I>, or the five beloved ones.  They were baptized 
and then were requested by the guru to admit him into the 
<I>panth</I> by administering <I>amrit</I> to him, or baptizing 
him.  About 20,000 persons took <I>amrit</I> and became members of 
the <I>khalsa panth</I> that day.  This was the birth of 
<I>Khalsa</I> and the day is called <I>Vaisakhi</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>amrit</I> is partaken of after adopting the essential five 
external Sikh symbols, called the five Ks, which are a unique 
gift from the great Guru Gobind Singh Sahib.  A Sikh is not 
supposed to part with any of these symbols. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be a member of the <I>khalsa panth</I>, all individuals, even 
the guru, had to take <I>amrit</I>, adopt the five K uniform and 
have the name Singh for a male, which means lion, and Kaur for a 
female.  Partaking of <I>amrit</I> is open to everyone, 
irrespective of caste, creed, race et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now let me talk about the five Ks I referred to. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of the five K's, the first one is <I>kes</I>, or hair. 
<I>Kes</I> is a symbol of saintliness or holiness and is 
considered an important part of the human body.  The hair of 
<I>Khalsa</I> creates a blessed appearance and outlook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guru Gobind Singh Ji said “<I>Khalsa</I> is my special form.  I 
live in the <I>Khalsa</I>”.  To keep hair intact and not meddle 
with hair is the first and foremost duty of a Sikh.  Even the 
place where baptism of five beloved ones at <I>Anadpur Sahib</I> 
took place was named <I>Kesh-Garh</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is required of every Sikh to keep his or her head covered. 
Males do it by tying a turban while females keep a big scarf 
called a <I>chunni</I> or a smaller turban called a <I>keski</I>. 
The turban is a very important part of the Sikh religious 
tradition and also a matter of huge respect, pride and honour. 
This is why Sikhs cannot be asked to remove their turbans in any 
place under any circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, oppressive Mughal emperors forcefully ordered Sikhs 
to cut their hair which resulted in Sikhs choosing to be beheaded 
rather than succumb to the orders of the oppressors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second K is for <I>kangha</I>, usually a small wooden comb. 
<I>Khalsa</I> combs the hair twice daily, ties the hair on the 
head in a topknot, sticks the <I>kangha</I> behind the knot and 
then ties the turban with pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third K is <I>kirpan</I>, a stainless steel sword that is a 
symbol of power, dignity, courage, self-confidence and faith in 
the victory of good over evil.  It is also called <I>sri 
sahib</I>.  It is a weapon of defence and not offence.  It is 
regarded as a scourge of the tyrant and the wicked.  It is used 
to provide for the protection of a good or righteous cause. 
Sikhs keep the <I>kirpan</I>, the active symbol, in a sheath and 
wear it in a belt called <I>gatra</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sikhs had to struggle to get concessions in regard to 
keeping these symbols intact as part and parcel of the 
<I>*Khalsa</I> code of conduct at all places, including the army, 
jails, flying or even on motorcycle rides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recognition of the loyal and distinguished services rendered 
by the Sikhs in the great wars to the Queen, in September 1920 
Sikhs were allowed to wear the <I>kirpan</I> even in the army both 
in uniform and in plain clothes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, Singhs used the <I>kirpan</I> to free young Hindu 
ladies who were abducted and raped in the thousands by oppressive 
rulers and traded in the market.  Sikhs freed them and returned 
them to their respective families safely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth K is <I>kara</I>, a stainless steel bracelet worn on 
the right wrist.  It reminds the Sikhs of the vows of baptism. 
Thus it prevents <I>Khalsa</I> from doing anything evil that is 
unworthy of a <I>Khalsa</I>.  Additionally, it serves the purpose 
of a shield to protect the arm while fighting with an enemy. Even 
those Sikhs who have not taken <I>amrit</I> wear <I>kara</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth K is <I>kash</I> or <I>kashehra</I>, which is underpants 
or drawers.  It is so tailored that it covers the private parts 
well and does not restrict movements of the marshall 
<I>Khalsa</I>.  It is a symbol of sexual restraint and moral 
purity.  <I>Khalsa</I> has been known for not committing adultery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the day celebrated as <I>Vaisakhi</I>, the <I>sangat</I> 
founded by the first Guru Nanak Dev Ji was transformed into the 
<I>Khalsa Panth</I>.  The mandate of the <I>Khalsa</I> is to spread 
righteousness, protect the human rights of truthful people and 
destroy tyranny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Vaisakhi</I> brings the spirit of <I>chardi kala</I>, that 
is the high spirit to the <I>Panth</I> and reminds them of their 
great heritage, self-esteem and high character.  To be a member 
of the <I>Panth</I>, one has to follow the life of 
<I>Sewa-Simran</I> and wish all humanity well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 18th century becoming a Sikh was against the law of 
the land ruled by oppressive Mughal rulers who ordered that 
anyone who could find a Sikh could chop his head off and could 
exchange that head at any police station for about one year's 
wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sikhs not only survived this elimination or genocide, but also 
before the turn of the century Sikhs became the formal rulers of 
the Punjab from Pishawar to Delhi.  The Sikhs were famous for 
their pure conduct, bravery, love for humanity and the protection 
they provided the poor and helpless, even at the cost of their 
own lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The high character of Sikhs was so popular with the people that 
even a Muslim historian, Kazi Noor Mohammed, could not help 
recognizing it and recorded it on pages 156 to 159 in his book 
<I>Jang Nama</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I congratulate the member for Winnipeg—Transcona 
for the motion and urge all members of the House to support it. 
Recognizing the importance of <I>Vaisakhi</I>, the Reform Party of 
Canada and now the Canadian Alliance, Her Majesty's Loyal 
Official Opposition of Canada, proudly celebrates <I>Vaisakhi</I> 
in parliament every year since 1998.  This year's annual 
celebration of <I>Vaisakhi</I> will be celebrated on Wednesday, 
April 4, in Room 237-C, Centre Block, from 4 to 6 p.m.  As 
always, I invite members of all parties and the public in general 
to join us in the celebration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the leader of the Reform Party was the first and only 
federal leader of any political party in Canada to visit the 
Golden Temple, the holiest shrine of the Sikhs and the Durgiana 
Mander in Amritsar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say that I am a politician and not a 
religious leader in any way.  Due to my limited knowledge, wisdom 
and time, I may have unknowingly made omissions or statements 
that may not have expressed the exact feelings or principles, for 
which I apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I am proud to end the speech with the <I>Khalsa</I>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
states do evolve over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec and Canada are no exception to this rule and one of the 
main reasons for changes in states is, of course, the 
contribution of new citizens, new communities, people different 
from us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many groups have come to Quebec and to Canada to seek a better 
life and more dignity. Some of them chose to settle here to 
escape famine or persecution or simply to try to build a better 
life for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona is giving us today the 
opportunity to talk briefly about a community that is not well 
known in Quebec, because not many of its members are living in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sikhs came to Canada toward the end of the 19th century. They 
made their way over here as members of a unit of the British 
Army. They were on their way home to India after the 
celebrations surrounding Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee when 
they chose to stay in Canada. That was probably not a bad 
choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years later, following Kind Edward VII's coronation, a 
second group arrived in Canada. All of them had a military 
background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are currently 300,000 Sikhs in Canada and the motion put 
forward by the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona asks the House 
to recognize the importance of April 13 for all Sikhs and the 
contributions that Canadian Sikhs have made to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion also reads as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that this House also recognize the importance of the five K's: 
the KIRPAN—a sword representing indomitable spirit; KES—unshorn 
hair, representing a simple life, saintliness and devotion to 
God; KARA—a steel bangle worn as a sign of the eternity of God; 
KANGA—a wooden comb worn to represent a clean mind and body; and 
KACHA—short breeches, representing hygienic living.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally have a great deal of admiration and respect for 
communities that show their attachment to the symbols that 
represent them. In the life of all people, symbols are part of 
their vitality, culture and identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context, I wish to thank the hon. member for putting 
forward this motion. Clearly, I hope that the House will 
recognize the importance of April 13, because to the Sikh 
community April 13 is what New Year's Day is to us. It is the 
first day of the new Sikh year, the <I>Vaisakhi</I>. Unfortunately, 
that is the extent of what I can read in Sikh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999, Canada Post recognized the Sikh community by issuing a 
stamp. Canada Post issues many stamps, but this one was quite 
special since it stressed the importance of the Sikh community, 
of the April 13 celebrations for that community and of the role 
that its members play in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I had to say. I hope that after today's debate, 
April 13 will be an important date for Canadians and Quebecers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to acknowledge, as part and parcel 
of the motion, the significant contribution that has been made by 
Canadian Sikhs to Canadian society and to recognize the 
importance of April 13 as the birthday of <I>Khalsa</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I extend sincere congratulations to the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona, a respected colleague, fellow House leader 
and a dean of the House of Commons, on his attempt to have the 
whole House support the particular motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you will undoubtedly be aware, Mr. Speaker, Canada has a rich 
history of diversity and one that spans many religions, cultures, 
languages and ethnicities.  I believe it is in our very best 
interest to support and celebrate each and every one of these 
diverse cultures to the extent that we recognize important 
religious heritage days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada as a whole was built upon the efforts of immigrants, 
coupled with the foundation and origins of our aboriginal 
peoples.  On this special day, April 13, Sikhs across the world 
celebrate <I>Vaisakhi</I>, the Sikh New Year.  Today in Canada we 
have close to 300,000 Sikhs.  On this day the Sikhs pay tribute 
to their faith, not unlike the Christian significance of 
Christmas, and we join in that celebration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Sikh population in my constituency of 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough is relatively small compared to 
that of more urban centres across the country, we recognize the 
contribution Sikhs make in each and every riding, in each and 
every corridor and corner of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the motion that has been presented to us by the hon. 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona for a number of reasons.  First 
and foremost, Canada's diversity is only strengthened by the 
encouragement of all religions and ethnicities to participate 
fully in Canadian society and to integrate themselves further 
into the social fabric in our economy, in our culture and in our 
way of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By supporting resolutions such as this one we are setting a 
landmark example of the acceptance of religions, ethnicities and 
cultures in Canada, again a very fundamental founding principle 
that all Canadians embrace.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I unequivocally support this motion, as do members of my 
party, as one would not question the significant contributions 
the Sikh community has made in Canada in the business sector, in 
the human rights field and in numerous other fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the early settlement of this country, Sikhs laboriously 
and reliably worked in lumber mills and yards to better their 
lives and to better the lives of those in their communities. Some 
Sikhs eventually went on to own their own mills like the Mayo 
Lumber Company and the Kapoor Lumber Company in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wealth accumulated from those particular businesses was used 
to benefit the advancement of the Sikh community on the west 
coast by building schools, temples, homes and other 
contributions.   You will be the first to agree. Mr. Speaker, 
that this type of dedication and determination is commendable and 
it is a symbol to all Canadians of innovation, perseverance and 
entrepreneurial spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this same period Sikhs were actively promoting human 
rights in their new land, not only for Sikhs in Canada but for 
Sikhs around the world.  Often we will hear about the early days 
when those in Sikh communities across this nation would raise 
money for humanitarian efforts such as natural disasters that 
occurred in their homeland or in other countries.  Their 
commitment to Sikhs in this country was also equally intense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fighting for equality, the Sikhs were diligent in overturning 
and rewriting discriminatory laws that many immigrants faced when 
arriving on our shores.  The Khalsa Diwan Society was started and 
led this immigration fight, lobbying both the Canadian government 
and the government of India for fair immigration policies.  These 
were laudable efforts and significant accomplishments.  This 
group was successful in finally working toward a more equitable 
and non-discriminatory immigration policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I truly believe that this community has worked hard to earn the 
right to call Canada their home and to be fully embraced by all 
Canadians.  We in this parliament can take a significant and 
symbolic step by embracing this motion.  I know there may be 
efforts made later to make this matter votable.  We fully endorse 
the significance that would attach by having a vote by all 
parliamentarians on this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, like all Canadians, that anyone who pays taxes, who 
abides by the laws of the land, who makes and works toward a 
better Canada deserves the respect of all of us in the Chamber. I 
say this and say it in the hope that each and every member of the 
House of Commons will see it within themselves to support this 
motion and recognize the importance of April 13 to all Sikhs and 
to further acknowledge the importance of their spiritual symbols. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Sikh community grows in numbers and they continue to 
observe and practice the customs and traditions of their new 
country, as well as their former country, I believe it is only 
appropriate that we extend this goodwill.  Through this motion 
and others like it, we can find a common meeting place that all 
Canadians, whether they be Sikh, Christian, Muslim, Jewish or 
those of any background, can take pride in having a sense of 
ownership.  Mutual understanding and respect are the keys to a 
more balanced and solid fabric in Canada.  I do not believe that 
Sikh Canadians, or any Canadians for that matter, should feel 
obliged to alter their customs or belief.  These should be a 
source of pride and a source of beauty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to record again the unequivocal support of the 
Progressive Conservative Party for this motion.  I call upon all 
members of the House to do the same.  It is with pride that the 
Progressive Conservative Party does attach itself to this 
particular motion.  As mentioned by the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona, it is a motion that originated in 
legislature of his home province.  A Progressive Conservative 
government in Manitoba embraced a similar motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians, all religions, all spiritual beliefs should be 
given this significant recognition by this, the home that all 
Canadians should look to.  The symbolism would be significant. By 
working together, a motion like this embraces the very essence of 
this country and the great culture and the cultural mosaic that 
has become the catchphrase for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My congratulations to the NDP member for bringing this motion 
forward.  He will certainly have our support on this motion.

I am to second the motion before us today sponsored by the member 
for Winnipeg—Transcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleague who represents an area that has a very 
significant population of Sikhs, I too have been blessed with the 
opportunity to represent an area where the Sikh population is 
large, active and contributes a great deal to the health and 
well-being of our whole community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my area, the constituency of Winnipeg North Centre, there are 
two <I>gurdwaras</I> that have been a source of inspiration to me 
and to our whole community.  They are the <I>gurdwara</I> of Singh 
Sabha and the Sikh Society of Manitoba.  Those two 
<I>gurdwaras</I> have played a very active role in bringing the 
community together to appreciate the cultural significance of 
Sikhism and to share with everyone the sense of spirituality that 
really signifies this community and the contributions it makes to 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too am very pleased to join with my colleagues in the House in 
recognizing the significance of the April 13 birthday and to pay 
tribute to my colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona for taking this 
initiative to bring the motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would certainly be my hope, as I am sure is a hope shared by 
colleagues from all parties in the House, that we could agree to 
support the motion with a vote of confidence and make it a 
unanimous recommendation from the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a significant moment to pay tribute to Sikhism and the 
contribution by Sikhs in the history and development of the 
country.  I certainly have felt that contribution in my community 
and value very much the sense of spirituality of Sikhs.  Their 
devotion to the values of justice, equality and dignity is very 
much a part of the faith and culture that surrounds Sikhism in 
Manitoba and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would pass the speaking over to my colleague and hope that the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to begin by thanking all members of the House who have 
contributed to this debate.  It is the kind of debate that I had 
in mind when I put forward the motion.  This is an opportunity 
for members from all parties to put on the record their views on 
the importance of April 13 with respect to the contribution of 
the Sikh community to Canada and with respect to the importance 
of the five Ks to the Sikh community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Sikh community will be able to look back on this day, 
February 20, 2001, as a day when the Canadian parliament saw fit, 
not only to debate in a consensual and harmonious way this 
particular motion, but also, as I will very shortly request, to 
go beyond that and use the powers we have through unanimous 
consent to deem the motion votable and to pass it by unanimous 
consent, which is within our power to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is somewhat unusual, and I apologize to the House for 
the unusual nature of the request, but it is not without 
precedent.  I have seen it happen on a number of occasions when 
people felt that it was a special enough occasion for us to use 
that particular power.  I think today is that kind of day.

to me as a measure that I might bring forward.  I am very 
grateful that we see the kind of unanimity we have here. Everyone 
has spoken in favour of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the motion passes, if we deem the motion votable and put the 
question, no particular burden, legislative or otherwise, will 
flow from this except that the Sikh community in this country 
will know that at this particular time in our history we were 
able to reflect on their history in Canada, to reflect on some of 
the things that were done that we wish had never been done, to 
reflect on many of the great things they have done in this 
country and finally to express ourselves as the House of Commons 
in the way that this motion suggests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that you seek unanimous consent to 
deem this motion votable.  I am not exactly sure what the 
procedure is.  I ask the House for unanimous consent that it be 
deemed votable and passed.

Winnipeg—Transcona have consent to present his motion?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona, who put Motion 
No. 32 before the House, asked for unanimous 
consent of the House to make it votable.  I want to 
point out that members of the Canadian Alliance said yes, and 
it was Liberal members who said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time provided for the 
consideration of private members' business has now expired.  As 
the motion has not been designated a votable item, the order is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to request more information on a question I asked earlier 
with respect to the Vienna Convention and the immunity for 
diplomats, which has been brought to light because of the very 
unfortunate accident in Ottawa involving a Russian diplomat which 
resulted in a fatality and the serious injury of another person 
and a pet.  It certainly put the focus of attention for all of 
Ottawa and a great deal of the country on this issue of 
diplomatic immunity and just how far diplomatic immunity extends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although for a while it did not look like the Russian diplomat 
would be charged, it now looks like there is at least a chance he 
will be charged for this fatality.  There will be an 
investigation done in Russia under article 264 of their criminal 
code, which appears to be the appropriate place for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, the problem with this issue is that the diplomat 
was known to be an abusive person and was also known to have a 
record of driving while intoxicated.  The diplomatic immunity 
that we have and need as politicians and diplomats around the 
world was used to protect this person from prosecution or even 
from discipline for driving while intoxicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we realize the Vienna Convention is very important, we 
think there are serious flaws in it and we would like the 
minister to lead the charge to change the Vienna Convention. 
Canada is not the only country to have experienced difficulties 
with diplomats who abuse the immunity rules.  We think there 
would be consensus in other countries to change the Vienna 
Convention with respect to immunity to prevent diplomats from 
abusing the system, repeatedly breaking the law and endangering 
people's lives like the Russian diplomat did in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that I believe the administration 
of the Russian embassy is partly responsible for this, because it 
knew that it had a diplomat who was acting in a dangerous manner 
and was abusive to the police every time he was stopped. 
He abused his immunity rules to protect himself when really they 
should not have been used for that purpose.  They were never 
intended for that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the minister to take the initiative to change the Vienna 
convention to prevent diplomats from abusing it in cases where 
they are endangering lives of people in other countries.  We 
think that Canada should take a leading role in spearheading the 
amendment to the Vienna convention.  We think there would be a 
great deal of support around the world for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I asked before is the same question I am asking 
now.  Will the Government of Canada spearhead an international 
initiative to change the rules on diplomatic immunity and in 
particular to stop protecting drunk and dangerous drivers?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as everyone knows, Catherine MacLean 
was killed and Catherine Doré was seriously injured in a tragic 
accident that happened in Ottawa, on January 27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The driver of the car that struck both women was Andrei Knyazev, 
a Russian diplomat who was apparently driving under the 
influence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediately after the accident the Department of Foreign Affairs 
sought a waiver of Mr. Knyazev's diplomatic immunity by the 
Russian government.  As is normally the practice in such cases, 
the Russian government refused to waive his immunity and Mr. 
Knyazev returned to Moscow on January 29. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the accident, the Minister and the Department of Foreign 
Affairs, as well as the Canadian embassy in Moscow, have been 
working hard to see that justice is done in Russia. We have just 
learned that the Russian attorney general has announced that 
criminal charges will be laid against Mr. Knyazev. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that the case is now being turned over to the 
Moscow police for investigation.  The Canadian police file on the 
accident involving Mr. Knyazev was sent directly to the Russian 
authorities through police channels on February 12.  It has now 
arrived in Moscow. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy that occurred on January 27 has led the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs to ask for an urgent review of the policies and 
procedures followed by the Department of Foreign Affairs. The 
results of this review carried out by the deputy minister will 
be made public shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department recognizes that diplomatic immunity was crucial 
to bilateral relations and allowed diplomats to appropriately 
serve their countries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to elaborate 
further on my question in the House on February 13.  It pertains 
to the whole Brazilian beef episode.  It refers to the treatment 
of Health Canada scientists.  Most significantly, it pertains to 
the very serious matter of mad cow disease in our society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without going into great detail about the whole Brazilian beef 
fiasco which is unfolding as we speak, suffice it to say the 
entire issue has highlighted the adequacy or inadequacy of 
Canada's food safety system.  It has raised serious questions 
about the ability of our government to protect Canadians from mad 
cow disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I raised on February 13 followed the fact that two 
senior Health Canada scientists spoke out in early February 
suggesting that there was no sustainable argument for singling 
out Brazilian beef products ahead of those from other countries. 
It also referred to the fact that the government chose to gag the 
scientists who had spoken out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the sequence of events, the critical issue scientists 
have raised for all of us is:  What is the state of our food 
safety system?  Are there reasons to be concerned?  What is the 
process that the government has in place for ensuring a 
completely fail-safe science based system to protect Canadians 
from mad cow disease? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Various questions have been raised.  The scientists themselves 
have asked why Brazil.  What about the beef we get from other 
countries such as Australia, Argentina, India and so on?

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other reports talk about the fact that, contrary to the minister 
of agriculture's assertion, Canada did import beef products and 
bone meal products from Britain at the very time that it knew 
about mad cow disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent reports have come out of the United States, in particular 
from a biologist associated with the U.S. consumers union, 
suggesting that Canadians may be at risk of contracting the human 
form of mad cow disease from domestic beef because current 
testing is inadequate.  Those are the questions behind the whole 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientists chose to speak out.  They were the same 
scientists who had spoken out about bovine growth hormone and 
were subsequently intimidated and gagged by this government. 
However, they pursued that case through the courts and won the 
right to speak out whenever they felt the public interest or the 
public good was in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we face the same situation, a repeat of that sad chapter 
in our history, and yet the government has not come forward with 
any explanation for gagging those scientists, let alone assure 
Canadians it has a fail-proof, science based system in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions today for the parliamentary secretary are:  Will 
the government come forward with precise details about how to 
protect Canadians from mad cow disease?  Will the government tell 
Canadians whether the precautionary principle is truly at work 
and whether scientists with expertise in the area of research on 
beef products will be included in the review of the area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians must be absolutely confident that the beef they buy in 
supermarkets is safe and that there is no reason for concern in 
terms of this very serious and dangerous disease. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a great many scientists work at 
Health Canada.  They are responsible for public health and food 
safety, but they do not all work in the area of mad cow disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the House that Health Canada and the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency each have a team of specialists who oversee 
the scientific, political and administrative aspects of this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Health Canada scientists who were recently quoted in the 
media and by the opposition member were not members of either of 
these teams. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, I have the pleasure to communicate to the 
House that an independent science advisory panel within Health 
Canada has endorsed the government's controversial decision to 
temporarily ban Brazilian beef over concerns that it may be 
contaminated with mad cow disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The science advisory board is headed by astronaut Roberta Bondar 
and composed of people with expertise in areas such as science, 
medicine and bioethics.  The board has stated that the temporary 
suspension of imports and the removal of Brazilian beef products 
are justified actions on scientific grounds. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As can be seen, the opposition member is committing a serious 
error in implying that this decision was unfounded 
scientifically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to public health, Canada has clear policies which 
are based on a scientific approach developed by experts, an 
approach supported by independent experts, as we have just seen, 
and this enables us to reduce to a minimum all known or 
apprehended threats to public health in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
