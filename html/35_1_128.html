Madam Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, constituents of 
my riding of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt are adding to 
the growing number of people who are concerned about the 
intrusion of government into the rights of ordinary, law-abiding

<P>
	This intrusion is in the form of adding to the already stringent 
gun control legislation in Canada. Canadians are clearly saying 
that we have a crime problem, not a gun problem.
<P>
	The petitioners are calling on Parliament to oppose further 
legislation for firearms acquisition and possession, and to 
provide strict guidelines and mandatory sentencing for the use 
or possession of a firearm in the commission of a violent crime.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.
<P>
	On May 3 of this year I put Question No. 47 on the Order 
Paper. It asked for information relating to the travel and 
entertainment expenses of deputy ministers in the years 1991, 
1992 and 1993. A part of the question was tabled sometime last 
week by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government House 
Leader. Since an Order for Return was issued, I am asking when 
we can expect to have the report for 1991 and 1992?

<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Madam Speaker, I know the hon. member is 
apparently dissatisfied with the very lengthy response he 
received to his important question.
<P>
	It was tabled as an Order for Return of the House and it 
applied only to the third year of the three for which he asked. 
Naturally the government is anxious to provide all the 
information it can to the hon. member. I express my concern that 
the answer was apparently incomplete when we received only 
the one year.
<P>
	I was informed that the cost of rooting out the other years is 
very substantial and that unless the hon. member is quite 
insistent on getting the answer that it would not be forthcoming 
because it would cost so much to get it.
<P>
	Might I suggest that if the hon. member is serious in wanting 
this additional information, I have no objection to getting it for 
him at some cost. I am quite prepared to request that it be 
provided.
<P>
	I would suggest that since the question has been made an 
Order for Return and the return has been tabled, it would be 
appropriate for him to put the question on the Order Paper again, 
at least in relation to the two years for which he has not received 
an adequate response. I would then instruct officials to get the 
necessary information to the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is this on the same point 
of order? This is not debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Madam Speaker, yes it is. It is not on 
debate.
<P>
	I appreciate there may be some cost associated with the 
government tabling the information in the House. However it is 
important for the Canadian people and for accountability that we 
do see the information. I would ask the government to pursue the 
information with the appropriate officials in the government.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Shall the remaining 
questions stand?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to replace the current members of 
Parliament retirement allowance plan with a pension plan that reflects the 
current norms for private sector pensions, with a maximum contribution in 
accordance with the Income Tax Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Madam Speaker, I am very pleased that we finally 
get a chance to debate this matter in the House. Yesterday trough 
day arrived and we see the important need for changes to the 
members of Parliament pension plan.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the government did not live up to its red 
book promise and make the changes before trough day 
yesterday. That certainly would have sent the signal loudly and 
clearly to the Canadian public.
<P>
	The Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act is a very 
modest statute introduced in 1952. In the last dozen years or so it 
has become really divisive. It is destructive. It is an unfair and 
detested piece of legislation in the eyes of most Canadians.
<P>
	I draw the attention of the House to a report that was just 
brought in by a commission to review allowances of members of 
Parliament. This plan was started in 1952, which is interesting 
because that is the year I arrived on the scene as well. We might 
take notice that the prime minister of the day, Louis St. Laurent, 
said they wanted to make sure what was happening in those days 
in terms of the public service made it impossible for somebody 
who was serving as a member of Parliament to provide 
adequately for his later years.
<P>
	I appreciate that pensions are good things. A pension scheme 
is not wrong at all. But this particular MP pension is a ``scheme a 
dream'' when you think about what has gone on in the last 
several years to make sure MPs look after themselves. We need 
to come up with a plan that is fair and is going to sell itself to the 
Canadian taxpayers who are funding the pension plan.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	I do not consider myself nor do I consider my friends across 
the aisle, who have just qualified for trough day yesterday to get 
an MP pension, later years. March 13 is my date coming up, and 
I make full awareness to the people of that. I mentioned it in 
Question Period the other day. If the government does choose to 
put in MP pension reform I find it very strange that it would do it 
to its own members to make sure that they were in safe as of 
November 21. I have a feeling that it is going to make changes 
before March 13 so that I may be set up as the fall guy. I do not 
mind being set up as the fall guy if there are going to be 
substantive changes to the pension plan. We want to see that.
<P>
	I am being assured by my friend across the aisle that they will 
look after that or they will look after me. Nothing makes me 
more nervous than having Liberals say that they are going to 
look after me. I will look forward to any remarks in the future 
from the member for Kingston and the Islands when he 
discusses this plan I am sure later.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8079"> 8079 </A></B>
<P>
	I might also mention that my friend from Kingston and the 
Islands will qualify if he lives to age 75 and all goes well for him 
and he will stand to gain $1,061,976. That is not a bad pay out at 
all.
<P>
	You can see that this is a rather touchy subject across the aisle, 
Madam Speaker, and you are on the list as well of benefiting.
<P>
	Yesterday the class of '88 qualified for ``Lotto for Life'', 
reveals editorial comments across the country. We saw 
yesterday such descriptions as outrageous, gold plated, golden 
parachute, inflation proof, pension paradise and probably the 
most descriptive and graphic of all, hog heaven.
<P>
	I know there are many members across the aisle right now 
who are just dreaming of the day when they qualify for hog 
heaven. They need to be re-elected one more time.
<P>
	Is this divisive, is it destructive and is it detested? Yes to all of 
the above. This does more to divide parliamentarians and 
taxpayers who pay the bills for these parliamentarians probably 
than anything else. We see that this is a system in which 
members of Parliament are totally exempt from everyone else in 
the country. As my friends know, many of them have been in 
other professions before. They will know clearly that this 
pension plan is more, bigger, better, higher, everything else, 
overbloated, than any pension plan they could have ever bought 
into when they were working in the private sector. They know it, 
we know it and the people who pay our bills know it.
<P>
	My friend across the aisle says that is not true. There is not a 
pension plan in this country that pays dividends of 
employer-employee ratios of approximately six to one. I would 
like to bet on that and I am looking forward to the members 
bringing that to our attention in debate as well as proof.
<P>
	We are demanded in this country as parliamentarians to put in 
11 per cent of our earnings. We have no options on that. We must 
put in 11 per cent of our salary toward the MP pension plan.
<P>
	I am a member of the Alberta Teachers Association and we put 
in $92 a month to our pension plan. That was in the regular 
private sector. I am forced by the Members of Parliament 
Retiring Allowances Act to put in just under $600 a month out of 
my salary. Somehow that means that we are putting in a lot but 
the government kicks back far more than it puts in. For instance 
in Canada we are demanded, as I just said, to put in 11 per cent of 
our earnings. It is mandatory, there are no options about that. We 
qualify then for a minimum pension after six years of service. 
Madam Speaker, you know that, I know that and the Canadian 
taxpayers who pay the bills know that. As of age 60 it is fully 
indexed to the cost of living allowance-very expensive.
<P>
	Let us look at the United Kingdom. Its members put in a 6 per 
cent contribution level and are eligible after age 55 or age 60 
plus years of service equalling 80. That looks  very fair. Most of 
them are full time. I suspect anyone in public life serves full 
time regardless of the number of hours they put in a week.
<P>
	Let us look at the United States. People who serve in Congress 
in the United States have to put in a 1.3 per cent contribution 
level. They qualify at minimum age and serve age 62 or age 50 
plus 20 years of service. This looks like something that is a little 
fairer, a little more level than the pension plan that we have now.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	I suspect from the amount of noise across the aisle perhaps we 
have touched a raw nerve here. That is fine. Touch nerves we 
will.
<P>
	The plan that the premier of Alberta has just brought in has in 
effect blitzed members of the legislative assemblies. My friend 
across asked me to talk about double dipping. We are against 
double dipping. When you are in one level of government, you 
may not collect a pension for another level of government.
<P>
	We are asking this government to make sure that it follows its 
red book promises. I suspect these will turn out to be red face 
book promises very soon.
<P>
	The members of Parliament retiring allowances plan simply 
must be replaced. There are two aspects to this, the first is the 
retiring allowances act which lets members contribute up to 2 
per cent years of service on earnings on the limit up to 75 per 
cent. This first account under the whole retirement allowance 
plan qualifies as a registered retirement allowance plan under 
the Income Tax Act. That is fine, nobody has any problems with 
that, I suspect even new MPs in the House.
<P>
	If the MP pension plan were restricted to this first account, the 
taxpayer would not complain because our plan would then 
conform to normal public service plans. The problem is the 
second part of this, the retiring compensation arrangement 
account, the RCA. I am reminded of the old ad, they really are 
now RCA victors as of yesterday. That is the account that leads 
one to question the judgment and fiscal integrity of those who 
put it in place and subsequently defended it.
<P>
	This account draws contributions from members in the 
government that exceed the 6 per cent limits prescribed by the 
Income Tax Act. I have one word for that, shame. Shame on a 
government that would continue to do that and bring it in. It pays 
benefits prior to the age and length of service required by the 
Income Tax Act to allay accusations of one set of tax laws for 
ordinary Canadians and a different set of tax laws for 
parliamentarians.
<P>
	The pretence is that these payments are as is said in the study, 
a retirement compensation allowance to compensate members 
for the volatile tenure of their jobs. There is not a job in this 
country that does not have volatile tenure. This is one of them 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8080"> 8080 </A></B>
<P>
but this is certainly not the only job in the country that has 
volatile tenure for sure.
<P>
	I am splitting my time with the member for Calgary West, and 
therefore I would like to just finish up by saying that this 
program is wrong. It needs to be changed. The government 
promised it would change it. It did not do it by November 21, 
trough day. Come on, colleagues, this is the time to take action 
on this. Let us do the honourable thing. Let us make sure that we 
get this thing changed. It is unfortunate it has lost so much 
credibility with the Canadian public and taxpayers. Now is the 
time to get our trotters out of the trough. It has to be very soon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, we intended to 
announce prior to the first speech of the member for Beaver 
River that we would be splitting our time on this debate, 10 
minutes each. We would like to put that request in now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am rather surprised that there are so few questions while there 
were so many while the hon. member was speaking.
<P>
	In any case, I am rising to discuss the MP pension plan and 
just to summarize the obscenity of this plan as the hon. member 
for Beaver River pointed out. There is a benefit rate of 5 per 
cent, two and a half times the average in the private sector. There 
is virtual full indexation, 78 per cent of private plans have no 
automatic indexation whatsoever. Age of retirement based on 
years of service, could be at any age, could be as young as 24. 
Ninety-one per cent of all private sector pensions have a 
retirement age of 65. Contributions are well in excess of 
anything allowed under the Income Tax Act and there is the 
ability to have another federal job while collecting the pension.
<P>
	All of these things are opposed by the Reform Party and have 
been opposed for some years now. Our blue book makes clear 
that we would change virtually all aspects of this plan including 
the fact that present beneficiaries of the plan should share in part 
of the costs of those changes.
<P>
	Let us recognize that under the present plan we have 
accumulated a liability of $220 million that is growing rapidly 
and this liability can barely be touched unless some of these 
changes are applied to present beneficiaries and to those who are 
presently qualified. Some will reply that this is unfair on a 
number of grounds and I want to address those changes to really 
understand the nature of that kind of argument.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	First of all, the statement that this would be retroactive is not 
true. Retroactive changes are changes to law at a prior time and 
no one is suggesting that. We are suggesting that there would be 
retrospective changes which legally speaking are changes that 
would only affect the future consequences or only affect the 
future expectations of law from a prior time which is common to 
virtually all legislation.
<P>
	It has also been suggested that these are contractual 
obligations that are somehow sacrosanct. There is no 
contractual obligation here. Let us be absolutely clear about 
that. The MP pension plan is a legislative privilege. Section 42 
of the Federal Interpretation Act makes it clear that Parliament 
has the authority to revoke, restrict or modify any privilege or 
advantage by repealing or amending the statute that granted that 
privilege.
<P>
	The MP pensions were not entered into on a voluntary or 
commercial basis. There were not even two parties in this case. 
This is a case of politicians voting something for themselves, 
something that there was absolutely no reasonable expectation 
that their contributions would give them.
<P>
	It has been suggested that it would somehow be inherently 
unfair to make MPs change their pension plan. In response to 
that I believe fully and our party believes fully that 
contributions should be protected. To the extent that MPs have 
contributed the value of those contributions should be protected. 
Let us also be clear that contributions to the plan account for less 
than 20 per cent of the benefit. There is absolutely no fairness in 
providing such a windfall benefit at the expense of taxpayers.
<P>
	In terms of charter arguments there would be absolutely no 
evidence, notwithstanding the pleadings of the Deputy Prime 
Minister, that members of Parliament or politicians in general 
constitute a disadvantaged group in our society.
<P>
	There is no fairness also in suggesting that all of the reduction 
in pension benefits should fall upon those who are serving now 
or who may serve in the future. There is no fairness in my view 
in suggesting that future or present MPs, once the rules are 
changed, should be treated differently than past MPs. That kind 
of objection goes more broadly to a philosophy that states that 
only younger people should pay the costs of the present financial 
situation in the country, an implication that I reject entirely.
<P>
	What are the implications of the kind of argument against 
these changes and these retrospective changes? What these 
people are really saying is that we can change virtually any plan 
in this country but not the MP pension plan. The previous 
government changed old age security to provide a clawback. 
This Liberal government has not seen fit to change that. 
Previous governments changed their obligations on equalization 
payments to the provinces. They changed their obligations and 
payments in health, in post-secondary education, none of which 
this government has reversed. This government has also made it 
clear that it is contemplating changes to RSPs, so far as to even 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8081"> 8081 </A></B>
<P>
contemplate confiscation in some cases of certain portions of 
private savings.
<P>
	Yet the argument would go that MP pension plans are 
somehow sacrosanct. This is a completely untenable position. It 
is another example of the House of Commons suggesting that it 
should protect itself above all else. Just as we see today where 
the procedure and House affairs committee is suggesting that we 
should protect the size of the House of Commons from 
reduction, we should not share in the general downsizing of 
government here, we are seeing a similar argument with the MP 
pension plan.
<P>
	The Prime Minister early in this Parliament promised or said 
that MPs should be able to opt out of the plan. As the member for 
Beaver River pointed out, we are now paying 11 per cent of our 
gross salary which only covers less than 20 per cent of the plan 
to pay for the extravagant pensions of those who are already 
receiving it. This is something we as Reformers object to. Of 
course we would like to see a fair plan but we are prepared to 
arrange for our own private savings.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	The question is: Why is the Prime Minister delaying? I 
believe it was August 3, 1993 that the present Prime Minister 
called on Kim Campbell to recall the House of Commons and 
make changes to the MP pension plan and he wanted it done in 
one day. He said it could be done in one day. Now 400 days later 
nothing has been done and nothing in particular has been done 
on his promise to allow MPs to opt out of the plan.
<P>
	Why is he so reluctant? The reason is very simple. The Prime 
Minister knows he made a mistake in suggesting that MPs could 
opt out of the plan. He knows full well that if any MP in this 
House opted out of such an obscene and indefensible 
arrangement the political pressure on other MPs would virtually 
force every other member of Parliament within one term to drop 
out of the plan if they were considering seeking re-election. The 
Prime Minister knows that.
<P>
	I urge government members not to be so critical and to read 
the motion. The motion is quite reasonable. In principle it is not 
unlike what the government itself suggested during the election. 
I would suggest that government members consider this very 
carefully. Forget the fact that some of them have big dollar signs 
in their eyes now and in their dreams. Just remember that the 
motion is quite reasonable, vote for it and indicate to the 
Canadian people that all parties are prepared to make a change to 
this unjustifiable arrangement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a question for either the hon. member for Beaver 
River or the hon. member for Calgary West.
<P>
	Accept for argument's sake that in juridical terms what we are 
dealing with is not a constitutional right, because unlike the 
United States constitution the Canadian Constitution has no 
contract clause. We are dealing with a constitutional privilege.
<P>
	Is it the thrust and intent of the motion not merely to cover 
presently operating privileges as to pensions but those that 
might be said to be in a private law sense to have already vested, 
that is to say, contracts already entered into? The argument as 
presented would seem to suggest that this should apply both 
retrospectively and prospectively in the full sense. I wonder if 
that is in fact the intent and purpose of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate 
the question.
<P>
	The member for Vancouver Quadra will understand that today 
we are not discussing a formal amendment or legislation but 
merely a motion that we bring the MP pension arrangement into 
line with private sector standards.
<P>
	In terms of my own address I was talking specifically about 
broader Reform Party policy which has suggested that changes 
to the MP pension plan should apply retrospectively as well as 
prospectively. Once again I would defend that very clearly on a 
number of grounds. The most important is that this was not a 
voluntary transaction and not a transaction with any defensible 
commercial basis. Any privileges that have been gained through 
this legislation well above and beyond what could be expected 
from MPs' own contributions should not be protected in law, not 
for past members nor for future members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
note my colleague said in his address that over 400 days ago the 
Prime Minister had said he was going to make a change to the 
MPs pension plan. By way of comment I draw to the attention of 
the House that he cancelled a multibillion contract on 
helicopters just like that. He cancelled the Pearson airport deal 
which was in the hundreds of millions of dollars just like that.
<P>
	I wonder if the member has any idea why in the world the 
Prime Minister would not have done something about the MPs 
pension plan when it is the number one item on the hit parade. 
The people in my constituency tell me and other members in my 
party tell me that when they get to their constituencies it is the 
number one issue that stands between them and their 
constituents in spite of the fact that our party is attempting to do 
something about it.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	I find it absolutely amazing that there are only 52 members in 
this House of Commons who find that to be true. I wonder if that 
is possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I cannot read 
the Prime Minister's mind but it is evidently clear that within 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8082"> 8082 </A></B>
<P>
the government caucus there is more support for preservation of 
the MP pension plan than for respective certain private and 
voluntary contracts.
<P>
	In the case of the cancellation of the helicopters the 
government has fulfilled its contractual obligations. Of course 
in the case of the cancellation of the Pearson airport, the 
government is actually trying to block the right of those people 
involved in that contract to even seek some kind of 
compensation through a court process. That seems particularly 
ridiculous when in the case of the MP pensions it is fairly clear 
from my office's study that if retrospective changes were to be 
taken to court there would be very little likelihood that MPs 
would be successful in achieving these gross privileges they had 
voted themselves in the past.
<P>
	I cannot entirely explain the government's motivation, but I 
would repeat once again for the hon. member and for other 
members across the way that it would be in the interests of all 
parliamentarians if the government would vote for the motion 
and proceed on a plan that gave realistic and defensible benefits 
to members of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure this morning to address the 
House on this opposition motion presented by the member for 
Beaver River.
<P>
	The motion says that this House urges the government to 
replace the current members of Parliament retirement allowance 
plan with a pension plan that reflects the current norms for 
private sector pensions with a maximum contribution in 
accordance with the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Perhaps before discussing the content of the motion itself we 
could spend a moment talking about what brought us to this 
discussion today. I have a theory and members across are free to 
disagree with it. I believe it is reasonably easy still, although 
somewhat less than it was a year ago, to bash anyone in public 
office. Perhaps that is fair game. We certainly should not be 
immune to criticism, all of us who have chosen to seek public 
office or to serve in this very honourable House.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> We are not bashing; we are bashees as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Now we are going to justify 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I see I have already provoked 
a few cat calls from across the way. I also am of the opinion that 
the mistakes of previous governments, particularly one regime 
that was turfed out, should not be equated with criticism against 
the institution itself or those who now serve in it.
<P>
	I believe firmly in what I call the John Diefenbaker way of 
looking at it. There is no greater honour for a Canadian than to 
serve his or her fellow citizens in the highest court in the land, 
the Parliament of Canada. I have said this in previous 
Parliaments and I will say it again in this one.
<P>
	I came to Parliament Hill on October 25, 1966 as a busboy. I 
am very proud of the fact that I managed to climb more rungs in 
the ladder than those who started in the middle of it. I am very 
fond of that and I am not ashamed of that background. On the 
contrary, I use it to illustrate what a great country this is when 
someone can start with such humble beginnings and end up a 
member of Parliament. In my case I am presently the chief 
government whip, thanks to the decision of the Prime Minister 
on September 15.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> We are talking about pensions here.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The member across the way says she is talking 
about pensions. I know exactly what she is talking about. She is 
talking about the compensation offered to MPs, those things that 
bring us to Parliament and those benefits that are accorded after 
one leaves. That is exactly what I am talking about as well.
<P>
	There is a one man band in this country, the David Somerville 
band. The one man band calls itself the National Citizens' 
Coalition. It is not national and it is not a citizens' coalition. It 
has nothing to do with anything of the sort. It is a business 
operated by one person who puts ads in the newspapers inviting 
Canadians to give him money. He says he is going to use that 
money to buy some more newspaper ads to fight the causes he 
says he is fighting. How much money is that person paid? No 
one knows. How much money do Canadians give him to fight 
these causes which he says are legitimate? No one knows that 
either.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Members opposite are saying this is not someone who holds 
public office. I never said he was. In fact, I made it clear at the 
beginning of my speech that he had his own business. I did not 
say he held public office; hon. members opposite should have 
listened more carefully.
<P>
	This individual takes advantage of the Canadian people, who 
are often taken in by his malicious attacks against those who 
serve in this House, and he puts ads with little pigs in the 
newspaper, urging people to send them money. That is his way of 
getting rich, not his way of defending the interests of Canadians. 
Let us be clear about his agenda.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> We are talking about MPs pensions from the 
inside.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The hon. member across is heckling that we are 
talking about MPs pensions. I am talking about the guy who put 
the ad in the paper about the MPs pensions, if the member was 
listening.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8083"> 8083 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform Act of 1830 in Britain was passed to do 
essentially three things and it is part of our Constitution in 
Canada. It was passed to widen the franchise to enable more 
people in Britain to participate in the democratic process. It was 
also passed to do away in large measure with what were called 
rotten boroughs and to enable different constituencies to have 
equivalent representation or close to it in the British House of 
Commons. Also it was to give salaries to members of Parliament 
in Britain so that not only the rich could be MPs. Not only the 
rich. That is an important issue.
<P>
	The member across keeps heckling that is salaries. A salary is 
part of what an MP gets to do his or her job in this place.
<P>
	Some years ago when the same Mr. Somerville put one of his 
ads in the newspaper I challenged him. I appeared in a television 
debate with him. I demonstrated to him that I had served as a 
civil servant for many years and when I had withdrawn from the 
civil service pension plan I was forced, and I say forced, to 
withdraw my contributions to the plan.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> You cannot do that with this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Yes, as a matter of fact one has to withdraw 
their contribution if one has not reached the amount required to 
obtain a benefit. The member is completely wrong.
<P>
	I was forced to withdraw my contributions to the plan without 
interest, or I think I received 2 per cent. That was in 1981 when 
the interest rate was something like 18 per cent but I received 2 
per cent on the money I had invested. I put that in a registered 
retirement account.
<P>
	I debated with Mr. Somerville and said: ``Mr. Somerville, I 
will make a deal with you. If you think my MP pension plan is so 
great, you can run against me in my riding and if you think your 
plan is so great maybe the people will vote for you. 
Alternatively, I challenge you to do the following. Let us 
calculate it and see, Mr. Somerville, if a registered retirement 
savings plan given to MPs''-which is what he was advocating 
at the time with employer-employee contributions-``would be 
richer or poorer than what we have now''. I challenged him. I 
said: ``Do it for me. If your plan ends up being better than what I 
would get out of a retirement plan of the kind we now have for 
MPs, I will resign''. It was the opposite. In fact I could easily 
demonstrate that in my case I lost quite a bit.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Is the challenge still on?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The member across used figures selectively a 
while ago. When referring to the member for Kingston and the 
Islands she said that he was eligible for a given amount of 
pension, therefore this was an unfunded liability of some 
millions of dollars, which she demonstrated.
<P>
	That is hopelessly wrong for a number of reasons and 
members across know it. First of all, the unfunded liability is 
based on two premises. One, that the person would retire 
immediately and live until age 75, which may be the case. Of 
course, not too many members have resigned yet today even 
though it so-called trough day for 52 of them.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> They qualify now. It is kick-in day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> If the member across will stop interrupting just 
for a minute or so, she will know that the second proposition is 
even more important. That is the fact that the whole unfunded 
liability business is based on the assumption that no new 
member would ever be re-elected to make contributions toward 
the plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> It is so different now that 
we are Liberal, eh? Now that we are government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I do not know what the people across are 
advocating, but I personally am not proposing to end 
parliamentary democracy in Canada today. I would imagine that 
whatever plan there is, there will be new people to contribute to 
it and that the unfunded liability is just a bunch of nonsense 
perpetrated by Mr. Somerville and now-
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Do you challenge Mr. Somerville again today?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I have challenged Somerville many times. I 
have debated him on television. Members across have seen this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Unsuccessfully.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Now that we are 
government things have changed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> That is not to say that we should not amend the 
member of Parliament retirement plan. As a matter of fact, in the 
book ``Creating Opportunity'', we have said the following:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The pension regime of members of Parliament has been the focus of 
considerable controversy. It is now the subject of an independent review.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Members opposite asked what the government is waiting for. 
Two studies were ordered: one, under the previous government, 
was the statutory review conducted after each election, and the 
other one was done by the former Prime Minister. We were 
waiting for the results of these two studies. We have received 
them, and the Prime Minister said he would table amendments in 
the House.
<P>
	I will read some more from the red book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is now the subject of an independent review, which Liberals support. We 
believe that reform is necessary.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whatever the results of the independent review, a Liberal government will 
reform the pension plan of members of Parliament to end ``double dipping''. 
Members of Parliament should not be able to leave office and receive a pension 
from the federal government if they accept a new full-time paying job from the 
federal government.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8084"> 8084 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is an important point. How many of the members who are 
making these remarks today have said that some members of 
Parliament are receiving pensions from the federal government 
and are here as MPs. That is double dipping.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> No, it is not.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> No. You are an MP first. It is when you are an MP 
first. That it is double dipping.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> How about those who used to work, not to name 
them, for Transport Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Can you redefine double 
dipping?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> That is an interesting proposition. I just heard 
the member across say that someone who is an MP first cannot 
double dip to be a civil servant later, but that someone who got a 
public service pension first can double dip and be an MP later. 
That is what I just heard the member for Beaver River say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> You have to get elected first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> If that argument works for you, Madam 
Speaker, it does not work for me. It is illogical. A double dipper 
is a double dipper is a double dipper as far as I am concerned. If 
we are to end double dipping, it applies whether someone is a 
general, a colonel, an employee of Transport Canada, a retired 
MLA or anyone else.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Or a busboy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Double dipping is double dipping. If that 
displeases the hon. member for Beaver River-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> That is not what the red book 
says.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The red book says clearly that there should be 
no double dipping from the federal administration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Give it up, Don. You are losing, Don.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> We will see a little later how some MPs in this 
House react when the government's initiative is announced.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, I want to talk about the salaries of those who serve in 
this House and compare them with salaries in other professions. 
We already know that according to a study by the OECD, 
Canadian parliamentarians are paid the lowest salaries of any 
G-7 country.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	We also know that, in Ontario, mayors of large or 
medium-sized municipalities earn anything from $63,000 to 
$155,000, police chiefs make $90,000 a year, school principals 
in Toronto, $88,000, company officers $90,000 in small 
companies, $98,000 in slightly larger ones and $118,000 in large 
companies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In terms of professionals here are some salaries: journalists, 
$60,000; accountants, self-employed, $76,000; lawyers, 
$98,600-
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> What do they get for pension?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> -dentists, $108,400; judges, $112,100; and 
doctors, self-employed, $121,100. That is the cash 
compensation. If we include other benefits such as pension 
contributions they vary and bring some of these salaries I have 
just listed as high as $139,000 and $144,000 in some of the 
executive positions.
<P>
	I thank the member for Beaver River for heckling that 
particular one. I would not have thought of bringing the total 
compensation to public attention.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to read from two editorials, Madam Speaker. The 
member opposite said that every editorial writer was against the 
members of Parliament retirement plan. I submit to you that it is 
not the case. Let me share the following with you.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This editorial from the February 27, 1992 <I>Hill Times</I> says: 
``The Canadian legislator has long since given way to the 
professional politician. Without an adequate salary and pension 
plan the only people who would apply for the job today would be 
the wealthy, the well networked corporate union types, the 
weak-willed who would use the position to line their own 
pockets''. That is what one editorial said.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to read this other commentary, which is dated 
November 21, 1994. It was signed by Dr. Clinton Archibald, 
political scientist and professor at the University of Ottawa. In a 
piece entitled ``Nos riches politiciens'' (Our Rich Politicians), 
he states that the problem with the charges made by the coalition 
is that they rest on the premise that it would be to the advantage 
of the public not to pay its elected representatives well; if that 
were the case, we would have only one class of members in 
Parliament: already well-off individuals representing money 
interests only or aspiring to do so to compensate for their slender 
income.
<P>
	Not all editorial writers, not all Canadians are against paying 
a decent salary to their elected representatives. Yes to pension 
reform. The Prime Minister announced that it was forthcoming. 
Yes to all of that, but no to holding the position that all 
parliamentarians should be entitled to is a paltry salary, paltry 
compensation, thereby allowing only the rich to be represented 
in Parliament.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8085"> 8085 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Are amendments necessary? Yes. Are we going to make 
changes? Yes. Should MPs be paid less? No. MPs should be paid 
a decent salary to do the work that is necessary to be done. I do 
not apologize for working hard for my constituents. They pay 
me well for it. I work hard for them.
<P>
	We announced in the book ``Creating Opportunity'' that we 
were going to change the plan and we will. Therefore, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word 
``reflects'' and by substituting therefor the words:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``the commitment made in the document entitled ``Creating Opportunity, the 
Liberal plan for Canada''''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would advise the hon. 
government whip that I will reserve my decision on the 
acceptability of his amendment and I will come back to him in a 
very few minutes.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened in great agony to the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. While I was listening it 
reminded me of the days when I was a young lad working on a 
farm in central interior B.C. My job that summer was to clean 
out the stables. Listening to the hon. member speak, what he was 
saying bore a huge resemblance to what I was throwing out of 
the stables that summer.
<P>
	I want to touch on a couple of points. The hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell made a statement that there is no 
greater honour than to serve the people. He referred to the right 
hon. prime minister of the past, Mr. Diefenbaker. I would say 
that there is no greater disgrace in the House of Commons than 
the MPs' pension plan as it currently stands.
<P>
	We may serve this House as MPs with the honour of serving 
the people, but that is counteracted. Any pride we may feel in 
this House is counteracted by this obscene MPs' pension plan. 
But this government refuses to change it. It says it is going to do 
it. When the Prime Minister was in opposition he said he could 
do it in a day. Now 400 days later we are wondering how long his 
and his government's days are.
<P>
	The hon. member who just spoke, and I would like to just put 
this on record, has been in the House 10 years. If my arithmetic 
is right, and we will give him the benefit of the doubt, he has 
probably contributed about $75,000 to the pension plan, 
averaging $7,500 a year. If he retired tomorrow, and let this go 
on the record for all the people of Canada to see, for a $75,000 
investment he would collect $2,152,672. Such a deal, such a 
deal. It is no wonder the Liberals do not want to change the 
pension plan.
<P>
	The hon. member also referred to the NCC. He said the 
Canadian people were vulnerable to malicious, hugely 
disparaging ads by the NCC that exposed this pension plan. 
What the Canadian people are most vulnerable to is the constant 
cash grabs by the government to pay for these things. That is 
what they are most vulnerable to.
<P>
	Let us clarify this double dipping phrase once and for all. 
Obviously the member opposite is very confused about what the 
Canadian people think about double dipping. That is not 
surprising. This government has a habit of not listening to the 
Canadian people. The Canadian people hate double dipping 
which specifically refers to someone who serves in the House of 
Commons for six, ten or fifteen years, is paid reasonably well as 
an MP and then is eligible to collect this gold-plated pension.
<P>
	They collect the pension. As a matter of fact, the hon. member 
has been here 10 years and he could collect a pension of $33,540 
a year starting next month. The member retires and of course his 
Liberal pals are still in government. What happens is he gets 
appointed to a key government position. Now he gets a salary 
from the same government he just retired from. He is getting 
$33,540 a year in pension and now he is eligible to get whatever 
in his new job.
<P>
	That is double dipping. Let us be clear about what Canadians 
think of double dipping.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	I am sure that today is going to be a fun day on this subject. I 
encourage more comments from the Liberals although they have 
an indefensible case. I am sure there will be some more rhetoric 
and more stable waste coming from the other side of the House 
today before we are through.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I will try to be polite with the 
member in spite of what he has just said. I do not think his 
questions are horse manure. He has a right to ask whatever he 
wants no matter how objectionable I privately think his 
questions are.
<P>
	I was asked if I contributed approximately $75,000 in capital 
to the MPs pension plan. That is probably true. I have no idea. I 
never counted it. We can phone some place in the comptroller's 
office and someone can tell us. It could be true.
<P>
	He would however not take into account interest accumulated 
on capital. If one added that based on the basic five-year GIC 
rate, I would suspect that the $75,000, if it is the proper amount, 
is probably worth somewhere between $150,000 to $200,000 
right now. Even invested in a GIC, that amount would generate 
probably $15,000 or $12,000 a year. I do not know what it would 
generate. That is not the point.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8086"> 8086 </A></B>
<P>
	The point is that I am not retiring. I know it saddens members 
across the way, but I will not quit. I am not retiring. I was not 
elected to retire. I was elected to serve. Maybe that is a concept 
that shocks members.
<P>
	I can understand why Reformers are just a little defensive 
concerning double dipping. They say it is okay for someone to 
receive a federal government pension and to serve in the House 
at full salary later but not the other way around. Could the reason 
why the argument is presented in that way by them is because 
they have dissension in their caucus with at least three double 
dippers at the federal level that I know of, two of whom are 
sitting in the Chamber right now as I make this speech. 
Duplicity, thy name is Reform.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will try to bring a civil tone to this debate. I absolutely agree 
with the hon. member that it is an honourable calling to serve the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	Yesterday I was in a high school in my constituency. As I was 
in a junior high school telling people about the honourable 
calling that I had undertaken and trying to get these young 
people involved in the democratic process, this subject was 
raised by the students.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member that he should be proud of 
working his way up the ladder. I suggest to the hon. member that 
all members work hard for the people of Canada. Why is it then 
that the government side refuses to make these changes within a 
responsible, reasonable time when the Prime Minister, then the 
opposition leader, said in August 1993 that he was going to be 
making the changes. However he does not do it but he does wipe 
out contracts worth billions of dollars, making all sorts of 
changes.
<P>
	When the member says the NCC is simply conducting 
malicious attacks against members, I suggest that the NCC is 
drawing to Canadians' attention the fact that the members have a 
gold-plated plan that is unacceptable.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would agree that perhaps his way of 
handling the problem would be for the legislature to outlaw 
criticism of the pension plan? Therefore we could get on with 
life. Is that the way we should do things?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Time has almost 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I will be very brief. I know 
that this hon. member knows much better than what he has just 
said. I have the highest respect for that member. He knows that 
no one is advocating that Mr. Somerville does not have the right 
to state the nonsense he is stating. He has absolutely that right. 
This is a democracy. But I also have the right to say what I think 
of him just as he has the right to say what he thinks of all of us. I 
will continue to do that because that is my right. We have not 
refused to deal with this issue.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Members will know of the two reports presented in the last 
Parliament and they will know of the Prime Minister's 
commitments, some of which were made as late as yesterday in 
the House of Commons. The member knows deep down what the 
Prime Minister said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Four hundred days.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The member will know that approximately half 
of that time was taken up with the two reports, one ordered by 
the previous government and the other one which is statutory. In 
any event it is going to be done.
<P>
	I do not know whether it will please the people across the way. 
It will perhaps please that member.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> It will please the people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Not all of them. Certainly I will make one 
guess. It is going to make a few double dippers angry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, don't we have an interesting debate going today? It is 
funny how the affairs of men have changed when they become 
government, isn't it?
<P>
	We listen to the hon. member justify how hard he works, 
which is important, and how he justifies living off the Canadian 
taxpayer through the pension plan. I am going to address double 
dipping, among other things.
<P>
	Perhaps Liberal Party members could ask themselves what is 
the difference between the MP pension plan and Lotto 649. The 
difference is risk. There is risk in getting Lotto 649, a payment 
for life, but there is none in the MP pension plan. Are there not 
all kinds of taxpayers out there ready and willing to pay now?
<P>
	I want to address the red book and the blue book for a moment. 
We have heard so much about this red book. Canadians should 
think back to how long they have been hearing about this red 
book. They have been hearing about it since the election. It was 
written during the election to sell taxpayers on what they wanted 
to hear.
<P>
	The blue book is the Reform policy document. Canadians 
have been hearing about it for years. That is the difference 
between a party of commitment and a party that wants to come to 
Ottawa and sell the folks on an election every five years. That is 
the difference.
<P>
	Now that they are the government, here we go. We are going 
to hear more speeches from these folks. We are going to hear all 
about how we can justify through hard work a pension plan.
<P>
	There were a number of major issues during the last election. I 
would suggest the finances of the country was the number one 
issue. Other issues were the criminal justice system, the 
problems with immigration and the fact that Parliament needed 
an overhaul through things like recall and free votes and so on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8087"> 8087 </A></B>
<P>
	There were two issues that the people put before the 
politicians. One of them was the Senate. The people were 
saying: ``Either toss that group out or elect them''. The other 
issue was: ``What about MP pensions?''
<P>
	We have elected the Liberals. We have a majority 
government. What are the Liberals going to do? They have put 
three, count them, of their party hacks in the Senate. I 
congratulate the Liberals. They have done exactly what the 
Canadian people did not want. Now we hear today about the 
Governor General's appointment. I believe he has some 
affiliation with the Liberal Party.
<P>
	The second issue was the MP pension plan. Virtually every 
Canadian told politicians to do away with it. What happened? 
The Liberals said they were going to study it for a year. What do 
the Liberals over there have to study? We already know what is 
wrong with it.
<P>
	There was reference to the study. By the way, that study was 
supposed to cost around $150,000. I could have provided the 
service for very little. It finally ended up costing, if you can 
believe it, a little over $200,000. One can check the firm who did 
it to see if they have any affiliation or made any contributions to 
the Liberal Party. I know what the relationship is.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Here we are at trough day yesterday with 52 who are already 
jumping into the trough. What have they told the taxpayers? 
Where are they over there?
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> The one that supports MP pensions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The one who supports MP 
pensions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am quite sure the hon. 
member is well aware that we do not refer to the presence or the 
absence of members in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I love a 
crowd, that is all.
<P>
	We have told the people in Canada that we are going to ignore 
the Senate. We will do what we want on that, although they 
wanted some changes in it during the election. We are going to 
ignore the MP pension plan. We are going to make some very 
small changes to it. Just watch, when the changes come out to 
the pension plan and see what we get. We have got 52 already 
qualified, so they will do all right.
<P>
	I have actually had some personal experience in developing 
pension plans. I have developed a pension plan. It is a money 
purchase plan. It is significantly different than a defined benefit 
plan. I do not want to get into the details because I do not want to 
take the time. I am having too much fun having a little 
discussion on some of the other things.
<P>
	I want to talk about the defined benefit plan for a minute. I 
will read for clarification. They calculate pension benefit 
payments according to a defined formula. That is what is 
basically and inherently wrong with this MPs pension plan:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These kinds of plans become more difficult for employers to administer. 
Uncertainty in financial markets, changing rules and regulations and problems in 
dealing with actuarial surpluses and liabilities have made defined benefit plans 
consistently more risky.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Indexing, cost of living increases and so on lead to a deficit in 
the MP pension plan. We have to make up a deficit, of course, at 
some time or another. That is another whole lesson these folks 
have to learn. They are not doing well at that.
<P>
	We had an actuarial adjustment to the MP pension plan of 
$158 million. That is okay. Just throw the $158 million into the 
pot for them, because it came from the taxpayer.
<P>
	Let me give a little lesson to the folks next door. I will say it 
like this. ``If you continue to think the things you thought, you 
will continue to get the things you got''. That is saying they had 
better focus on the future, because they are continuing to go the 
same way as the Conservatives and the Liberals before them. 
Nothing has changed. They had better learn.
<P>
	Personally, when I came into the House as a member of 
Parliament I asked to be relieved of the pension plan so that I 
would not have to pay into it. I wrote the comptroller a letter and 
asked him: ``Is it possible to get out of this ridiculous plan?'' 
Here is the letter I received:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am writing with regard to your letter of December 7, 1993, in which you 
indicate that you do not wish to contribute to the retiring allowances accounts 
under the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act. However, pursuant 
to the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act, members are required 
to make pension contributions based on the amounts payable by way of 
sessional allowance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, we are unable to accede to your request and will continue to 
deduct your pension contribution until such time as the existing act is amended.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Here is the part I like:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I trust the above will be to your satisfaction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	It is not to my satisfaction. It will never be to my satisfaction 
and it will not be to the Reform Party's satisfaction. It will 
change. It must change. It has to change. I replaced a fellow in 
my riding 52 years of age with 18 years of service. He is now 
picking up $46,803 a year from the taxpayer. That is only about 
$2 million if he gets a little older. What the heck, we are only 
taxpayers out here, folks.
<P>
	I just cannot understand. I guess it is because when the Liberal 
Party is in opposition it says: ``Ah gee, all these things are 
wrong. They have to change. The pension plan is exorbitant. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8088"> 8088 </A></B>
<P>
do not deserve it''. However, when it  gets over there: munch, 
munch, crunch a munch at the trough.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Bloc 
Quebecois members find this morning's debate a little funny 
because we do not intend to stay here very long and will not need 
the pension plan. Quebec's representatives will certainly leave 
this chamber before long; we predict that it will happen in 1995.
<P>
	However, what I find really funny this morning is what I could 
call Reform's self-flogging exercise over salaries. These 
people, who engage in grandstanding at the drop of a hat, 
regularly come here to talk about cutting the salaries of overpaid 
members, despite last year's Price Waterhouse study stating that 
members of the House of Commons are underpaid.
<P>
	Strangely enough, we do not hear much about the members of 
that party who collect both their salaries as members of 
Parliament and their pensions as former army generals or 
members of provincial legislatures.
<P>
	What is the point of this? I wonder how sincere they are when 
they make such comments. Could it be that they found a cheaper 
way to engage in grandstanding? The day when a member of the 
Reform Party can prove publicly that he has decided not to 
collect the various pensions accumulated in the armed forces or 
elsewhere, he may earn the respect of the other members here 
today.
<P>
	Furthermore, I wonder if the money they will save on 
voluntarily uncollected pensions will be spent on enlarging 
prisons, since they are so keen on incarcerating people for 
longer periods. Their right-wing policies are not very consistent 
with what they said this morning.
<P>
	So until Reform members can prove that they are acting in 
good faith and that those eligible have voluntarily forgone the 
benefits accumulated in other pension funds, allow me to 
question their good faith and their honesty in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, there is 
one thing I agree with, the statement by the hon. member from 
the separatist party that he does not plan to be here too long. I 
can agree with that. We hope he is not here very long either.
<P>
	I really think the question was about the savings that we get 
from this pension plan. I do not know if the hon. member heard 
but we are actually borrowing about $40 billion a year to run this 
country. We are spending $40 billion more than we take in. I 
kind of think it would be a good idea, although it is hard to 
convince the Liberals about this, to try to pay that down. What 
do you think of that? Maybe we could just try to balance the 
budget for a change.
<P>
	It is not just a matter of taking the money from some of these 
ridiculous accounts and trying to find out what to do with it. This 
is a very principled issue. The question is whether or not people 
after six years of service anywhere deserve a pension as 
exorbitant as this one. The answer according to the taxpayer is 
no, so why do we spend all of this time trying to coax this 
government into change? We should not be here doing this. 
Everybody in this room knows that these changes have to be 
made and there should not be debates.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, when I was getting ready to come to the House today to 
speak I turned on the parliamentary channel and I listened to the 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. As a result of 
listening to what I think was fairly accurately described by my 
colleague from Prince George, I found it necessary to change a 
lot of what I was going to say.
<P>
	The hon. member suggested that this is an honourable 
profession and that it is great of us to be here, him included. In 
the same breath he went on to talk about the remuneration of an 
MP and the benefits, referring to it as ``those things that bring us 
here''. Perhaps that is what brings members of the Liberal Party 
here but I can assure you, Madam Speaker, that it is not what 
brings members of the Reform Party here.
<P>
	He also discussed at length the concept of the RRSP as an 
alternative to the MPs pension. He talked about the suggestion 
that this is what should be done with our pensions. Then he put 
out a challenge to the gentleman who raised this, suggesting that 
if he can show how he could make more through RRSPs and this 
type of thing that he would in fact resign. It would be wonderful 
if we could bring that about.
<P>
	That being what it will, he is suggesting he wants the 
maximum dollar he can get, the maximum benefits. The only 
way he is interested in change is if we can prove to him that he is 
actually going to get more. There is no intent of sacrifice there, 
no intent of recognizing the financial situation Canada is in, 
only will he make more if we make some change in that 
direction.
<P>
	He then went on to suggest that it was a red herring, that the 
Reform was cooking up false numbers because there really is no 
deficit in the pension plan, that although people retire and get 
these huge gold-plated pensions there are more people coming 
into the House and as a result they will pay in and this will make 
it all right.
<P>
	The member obviously does not know anything about the 
concept of cumulative effect. In fact that may well explain why 
we are five hundred and thirty-some odd billion in debt and 
going up at the rate of almost $1,500 a second because of the 
cumulative effect not only of the overspending by the Tories in 
the last nine years but the Liberal Party before that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8089"> 8089 </A></B>
<P>
	The cumulative effect is if a member retires and starts 
collecting this money and is relying on those people now in the 
House to make that payment, which I might add is what is 
destroying the Canada pension plan, then the problem is that that 
first member who retires is still collecting while the second 
member retires and joins him at the trough. This is the problem 
with the type of system we have now.
<P>
	The hon. member suggested that this is part of the 
remuneration package. It is an unreasonable, unrealistic way of 
trying to compensate people for coming to the House of 
Commons. A realistic way would be if a member simply got a 
responsible proper amount in terms of annual compensation. 
The difference between that and what we are getting right now is 
the fact that no matter what you pay a person, it stops when that 
person stops making his contribution. If it becomes a matter of a 
difference in salary or a matter of a shared contribution to an 
RRSP, the government's obligation ends when that person 
ceases to be a member of Parliament but the member then 
benefits from whatever resources were built up during that 
period of time.
<P>
	I heard about double dipping from the same member. There 
are two things I would like to say with regard to double dipping. 
I am glad to see they are talking about the concept of looking at 
double dipping for those people who come here, leave, collect a 
gold-plated pension, and then get appointed to a government 
board. He referred to three people on this side of the House who 
in his opinion are double dipping. I am not one to hide behind 
anything. I believe I am one of those people he referred to.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	In looking at double dipping let us first look at the type of 
concept by which he suggests I am double dipping and the actual 
benefit that I receive.
<P>
	First, I am getting a pension as a result of having worked as an 
air traffic controller for twenty-two and a half years. In addition 
to the normal amount that people pay for their superannuation 
contribution, I paid an additional 2 per cent of my gross salary 
for what is referred to as an early retirement benefit. That is 
something that I paid over and above the normal superannuation 
deductions for the benefit of being able to retire early from a 
profession in which very, very few ever make it to full 
retirement.
<P>
	In addition to that 2 per cent I paid, I took a reduction of 20 per 
cent of my calculated pension because I retired early, over and 
above the extra 2 per cent that I paid. I have paid well and good 
for the benefits that I receive.
<P>
	Let us look at those benefits. I worked 22.5 years as an air 
traffic controller. After 22.5 years I have a pension of 
approximately $17,000 a year.
<P>
	As did other members, I replaced a member in order to come 
to this House. The member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke that 
I replaced after two terms of office collects a pension of $27,000 
a year, 70 per cent more than I get for 22.5 years of service as an 
air traffic controller. I think the hon. member might take this 
into consideration both in terms of pointing the finger over here 
at people like myself with regard to double dipping and, second, 
in regard to trying to defend the justification and reasonableness 
of a pension plan that pays someone after two terms of office 
$27,000 when someone who worked 22.5 years paying 9.5 per 
cent of their salary receives $17,000. There is something far 
apart.
<P>
	Everyone who works in this House, except for MPs, the clerks 
at the table, the Sergeant-at-Arms, all the people who work in 
the House who make the machinery work, who work behind the 
scenes, what do they have? They pay 7.5 per cent, two thirds of 
what an MP pays. What benefit do they get for that? They get 2 
per cent per year based on their best six year average. What does 
an MP get? He gets 5 per cent. If we were trying to do it in 
proportion it would reduce the MP's pay to 3 per cent. They 
cannot retire until they are 55 years of age. They cannot get any 
pension whatsoever if they retire before age 50. If they retire 
after age 50 they lose 5 per cent of their calculated pension for 
each year they are short of age 55.
<P>
	When you start drawing the comparison to what everybody 
associated with the government, every single person with the 
exception of the MPs and of course those in the other place gets, 
the pension they get is wholly out of line. It is out of line with 
industry and it is out of line with every other single person in 
government.
<P>
	I would suggest that the government look very closely at 
changing the whole concept of the program of pensions for MPs. 
It has to change it to a system that is based on the benefit due a 
person for the work they do while they are here that allows them 
to put away for their retirement. God knows, the way the 
government is going there will not be any other kind of pension 
available through the government.
<P>
	We are telling people that they are going to have to reduce and 
we have to start doing it ourselves. Adjust it so that whatever 
payment MPs receive from the pension plan stops when those 
MPs stop serving the Canadian public. They will then make do 
with the resources they have developed as a result of putting 
money aside, as most people in the public have to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
difficulty the Liberals are having with this whole concept is the 
fact that at this moment our nation is under a tremendous 
amount of stress in terms of how we are going to fund the social 
programs, how we are going to be able to fund health care and 
how we are going to be able to fund the entitlements that people 
in Canada have become used to.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8090"> 8090 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	We are not here to necessarily defend all of those entitlements 
as they presently stand but the point is people in Canada are 
being told by the Liberals that there are going to be cutbacks.
<P>
	The members will know that daily the members of this House 
receive the publication called <I>Quorum</I>. I was just flipping 
through it and I noticed a headline saying ``New Brunswick 
welfare changes foretell the human resources minister's 
thinking on social program reform''.
<P>
	I wonder if they cannot understand or why they cannot 
understand that when the finance minister is one of the 52 who 
was named yesterday, when members of these committees 
sitting on the Liberal side going around the country saying that 
there are going to be cutbacks in entitlements, there are going to 
be increases in university tuitions, but not me. That is the 
ultimate NIMBY and I do not think the people of Canada are 
prepared to accept the ultimate NIMBY. I wonder if the member 
has experienced the same kind of frustration that I have in my 
constituency of people saying this not in my back yard 
philosophy is not good enough when members of Parliament are 
not prepared to stand up and be counted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Madam Speaker, I have had a great deal of 
dialogue with people on a variety of subjects in my riding, as 
many of us have done. It is very frustrating that we are placed in 
this position in which we have to go out to the public and say we 
are cutting back on these services and we want you to identify to 
us what you are prepared to give up.
<P>
	We are looking at cutbacks in some types of pensions, various 
types of services that we are going to not only be willing to but 
are able to offer to the Canadian public. It is very hard to stand 
there with a straight face and tell the public this when we are 
faced with the kind of gold plated benefits that are currently 
available to people in this House.
<P>
	These are the types of things that we have to address. I am one 
of those people who take a 10 per cent reduction in my pay. I do 
it through donations to charities within my riding. I do not do 
this because I think MPs are overpaid, far from it. Those MPs 
who do their job, truth be known, are probably underpaid in 
general terms. Most of us do not come here for money, we come 
here to serve. We can serve the Canadian public best by leading 
by example and that is what our motion is all about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to address this House 
on the issue of MP pensions. This is an issue that is of great 
concern to me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> On a point of order, Madam 
Speaker, I wonder if you could verify your rotation list. We just 
had two speakers split their time on this side and I did see the 
parliamentary secretary who wanted to speak.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> There has been an 
agreement with the Reform Party and the Bloc to allow four 
Reformers or two slots to go to the Reform Party. This had 
apparently been worked out prior.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> As I was saying, this is an issue that is of 
great concern to me, to the Reform Party and to all Canadians.
<P>
	This pension plan is indefensible even in good times when 
Ottawa vaults were overflowing and the public was feeling 
wonderfully generous toward its politicians. In bad times such 
as we experiencing now when many Canadians are suffering and 
the government is hard pressed to fund basic programs the MP 
pension plan amounts to little more than highway robbery.
<P>
	When I say I know that Canadians truly do want the MP 
pension plan reformed, I am speaking from results of my 
constituency survey which I conducted in my riding of 
Edmonton-Strathcona in the spring of '94. The responses were 
overwhelmingly in favour of pension reform. When the 
constituents were asked the question at what age should an 
outgoing MP be able to collect a pension, 97 per cent of all 
respondents said that an outgoing or retiring MP should not be 
able to collect their pension until age 55.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	Even more convincing is the fact that 75 per cent of my 
constituents think that an outgoing MP should not be able to 
collect his or her pension until after his or her 60th birthday.
<P>
	A second question that was asked regarding MP pensions was 
after how many years should an MP serve before being eligible 
for a pension. The results again were staggering in favour of 
pension reform. A hundred per cent of respondents said that a 
minimum number of years should be no less than eight. 
Eighty-one per cent felt that the minimum number of years of 
service should be no less than 16. The answers to these questions 
are a far cry from the present situation which is in place today.
<P>
	It is important to illustrate a few facts about MP pension 
plans, as it will clearly illustrate why pension reform is needed. 
First, pensions are payable immediately upon retirement after 
only six years of service no matter at what age an MP retires or is 
not re-elected.
<P>
	Second, payments continue even if the ex-MP holds another 
government job which we refer to as double dipping. Third, 
pensions begin at $23,390 per year and increase 5 per cent per 
year of service to a maximum of 75 per cent of average salary. 
Fourth, inflation indexing kicks in after age 60 and finally, MPs 
pay 11 per cent of their base salary into the pension fund, the 
government matches this amount and covers shortfalls, an 
unfunded liability which cost the Canadian taxpayer nearly $160 
million in 1992.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8091"> 8091 </A></B>
<P>
	By no means is this list inclusive. These are, however, the few 
items that are of grave concern to me. I have stated in this House 
repeatedly that Reformers have come to Ottawa to make a 
difference and I think we have.
<P>
	We also feel that one way to do this is to ensure constructive 
criticism and offer an alternative to the status quo of the 
government. I can honestly say that I am offering the Liberals an 
alternative to the status quo simply because they are doing 
absolutely nothing in terms of legislation reform regarding the 
issue of MP pensions or for that matter any issue.
<P>
	This Liberal government seems stuck in the perennial rut of 
talk, talk, talk and discussion paper after discussion paper. The 
Liberals state in their red ink book: ``A Liberal government will 
reform the pension plans of members of Parliament and put an 
end to double dipping''. After 392 days in government I can see 
that this was truly an important commitment of the Liberals as 
we have seen absolutely no legislation and little or no talk about 
MP pension reform.
<P>
	Obviously the current Prime Minister has forgotten about his 
challenge to the former Prime Minister in which he challenged 
her to recall Parliament if she were truly serious about pension 
reform: ``reforms would pass in one day''. The only time the 
Liberals speak on pension reforms is when they are responding 
to our questions. Even then all they do is respond with rhetoric 
and Liberal double talk.
<P>
	I was right in saying the other day that Liberals are no 
different than their Conservative predecessors. They may even 
end up like them after the next election. In the meantime they are 
all talk and no action.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	We on this side of the House know that this government is 
stalling on the issue of pension reform. Perhaps it is because the 
Liberals are concerned about having to take another Reform 
policy such as they have done in the past on issues such as the 
Young Offenders Act, parole reform, criminal justice reform, 
debt and deficit reform and let us not forget immigration. All 
this stalling is doing nothing but costing the taxpayer more and 
more every day.
<P>
	We all know yesterday was, as the National Citizen's 
Coalition called it, national trough day as another group of 52 
MPs of all political stripes became eligible for this outlandish 
and extravagant pension plan which could collectively amount 
to approximately $53 million if all of these MPs quit today and 
lived to the age of 75.
<P>
	While the average citizen in Canada must work 35 years to 
accumulate a pension, the average MP must work six years. The 
gold plated MP pension plan should be renamed from pension 
plan to cash for life rip off of the Canadian taxpayer. This plan is 
perhaps one of the federal government's most offensive 
examples of government waste.
<P>
	What strikes to the core of the issue is the fact that we as 
parliamentarians have to set an example for all Canadians and 
stalling on issues such as pension reform is no way to lead by 
example.
<P>
	Because of time constraints I realize I cannot mention 
everyone who is presently sitting as an MP who is eligible for a 
pension. I believe that I have not only a duty but an obligation to 
point out a few of the more offensive potential payouts of certain 
members of this House.
<P>
	The member for Winnipeg South Centre, initial benefit of 
over $59,000 annually, will have a total potential payout of over 
$2 million. The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
initial benefit of $33,000 annually, will have a total potential 
payout of $2.1 million. The member for Hamilton East, initial 
benefit of almost $35,000 annually, will have a total potential 
payout of over $2.5 million. The member for Lac-Saint-Jean, 
initial benefit of over $26,000 annually, will have a total 
potential payout of almost $1 million.
<P>
	Perhaps I have left the greatest sanctimonious display to that 
of the NDP, a party that claims to speak for the common man and 
social equality, while the total payout for the member for 
Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing will be approximately $1.2 
million. The member for Winnipeg Transcona will have $3.4 
million.
<P>
	We could go on and on. Just when voters think that they have 
the final word it turns out that politicians had the last laugh.
<P>
	Highlights of the 1993 election will illustrate the point. One 
hundred and thirty-four of the two hundred MPs who were 
defeated or resigned before the election had complied with the 
minimum six years of service necessary to qualify for a pension. 
We must stop this insanity today. We must reform the MP 
pension plan now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
on this matter of MP pensions, there is no question that the 
members have raised an issue which has been raised to all of us 
by our constituents. However, I note that throughout the debate 
the members continue to provide figures but they have not 
explained how those figures were arrived at.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	Would the member not agree it is somewhat misleading not to 
let the Canadian public know that members of Parliament must 
contribute to their pension plan? In fact that contribution is 11 
per cent of their $64,400 salary. That means they are 
contributing over $7,000 a year. The calculations members are 
putting forward also assume the member takes early retirement 
after six years and then receives that pension until age 75 or 
later.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> They get it for life.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8092"> 8092 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> They get it for life but the calculations that have 
been provided as examples really go up to age 75 as an average 
mortality rate.
<P>
	Would it not be fair simply to put all of the facts on the table? 
Most members are not here just to be here for six years. They are 
here to serve, as the member said; they are here to do a job. In 
many cases as we can see in this House that job goes on for 20 to 
25 years. Those members of Parliament who serve their country, 
which presently is at a salary of $64,400, have forgone the 
opportunity of their best earning potential during their career 
lifespan to serve in this House.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would like to comment on whether or 
not the facts really are on the table and whether or not the full 
compensation of the members of Parliament ought not to be 
considered.
<P>
	I personally agree there should be changes to eliminate the 
double dipping scenario. There should be changes to the date at 
which a member would qualify. I know the government has 
committed to making those changes and that those changes will 
be forthcoming at Christmastime. That is the undertaking this 
government has made to Canadians. We have listened and we are 
going to make those changes.
<P>
	However let us never forget that members of Parliament are 
also family members. They have children. They have mortgages 
to pay. They have the ordinary costs of anyone else and they are 
entitled to a fair and reasonable compensation. As the member 
well knows all of the recent third party studies show that the 
contribution of members of Parliament in comparison with the 
corporate sector make their jobs worth at least $100,000.
<P>
	Would the member not agree that certain facts have not been 
put on the table? If he wanted to be fair with all Canadians he 
would make sure they had all these facts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to 
respond to that question.
<P>
	The key words the hon. member used were ordinary 
Canadians. Ordinary Canadians average 30 to 35 years before 
they receive a pension. Ordinary parliamentarians average six 
years. It would irritate ordinary Canadians to receive after 35 
years what we receive after six years. I do not think the average 
Canadian would accept this in any manner, shape or form.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, one 
year ago Canadians sent a clear message to Ottawa that they 
were tired of the status quo, hypocritical politicians. They 
subsequently voted in 205 rookies to the 35th Parliament. My 
speech is to the rookies. My message: Let us not let the veterans 
corrupt us.
<P>
	When the voters fired the former frontbenchers, former 
backbenchers and former prime ministers, they took away their 
power but for most not their paycheques. We will be paying 
them for the rest of their lives  millions of dollars. We as 
taxpayers will be paying 30 per cent of the average of the last six 
years of their salary.
<P>
	The issue before us today is the MP pension plan, technically 
described as the members of Parliament retirement allowance 
and retirement compensation allowance. Combined, the two 
plans force members to contribute 11 per cent of their salaries 
toward their retirement, or should I say toward an annual 
annuity one month after they leave public office regardless of 
age.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	The result is a plan that is fully indexed, completely immune 
to inflation and payable for life with only six years of service 
required. Not bad. A lifetime annuity worth about $19,000 plus, 
and a minimum collectable whether you are 35, 25 or 65 years of 
age or over just 2,100 days on the job.
<P>
	For an MP to receive such a generous amount after only six 
years of service is ridiculous. The Government of Canada must 
contribute 5.85 times what the members put into the plan to meet 
the payments. I would suggest that in the very near future this 
ratio will continue to rise as more and more MPs are retired 
when voters vote with their feet, unless members pay more into 
the plan.
<P>
	I submit this is why so many Canadian taxpayers are upset 
with MP pensions, considering them both unfair and unrealistic. 
What plan anywhere in the private or public sector in Canada or 
in any of the other G-7 countries that this government so 
proudly likes to compare itself to has such an overly generous 
matching amount from the government side?
<P>
	In the name of justice and fairness I urge the government to 
correct this inequity immediately. What I am saying today is no 
different from what the Prime Minister when he was leader of 
the opposition said on August 13, 1993: ``We will change the MP 
pension in one day''. He has been here for one year and he has 
not done a thing except talk about changing double dipping and 
raising the age.
<P>
	If that is all he is going to change, it is not enough. It is the 
overly generous matching contribution by the government that 
is annoying to the taxpayers of this country. That is what we 
cannot get through the heads of those Liberal members on the 
opposite side. I plead with them to show some leadership by 
example like Reform Party members.
<P>
	We have all pledged not to take an MP pension in its current 
form. Yes, we pledged. The Liberals who are here can laugh, but 
we have pledged that because we want to show leadership by 
example. Some of us want to opt out of this current type of plan, 
but the fact is the government will not let us.
<P>
	Many of us whether we can afford to or not have also taken a 
10 per cent pay cut. It is not because MPs make too much money, 
but because as leaders we know that Canadians will need to 
sacrifice in the near future and we are prepared to lead by 
example at the top. Whether it is  one of us, 52 of us or 35 of us is 
not the issue. As long as there is someone willing to lead 
Canadians will have hope. The Reform Party is here to provide 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8093"> 8093 </A></B>
<P>
that leadership. We challenge government members to follow 
our lead, because simply put, it is the right thing for them to do 
especially when we are asking Canadians to sacrifice.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Human Resources Development talk 
about reductions in social spending, welfare, education and UI 
without mentioning his own unemployment insurance scheme, 
the MP pension plan? What will he reduce there?
<P>
	How can the minister complain about 25,000 auto workers 
withdrawing $70 million annually from the UIC fund when 
taxpayers paid out an estimated $158 million in 1992 to cover 
revenue shortfalls in the MP pension plan to which the Liberal 
member pointed out earlier we contribute 11 per cent? That is 
not enough for what you get out. It is topped off in excess of $2 
million every year to do exactly what the Minister of Human 
Resources Development is criticizing the auto workers for. That 
is hypocrisy.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance talk about taxing RRSPs 
without addressing his own retirement compensation allowance 
that taxpayers fund more than he does on a disproportionate 
basis which is not even allowed in the private sector? This is a 
minister of the crown.
<P>
	The hypocrisy of the Liberal government on this issue is truly 
disheartening. It promised to address MP pensions. It promised 
to let us opt out and it has not. It has had the report in hand since 
March with specific recommendations but has done nothing. 
Instead it has waited for 52 more MPs, 46 of whom are Liberal, 
to qualify for the golden parachutes.
<P>
	The majority of Reformers who have taken a 10 per cent pay 
cut are also denied access to the 11 per cent the government 
takes out of their pay to fund retired MPs pensions. That is 21 
per cent or over $1,000 a month less than any one of the Liberal 
members opposite get in their paycheques every month. That is 
what we are sacrificing to show leadership to the country to get 
everybody to participate in the deficit reduction program.
<P>
	The government is hurting our cash flow and all its members 
do is laugh. Well, let them laugh because he who laughs last 
laughs hardest. Is it any wonder then why some of us on this side 
of the House question the blindness and stupidity of the 
government on this issue?
<P>
	Let me outline the Reform Party's position on MP pensions. 
We would end full indexation of these pensions. We would 
postpone eligibility for benefits until at least age 60, with 
eligibility further postponed by the amount of time in which the 
person has already been paid prior to age 60. We would also 
subject the MP pension plan to a tax back according to a formula 
identical to that of the old age security program.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	The Reform caucus has already approved the concept of 
privately purchased MPs pensions under which future RRSP 
contributions for sitting MPs would be matched by the 
government up to the legal limit for contributions. After 
eliminating the gold plated pension plan this House could agree 
to a proper and balanced compensation package that would be 
more palatable and compatible with Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	Here is my personal recommendation, which is certainly 
debatable, but should satisfy our critics and possibly have all the 
rookies in this House vote in favour of our motion: Individual 
citizens from time to time wish to enter the public sector to help 
shape legislation and make a contribution to Canadian society. It 
is desirable to attract individual citizens from all walks of life to 
Parliament regardless of income. Therefore, a reasonable 
compensation package should be offered so as to have this great 
institution in the hands of members of Parliament more 
interested in serving their country rather than for the pay, perks 
and privileges without inflicting undue financial hardships.
<P>
	This is an important job. Only 295 people in Canada have it at 
any given time. They must balance personal sacrifices with the 
public interest. Given the current job description of an MP and 
people's expectations let us get rid of the impression that MPs 
are somehow special, different, or somehow deserve something 
that is not available in the private sector.
<P>
	Let us get rid of the notion that MPs are paid just $64,000 per 
year. They are not. They are paid much more. It is confusing. 
They have $64,000 in salary. They have a tax free living 
allowance of $21,300 and a tax free expense allowance of 
$6,000. After six years they get a bonus, a pension for life. They 
get $27,000 tax free. Why?
<P>
	For someone in the private sector to earn $27,000 they have to 
make $50,000 plus. This sort of pay structure is nothing more 
than planned deception. It gives the Prime Minister the ability to 
say he makes less than the lowest paid Ottawa Senators hockey 
player. A member of Parliament's total salary is about $120,000 
per year if we mark up the tax free portion. This is the kind of 
double talk that makes people lose respect for politicians.
<P>
	The Liberals are in power and the Deputy Prime Minister of 
Canada supports the GST. She said during the election campaign 
that if the GST was not scrapped she would resign. They have 
promised to do it by January 1996. I promised to take a 10 per 
cent pay cut. I did. I promised to opt out of the current pension 
plan. I will. I promised to take the 10 per cent pay cut for the full 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8094"> 8094 </A></B>
<P>
term. I will. Perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister can learn from 
this what it means to keep a promise. Will she keep her promise 
and resign on January 1, 1996 if the GST is not scrapped?
<P>
	This job itself with its responsibilities compared to the private 
sector is at least at a senior executive level and is deserving of a 
$6,000 to $7,000 salary per month. We should get rid of the MP 
pension plan, the tax free living allowance and the tax free 
expense allowance, limit members to two terms and offer the 
following: A taxable salary of $10,000 to $12,000 per month 
where members look after their own expenses and their own 
pensions. The $10,000 per month is the current minimum as it 
reflects basically what MPs are paid now after we mark up the 
tax free aspects.
<P>
	I personally believe that MPs should be paid more. However 
once they are removed from office Canadians should not be on 
the hook for about $1 million per year per member. They should 
be given a private sector pension plan to which they pay 5 per 
cent, matched by the government on a 1:1 basis as opposed to 
6:1 as is currently the case. Upon departure after two terms or 
whenever members would get a one time, one year severance to 
help re-enter the workforce and reintegrate their previous lives. 
This is more in line with the private sector and should make the 
voters and the politicians more respectful of each other.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, may I ask for unanimous consent to continue 
for one minute? I have just three more paragraphs.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry. We do not 
have unanimous consent. Questions and comments. The hon. 
member for Mississauga South.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I wanted to address a couple of the points the member raised. It 
is extremely important because it has painted a picture which is 
quite slanted and biased on behalf of the member.
<P>
	First, throughout his statements he commented about his 10 
per cent salary cut. If the member was going to give all the facts 
he would also report that as has been reported in the press 
Reform members are now reconsidering their 10 per cent cut 
because they are not getting enough publicity or benefit from it 
by the voters.
<P>
	Second, the member seems to suggest that members of 
Parliament when they leave this place whether by choice or they 
are defeated in an election, can somehow simply integrate into 
the workforce.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	The member knows very well that 82 per cent of the members 
who did not return from the last House do not have employment 
today. They have nothing to go to. As the member well knows, 
when members of Parliament leave here, having been defeated 
in an election, they are a nobody. They are lower than a nobody 
because they no longer have the influence to speak with people 
and to have those contacts.
<P>
	There are many members of Parliament and many others who 
have served in public life who have given so much that have 
nothing to go to when they leave public life.
<P>
	On that basis the member probably should consider that the 
so-called gold-plated pension plan is in fact not just a pension 
plan for the future retirement of that member once that career 
ends but is also to provide some modicum of income protection 
or salary continuance because of the difficulty that members of 
Parliament have had to get back into the work force.
<P>
	The member asks for a reasonable compensation package but 
you will note, Madam Speaker, that the member was not full and 
clear with the Canadian public because he did not mention a 
dollar figure. He is unprepared to say what a fair and reasonable 
compensation package would be.
<P>
	Finally, the member made reference to a tax free allowance. 
The member said if you take this tax free allowance and convert 
it into an effective salary, the member of Parliament makes 
much more.
<P>
	What the member failed to point out to Canadians is that 
members of Parliament received these allowances to take care of 
real legitimate expenses. As one example, as a member of 
Parliament I am here four or five days a week for nine months of 
the year. I must have a place here to live. That place costs me 
$1,000 a month. That does not come out of some magical bin. It 
comes out of the tax free allowance.
<P>
	The member should really consider whether or not he has told 
the Canadians the full truth.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member for 
Calgary Centre. You have about a minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, that is a nice application of the 
rules. I really appreciate it. I just heard the gun go off outside. 
That was hot air just like some of the hot air I am hearing in here.
<P>
	When the hon. member's leader was Leader of the Opposition 
he said he wanted to reform MP pensions. He said he would raise 
the age to 55. We go to 60 so we support that a little higher. He 
said he would get rid of double dipping which he defines as 
receiving appointments from the federal level of government 
while on pension. We would support that as well. Whatever way 
you want to define double dipping you probably would find the 
Reform Party supporting it.
<P>
	Where we fundamentally disagree and where his party is too 
weak, too void, too empty, lacking the political will, is to make 
the contributions matching so that if if we give 11 per cent the 
federal government gives 11 per cent, or if we give five it gives 
five, no better than the private sector. Why should we be any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8095"> 8095 </A></B>
<P>
different, any more special? The MP compensation package 
should-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Don't tell me to hurry up. You are the one who was 
taking the time and hogging my time with your comment. So if 
you are interested in my comment in response-you're not. That 
figures. That's the government. That's the government side-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I'm interested. Talk to me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> There is a lady across the way who keeps 
interfering, Madam Speaker. I think I should be allowed another 
five minutes to respond because of the heckling.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry. The time has 
expired.
<P>
	I am now ready prior to recognizing the hon. parliamentary 
secretary to rule on the amendment proposed by the chief 
government whip.
<P>
	After consideration the Chair must rule that the proposed 
amendment by the hon. chief government whip is out of order 
because it goes against citation 579 of Beauchesne's sixth 
edition as it sets forth a proposition dealing with a matter which 
is foreign to the proposed proposition involved in the main 
motion and as it raises a new question. Second, it goes against 
citation 929 of Beauchesne's which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On an allotted day, during consideration of the business of Supply, an 
amendment must not provide the basis for an entirely different debate than that 
proposed in the original motion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	Also, as quoted in the ``Selected Decisions of Speaker 
Lamoureux'' on page 322, it was ruled by the Chair on March 
16, 1971 that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-for an allotted day, ``the spirit of fair play would require that the day not be 
taken away by means of an amendment''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Thank you, Madam 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Do you want to talk louder so everyone will hear 
you?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Now, now. I would ask that the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre listen. He might hear something that he might 
even like.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Should I hold my breath?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Probably not, although I am sure you can try.
<P>
	I have been in this House six years yesterday when I was 
elected.
<P>
	Oh, please wait to hear what I have to say, ladies and 
gentlemen.
<P>
	Six years ago last night was one of the most exciting and 
humbling moments of my life. The opportunity to be a member 
of Parliament, to serve the people of Halifax and, I hope, to 
serve the people of Canada as everyone of us in this House 
does-some of us whether we like it or not-is something that 
maybe a lot of us never even dreamed of when we thought about 
the way our lives would go.
<P>
	I want to say something else. I think most people in this House 
who know me know that I am a very partisan member of 
Parliament and I am proud of that partisanship. I come from a 
partisan tradition in my family, in my province, in my region 
and in my party. However, I think that this is an amazing and 
wonderful place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> So now the thinking is hereditary?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Is this the new politics, Jim?
<P>
	I look over to the other side, to the members of the Reform 
Party, and I want every one of them, particularly the member for 
Beaver River, to know that I hold them in great respect. I 
disagree with them on many, many issues but I hold them in 
great respect as members of Parliament, as representatives of 
the people, as fellow Canadians and as colleagues in this House. 
I congratulate the member for Beaver River for bringing 
forward this motion. This matter needs debate.
<P>
	I am going to veer off briefly in a lighter vein to my colleague 
and good friend, the member for Mississauga South, and say that 
I thought I was going to burst into tears before he finished his 
intervention. There are a number of good reasons for the proper 
remuneration of members of Parliament. I congratulate the 
member for Calgary Centre again-take it while you can-on 
his comments about proper remuneration. He is absolutely right.
<P>
	We all know right now that political suicide, which is 
something that I do not think any of us are interested in 
committing, would be to raise salaries. I think that what really 
needs to be done over the long term is what is said in the red 
book. I would be happy to read it in the French version which I 
have right here. It states that the entire thing needs revamping.
<P>
	In the meantime, and I am only going to deal with this briefly 
and I will come to it later in my speech, I support very strongly 
the elimination of double dipping while at the same time not 
disagreeing with the member for Kootenay West when he talked 
about his 22 years as a civil servant, an air traffic controller, one 
of the most stressful and difficult jobs and one of the most 
important jobs in this country. The issue is a complex and 
complicated one on both sides.
<P>
	I can bring up examples particularly in my previous 
incarnation in opposition when I was charged with the role of 
women's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8096"> 8096 </A></B>
<P>
critic. It is harder for women  parliamentarians to reintegrate to 
society just as it is harder for women economically in a number 
of areas.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	That is not the issue. We are not people to be felt sorry for. 
This is the greatest job on earth as far as I am concerned. This 
job is incredible. I think a lot of us would do it if we could even if 
we did not get paid.
<P>
	Mind you, I want to make a point very strongly in agreeing 
with the Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Hamilton East, 
that we are worth what we get paid. The member for Beaver 
River is worth a lot of money to the people of Canada and so is 
the member for Calgary Centre, I guess-yes, no-and so is the 
member for Mississauga South. We are all worth our salaries. 
We work hard.
<P>
	There may be some but I personally have no knowledge of 
members of Parliament who do not, as one journalist called it, 
have the work schedules of dray horses. I also think that we 
enjoy these schedules. That does not mean we should not be 
remunerated. It also means that it is not a simplistic issue that 
can be easily dealt with. That is why I again congratulate the 
member for Beaver River for bringing it forward and for giving 
the opportunity for debate in this House.
<P>
	I want to talk about something in particular because I think it 
is important. I think that I as a very partisan member of this 
House perhaps can say this where some others might not be able 
to. We have to treat each other with respect and dignity when 
dealing with this issue. I thought about cracking wise about this 
but the people of Canada and the people in this Chamber deserve 
better than that from all of us. This is a serious issue.
<P>
	Members opposite are quite right when they say we have to be 
credible as we say to the people of Canada that cuts are coming, 
that we are changing what we do, that we are putting our own 
house in order. Again, that is why I support the red book 
promise.
<P>
	Some comments were made in particular about the member 
for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, my whip, a veteran of this 
House and a veteran of the Ontario legislature, someone who has 
given long and hard to public service. I certainly do not want to 
embarrass the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell but 
given the comments by the member for Kootenay West, I am not 
sure if he knows a bit about the history of the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell who started as a busboy in one of 
the parliamentary cafeterias, who worked his way up, who is 
absolutely a glowing example of a Canadian success story.
<P>
	I do not think anybody on either side of this House would deny 
that there is no better constituency MP in the House of 
Commons than the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. 
That is one of the reasons that he gets returned with amazing 
majorities. I think the last one was somewhere around 85 per 
cent. There is a quote about the longest serving premier in a 
Canadian province who was a Liberal premier of Nova Scotia 
many  years. I have a picture of him in my kitchen with a caption 
that states: ``He trusts the people and the people trust him''. I 
think that is a tremendous thing for a person elected to political 
office to attain. I think that could be said about the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	When we debate this issue, it is an emotional issue. All of us 
are emotionally concerned in our own futures. We are all of us 
concerned for ourselves and our families and we all of us know 
that these matters are of tremendous importance to us. I do not 
for an instant accuse the hon. member from the opposition of 
being unparliamentary. I just want him to know that when the 
hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell or the hon. 
member for Mississauga South or any hon. members in this 
House stand and speak passionately about any issue, whether it 
is our remuneration as members of Parliament, whether it is 
issues that relate to our constituents, whether it is issues that 
relate to Canada as a whole, and I know that the member for 
Beaver River agrees with me on this, we all deserve the respect 
of our peers and colleagues. We all deserve not to be accused of 
making these statements for personal gain. That is what I found 
very difficult in those earlier comments.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	As I said, I think perhaps he was unaware of the history of this 
particular member who is, has been and will continue to be a 
benefit and an adornment to this House.
<P>
	This debate has in the past been acrimonious. It has in the past 
used the logical fallacy ad hominem. I am winding up. I know 
who is coming in. It has in the past created a great deal of sound 
a fury, signifying nothing.
<P>
	In closing, everyone who is here, whether it is the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, the hon. member 
for Beaver River or other hon. members, we are all aware that 
our role as members of Parliament is one of integrity, decency 
and deserving of respect.
<P>
	The hon. Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Hamilton 
East, has said in this debate that she will not apologize for the 
remuneration of members of Parliament. I want to say that I 
stand four square with her and with other members of the 
government on that level. Members of Parliament deserve their 
remuneration. We also need to air these issues, discuss them 
publicly and to ensure that the people of Canada see that we do 
respect each other and each other's opinions.
<P>
	I believe last week the hon. member for Beaver River 
suggested that I would collect I think it was in excess of $1 
million if I were to retire today, the day after my qualifying for a 
pension. I want to assure the member for Beaver River that I 
have absolutely no intention of retiring today. I hope I would 
have no intention of retiring long err this. I would imagine that 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8097"> 8097 </A></B>
<P>
the hon. member who becomes pensionable on March 13, 1995 
will also not have much intention of retiring.
<P>
	While we will both attempt to assist our colleagues in aiding 
both of us to that end in future elections, I think we both know 
that the work we do here and the remuneration we receive for it 
is certainly not overwhelming. I want to also say that this is a no 
win argument in many areas of this country.
<P>
	I want to say that I am delighted to have taken part in this 
debate. I thank again the hon. member for Beaver River for 
bringing forward this motion.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I understand that there will be questions put to 
the hon. member for Halifax in just a moment. I have been given 
notice of a request to return to ministerial statements. My 
colleagues, you will have a chance to put questions to our 
colleague in just a few minutes.
<P>
	Might I understand, Mr. Prime Minister, that this is a request 
to return to Statements by Ministers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to return to 
Statements by Ministers?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GOVERNORGENERALOFCANADA">GOVERNOR GENERAL OF CANADA</A></H3>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to inform the House 
that Her Majesty the Queen has graciously approved the 
appointment upon my recommendation of the Hon. Romeo 
LeBlanc as the next Governor General of Canada. The 
installation will take place in early February 1995.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Hon. members are well acquainted with Mr. LeBlanc, who has 
served Canada with distinction in public life for over twenty 
years: as a member of this House, as a minister of the Crown, as 
a senator and, most recently, as Speaker of the Senate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Born in New Brunswick, Mr. LeBlanc is the first Governor 
General from Atlantic Canada. He is also the first Acadian to 
serve as Governor General.
<P>
	In recommending this appointment to Her Majesty, I was 
conscious that a Governor General must have a profound love of 
his country and of the Canadian people in order to effectively 
carry out the duties of this high office.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I know that Mr. LeBlanc has these qualities. As a teacher, as a 
journalist and as a parliamentarian, he has made outstanding 
contributions to Canada and to Canadians. With his 
understanding of our country and his personal warmth and 
dedication, I am sure that he will carry out his new 
responsibilities with success.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At this point I would like also to thank on behalf of all 
Canadians His Excellency Ramon Hnatyshyn and his wife 
Gerda. First elected to the House of Commons in 1974, Mr. 
Hnatyshyn has served Canadians for 20 years. As a member of 
Parliament, I served with him. He served Parliament with great 
distinction.
<P>
	In 1990 Ramon Hnatyshyn was sworn in as Governor General 
of Canada. Since that time he and Mrs. Hnatyshyn have fulfilled 
their roles with dedication and dignity. I worked with them for 
the last year and they have been gracious people to work with.
<P>
	I would like, on behalf of all the members of this House and 
the people of Canada, to say to Madam Hnatyshyn and Mr. 
Hnatyshyn, thank you for a job well done.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the appointment of the Hon. Roméo LeBlanc as 
Governor General will no doubt be welcomed as good news. I 
salute the Prime Minister's decision to name an Acadian to this 
prestigious position, in fact the first one in Canada's history. 
This is undoubtedly a gesture of openness to Canada's 
francophone communities.
<P>
	The Hon. Mr. LeBlanc will be able to continue the efforts that 
he has always made in his long and fruitful career for the 
promotion of minority rights. I wish him good luck and great 
success in his new duties.
<P>
	Let me also point out the good, solid work of the present 
Governor General, the Hon. Ray Hnatyshyn, and thank him and 
his wife for what they have done for their fellow Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the Prime Minister's 
announcement of the appointment of Romeo LeBlanc as the next 
Governor General of Canada and to protest the appointment as 
unwise and inappropriate.
<P>
	In doing so I mean absolutely no disrespect for Mr. LeBlanc as 
an individual, a parliamentarian or a public servant. However, as 
hon. members know, the prestige and the standing of the Office 
of the Governor General with the Canadian public is in decline 
and it is in decline for three reasons.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8098"> 8098 </A></B>
<P>
	First, in a democracy an increasing number of people feel that 
the public should have a say in who occupies the office of chief 
of state. Second, it is in decline because Canadians prefer the 
appointee to be above and beyond partisan politics. That 
reference has not been respected.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Third, it is in decline because the public no longer supports 
some of the special privileges which pertain to the Governor 
General's office such as the exemption of the occupant from 
payment of income taxes and the ability of the occupant to 
double dip on pensions.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has disregarded all of these factors in 
making this appointment which he announced today. Reformers 
therefore believe the appointment to be unwise, inappropriate, 
and wish that fact to be registered in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
unprecedented in Canadian history. The Governor General 
nominated has informed the government that he will accept his 
pay as a governor and will return his pension to the crown.
<P>

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We are now entering a 
10-minute question and comment period for the hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
getting back to the MP pension plan and the need to address it 
and reform it, I would like to make a couple of comments on the 
speech of the member for Halifax and also a couple of questions 
I hope she would take the time to answer.
<P>
	First of all, the problem with this is that the current Prime 
Minister said a year ago in opposition that he would reform the 
pension plan in one day given the opportunity. Now he has been 
there for a year and has not reformed the pension plan in that one 
day as he promised. It is in the red book what he would do, the 55 
years, the double dipping.
<P>
	We would support that except we would expect the age to be 
60, not 55. We would go further and get into the area which we 
feel annoys the taxpayers of Canada which is the fact that 
whatever it is that a member of Parliament contributes, why is it 
that the taxpayers have to contribute higher than that. Why is it 
that the taxpayers are expected to foot the tab for this generous, 
self-serving, gold plated pension plan? Why is it not just a 
matching contribution?
<P>
	Does the member for Halifax not agree that the government's 
share of the contribution should not exceed a member's share to 
restore respect in the private sector and to restore the confidence 
of the Canadian public? That is one of the changes that we would 
make in addition to what is in the Liberal red book.
<P>
	Also, does she not agree that 55 is not high enough, that it 
should be 60? It would help to make it more actuarially sound 
and it would be more in line with the private sector. If a member 
wishes to draw it earlier than that age then they would get a 
reduced amount as in similar plans.
<P>
	All we are asking in our motion is to rectify a wrong. It is 
clearly wrong. It clearly annoys the Canadian taxpayer and all 
we want to do is address that portion of the MP compensation 
which is too generous, not the MPs' salary which is too low.
<P>
	If we looked at it why can this government not find a balance 
between too much and too little? Why can this government not 
find a balance between good government and self-serving 
government? Why can this government not find a balance and do 
the things it said it was going to do when it was in opposition? 
Now it is on the other side and it is not doing them, or it is doing 
opposite. This is what frustrates taxpayers. This is what 
concerns people.
<P>
	The last question is does she not agree that the government 
plan is better than that of any in the private sector? Politicians, 
members of Parliament, belong to an exclusive club of only 295 
people, which is probably about 30 too many. There should only 
be 265. Now they plan to increase it to 301 because they work so 
hard. Does she not agree that if we have a better plan than that of 
the private sector is it not somehow embarrassing to her that she 
has something, or that a member of Parliament has something, 
better than that which is out there? We come into this job 
willingly. We know the sacrifices. We know what we are getting 
into. If we cry about what we are going to lose when we 
leave-the member did not, I am referring to some other Liberal 
members who made that point-and cry about what we are going 
to see out there when we leave, then we should not become MPs 
in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Those are my comments. I am trying to be reasonable. I am 
trying to ask for support for this motion. It only supports what 
the Liberals promised. We want action before 53 more members 
qualify under the current rules. We want the current MP pension 
plan to be changed. Why does the government not act?
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="8099"> 8099 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre for his question.
<P>
	In the past the former third party in the House, the New 
Democrats, used to be called Liberals in a hurry. I am not quite 
sure how we would make that correlation to the Reform Party 
members opposite, but I am not quite certain if they understand 
what happened yesterday. They know that 52 of us, I 
believe-the member for Beaver River does not qualify until 
March 13-became eligible yesterday. I am not being funny. I 
am being absolutely straight with the hon. member. None of 
those 52 people are going to retire overnight.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> No, but they are eligible.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I am eligible for a lot of things. I could enter the 
Olympics. I am eligible. I am breathing but I probably would not 
do very well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> For what you have contributed you deserve a 
million dollars when you leave here?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> No, no, let me answer the question. The hon. 
member posed a question. Let me answer it.
<P>
	First and foremost when the hon. member asked me the 
question, he opened the door and I am going to walk through it.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Yes, you just did yesterday.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Yes, I did. The answer is that we made a red book 
promise and we will keep the red book promise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> When?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> When the Prime Minister and the President of 
the Treasury Board are ready. Our mandate is not going to end 
tomorrow. We are here. Much as the Reform Party may not like 
it we are here for at least another three years, maybe four and 
probably longer.
<P>
	Let us talk about what Canadians want. Need I remind my 
hon. friends opposite, Canadians sent 177 of us to this House, a 
clear, overwhelming majority.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> They sent 178.
<P>
	<B>Miss Clancy:</B> No, 177 and it went to 176. I know the numbers, 
I won a pool. They sent us in an overwhelming majority to this 
House based on the red book promises. The red book promises 
will be fulfilled. I know that, the minister knows that, the Prime 
Minister knows that, and in their heart of hearts the members of 
the Reform Party know that.
<P>
	Heaven knows, if there is one thing I do not want to be in this 
debate it is partisan but I may get driven to it. If I get driven to it 
I will have to arrive there. I am driven to remind hon. members 
opposite that not only did the Canadian people send a clear 
majority of Liberals to the House based on red book promises, 
including the one we are talking about here, but does anybody 
remember the 75 per cent approval rating in which the Prime 
Minister is held by the people of Canada today? Does anybody 
remember that? I do not know but there we are.
<P>
	It hurts me to bring this up. It cuts me to the very quick to have 
to bring this up in debate. I am almost embarrassed to bring it up 
in front of the President of the Treasury Board because I am 
afraid it will diminish his hitherto good opinion of me. Does 
anybody remember that there is a party that is at 10 per cent in 
the polls? There is a Prime Minister at 75 per cent with a 
government at somewhere in excess of 60 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mary, the election is in three years, so check that 
poll later.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Exactly, the election is in three years. How 
grateful I am to the hon. member for Calgary Centre for bringing 
that up. There are all kinds of promises in the red book that will 
be fulfilled over the life of the mandate, including this one. I 
want the hon. members opposite to be calm, to not worry, to be 
happy-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Why was the Prime Minister in a hurry a year ago 
and now he is not in a hurry? Why the change? That is what is 
hurting. That is the perception that is wrong.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Did he say which day? He did not say which day. 
The day will come and it will be a day that the Lord hath made 
and He can be happy and rejoice therein.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I remind the hon. member that I knew of a party once that used to 
brag about its high standings in the polls. We all know where it is 
today. That may be interesting information but in and of itself 
will not get anybody re-elected.
<P>
	The hon. member spent a considerable part of her speech 
defending what she perceived to be a personal attack on the 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. As I heard the 
speech from the member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke he 
was really quarrelling with some very specific things that the 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell had said.
<P>
	The most ridiculous thing he said was that it could be 
demonstrated that a private kind of RRSP purchase would be 
less generous to him than the current MP pension-
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> More.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Sorry, if it was more generous, 
he would resign.
<P>
	He actually suggested it would be more expensive if the 
public put us on RRSPs in a 1:1 matching arrangement. We know 
the current plan is a 6:1 matching arrangement. With all her 
rhetorical eloquence, is the hon. member seriously suggesting 
that she can make the number six less than a one?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8100"> 8100 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, there is a long time theory 
about women and their inability with mathematics. I can assure 
the hon. member that mathematically I am challenged.
<P>
	I neither heard the speech of the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell-
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> I am too, but I can figure out 6:1.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I am sure the hon. member for Beaver River 
probably can do that. As a teacher she is trained to do it. As the 
hon. member so kindly put it I am trained in rhetorical 
eloquence. I will keep to my job.
<P>
	I did not hear the speech of the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. I did hear the comments of the 
hon. member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke. As I made very 
clear, I was making a statement about the contribution as a 
member of Parliament of the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell of his years both provincially 
and federally and the fact that he deserved to be heard without 
his motives being questioned, pure and simple.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I wish to inform the 
House that pursuant to Standing Order 33(2) because of the 
ministerial statement, Government Orders will be extended by 
seven minutes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the motion before the House today reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to replace the current Members of 
Parliament Retirement Allowance plan with a pension plan that reflects the 
current norms for private sector pensions, with a maximum contribution in 
accordance with the Income Tax Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Its wording is extremely vague, when it refers to current 
norms for private sector pensions. Which private sector 
pensions? Are we talking about the pension plan for executives 
at General Motors or Chrysler Canada, or about the pension 
plans of employees of small businesses in East Montreal? The 
standards are not at all the same. The wording of the motion is 
definitely unsatisfactory, and if the wording is unsatisfactory, 
we can assume that the substance is as well and that the motion 
leaves much to be desired, as it will in the course of this debate, 
especially in terms of what is said by the motion's sponsors.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	We in the Official Opposition feel that the pension plan for 
members of Parliament cannot be dissociated from the issue of 
members' salaries or the entire budget envelope that is allocated 
to members.
<P>
	If members were paid $200,000 annually, as they are in the 
United States, it would be obvious that a pension plan if any, 
should be very modest in scale. However, when a member's 
salary is quite low, as may be the case today, it makes sense to 
have a more substantial pension plan. The two go together. We 
cannot separate these  issues like the compartments they have in 
submarines to keep them from sinking.
<P>
	I think it is just petty politics to take an issue that is already 
controversial and say: ``Look at those people in the House of 
Commons. They are overpaid, they have too many benefits and 
privileges, they have a shoe shine service, they have people to 
cut their hair-'' and other people to split hairs. I think we have 
to take a far more comprehensive view, and that is the approach 
we support.
<P>
	We can afford to be very detached about this issue, Madam 
Speaker, especially considering the role of the Official 
Opposition in this House and its life expectancy, in the light of 
its political views. So we have a certain perspective that others 
may not have, in the circumstances. Of course, members should 
be treated in a way that is commensurate with their 
responsibilities. To claim, which is petty politics in my book, 
that members of Parliament are overpaid and make such a 
pronouncement out of the blue, based on nothing, further erodes 
the role of MPs in our society.
<P>
	There was no shortage of occasions in the past for demeaning 
the role of parliamentarians, a role which is often not obvious. 
Very few care about the number of hours MPs dedicate to their 
work, seven days a week. You know, Madam Speaker, 75, 80 and 
90-hour weeks are not uncommon for MPs, but who is counting? 
So, the entire system, both the pay plan and retirement plan, 
should be reviewed.
<P>
	We must also be able to attract quality candidates for the 
position of member of Parliament. My colleague from 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell referred to the 1830, 1832 
legislation which was in fact designed to allow any citizen, from 
the richest to the ones from the humblest origins, to have a 
chance of becoming a parliamentarian. It is not with this kind of 
abrupt rollback of benefits that we are going to be able to set the 
course and stay on course, one which is increasingly difficult to 
maintain.
<P>
	One has to realize that, normally, MPs are elected to the 
House of Commons at the peak, so to speak, of their working 
life, when they are the most productive, building a career, 
whatever their line of work is. So, at the end of their mandate or 
mandates in the House, MPs very often find themselves in a 
vulnerable situation, especially since, as we know, the turnover 
rate among members of the House of Commons of Canada is one 
of the highest in Western Parliaments.
<P>
	Unlike in the United States, where members of Congress 
serve some 20 years on average, Canadian members of 
Parliament serve between five and seven years on average, 
which is an extremely short time. We know what happens to 
members after they retire or fail to get re-elected, how difficult 
it is for them to find new jobs, for all kinds of reasons I will not 
get into at this time. But this is a reality members from all 
political parties must face. That is why we must make it a little 
easier for members 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8101"> 8101 </A></B>
<P>
who retire of their own free will or  who are forced to retire 
because voters have decided it is time for them to do so.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Because of their precarious position, members of Parliament 
must be given sufficient financial resources to get back on their 
feet after retirement or electoral defeat. There is however one 
thing on which the Official Opposition has always been clear, 
that is, when a member of the House of Commons has the right to 
collect a pension from the Government of Canada. We do not 
find it normal for a person who is barely 30 but who has 
completed two mandates to be able to collect a pension from the 
Canadian government immediately.
<P>
	In our opinion, we should discuss the age at which former 
members of the House of Commons should be able to collect this 
pension, by comparing apples with apples. Let us look at how 
things are done at the RCMP and in the Canadian Forces. This 
could help us in trying to determine the age at which former 
members of the House of Commons should be able to collect 
their pensions.
<P>
	Of course, we are also opposed to double dipping, that is, 
getting two cheques from the Canadian government. We think 
that this practice should be abolished. For someone who is 
already receiving a pension or an allowance because of their past 
services to the Canadian government to be allowed to continue 
to collect these cheques while sitting in the House of Commons 
is not normal either, in our opinion.
<P>
	We do not intend to compromise on the age at which one may 
collect a pension or on what is commonly called double dipping.
<P>
	To consider the issue of pensions, we must look at reality. 
Many members of this House or of previous Parliaments had a 
job in which they contributed to a pension fund in the company 
where they worked. When they came to the House of Commons, 
they contributed to its pension plan and stopped contributing to 
their other plan. Often, a member who leaves this House finds 
that he has contributed for a very short time to a private pension 
plan, so he will have to continue working for quite a while. He 
will be penalized because the pension fund is not transferable. 
We should look into this issue.
<P>
	I do not think that we can solve these problems with an 
opposition motion. We will have to wait for a government bill to 
frame the issue so that we can really debate it.
<P>
	We now have a five-line motion. I think that a fleshed-out bill 
should have quite a few more provisions and that a non-partisan 
review should lead to the government presenting a bill, as the 
Prime Minister said a few days ago.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Finally, we said that we could consider the government bill 
very calmly, but surely not in the heat of a debate that stirs 
passionate feelings against members of Parliament, in which 
people are led to believe that MPs are literally sucking the teat 
of state. The whole benefit package of members of the House of 
Commons, particularly their pension plan, must be the subject 
of a government bill that is considered as neutrally and 
objectively as possible, certainly not in the heat of passion and 
especially not one from people who told us at the beginning of 
the session that they would cut back their salary, or at least part 
of it, that they would give back 10 per cent of it and then said that 
they had made a mistake. ``I have unemployed people at home 
and I cannot afford to set aside 10 per cent.'' Such an issue so 
easily inflames public opinion that perhaps we should avoid 
doing it.
<P>
	For the reasons which I mentioned, the Official Opposition 
will vote against the motion before us today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, today's motion by the Reform Party is premature. The 
government is committed to honouring the red book 
commitments with respect to ending double dipping and with 
respect to dealing with the question of minimum age. Reform of 
the pensions is clearly a matter of interest.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Point of order, Madam Speaker. I would like to 
know if the hon. member is speaking in the period for questions 
and comments or if he is opening the debate on the issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ur):</B> The hon. minister is on 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Madam Speaker, the government is committed 
to the reforms that were outlined in the red book with respect to 
pensions.
<P>
	The member for Beaver River, a member of the Reform Party, 
the third party, is very premature and is wasting her time in 
presenting today's motion. It has been clearly said previously by 
the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and myself that a 
presentation will be made to the House before the end of this 
year with respect to the government's plans regarding the matter 
of pensions.
<P>
	One of the hon. member's colleagues mentioned that the 
Prime Minister had said in the days when he was in opposition 
that he could bring in the pension reforms in one day. He did not 
necessarily say it was going to be day one and it does not need to 
be day one of this Parliament. It does not need to be done with 
the kind of urgency the hon. member for Beaver River suggests 
it should be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8102"> 8102 </A></B>
<P>
	As has been stated time and time again in today's debate 
nobody is retiring between now and the end of this Parliament. 
Indeed, there are a lot of things on the government plate that 
relate to reforms in many areas that relate to the whole budget 
process. Those matters have a great deal more urgency than this 
matter.
<P>
	Notwithstanding that, I understand how Canadians feel about 
the pensions and the need for reform. We have said that within 
just a little over one year of having taken office we will bring in 
a reform of MP pensions that is based on the red book 
commitments.
<P>
	The red book commitments are to end double dipping. Those 
members of Parliament who cease to be members of Parliament 
would not be able to collect both their pension and another full 
time salary in government service. Whether they were employed 
in the government service or receive a governor in council 
appointment, they would not be able to be in full time 
occupation receiving a full time salary with the crown at the 
same time as collecting the pension.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	That was amply demonstrated today. The bill is not yet before 
the House and of course it is not yet in effect. Nevertheless, the 
Prime Minister announced today that the designate for Governor 
General is a former member of this House and a member of the 
other house. He will be forgoing his pension while receiving the 
salary for being the Governor General of Canada. It is a 
voluntary compliance and the Governor General designate 
should be commended very much.
<P>
	Once the law is brought into effect it will prevent those who 
do retire from this House or the other place from being able to 
pick up a salary as well as their pension scheme. That is 
certainly one of the very clear red book commitments. I again 
say that the government is committed to bringing in legislation 
and bringing it in early to end double dipping.
<P>
	With respect to minimum age, again the red book talked about 
the concern that some members retire from this House at a very 
early age and collect a full pension. Some members collect it in 
their 40s, far earlier than the normal retirement age of 
Canadians. They collect it as an amount of money that would be 
supplementary to other remuneration they might receive in their 
new pursuits. It becomes part of a larger income that they then 
enjoy.
<P>
	Canadians generally do not enjoy that kind of pension 
arrangement. A great many people have expressed their 
opposition and concern about it to me. This government again is 
clearly committed to dealing with a minimum age with respect 
to the pension payout for former members of this House. It is a 
red book commitment and something we will be dealing with 
very shortly. I reiterate there will be a statement before this 
House before the end of the year.
<P>
	There is another thing which was not in the red book but has 
been added to this consideration. It responds to something the 
third party members raised earlier in the term. It is with respect 
to wanting to opt out of or not be included in the pension 
arrangements, whatever they may be. They want to have the 
opportunity not to participate.
<P>
	Although that has not been an option up until now, the Prime 
Minister clearly stated before this House that members of 
Parliament would be given that option. Members of Parliament 
will have the opportunity to opt in to the pension plan in a timely 
fashion. If as the hon. member for Beaver River and her 
colleagues have been saying for some time that they do not want 
to do so, then they are free to not opt in to the plan. Members of 
Parliament can make their own decisions individually as to 
whether or not they want to participate in the plan.
<P>
	A lot of members of Parliament give up some of their best 
earning years to serve the public. The pension plan for them is 
some further protection. It is one I know that will be given 
serious consideration by each and every member of Parliament.
<P>
	I am sure even members of the third party will give it 
individual consideration. After all, they seem to be weakening 
in their resolve with respect to reducing their own salary. They 
are beginning to understand that they need that kind of money 
because of the hours they put in serving their constituents. They 
have to maintain residences both here and in their constituencies 
and they understand the cost of living and having to do that. 
They are weakening in their resolve with respect to this matter.
<P>
	I suspect we might see some change of heart when it comes 
right down to having to make that momentous decision of 
whether you opt in to the plan and participate or whether you are 
completely out and completely unprotected.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	I would not say completely unprotected because there are 
some colleagues of the hon. member for Beaver River who are in 
that double dipping category who have had previous experience 
in other houses and legislatures who collect money in addition 
to the money they gain from this House.
<P>
	They know what double dipping is over there. I think they 
understand how difficult it is to give up remuneration. They will 
also find that they will have to give very serious consideration 
for their own protection, the protection of their families in the 
future with respect to the matter of pensions. Opting in becomes 
another feature.
<P>
	There have been some suggestions and there are suggestions 
in this motion today, although I agree with my colleague, the 
hon. member for Bellechasse, that it is kind of vague. It is 
ambiguous and awkward in terms of its wording and it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8103"> 8103 </A></B>
<P>
premature. They are wasting their time debating this today when 
the matter is coming before Parliament shortly anyway.
<P>
	They are suggesting in the motion in their vague way that 
there should be some other changes to the plan. There was as 
study commissioned by the previous government by the 
consulting firm of Sobeco, Ernst &amp; Young with respect to 
remuneration for members of Parliament. That in turn, when it 
was completed this spring, was turned over to a commission of 
this Parliament, the Lapointe commission as it is known. It 
deliberated on it as well.
<P>
	Through the hon. Speaker the matter was tabled here in the 
House in July. That report talked about some other changes in 
the pension plan, suggesting there be some modifications to the 
accrual benefit package and a number of other aspects of it. It 
said quite clearly that members of Parliament were undervalued 
by many in terms of the work they do and in terms of the 
remuneration they should appropriately receive.
<P>
	It did say that while there should be some reduction in the 
total benefit package for the pension, there should be an increase 
in the remuneration for members of Parliament and that overall 
it should wash. It should come out as an even package, up on the 
salary and somewhat down on some of the other provisions, 
including the pension benefits.
<P>
	This Parliament has determined there will be no salary 
increases, not only for members of Parliament, but for the public 
service, because we are in a time of restraint. We are in a time 
when getting our fiscal House in order is of the highest priority, 
a time when we must get the deficit and the debt down. 
Therefore we cannot afford to give salary increases to anybody 
in the government system including, having to set an example, 
the members of this House and the members of the other place.
<P>
	If there is no increase in the salary then it can well be argued 
how do we take a decrease in the other parts of the compensation 
program. We would violate the principle of the Lapointe 
commission and the Sobeco, Ernst &amp; Young study, which was to 
maintain the level of compensation but make adjustments 
internally. Obviously we are not in a position where we can do 
that. When that day does arrive we can again look at that 
package of suggestions as to adjustments that might be 
appropriate.
<P>
	The final point I want to make is in relation to the vesting 
period, because much has been made by the third party on the 
vesting period. Yesterday six years arrived for 52 members of 
this House with respect to qualifying for their pensions. I want 
to point out very clearly that vesting does mean that as of now 
they are being paid out. Vesting means qualification to be paid 
out, but they are not going to be paid out. They are members of 
this Parliament. Nobody is planning on resigning or retiring. 
They will be here for another four years before the hon. member 
for Beaver River would have to really worry about their 
collecting that pension.
<P>
	Yesterday was the qualifying period for them. It is a six-year 
qualifying period. That is not an unreasonable length of time as 
a qualifying period for a pension plan. For average Canadians it 
is frequently less than that. It can sometimes be two years or 
three years to actually qualify for the pension. When it is paid 
out is another matter. To qualify in this particular case takes 
some six years to do. There is nothing magical about yesterday. 
It was not an occasion that should require this kind of debate 
today.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	There is a qualifying period that has now been met by another 
52 members of this House. With respect to the matters of how 
the pension is paid out and when it is paid out, those are all 
matters that are still under consideration and are not in any way 
prejudiced by what happened yesterday. Not one iota has 
anything changed by what happened yesterday.
<P>
	That is something you do not seem to understand and you are 
certainly misunderstanding this. It does not help Canadians 
when you make this point about the vesting period.
<P>
	I think it has to be understood quite clearly that six years to 
qualify for the plan is far different from when you pay it out and 
the ages you pay it out at. Those are all matters that are going to 
be dealt with by the government in living up to and completing 
its obligations under the red book commitments that we have 
agreed we would do, and do it in a timely fashion, do it long 
before anybody is going to retire from this House, long before 
you need to worry about any payouts.
<P>
	There are more substantive concerns at this point in terms of 
payouts that relate to getting the deficit and the debt under 
control, getting the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP. There is a 
program review that is going on. There is the social security 
review. We have gone through a defence review. We have gone 
through a foreign affairs review. We are reviewing everything. 
We are reviewing the size and shape of government, the roles 
and responsibilities that government performs. It is a very major 
undertaking, so this government does have a lot on its platter.
<P>
	Notwithstanding that, the government is quite cognizant of 
the concern of the hon. member for Beaver River that we deal 
with this at an early stage, and we are dealing with it at an early 
stage.
<P>
	This year the sitting of this House has almost a month to go 
and it is certainly my hope that in that period of time I will be 
able to rise in the House and advise as to the implementation for 
the red book commitments, specifically dealing with those 
items of double dipping and minimum age which we are 
committed to reforming.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8104"> 8104 </A></B>
<P>
	I am hopeful that the hon. member for Beaver River and her 
colleagues will support the government in its endeavours to do 
that. I know Canadians want to see reform of MP pensions and 
we are committed to doing that.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
we are certainly prepared to look at any legislation that the 
government does bring forward and if it is worthwhile and 
supportable we certainly will support it.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has talked about opting out and this 
minister just mentioned it a few moments ago. He would give 
the opportunity for some people to opt out if they wish.
<P>
	I beg the minister to explain to me how that could be 
ultimately fair in terms of making substantive changes to a 
pension program. In other words, some may opt out but the rest 
will continue to pork out. Is that what I understand? Those 
people who are still in an overbloated pension system because 
they have qualified now would just continue to pork out while 
some people would opt out. I hardly think that is a major reform 
of the MP system.
<P>
	The minister also said that these MPs who qualified yesterday 
will not retire tomorrow. Of course not. We are not assuming 
that these people are going to retire tomorrow. That is not part of 
this argument. It is superfluous to it.
<P>
	He said there was nothing magical about yesterday. There was 
something magical about yesterday and it is that if this 
government had acted on what the Prime Minister talked about 
last August when in opposition, if these changes had been 
brought about before yesterday, the six-year magic marker of 
qualification or vesting date, then for example my friend from 
Halifax who is in her 40s would not qualify for an MP pension 
until her 50s, which is what the red book says.
<P>
	It talks about deferring the age. It talks about bringing it more 
in line, ending double dipping, putting it off to a later retirement 
age.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	Someone in their 40s would now qualify. That is magic to me, 
that is lotto for life, just as simple as pie yesterday that these 
people qualify. If the government is even thinking of moving 
this further to a retirement age I do not understand how he can 
say that there was absolutely nothing magical about yesterday. 
They are eligible now for pension. We are not saying they are 
going to go out and collect it right away either. That will be after 
the next election date, whether they choose to resign or whether 
the taxpayers in their ridings choose for them to resign. It will be 
one way or the other.
<P>
	It is also really important to note that when that day the 
minister talked about earlier does arrive they will be eligible to 
collect a pension also. When a government contributes $6 to $1, 
as my friend from Halifax said  earlier, it does not take a 
mathematical whiz to figure out that this is the most generous 
kick in for employer-employee benefits. It is almost $6 to every 
$1 that we contribute. There is no way that is actuarially sound. 
We can have that proven time and time again.
<P>
	The minister says they only became eligible for pension 
yesterday, there was nothing magical about it whatsoever. If 
they brought it in before those 52 MPs qualified for it yesterday 
afternoon they simply would not be eligible today. If the 
government is going to make substantive changes to this MP 
plan it should make sure that it would affect the people who 
qualified yesterday.
<P>
	What part of eligible does this minister not understand?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Madam Speaker, I am afraid that the hon. 
member for Beaver River just does not understand vesting 
because she talks about if the government had brought in 
legislation before yesterday then somehow yesterday would 
have meant nothing. That is not true at all.
<P>
	The vesting period is not to be confused with benefit payout. 
We could bring in a minimum age with respect to benefit payout 
and it does not hinge on what the vesting period is. That is all 
yesterday was related to.
<P>
	The member is in a rhetorical fantasy about what yesterday 
was. It really does not relate to the question of benefit payouts 
and the age they are paid at.
<P>
	This government knows full well that Canadians are 
concerned about people collecting a pension when they are in 
their 40s, that they are collecting a pension far earlier than any 
other Canadian and we are going to deal with that issue. What 
happened yesterday is of absolutely no consequence in dealing 
with that issue.
<P>
	We intend to continue to allow these people to qualify. Why 
would we do anything else? The hon. member has her qualifying 
day coming up sometime before long.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> March 13.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> She knows it is March 13. She is obviously 
very interested in the date.
<P>
	Let me also deal with her favourite possibility and that is to be 
able to opt out so she cannot reach her day. I wonder if she is 
really going to decide not to allow March 13 to happen. She can 
opt out. The Prime Minister has said that we will provide a 
provision that you can opt out or maybe it will be opting in. It 
will be one or the other. It will work out the same way. You might 
actually have to opt in. You may actually have to sign a piece of 
paper saying that you want to be into the plan. However, you 
have that opportunity. If you feel that you want to save the 
Canadian taxpayer that money then it is up to you to do that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8105"> 8105 </A></B>
<P>
	I would not cast aspersions on other members of this House 
who decide to opt into the plan simply because they are 
understanding that they put a lot of years into the public service. 
They have the obligation, as any Canadian feels they have, to 
protect themselves and their families in their retirement years. I 
would fully expect that most members of this House would want 
to continue to be protected and be a part of such a plan.
<P>
	Revisions to the plan to make it a better plan, to reform it, to 
make it something more reasonable as Canadians are expecting 
us to do and as we are promising to do, will all be part and parcel 
of it.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> You are still getting it in the 40s.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> He did not say that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> No, no. I did not say that at all. I do not know 
how many times I have to say that we are trying to respond to the 
concerns of Canadians about a pension being paid in the 40s. We 
are going to respond to that in our reforms. The member does not 
seem to want to understand that.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Then Mary should not qualify in her 40s.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> The plan is actuarially sound, if she is 
concerned about the 6:1 ratio. It is also worth pointing out that 
the contribution rate is very high by members, an 11 per cent 
contribution. A lot of money is put in by each individual 
member.
<P>
	The hon. member should not confuse vesting with benefit 
payout. We will be dealing with the question of minimum age 
for benefit payout. Vesting is a qualifying period of time. It is 
actually a higher qualifying period of time than what most 
Canadians have in their pension plans. I do not see why it should 
be of concern to members of the third party at all. They have 
really picked on the wrong thing.
<P>
	They have done this prematurely. They have picked on the 
vesting period because they do not seem to understand that it 
does not relate to benefit payout. They do not seem to 
understand that the government is going to live up to its red book 
commitments, but it is.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Open your ears, Deborah.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. The member has 
a question for the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
minister says he understands Canadians and that our effort is 
premature. I wonder if he really understands Canadians. I have 
done some research for members who choose to opt out. In my 
situation at age 52, if I choose to opt out at the end of six years 
and turn over the funds that have been confiscated from my 
salary by your government and invest them with a life insurance 
company, I will have an income of $380 a month, versus a 
member of the Liberals who will have an indexed income of 
$1,500 a month.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Madam Speaker, the member's figures are 
presupposing what is going to be in the bill we bring forward. I 
do not think he can presuppose that. He does not have to worry 
about the money that he wanted to take off and invest. If he does 
not opt into the plan, then he can be comforted by the fact that it 
is going directly to the bottom line. He will not get it. It will go 
directly to the bottom line to help reduce the deficit of the 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> And pay other MPs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> That is the option you have. If you do not want 
to look after your retirement, as most Canadians do, if you want 
to be reckless, you can do that. But we are going to give you the 
option to do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
has been a rather interesting day. I have sat through most of the 
debate and to be very candid, just about every point that needs to 
be raised, has been raised. I was particularly interested in the 
minister's comments.
<P>
	The minister has just finished saying that he understands 
Canadians, that the Reform Party in trying to bring pressure on 
the government is premature. I do not know if it has anything to 
do with the fact that even within his own party there is a 
democratic process that is filled, where people work through 
their nomination process to become candidates and then on 
through the actual election process, and whether having been an 
appointed candidate he rather lost touch with Canadians during 
the process. There is a real lack of understanding on the part of 
the government of the level of frustration. I reflect back to a 
debate we had in the House of Commons in March. That was the 
time when the Liberals were having their convention. We had 
brought the debate to the floor about the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	According to all of the comments by the members opposite, 
the only constituencies that had any concern about the Young 
Offenders Act were the constituencies represented by the 
Reform Party. That is what we were told all day long. ``Oh, you 
are just being extremist, you don't know what is going on''.
<P>
	I found it rather instructive. Over that weekend, when looking 
for something to put me to sleep I turned on the Liberal 
convention on television. Before I dozed off I happened to 
notice that most of the people who had come to the Liberal 
convention were saying that the biggest problem they had in 
their constituencies was the Young Offenders Act. Lo and 
behold, Madam Speaker, you will never guess what was the next 
bill that the justice minister brought in. It was weak and 
ineffective, but none the less it was movement on the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8106"> 8106 </A></B>
<P>
	Where did he get the idea from? Somebody said from the red 
book. Why is it that it took the Reform Party to draw to the 
attention of the members opposite the fact that the people in our 
constituencies, and I submit in their constituencies as well, were 
upset in a very major way over that act? It is still totally 
deficient.
<P>
	It comes as absolutely no surprise to me that members 
opposite are equally out of touch over the issue of MPs' 
pensions.
<P>
	The member opposite asks why don't I read the red book. I 
talked about needing things to put people to sleep. That is an 
excellent idea. The red book, in my humble judgment, is a catch 
all of just about everything written in so much bafflegab that you 
can actually make it appear as though what the finance minister 
is doing and must be done, and that is to get the deficit and the 
debt under control, was actually part of their platform.
<P>
	Every single Liberal member whom I have asked: ``Did you in 
the election in 1993 stand up and say that the deficit must be 
brought under control? We must take a look at all aspects of the 
economy''. The answers all were: ``Well, it's in the red book''.
<P>
	This is exactly the same thing. We have brought this topic to 
the floor of the House of Commons for the simple reason that the 
people of Canada expect better from the politicians they elected. 
We are here to drive, to push, this monolithic giant of 177 seats 
and the Prime Minister and the cabinet ministers to finally, after 
400 days do what the Prime Minister said he was going to do 400 
days ago.
<P>
	He said it would only take one day to do it. What happened? 
Why is it so much easier for the Liberal government to blow 
away $5 billion worth of work on EH-101 helicopters? Why is it 
so easy for the Liberal cabinet to blow away hundreds of 
millions of dollars of work on the Pearson airport deal, and yet it 
cannot do a simple thing like change the MPs' pensions?
<P>
	The thing I find the most frustrating, and I realize that I have 
already said it, is this. I agree with the member for Halifax that 
this job is one of the most exciting, one of the most worthwhile 
things that anybody in the House could possibly be involved in 
as far as their work is concerned. I do not disagree with her for 
one second that virtually every member of the House puts in 
hours from 7 in the morning until 10, 11 or 12 o'clock at night 
and keeps on serving the people of Canada. I do not disagree 
with that for a second.
<P>
	I agree with the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
that this is an honourable calling. Why will the government not 
listen to what the ordinary citizen is saying? My colleague from 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke has pointed out that he worked for 
22 and a half years in the pressure cooker of being an air traffic 
controller. After all that time he qualified for a $17,000 pension. 
The person he replaced worked his nine years as a member of 
Parliament and he qualified instantly for a $27,000 pension.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Why is it so difficult for the Liberals to understand the 
extreme hostility there is toward us as we work hard on behalf of 
Canadians, as we work hard on behalf of our constituents? Why 
can they not understand that this is the one barrier that stands 
between us and our constituents? Why could they not have made 
the changes? We do not seem to get any answers.
<P>
	The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell quoted from 
the <I>Hill Times</I> in February 1992. We all know being in Ottawa 
that the <I>Hill Times</I> is a fine paper and puts out all the facts as 
they should be and is well received every Thursday with all the 
factual documentation that there is in the paper. However it is a 
paper that is read only or almost exclusively by people who are 
involved with the Chamber in one way or another and to quote an 
editorial in support of obscene pensions is just beyond the pale.
<P>
	What he should have been reading from are the editorials 
from the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>, the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, the Calgary 
<I>Herald</I>, the Ottawa <I>Sun</I>. I can go on and on. This must be 
changed and it should have been changed 400 days ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am delighted to address the subject of MPs pensions 
today but my perspective has changed over the last year and I 
want to describe the change for members.
<P>
	Just one year ago I campaigned long and hard against the 
gold-plated pension plans that members receive, which was 
easy to do since I was not at that time eligible to receive one. 
Today I stand in a far different position.
<P>
	For a year now, I have experienced the trials of living far from 
home and family, the extra expenses of being a member of 
Parliament and the very demanding schedule that an MP must 
follow. In short, my whole heart and soul has been required of 
me this past year.
<P>
	Members would be right to ask if my perspective has been 
altered by this reality. Under the current system, if I remain here 
in the House for five more years, I will be eligible to receive a 
pension. I am not alone. Over 200 new members will be eligible 
for an incredibly generous pension after just six years.
<P>
	Most of these new members campaigned to change the 
pension plan, a task we could accomplish today if our resolve for 
change is not softened in one short year. While my perspective 
has changed over the last year, I have certainly not lost my desire 
for reform. I still believe that our pension plan needs change. 
Change at the top is essential to provide an example for the rest 
of the nation. I want to make a few proposals today that would 
bring our pensions out of fantasyland and into the real world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8107"> 8107 </A></B>
<P>
	I would also point out to all members that it is a mark of 
integrity to desire change even if it hurts so I am happy to see 
that Reformers at least are still speaking out on this issue, even 
though it could cost them a significant part of their future 
income. This is a mark of integrity and the electorate will 
remember it.
<P>
	Allow me to set the stage for a moment so that we can all be 
clear about what the pension plan offers to members of 
Parliament. I would like to quote from a major international 
study on parliamentarian's compensation called the Sobeco 
report which was tabled in February of this year.
<P>
	This is what a retiring member of Parliament receives: ``The 
pension plan provides the payment of a retiring allowance to any 
person who is an MP for a period of at least six years. This 
lifetime pension commences as soon as a member ceases to hold 
office regardless of age''.
<P>
	It goes on to read: ``The amount of retiring allowance for a 
member is equal to 30 per cent of the average sessional 
allowance after six years as a member and increases by 5 
percentage points for each additional year to a maximum of 75 
per cent after 15 years''.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	This means that a lowly backbencher or an opposition 
member like myself could walk away, after being re-elected just 
once, with a pension of about $20,000 a year for life. For a few 
members of Parliament who are very young, this benefit would 
indeed be of great value. Cabinet ministers who have a higher 
salary of course fare much better. In 1993 the average pension 
paid to cabinet ministers was almost $49,000 annually. Former 
Liberal Prime Minister John Turner is receiving $85,000 per 
year for life.
<P>
	The study also notes that the pension is indexed after age 60. 
It goes on to say that members pay only 20 per cent of the value 
of the plan while federal civil servants contribute 40 per cent to 
their plan and private sector executives about 35 per cent. The 
pension plan is more generous than those in the private sector 
and even in the broader public sector.
<P>
	I mentioned that the Ernst and Young study was an 
international study. How do our pensions compare with those in 
other countries? Our system is exceedingly generous. Only 
Australia and Belgium top our pensions. In fact our pensions are 
triple the pensions that politicians in the United Kingdom, 
Sweden and, yes, even the good old United States of America 
receive. Not only that, but no country allows the payment of a 
pension as early as Canada does. In fact the payment of a 
pension before the age of 52 is possible only in Sweden and 
Australia. In the U.K. you have to be at least 60. In the United 
States a politician must work for 25 years before getting a 
pension.
<P>
	Finally, how do we compare with the provinces? Only the two 
most generous provinces, Ontario and British Columbia, offer 
comparable pensions but there is a major difference in the cost 
to the taxpayer. That is that provincial members are not eligible 
for a pension until they are at least 55 years of age in Ontario and 
60 in B.C. Can you imagine the difference in cost to the taxpayer 
between receiving a pension from age 30 and receiving it from 
age 60? The cost differential is of course enormous.
<P>
	Listeners will not be surprised to find out that just a month 
before this study was tabled the government commissioned a 
completely new study called ``Democratic Ideals and Financial 
Realities'' that looked at all the same things. This is because of a 
statutory requirement that the compensation of MPs must be 
reviewed at the beginning of each Parliament which is a 
wasteful law that should be abolished as far as I am concerned.
<P>
	However, I would note that the commission's report arrives at 
virtually the same conclusions. I do not know how much that 
report cost but it is the same.
<P>
	There are really only a couple of principles that should guide 
us on potential pensions for members of Parliament. First, the 
pension should not offer to members benefits that are 
unavailable to other Canadians. For example, it must have a 
maximum contribution level equal to that of other Canadians. 
Pensions should pay benefits at retirement age, not when a 
member is 45 or even 35 years old, but 55 to 65 like others. The 
MP pension plan should be the same for all members.
<P>
	I hear that the finance minister may soon allow members to 
opt out of the plan. I still believe this is wrong. Some members 
will opt out but the rest will be allowed to remain with the 
current plan which means that after a long communication 
strategy in trying to sell what they are doing and much bragging 
about change and options and all the rest, most of the MPs, 
especially across the way, will remain at the trough and 
taxpayers will be even more sceptical of their members of 
Parliament. As usual, the more things change around here the 
more they will stay the same.
<P>
	Double dipping must be eliminated. By that I mean that a 
retired member must only receive one benefit at one time from 
the federal crown.
<P>
	Pensions must be actuarially sound where the money going 
into the plan equals the money being paid out of it. I would 
remind members that the unfunded liability of our pension plan 
at the end of 1991 was $12.2 million and that was after the 
government topped up the fund with 158 million taxpayer 
dollars earlier in that same year.
<P>
	The second broad principle is that our pension plan must show 
how members are willing to lead by example when it comes to 
government belt tightening. It is no surprise that when Premier 
Klein started to cut back on government expenditures, a move 
promised but not yet delivered by this government, the first 
thing he did was to abolish-he did not scale it back, study it, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8108"> 8108 </A></B>
<P>
consider it or talk about it-the MLAs pension plan. Only then 
did he move on to work on other government programs.
<P>
	A good leader only asks of others what he himself is prepared 
to do. Government members would do well to heed this 
management principle. The words of comfort to university 
students and UI recipients facing cutbacks will ring hollow 
indeed if members choose not to lead by example.
<P>
	A wise saying applies here. It goes like this: ``Your actions 
speak so loudly I cannot hear your words''. Let us put the empty 
rhetoric aside and start a massive overhaul of our pension 
scheme starting today.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Finally, we come to the solution. What do we offer MPs who 
give their considerable time and effort to serve their country? 
We want to be fair and equitable. I think we need a pension plan 
that is comparable to private sector pensions, but which ones I 
suppose you could ask. There are all sorts of pensions in the 
private sector. I think we need pensions comparable to those that 
are available to private sector executives, for example.
<P>
	Private sector executives get where they are because they 
display talent, ability and commitment. They are rewarded 
according to their performance rather than their seniority. They 
make major companies work and prosper in this country and 
they compete with the best in the world.
<P>
	We want to be able to attract this kind of talent, this kind of 
person to run for Parliament. We need top flight, private sector 
individuals to make our country run. Not only do people 
sacrifice careers and time, privacy and family and other things 
to become elected officials, they also take a drastic cut in the 
salary portion when they enter Parliament.
<P>
	Since the salary range for members is already lower than the 
salary range for private executives, there are few other things 
that Parliament can offer them in the way of compensation. 
There are fringe benefits, I suppose, such as a certain amount of 
notoriety or prestige.  Thankfully, this costs nothing to the 
taxpayer and it is at best a double-edged sword since it also 
means a corresponding loss of privacy.
<P>
	Another benefit is the personal satisfaction derived from 
having direct influence on government policy. Yet another 
compensation might be the pension they would receive. I think 
MP pensions need to be as generous as possible while remaining 
within the industry standard for those types of people.
<P>
	It would be fair for government to match the contributions of 
members like other civil servants rather than paying two and a 
half times what MPs currently contribute. I remind the House 
that the public service pension fund is in fact overfunded 
through employee contributions by a large margin. There should 
be no special deals, no long term obligations that would cost the 
taxpayer exorbitant amounts of money, just a fair deal that 
would allow MPs, like everyone else, to plan their future with a 
minimum of government involvement.
<P>
	Canadians have a right to demand an end to the current plan. It 
is an issue that crosses party lines. Let us not grant ourselves 
special privileges. Let us lead by example and use this 
opportunity to restructure the current plan. By doing this I 
believe we can take a step toward restoring the confidence of the 
Canadian people in the integrity, the equality and the leadership 
of all members of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to ask the hon. 
member for his party's views on double dipping when it comes 
between levels of government. I know his party's position is 
against double dipping as is ours within the same level of 
government.
<P>
	One of his colleagues, and I will not mention names, does 
draw a pension of $61,000 I believe and now is getting a salary 
of $64,500. This gives him a salary of $125,000 plus a year. 
What is his party's position and his own position on this kind of 
cross level of government double dipping?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl</B> Madam Speaker, I only have to suppose which 
member the hon. member opposite refers to. Let me talk at least 
in the broad principles. A couple of things are fairly obvious. If a 
politician gives 25 years of service to a province or to the 
Government of Canada or to the Chamber here, that in itself is a 
considerable difference than the six year minimum that is 
currently available here in the House.
<P>
	One thing is the length of time it takes to qualify for such a 
pension. I think 25 years is significantly different than six years. 
The other is that there should really only be one pension paid to 
that individual. I know in the case he is mentioning that has 
already been made obvious. The member will not be receiving 
another pension from this level of government since he has 
already put in 25 years of service in the position of an MLA. I 
think that is a very honourable and noble thing he has done. It is 
another leadership by example as he explained it well in  his 
constituency. He has made it obvious that he has refused. He has 
written across his forms that he will refuse any future 
parliamentary pension because obviously as the member has 
pointed out, one pension is certainly enough for any one 
individual.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Point of order, Madam Speaker. 
The smart-ass question which we just got-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> That is not a point of 
order.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8109"> 8109 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the previous speaker from Fraser Valley East talked about a 
number of issues on which I want to comment. I also have a 
question for him.
<P>
	The hon. member commented briefly on the opting out issue. 
Canadians should understand that the opting out provision he is 
talking about has nothing to do with the question that has been 
raised by this government in its policy or in fact by the proposals 
the government intends to bring forward.
<P>
	The opting out was a ploy by the Reform Party simply to get 
press attention. It had absolutely nothing to do with a legitimate 
option. The Prime Minister did say if members want to opt out of 
the pension plan he would allow it. It is not being proposed for 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	Second, the member says we should lead by example and that 
we should have no special privileges. I think that is a fair 
statement to have made. However, members of Parliament on all 
sides were elected knowing what the compensation package was 
and knowing that the Liberal Party had proposed two changes to 
the current government pension program. The first change was 
to end double dipping. The second change was to reconsider the 
age at which members of Parliament would qualify to receive 
benefits.
<P>
	Members of Parliament knew that. They ran for public office 
knowing what the compensation was specified to be.
<P>
	Now members are saying there should not be special 
privileges. I wonder if the member would agree that in fact it is 
not a special privilege but a right of any member of Parliament 
to know what their compensation is, what they are running for, 
and what they are going to have to plan for. I wonder if the 
member of Parliament, the previous speaker, would care to say 
what exactly he feels members of Parliament should be paid and 
if in fact, as he suggests, there should be no pension plan or 
something comparable to what is offered in corporate life.
<P>
	It is only fair that Canadians understand that there is a 
compensation requirement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, a couple of points were raised, 
one being that certainly members on the one hand should know 
what they are running for when they seek candidacy. We ran 
under one set of rules. We are going  to change them. They are in 
flux so they are going to change.
<P>
	I do not think there is anything wrong with changing them on 
the fly, as it were. I think Canadians have been demanding that. 
Polling will indicate that this is a very poorly received plan as it 
currently stands.
<P>
	The other thing is on compensation. I know the members 
across the way have consistently tried to make some hay out of 
this but the Reform Party has never felt that the pay package is 
too generous for members of Parliament. It is the pension plan.
<P>
	Again and again we say we are talking about the pension plan 
which is too generous the way it stands and six years is too quick 
to make that much benefit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this has been a valuable and informative debate 
because the government is committed to reform of the pension 
plan. It has taken this commitment by members of the 
government party very seriously and we are in the stage of 
discussion and dialogue and testing out ideas. It is quite clear 
that this problem can be resolved before the next general 
election.
<P>
	Although hypothetical cases have been cited of members who 
could resign tomorrow and acquire large pensions, I do not think 
anybody is contemplating resignation at this stage. We have the 
time and we have to do this thoroughly.
<P>
	It is also agreed that salaries and pensions are part of the same 
package and there is some disposition to think that members are 
underpaid but may be overgenerously treated in pensions.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	That is the sort of balance the government must and will 
consider. Be assured of the one general consideration today that 
we act in the sense of doing equity to everybody and that 
members of Parliament suffer with the general public. Therefore 
in approaching the reforms we have considerations of this sort 
well in mind.
<P>
	Some aspects were discussed during the election campaign. If 
they were not discussed in government papers they were raised 
at all-candidates meetings. It is interesting to note the 
consensus that develops easily enough on these considerations.
<P>
	It is agreed that it is unjust for members of Parliament to 
receive pensions on retirement from the House while still 
young, active, healthy and able to engage in other activities. A 
commencement age at 55, I would have said 60 or 65, whatever 
the regular national pension scheme finally may be is correct 
and is equitable. That is certainly within the government's 
consideration.
<P>
	The double dipping issue was raised during the election. All 
of us agree that the flagrant examples, and there have been 
several of them cited, are ones that arouse genuine public 
concern. Even if numerically they are not very large they do 
raise the issue of justice not merely being done but not being 
seen to be done. Equity  must be done to all citizens. If there is 
one case of a former MP taking a large government job at an 
inflated salary then people are justifiably saying that is not 
right.
<P>
	There are some complications in relation to this. I do not think 
they are insuperable. I think a member opposite said double 
dipping reaches only within the area of federal sovereignty. 
Sovereignty of course is indivisible. I myself would be 
interested in testing a declaratory judgment whether a ban on 
double dipping could not reach to pensions of members who 
have served in provincial houses or possibly at the municipal 
level. I raise this as a theoretical point, but theoretical questions 
can and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8110"> 8110 </A></B>
<P>
should be answered when they have practical consequences and 
if the practical consequences disturb the general public 
conception of what is right and proper.
<P>
	I hope in considering revisions of the pension plan we will not 
merely consider barring former MPs from collecting their MPs 
pensions while they take on a judicial, civil service, 
ambassadorial or other post. I hope we will consider whether it 
should not in equitable terms reach out also to those who have 
taken pensions from the provincial domain or even from the 
municipal domain.
<P>
	As I said sovereignty in classical theory is indivisible. I see no 
reason why artificial boundaries should be set up. Some might 
even raise the issue of whether civil servant pensions should not 
be viewed in the same way and when they are federal civil 
service pensions the logic becomes very persuasive and 
convincing.
<P>
	I have taken note of the comments already made in the debate 
on the balance between contributions by members of Parliament 
and contributions by Parliament itself. This is one of the issues 
the government will be looking at in its revised plans for the 
pension scheme.
<P>
	To be frank I have in mind one possible reform that would be 
crucially affected if there was more nearly a balance between the 
two contributions and that is the portability of pensions. Those 
of us who know the American system of government or those of 
us who have been familiar with universities or other public 
institutions will know that the principle of portability is very 
well assured.
<P>
	People may serve at a distinguished university like the 
University of Calgary and then move on after a year to another 
university. It is a quite common practice for a pension right to 
vest after a year's service. It may not be very much. It may 
provide only for one good dinner at the Palliser Hotel or 
somewhere else but the principle is important enough.
<P>
	It has always struck me as rather artificial that the pension 
rights vest after six years. That provides an inducement to 
members to serve a second term where it may be in their own 
best interests and the best interests of the country might better 
be served if they contented themselves with one term. Obviously 
if the pension contributions by one party, by Parliament, are out 
of line with the member's own contributions that sort of  
sensible reform as I see it tends to break down, or the logic for it 
tends to disappear.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	On the indexing issue which has been raised, it is very clear 
that this enters into larger approaches to social security and the 
Canadian social security network. Obviously what is good for 
one category of society should be good for all categories.
<P>
	We either move to a general system of indexing, which may be 
one way of facing inflation and the generally rising costs of 
living, or we have to move out of the areas where that exists. 
These again are well within the ambit of the government's 
proposals and the government's consideration of reform of the 
pension system and should be considered in that light.
<P>
	This issue has been raised in the House and I think it is worth 
considering: Where and when will reforms begin? Can they be 
prospective only? Is there such a system as vested rights? Can 
you not touch what has gone before?
<P>
	It is true that as a matter of constitutional law what we are 
dealing with is really only a constitutional privilege. That is to 
say Parliament has the full competence to apply any reform 
measures it may devise retroactively as well as prospectively.
<P>
	If we were considering that, one thing to consider would be 
the condition of the earlier MPs who came in before the present 
pension system was devised. I am quite shocked to learn of some 
of the pension provisions for people serving from the 1940s, 
1950s and 1960s, and some of them are still around, before the 
present scheme came in. These are really hardship situations.
<P>
	Obviously there is a difference between what is 
constitutionally permissible and what considerations of equity 
would demand. Any revision by the government should perhaps 
include a look at these pioneer members of Parliament who 
retired before the present scheme came into operation.
<P>
	It would obviously be easier in terms of general conceptions 
of what is right and proper to deal only with present cases, that is 
to say members elected in 1993. It may well be that the main 
thrust of the reform proposals is directed there.
<P>
	There has been discussion of self-administered pension 
plans. A good deal depends, Madam Speaker, as you are very 
well aware, on the competence of those administering the 
self-administered pension plans, the financial advisers. We do 
need some more details here. If the opposition parties have 
suggestions they should submit them in detail into the debate.
<P>
	Most members of Parliament whatever their other 
competencies do not have great expertise in this general area. 
One is reminded of the fact that many members of Parliament 
are lawyers. Frankly many lawyers have great difficulty in 
devising a pension plan that is fair to themselves.
<P>
	The self-administered pension plan looks to be an easy way 
out. However it would have to be some sort of plan that would 
look to a co-operative unit within Parliament and that would 
require discussion among the parties.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8111"> 8111 </A></B>
<P>
	These are my thoughts on what has been a fascinating debate. 
It has been a discussion of useful ideas which the government 
will certainly be taking into account in its announced reforms of 
the pension plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am familiar with the member's riding of Vancouver Quadra. It is 
a riding not dissimilar to that of my seatmate and is in a fairly 
high income bracket with very professional people. I am sure the 
hon. member has probably been apprised of the fact on the part 
of his constituents that the whole issue of compensation for the 
member of Parliament probably is not an issue.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	We could look at other ridings, for example the far eastern 
portion of Kootenay East where the coal miners have been put 
out of work. In the many situations where thousands of people 
are just barely getting by there is probably going to be a 
difference of opinion on the part of the constituents.
<P>
	Notwithstanding that, the chair of the committee on social 
reform is one of the people who will be qualifying, as is the 
Minister of Finance. The University of British Columbia is in 
the hon. member's constituency. The human resources 
development department is saying in all likelihood that tuition 
fees are going to double.
<P>
	In view of that, would the member not agree it would have 
been a very wise and prudent move on the part of the Prime 
Minister and the government to have made this move before 
these people were telling the students that their fees were going 
to rise from $2,000 to $4,000 and that by the way, there was an 
advertisement saying that the committee chair was going to 
qualify for a pension that in his lifetime has the potential of 
paying $1.4 million? Would the member not agree it would have 
been very prudent, expeditious and wise of his front bench to 
have made this move in a far more hasty manner?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
thoughtful question from the hon. member. It is true that I have a 
very great university within my constituency. I met with the 
student leaders there. I met with the administration two weeks 
ago. I have also met with universities outside my constituency. 
For a number of reasons they have come to me to discuss their 
concerns.
<P>
	I do not regard it as a consequence of the social security green 
book that university fees will go up. In fact, I have given my 
personal undertaking that I will do my best to see that whatever 
emerges under the social security green book proposals that 
consequence would not arise. It is not a necessary and inevitable 
consequence of the green book at all. Frankly, the remedies are 
more within the provincial domain and have very little to do  
with federal policy. That is a separate issue from the larger issue 
the hon. member raised.
<P>
	It is true that in my riding the sentiment seems to be to favour 
larger salaries for members. This has been put to me by people 
who say they would never run for Parliament because the 
salaries are too low. Accepting the notion of a pension plan more 
in line for example with university pension plans in terms of 
balance of contributions would be acceptable. I see that 
argument and in fact, I accept it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Should it have been done sooner?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> I think frankly since the review is going on 
and since there is no urgency before the elections, it can be done 
in its proper time. I do assure the hon. member I accept that 
viewpoint too. I would rather see more balance in the pension 
and a different approach to the salaries, but there is no 
correlation between this and university fees. I do not accept as a 
consequence of the green book that fees will go up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise on the opposition motion concerning the 
members of Parliament pensions. The member for Vancouver 
Quadra has raised some very interesting points as usual.
<P>
	I particularly want to note for all members that the 
government in its election platform and its statements in the 
House has said it will end double dipping and the age. Today the 
Prime Minister did show his commitment to make those changes 
when he announced the appointment of Canada's next Governor 
General, the Hon. Romeo LeBlanc. He further went on to say 
that the Governor General will draw a salary as a Governor 
General but will return his MP pension to the government as a 
sign of that leadership. That is outstanding.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I understand the hon. member may have 
a little bit of time remaining when we return to the debate.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, following the Government of Quebec and the 
Mayor of Saint-Jean, Col. Marcel Parisien, Commandant of the 
Royal Military College in Saint-Jean, has proposed to the 
federal government an alternative to the brutal closure of the 
college in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	In a letter addressed to his superiors, Col. Parisien confirms 
that Kingston does not have enough facilities to house the 
officer cadets from Saint-Jean and he expresses serious 
reservations about the ability of the college in Kingston to 
properly integrate French-speaking officer cadets in their 
language.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs refuse to 
consider Col. Parisien's proposal, since the colonel knows what 
he is talking about? Will he finally admit that the college in 
Kingston does not now have sufficient facilities for the 
French-speaking officer cadets from Saint-Jean?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I checked again with defence department experts 
and with the defence minister himself. They confirmed for me 
that once all the costs of converting the college in Kingston are 
taken into account, the federal government would save $23 
million a year net by putting all these military facilities there.
<P>
	What must be done now is to implement the July 19 agreement 
so that the college in Saint-Jean can remain a post-secondary 
educational institution.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister quotes anonymous defence 
department experts for us. He should realize that the expert in 
this area, who is there on location running the college and knows 
what it really needs and what it must have in future and who also 
knows Kingston, is the commandant of the present college, Col. 
Marcel Parisien. He contradicts the minister.
<P>
	The minister's attitude could drive one to despair. He is 
needlessly stubborn. When will he finally listen to reason, since 
he is practically the only one now who opposes his own 
commandant of the college in defending the brutal closure of the 
college in Saint-Jean, which Col. Parisien considers to be 
irresponsible and unrealistic?
<P>
	Does he not realize that he is jeopardizing the attempt to reach 
the goal of 30 per cent French-speaking students in Kingston?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, again, I rely on the opinion of defence department 
experts. The commandant himself is not an expert on the costs of 
converting such an institution.
<P>
	The experts are very clear. The federal government's position 
of concentrating all its teaching operations in Kingston is 
justified and the only problem still to be solved is to have the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8116"> 8116 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec government respect and ratify the agreement signed on 
July 19.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not think that the minister has made himself 
look better and convinced anyone by discrediting the present 
commandant of the college, saying that he knows nothing about 
the operation, when he is himself appointed by the government 
to run the college. He is the government's representative to lead 
the college and the institution and we are being told that he does 
not know his work. They are hiding behind nameless officials 
who are under the minister's thumb.
<P>
	Obviously, the minister still thinks that he alone is right on 
this issue. Does he share Col. Parisien's opinion that the college 
in Kingston cannot provide officer cadets with proper support to 
join the armed forces as French-speaking members and that 
their dropout rate will be higher?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is only 
appropriate since we are now not talking about the entente 
between the Government of Quebec and the Canada but rather 
the operations between the Canadian armed forces that I reply to 
the hon. member's question.
<P>
	The commandant in question was sent this summer to wind 
down CMR. He was not involved in the original decision making 
and is therefore not fully apprised of all of the financial facts 
that were available to me as minister and to the department when 
the closure was announced.
<P>
	What has happened here is something that should be 
explained. The commandant like a lot of base commanders 
across this country, faced with a lot of very frustrated and angry 
and upset people who are losing their jobs because of the base 
closures, whether they be in Chatham, Cornwallis, Dartmouth or 
North Bay, is trying to deal with his people in the best way 
possible.
<P>
	In good faith he thought he was being helpful to the cause. We 
have pointed out to him that the facts in his letter do not add up. I 
now believe that the commandant realizes that the situation as 
we had described it originally and the facts upon which the 
original decision was based is the correct one.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, once on 
site, the commandant of the college in Saint-Jean who was 
tasked with closing the college realized that the orders he had 
been given made no sense. This, I think, justifies his position.
<P>
	In his report tabled today, the Auditor General states that 
infrastructure mismanagement in the Canadian Forces costs the 
Canadian government over $100 million a year. Furthermore, 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs claims that closing 
the college in Saint-Jean will save $23 million, but he is very 
careful not to subtract from this $23 million the amount added to 
the budget of  the college in Kingston for the teaching activities 
that will be transferred there.
<P>
	Why does the government not admit that it erred by cutting 
the military college in Saint-Jean instead of targeting poor 
management practices that every year cost four times the total 
budget for all teaching activities in Saint-Jean?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government made the right decision for financial reasons to 
close the two military colleges, Royal Roads and Collège 
Militaire Royal in Saint-Jean, regrettable as that may be. In fact 
we closed a number of facilities across the country. It has caused 
a lot of hardship to many communities.
<P>
	What I think should not be lost sight of here is that the tactics 
of the opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, and the Government of 
Quebec are really distracting the focus of attention of those 
people who have to make a very important decision in their 
lives. By January 7 they have to decide whether or not to take the 
government offer, the civilian reduction plan, a program which 
has been offered to them.
<P>
	What is happening is that hon. members opposite and their 
tactics are giving those people hope that somehow this decision 
will be reversed. The decision will not be reversed and they are 
doing themselves and the people of the province of Quebec a 
great disservice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true 
that the opposition wants to offer renewed hope to the people of 
Saint-Jean, unlike the minister who stubbornly refuses to 
change his mind.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> As the Auditor General of Canada 
said, the government continues to spend millions of dollars 
more on its real property than what is needed. These 
expenditures, says the Auditor General, are based on 
ill-considered political decisions.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs realize that 
building the infrastructure needed to accommodate 1,200 
officer cadets in Kingston, when this number will be reduced to 
900 within two years, is a waste of money, especially since such 
facilities already exist in Saint-Jean?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are a 
number of factual errors in the hon. member's question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8117"> 8117 </A></B>
<P>
	First of all, any new construction that RMC was authorized by 
the previous government and amounts to normal replacement. 
That construction was scheduled to start in 1995. There will be 
no new construction required as a result of the consolidation 
process of the two colleges announced in the budget.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Second, when the hon. member talks about the Auditor 
General's report, and I have not had a chance to read it, he is 
really mixing apples and oranges. Whatever the Auditor General 
had to say in that area does not bear direct relationship to what is 
at hand with the very serious matter of St. Jean.
<P>
	If the member really wanted to give hope to the people of St. 
Jean, the professors and other employees who work at this very 
noble institution, he would encourage the Government of 
Quebec to accept the proposal negotiated by my colleague, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. That would bring them 
hope because the college would stay open as a civilian 
institution.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government spends more money on social 
programs than anything else. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development is running around the country discussing social 
reform. Yet the Auditor General in his report today says that a 
central concern in our study is that Parliament lacks important 
information on the performance and effects of existing social 
programs. Canadians do not even have the numbers, the actual 
costs and values received, not for existing social programs nor 
proposed reform.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister implement the Auditor General's 
recommendations and give Parliament and Canadians the 
financial information necessary to make meaningful choices on 
social policy reform?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member well 
knows, over the past several weeks the Department of Human 
Resources Development has tabled a number of very extensive 
supplementary papers that detail in a very wide range the 
impacts of a variety of options and choices.
<P>
	I would be very glad to submit to the hon. member copies of 
those papers so that he would be fully informed, although I can 
assure the House that every single member of Parliament has 
received on his or her desk copies of those supplementary papers 
that fully comply with the kind of requirements the Auditor 
General put forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Including 
technical reports as well. The weakness of the minister's answer 
reveals the fundamental weakness in the government's approach 
to social programs. That is an unwillingness and inability to 
assess fully the real costs, the long term costs on what is 
proposed. Weak on numbers. Sauce in the heart but soft in the 
head.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that this is the 
fundamental weakness of the red ink book? It is the fundamental 
weakness of the minister's green paper. It is the fundamental 
weakness of the government. Will he commit to start doing 
something about that weakness?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should 
know that the Auditor General prepares his analyses and 
assessments months and many times a year before the actual 
developments and events take place.
<P>
	I certainly agree that the Auditor General has clearly 
demonstrated in his report the fundamental need for social 
reform. He has pointed out how many of the programs have not 
worked well, how disincentives have crept into programs, how 
there is a dependency growing up. The Auditor General has 
underlined as clearly as anybody in this country has the need for 
social reform. The problem is that members of the Reform Party 
are opposing social reform because they do not want to see those 
changes take place.
<P>
	I would seriously suggest that if the hon. member was really 
paying attention to the Auditor General's report he should be 
applauding this government for undertaking social reform.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> The 
Reform Party opposes tinkering with social reform, not real 
reform.
<P>
	The Auditor General says in black and white what Reformers 
have maintained for years, that increased costs in social services 
since 1975 have made them, and I use his words, ``financially 
unsustainable from tax revenues''.
<P>
	This is a broader question than just the minister's department. 
Will the Prime Minister come clean with the Canadian people 
and tell them that with current deficit and debt levels federal 
social programs are financially unsustainable and that is the 
reason for having real reform rather than tinkering with the 
social programs?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one can only draw this 
conclusion from the hon. member's questions and general 
responses.
<P>
	The Reform Party is not interested in meaningful reform. It is 
interested in mean-minded reform. It simply wants to cut, cut, 
cut. It does not want to change the programs to get people back 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8118"> 8118 </A></B>
<P>
to work. It does not want to  change programs to help children 
out of poverty. It does not want to change programs to ensure 
that people have a greater opportunity. It simply wants to slash 
the programs.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, that is not the way Liberals do things.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	As the Auditor General continues to reveal cases of wasteful 
spending in the federal government, we learn that the president 
of CN, Mr. Paul Tellier, who receives an annual salary of 
$345,000, in addition to an annual allowance of about $52,000, 
received from his employer an interest-free loan of $432,000 to 
buy a house for which he paid $345,000, when he was 
transferred from Ottawa to Montreal.
<P>
	Does the minister feel that at a time of budgetary restraint, it 
was appropriate for CN to grant Mr. Tellier an interest-free loan 
of $432,000 without a mortgage guarantee, in order to 
camouflage this transaction?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the arrangement the hon. member has alluded to with 
respect to the interest free loan is not one that comes directly 
under the responsibility of the Government of Canada. The 
remuneration for the president of CN is a matter for the 
Government of Canada and it is set by order in council.
<P>
	With respect to any arrangements for the financing of a home, 
that is a matter between the president of Canadian National and 
the board of CN.
<P>
	The hon. member knows this is a precedent which has been set 
over a number of years with CN. It also occurs quite frequently 
in the private sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
far as I know, the Canadian government is the sole shareholder 
of CN. Since the loan to Mr. Tellier is $87,000 more than the 
price he paid for the house, does this mean that CN also lent this 
money interest-free and without guarantees, so that Mr. Tellier 
could spend it on redecorating the house?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I indicated, the practice at CN which is a crown 
corporation is compatible with what has gone on in the private 
sector. There is also precedent at CN.
<P>
	With respect to the question dealing with the evaluation of the 
property, I will see if we can clarify the situation and find out if 
it resembles in any respect what taxpayers have to do with Mr. 
Parizeau's home in Quebec City.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
shocked, as I am sure you were, to read in the Auditor General's 
report that the national defence department is the only 
department that keeps track of the implementation of the 
Auditor General's recommendations and it implemented only 56 
per cent of the 1990-92 recommendations.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Will he ensure that 
each government department from now on will comply with the 
Auditor General's recommendations to ensure that the taxpayers 
get fair value for the money they pay to this government.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Yes, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last year 
the Auditor General pointed out a tax problem that cost 
Canadian taxpayers more than $1 billion. This year the Auditor 
General has identified potential savings in excess of $1 billion 
again, including one point where over 10 years we spent $1 
million to design a boat that was never built.
<P>
	Can we be assured that all of the recommendations of the 
Auditor General will be implemented forthwith so that from 
now on we know that we will never see the type of report coming 
out again that shows waste and mismanagement right across 
government?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In his report tabled today in the House, the Auditor General 
indicates that tax revenues totalling $6.5 billion have yet to be 
recovered by the federal government, in addition to accounts 
receivable totalling $1 billion for the GST.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8119"> 8119 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance agree that before he considers 
taxing private health plans and RRSPs, he should first take steps 
to recover these billions of dollars in accounts receivable?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can assure the House that we will collect 
the vast majority of the taxes owing and we will do it with 
interest.
<P>
	Canadians should know that the accounts receivable of 
Revenue Canada are not some fund which is available to further 
reduce the deficit. They are funds taken into account in the 
government accounting by the Minister of Finance in budgetary 
projections.
<P>
	The total accounts receivable stopped growing last year and is 
now declining. I believe that we will continue to be able to 
reduce that sum.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, $5.4 
billion in taxes is owed by 400,000 high-income taxpayers.
<P>
	What explanation does the Minister of National Revenue have 
for the fact that so many high-income taxpayers continue to 
avoid the tax man and keep putting off paying their taxes? Will 
the minister promise to put in place a system that will accelerate 
the processing of these accounts receivable?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member appears not to have understood 
that the accounts receivable are funds collected by the federal 
government, by Revenue Canada. It is not some fund out there of 
uncollected money. We constantly collect the accounts 
receivable.
<P>
	I believe this amount of outstanding taxes will continue to 
decline as the economic recovery continues. As Canadians 
continue to regain confidence in the government and confidence 
in the improvements in the economy that has been brought about 
since the government came in, we will see the amount of money 
that is owed to Revenue Canada declining substantially as the 
recession of the past and the past government gives way to the 
recovery of the present government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Auditor 
General's report today states that during the past number of 
years the Canadian government donated $3.1 billion to the 
Governments of Poland and Egypt to help with their debt 
reduction payments.
<P>
	Does the foreign affairs minister agree with this sort of 
program for the future, considering our current financial 
situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada has obligations to 
fulfil. As members of the G-7 it is important that we fulfil these 
obligations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	When the red ink book talks about reducing the debt and 
deficit was it referring to Poland and Egypt or Canada? 
Canadians would really like to know the answer.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are on target. We said the deficit in relation to GDP 
would be 3 per cent by the third year of our mandate. The good 
policies of the Minister of Finance will make sure that we meet 
our target.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
directed to the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	The Auditor General's report tells us once again that the 
government is not running a tight ship. According to the report, 
since 1987, the Public Service Compensation System has cost 
the government $170 for each of its 200,000 employees in the 
Public Service, while the unit cost for provincial governments is 
between $50 and $70.
<P>
	How can the President of the Treasury Board tolerate the fact 
that the federal government's management of its compensation 
system is so costly and inefficient and that the government 
absolutely refuses to examine many other cases of wasteful 
spending in its administration, something the Official 
Opposition has been asking for the past year?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was not around for some of the years hon. members 
opposite were. Maybe they know about those practices back in 
the 1980s and early 1990s.
<P>
	The government is determined to clean up those practices and 
to make sure the government is open and transparent and 
manages its affairs in a cost efficient way.
<P>
	Certainly we want to study the Auditor General's 
recommendations. We want to be able to implement them and 
make sure that Canadians are getting value for the tax dollars 
they are giving to us, whether it relates to the public service or 
any other expenditure. We want to be cost efficient and effective 
in the use of taxpayers' dollars.

carefully. We do so understanding what the return is. We use 
new technologies all the time.
<P>
	In the use of those new technologies we are quite clear that 
there will be a recovery, there will be a pay back to the system 
that will help reduce the cost of government, help us to meet the 
3 per cent of GDP target in three years and to make sure we have

question for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Northern Ontario workers have suffered great job losses 
during the recent recession. In Elliot Lake, which is in my riding 
of Algoma, nearly 4,000 miners have lost their jobs since 1990. 
Many of these are older workers and many are losing hope.
<P>
	What measures is the minister taking to address the particular 
and pressing needs of all laid off workers in northern Ontario 
and Canada, especially older displaced workers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows 
that the plight faced by many older workers when they face a 
major dislocation in their industry or a downturn in the economy 
is one of the primary objectives that we have put forward as part 
of the social reform process.
<P>
	The great economic tragedies suffered by the people of Elliot 
Lake gives us an opportunity to look at the impact. For that 
reason one initiative my department is taking under its 
innovations program is to provide $2 million to Laurentian 
University and the people of Elliot Lake to look specifically at 
the impact on the miners who have lost their work, their families 
and how a community can begin to recreate itself. This is an 
example of how we can do innovative thinking about the 
development of new approaches for people who are no longer 
able to earn a livelihood through traditional means.

<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

indicate there is a need for a better classification system of 
inmates for the protection of the public and that greater attention 
needs to be paid to the supervision of high risk offenders placed 
in the community.
<P>
	Would the minister not agree that corrections' current 
classification system and the supervision given to these high 
risk offenders is as leaky as the security at Bath and needs a 
major overhaul, not just tinkering?

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary

appointed to assume responsibility for managing improvements 
to practices for supervising offenders in the community.
<P>
	Let me quote the Auditor General in chapter 18.29. I remind

substantive legislative authority, no plan, no goals, no

	As well as looking at what is in there and acting on it we will 
be working on housing conditions, greater employment skills

	The aboriginal people have a saying: Walk in my moccasins. I 
am sure if Reformers were in government there would be no 
moccasins for the aboriginal people. They talk about failures but 
they refuse to accept that there are successes. In 1968 there were 
only 600 aboriginal people in post-secondary schools. Because 
of Liberal policies over the years there are now 150,000 
aboriginal people in colleges. That is success.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I remind the minister that it is precisely the fact 
that Reformers do care about the plight of the Indians that we 
dare to question this. It is something no other party has done in 
this House. The government knows it. That is why its programs 
serving the natives have been an absolute failure.
<P>
	Since 1981 the number of individuals receiving social 
assistance funding in the native communities has risen from 
85,000 to the current 130,000. Spending has gone from $200 
million to $1 billion. These are unacceptable results. 
Considering this, will the minister take immediate steps to bring 
this social spending on native affairs under the scrutiny of the 
Parliament of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have already told 
the House, we shall make every effort to have an amendment to 
the code prepared for introduction shortly after the House 
resumes following the Christmas break. That time will be 
necessary to take into account the considerations that arise.
<P>
	May I add that those cases which may come before the courts 
in the meantime will do so with the admonition of the Supreme 
Court of Canada itself that this defence is available in the rarest 
of cases. The onus is on the accused to demonstrate that the 
principle applies.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadian real interest rates are the highest in the 
industrial world and there are now predictions for another large 
increase. While I do not agree, analysts suggest that the solution 
to Canada's financial problems lies in a reduction rather than an 
increase in these interest rates.
<P>
	Why does the Minister of Finance not order the Bank of 
Canada to lower interest rates?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in an exchange 
that did grievous harm to my career and the hon. member's 
career he gave me a 90 when I made my presentation to the 
House of Commons finance committee. It is with enormous 
regret knowing his great reputation that given that question I 
must give him a failing grade.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the public record shows clearly that I do not believe 
that the Bank of Canada can or should lower interest rates.
<P>
	The public record also shows that when the Minister of 
Finance was in opposition he argued vociferously that Governor 
John Crow should be ordered to lower interest rates. What has 
the minister learned since those days in opposition?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the position that I 
argued in opposition was that the government of the day should 
not place all the burden on the Bank of Canada but that it should 
take fiscal action itself to get the economy going and that it 
should put Canadians back to work. That is exactly what we are 
doing in government.

my question is for the Minister of Finance.

<P>

<B><A NAME="8123"> 8123 </A></B>
<P>
	The Auditor General reports that corporations owe $3 billion 
in unpaid taxes to Revenue Canada from 1993. He also states: 
``Clearly, reducing deficits through more effective tax 
collection is preferable to raising taxes. Taxes receivable are an 
important national asset and leaving them uncollected has a 
serious impact on the deficit''.
<P>
	Will the minister stop threatening students with increased 
costs of education and working people with cuts to UI and start 
paying more attention to collecting the $3 billion owed to 
Revenue Canada by these corporations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat the reply I made to a question 
earlier. We are coming off a particularly nasty recession. There 
are companies and individuals who have had a tough time of it. 
It would be possible for us to drive some of them into 
bankruptcy without necessarily collecting any more money. 
That would be most inappropriate for Revenue Canada to do. We 
will collect the revenues that are owed to us, except for a small 
proportion of bankrupt or companies in receivership. We cannot 
collect the amount that is in dispute which the taxpayer 
persuades us is not appropriate for it to be collected in the first 
place.
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	We will collect that money because our record on collection is 
very good; far less than one per cent of moneys owed to Revenue 
Canada is not collected.

agreed to consider all of the concerns of our seniors, to reorient 
our programs to those most in need and most at risk. That fits in 
very well with what I have been doing as Minister of Health, that 
is ensuring that our seniors get the help they need by using those

	The House resumed consideration of the motion
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to continue my remarks with regard to the opposition 
motion for today, that this House urge the government to replace 
the current members of Parliament retirement allowance plan 
with a pension plan that reflects the current norms for private 
sector pensions with a maximum contribution in accordance 
with the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	This morning throughout the hours of debate there were a 
number of points made by hon. members in the House. I think it 
is very important to review a few of those points.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	I think the most important aspect is the fact that during the 
election campaign the Prime Minister promised the Canadian 
people that he would reform MP pensions. He made two specific 
promises, the first being to end the so-called double dipping 
which is a case where former members of Parliament would 
receive appointments to government and receive not only a 
pension but also the compensation for that appointment to some 
government position. The Prime Minister has committed to 
eliminate double dipping.
<P>
	The second was with regard to the age qualification, the age at 
which members of Parliament could qualify to start collecting 
pension benefits they were entitled to.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister rose in this House and 
reaffirmed his commitment to make those changes and 
specifically said that those changes would be tabled in this 
House within the next few weeks.
<P>
	I think the Prime Minister's commitment to this reform of our 
pension plan was very clearly demonstrated this morning when 
the he rose in the House to announce that his recommendation to 
Her Majesty the Queen that the Hon. Romeo LeBlanc be 
appointed as Canada's 25th Governor General had been 
accepted. In the House the Prime Minister and the other leaders 
of the other parties rose to compliment the Prime Minister on his 
selection and nomination of the Hon. Romeo LeBlanc who, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8124"> 8124 </A></B>
<P>
incidentally, is the first Governor General from New Brunswick, 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	I thought it was very aptly put by the Prime Minister when in 
addition to announcing that appointment he concurrently 
announced that the new Governor General would be accepting 
his compensation as Governor General but that the Governor 
General nominated will forego or return his pension as a 
member of Parliament back to the government. That speaks a 
great deal for the leadership that the Prime Minister is showing 
on the aspect of MP pension reform.
<P>
	Throughout the debate this morning a number of members 
raised interesting points and interesting issues. I receive with 
interest the comments of the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra 
who, through all of the rhetoric going on today, actually sat back 
and recalled, remembered and reflected upon members of 
Parliament who served in this Chamber prior to pension plans 
being formalized and being made for members of Parliament.
<P>
	I think it behoves all members of Parliament not to forget 
those members of Parliament who served back in the 1940s and 
the 1950s, many of whom are still active and around, who do not 
have those same kind of benefits. I believe there would be some 
interest within this House to express some support for some sort 
of initiative to ensure that former members of Parliament who so 
honourably served in this Chamber would also be given some 
consideration in terms of pension reform.
<P>
	I think most members of Parliament will have received an 
awful lot of input from their constituencies about MP reforms. It 
is referred to often as a gold plated pension plan and that it costs 
a great deal of money.
<P>
	One of the things that really does not come up with regard to 
the discussion of the pension plan is how that relates to the 
overall compensation of members. I have to declare right off the 
bat that I am very supportive of comprehensive pension reform. 
I think it is the right thing to do and I hope that the reform will 
take place in conjunction with an overall reassessment of the 
compensation of members of Parliament.
<P>
	I believe that Canadians would want to ensure that all 
members of Parliament receive a fair and reasonable 
compensation for the work that they do comparable to that 
which they could earn within the private sector. I think those 
principles should be sought and pursued by the government.
<P>
	Most Canadians are not very familiar with the lifestyle of an 
MP and as most members know when you become an elected 
member the first thing you have to do is wind up your previous 
affairs. It is virtually impossible to maintain other income 
earning activity and still be a member of Parliament. I can speak 
from some experience as a chartered accountant. I know that it 
took some time for me to make arrangements to have my clients 
transferred to others so that they would receive the service they 
needed.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	However, the fact remains that right now my chartered 
accounting practice as it existed no longer exists. In the next 
election, should I not be re-elected, I will be unemployed just as 
anybody else might be unemployed and will have to start again. 
That is a sacrifice that members do make. I hope that hon. 
members will continue to remind Canadians that all members of 
Parliament have left investments that they have had in other 
careers to come and serve in this place.
<P>
	The other aspect of the pension discussion is what members of 
Parliament do here. I am sure that most members of Parliament 
work four or five days a week in Ottawa, some nine months a 
year away from their families. That investment and that 
contribution to Canada is very significant. I know this should be 
taken into account very carefully when the government 
considers compensation to members.
<P>
	On top of that Canadians should also be aware that when 
members of Parliament go home when this House is recessed 
that does not mean that all of a sudden members of Parliament 
are somehow on vacation. Every member of Parliament has at 
least one office in their constituency, their riding. They have 
staff there to service the needs of their constituents. Their job in 
the riding is just as busy and important as it is in Ottawa. I am 
sure every member of Parliament has experienced the same 
thing where we find that we are working 80 hours a week to 
make a contribution to the betterment of Canada and to the 
concerns of our constituents.
<P>
	When we make changes to compensation plans a fair and 
reasonable rule should be that every member of Parliament or 
every candidate for elected office should know what the 
compensation package is so that they can make an informed 
decision. To make changes over and beyond what was promised 
to be made, for instance the changes in the pension plan, is 
asking a lot for members of Parliament to take at this time 
without some reasonable expectation that there would be equity 
and fairness for all.
<P>
	This whole question of when changes should be made really 
should come up in the debate. I would be interested if the 
Reform Party would care to comment on the general principle 
that when changes are going to be made to compensation of 
elected officials such as members of Parliament those changes 
should be fully debated, discussed, tabled and decided upon 
before an election but not to be effective until after an election.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8125"> 8125 </A></B>
<P>
	With those comments, I am pleased to have participated in the 
debate. Again, I want to thank the Prime Minister for following 
through with his election promises to amend and reform MP 
pension plans.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
member, when our member for North Vancouver was making 
some comments a couple of weeks ago, said that it was the gong 
show, that he could ring the gong.
<P>
	I can imagine that there are a number of Canadians who are 
watching the parliamentary channel today who just listened to 
this wonderful verbose bunch of hot air and they want a gong. 
How in the world can this member say that there should be some 
reasonable expectation on the part of members of Parliament 
with respect to this particular issue when we have all known that 
this has been a major issue? How does that compare with the 
people of Canada who have lost their jobs, who are having roll 
backs in their pay cheques and who are facing hardship, for 
members of this assembly to be sitting around saying: ``Well, 
you know, I really wasn't expecting this. Boy, I don't know''?
<P>
	I have a lot of sympathy, and I mean this in all seriousness, for 
the former members in terms of the reform of the pension plan as 
was suggested by the member for Vancouver Quadra in the same 
way that I have sympathy for Bobby Orr and other people who 
are members of the NHL Players Association when they 
apparently were ripped off in that situation.
<P>
	What about the old age security recipients?
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	What about the people who put away their dollars in good 
faith that the Liberals were going to bring in some kind of a 
sound policy over the last 25 years so that their retirement 
pension plans would not have been eaten up by inflation and so 
that their entire pension plans would not have been under attack 
by the policies of this government?
<P>
	Those being my comments I ask the member: Considering 
that this issue is the number one issue on the hit parade of all 
Canadians, the number one reason why Canadians do not feel 
comfortable with politicians, why they think that we consider 
ourselves to be in a different class or a different league, which I 
do not and I do not imagine any other member does, why does he 
think his Prime Minister has delayed and delayed and delayed to 
bring forward this very simply reform?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, in reply to the member's points, 
first, he commented with regard to the aspect of reasonable 
expectation on behalf of those who seek elected office.
<P>
	When I sought elected office I knew very well that the Prime 
Minister or the then leader of the Liberal Party had made a 
commitment if elected to reform MP pensions. I was expecting 
that and I fully took that into consideration. The reasonable 
expectation that I am talking about has to do with the constant 
suggestion on  behalf of the Reform members that all members 
of Parliament should now take salary cuts, we should just not 
have a pension plan, and so on.
<P>
	I must say that if this House and the Canadian people want to 
attract good people to this Chamber to make sure that the views 
of Canadians and the laws of our country are good laws, we are 
going to have to make sure that there is a fair and reasonable 
compensation. That is all I ask, that there is a reasonable 
expectation that it will be fair and reasonable and not somehow 
adjusted in major way after the fact.
<P>
	That is why I raise the point that perhaps changes should be 
proposed before an election to be in effect after an election so 
that absolutely everyone knows what the story is going to be 
during their term.
<P>
	Finally, with regard to the member's comments about old age 
security, I think it is patently unfair to somehow start raising 
that there are other social programs. We are talking about 
members' pensions. The motion says that it should be the same 
as pensions that exist in the ``norms for private sector 
pensions''.
<P>
	I wonder if the Reform Party really means that. One aspect is 
that in normal private sector pensions, as a charter accountant I 
know there are portability provisions whereby the accrued 
benefits that one had during the period that one was there one 
gets to take them and transfer them into another plan. As the 
member well knows that is not the case with the current plan for 
MP pensions.
<P>
	I would just say that there are some differences. Whatever it 
is, whatever it turns out to be, I am very confident that it will be 
fair and equitable to members of Parliament and to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to address this notion held by some that 
pensions are not required around here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> We have never said that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> I have heard it said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Not today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would just like to 
remind colleagues so that we can all have the benefit of the 
debate to please direct their interventions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> They are very sensitive, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	In any event, I think most people would agree, even 
Reformers, that in this place, the House of Commons, 
membership should be open to all Canadians. Membership here 
should not rely on personal wealth. That being the case I think it 
is incumbent upon us to pursue policies to ensure that not only 
rich people are able to come to this House as members of 
Parliament.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8126"> 8126 </A></B>
<P>
	Consider this for a moment. Someone from a political party 
goes to a school superintendent, a school principal, a lawyer, a 
doctor or a chartered accountant and says: ``Why don't you 
consider serving in public life for five, ten or fifteen years?'' 
The person says: ``Yes, I would be interested. I know there is a 
risk in politics. What have you got to offer me''? He is told: 
``Oh, nothing. Absolutely nothing''. Then the person says: ``You 
know, I do have a career. If I leave this place for 5, 10 or 15 years 
I will have no career to return to. Would you consider that?'' 
``Oh, no. There is nothing there.'' ``I also have a pension plan. I 
have a family. I am 45 years of age. I have been in the pension 
plan for 15 or 20 years. If I leave this place and come back 10 or 
15 years from now I will have no pension plan. Would you 
consider that?'' ``Oh, no.''
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	The person from the political party says: ``If you come into 
public life you take the risk completely. Not only will you have 
nothing to return to and nothing to soften the landing when you 
return to public life, but you will have to win at least two or three 
party nominations and you will have to win general elections''.
<P>
	In other words this possible candidate for public office is 
being offered nothing by the employer. ``I am supposed to take 
all the risk, give up my career, give up my pension plan, give up 
my family so that I can serve in public life.'' The person from 
the political party says: ``Yes, that is pretty well it''.
<P>
	I would think that in most cases the person being pursued as a 
candidate would say: ``Well, public life is great, but it is simply 
too much for me. I cannot afford it''. The fact of the matter is 
that even with the pensions we have now, most Canadians do not 
consider public life. Most of them are in mid-life and they 
simply cannot afford to leave their private careers. The risk is 
too great even if they are eligible for a pension plan six years 
after entering public life.
<P>
	I want to ask the previous speaker if he has considered that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member has made 
some very valid points. The important point is, and I think he 
would agree, that people entering any career should have 
reasonable knowledge, reasonable expectation of what the 
compensation should be and it should not be effective 
retroactively to their detriment.
<P>
	A final comment. I failed to raise this in my comments, but I 
do agree very much with the member with regard to his comment 
on the family. All members of Parliament make a very, very 
significant sacrifice in being away from their families four or 
five days a week, nine months of the year. That is the important 
contribution they make so that they can serve and make sure we 
live in what the Prime Minister says often in this House, the best 
country in the world.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if you could 
indicate to the Chair if in fact the practice of splitting the time is 
still ongoing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be speaking for 10 minutes if the Chair allows.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to speak here today on the MP 
pension plan. Before I begin I would like to make a remark.
<P>
	For reasons that elude us on this side, I cannot in my wildest 
dreams imagine that when we are speaking here how when the 
simple information and constructive solutions we are putting 
forth cross the line in this House it gets so distorted so that the 
responses from the other side come back being unintelligible.
<P>
	In any event, we in this party are not saying that we do not 
want pensions. All we are saying is that we would like to bring 
them into line with the rest of the public. Of all the things the 
public finds distasteful and unfair about this government, this 
House and these members, it has to be the gold-plated MP 
pension plan we have.
<P>
	In fact, the recent commission that was sent to study MP 
pension plans, when comparing them to other countries said that 
our plans were the least stringent in terms of commencement 
and one of the highest in terms of allowance.
<P>
	Let us take a look at some other first world countries and make 
some comparisons between our pension plans and theirs. In 
France and the United Kingdom the minimum age of service is 
55 years, not six years like we have. Australia, 12 years of 
service or age 60. The United States of America age 62. The 
maximum allowance in our country is 75 per cent of our 
terminal salary which is just near the top of all the countries I 
have discussed. We have about the best that one can possibly 
imagine.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	How lucrative is this plan in real terms? Let us look at the last 
election. An MP serving eight years who left office at the age of 
37 will receive $28,350 a year initially and $87,000 a year at age 
60 for a total buyout of $2.7 million.
<P>
	An MP serving 13 years who retired at age 50 will receive 
$39,700 a year initially for a total buyout of $1.9 million. His 
initial payments will increase with the indexing. Therefore the 
last payment will be $64,692 a year. Not bad. Nowhere will 
members find that in the private sector. Nowhere in the private 
sector does such a lucrative plan exist. In fact in the last election 
73 eligible defeated MPs will collectively receive over $100 
million in buyouts at the expense of the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Who's paying the bill?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Shame.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8127"> 8127 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Exactly. In these 
days of fiscal restraint, this is completely unconscionable. The 
pension plan scheme that we have now is called the defined 
benefit scheme where the benefits are paid according to a 
specific equation.
<P>
	It is reasonable to do this kind of scheme in firms where there 
is long tenure, long contributions and high retirement ages. 
Does this look like what we have here in this Parliament? No. In 
fact, it is the exact opposite of what we find here in this House.
<P>
	MPs retire relatively young after short tenures with minimal 
payments into the system. Thus one can see that this type of 
system bears a lot of risk for the employer. In this case who is the 
employer but the Canadian taxpayer. We are burdening the 
Canadian taxpayer with a risk that the private sector would not 
take for itself.
<P>
	The taxpayers in this country are taxed too much and cannot 
afford to be taxed any more. They have no obligation nor should 
they have to pay these lucrative pension plans that we currently 
enjoy in this House today. Currently MPs contribute 11 per cent 
of their basic salaries to the plan. The taxpayer picks up the rest. 
How much is this?
<P>
	If one looks at the entire plan, the MPs actually contribute 
from 20 per cent of the total amount that they are going to get 
paid out while the taxpayer pays 80 per cent. Furthermore these 
plans as members know are fully indexed to inflation.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party as usual would like to make some 
constructive suggestions to help bring these MP pensions in line 
with the rest of the public, this in the name of fairness, in the 
name of togetherness and in the name of collegiality to 
eliminate the us versus them mentality that the public perceives 
of us, to engage in fiscal responsibility and to do our part in a 
small but constructive way to bring the deficit down to zero and 
to start attacking the debt.
<P>
	To make the sacrifices that we are demanding of the Canadian 
public I have some constructive suggestions. First, let us 
convert these MP pension plans into a money purchase system 
that many private companies are doing. This is a shared 
contribution system where the MPs and the government put 
money into the system and into individual RRSPs. It is a joint 
contribution plan.
<P>
	Second, we must stop indexing the pension plans. Private 
plans do not do this so why should we? These measures will help 
eliminate the excessive topping up that the Canadian taxpayer 
must make in order to fulfil the obligations under the current 
payment scheme.
<P>
	Also, by putting it into private individual RRSPs, we are 
adding an element of personal responsibility into the system for 
the MPs themselves. Third, by doing this one is ultimately going 
to decrease the amount of retirement payments through OAS and 
CPP that we would have to incur in the future thereby adding 
further savings.
<P>
	I am going to take a little bit of licence here and bring in the 
social service payments to the retired for a moment because it is 
an interesting thing to do when we look into the future of a need 
that is going to require these social programs for the retired 
individual, in particular to enable those retired individuals who 
are not well off to have a social program that is going to provide 
for their needs in the future. When we look into the future our 
current social program schemes will not be able to provide 
payments to all retired individuals. Why? Let us look at some 
things. OAS pays out around $14 billion per year. CP pays out 
$10 billion a year and the guaranteed income supplement is 
around $4.5 billion a year.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore the CPP current liability, the unpaid liability, is 
$500 billion, a fact that the Canadian taxpayer does not realize. 
This amount of money has to be paid and an amount of money 
that is not factored into any current debt projections we are 
currently hearing. By the year 2030 there will be two working 
people for every retired individual. This is an unsustainable 
situation and cannot last.
<P>
	In the near future it will be a necessity for individuals to take 
it upon themselves to provide for their own retirement needs 
because the government is not going to be able to do it for them. 
They will, I hope, be able to provide for the needs of those who 
are retired and those people who need it most. This is an 
example of prioritizing the spending that we are trying to 
convince the government to do.
<P>
	If MPs were to receive their pensions according to the ways I 
have mentioned in a sustainable fashion in the individual 
RRSPs, government social handouts would decrease, 
particularly government handouts would decrease to those 
individuals of which we would be a part. Therefore we could 
anticipate considerable savings from these programs.
<P>
	There is no way to balance this budget without making cuts to 
the social program situation as our party has discussed before. 
The government should take us as an example of a group of 
individuals where we can revamp our retirement program in 
order to become self-sufficient and in order for the individuals 
here not to become a millstone around the taxpayers' neck.
<P>
	Last, I would put up the retirement age for MPs. As I 
explained initially retirement age for most members of 
Parliament in other first world countries is much higher than 
what we have here. I would ask the Prime Minister to raise that 
to age 55 or 60.
<P>
	I have heard before that government members make various 
arguments that the lifetime of an MP is short and their certainty 
of employment is not high. Many members of the public also 
engage in jobs where the future is very uncertain. It is no 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8128"> 8128 </A></B>
<P>
different for them than for us. They do not receive any lucrative 
pension packages and neither should we.
<P>
	Government members also argue, as has been discussed today 
in the House, that many members take large pay cuts, have given 
up lucrative careers and that we will not get good people coming 
to government unless we have these lucrative pension schemes.
<P>
	I believe that good people will always come to the top and that 
money should not be the motivating factor to get into this job. If 
people are prepared to give up their professions in the name of 
public service then one is more assured that they will be honest 
in their intentions to serve the House and to serve the country.
<P>
	Much has been said on pensions. The Prime Minister has 
promised that he will allow us to opt out and revamp the pension 
scheme. I challenge him to rise to the occasion and do this in the 
name of fiscal responsibility and also in the name of respect of 
the Canadian public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to share with members a little bit of history. This is not an 
issue which is new on the public agenda. For example in 
Saskatchewan in 1977 the then government of Allan Blakeney, 
who was a New Democratic Party premier, foresaw the problems 
of unfunded liability with respect to pensions for the civil 
service and also with respect to elected members of the 
legislature.
<P>
	Before I get into that historical perspective, for a couple of 
minutes I want to say that I believe fundamentally that serving 
your country and serving the public is an honourable profession, 
whether you are an elected member of a legislature, of 
Parliament, or an employee of one of the provincial, municipal, 
or federal governments.
<P>
	People want their elected representatives to be accountable, 
to have a pride in serving their country and to be compensated in 
a very satisfactory way so that we are responsible to those who 
pay our salary as opposed to having large incomes from secret 
sources or sources other than the taxpayers. If that is the case we 
become accountable to those who do pay our salaries.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	The point I want to make in my intervention this afternoon is 
that I believe serving your country is extremely important and 
our compensation should be adequate. I believe that a pension 
system is part of a compensation package, it is deferred income. 
I also believe, however, that the pension system we have now is 
unfunded in terms of its liability for taxpayers, it is very costly, 
and I believe it has to be changed.
<P>
	I do not just say this. I have undertaken some initiative to see 
some change. On September 21 I introduced a private member's 
bill, Bill C-270, which is the money purchase plan bill.
<P>
	It calls for the Government of Canada to change the MPs' 
pension system from the defined benefit to the defined 
contribution plan of a money purchase. It would be fair. It would 
be effective. It would reduce the taxpayers' subsidy of pensions 
from $7 to our $1, to a more fair $1 for $1. We contribute a 
dollar, the employer contributes a dollar and it goes into an 
RRSP-like account, earns interest, and at the time of our 
selection to take the money we become eligible to purchase a 
joint spousal life annuity which then reduces the amount of 
pension that we have, depending on the age of our spouse if the 
spouse is younger than us.
<P>
	This is something that is very important to me. To get back to 
my history comment, in Saskatchewan this type of plan was 
introduced-the defined contribution plan or money purchase 
plan-in 1979 for elected members of the Saskatchewan 
legislature. It has proven cost effective. It is the only pension 
plan for elected officials in the country that is endorsed by the 
Saskatchewan Taxpayers Association, by the Canadian 
Taxpayers Association, by the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business. It is even endorsed by the National 
Citizens Coalition, to which some people may not be attracted 
but at least it is endorsed in the sense of it being fair, equitable 
for both taxpayers and members.
<P>
	I maintain that this is an opportunity for the House of 
Commons. When the Prime Minister introduces his bill, we 
should look at my private member's bill, Bill C-270. It is 
modelled after the Saskatchewan plan which has been in effect 
for 15, almost 16, years. It would be a very effective approach to 
addressing some of the concerns of taxpayers.
<P>
	I want to ask the member from the Reform Party whether he 
has seen the bill that I have tabled and whether his party would 
endorse such a plan which has been endorsed by many of the 
same associations which support his party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
no I have not seen the bill that the hon. member has mentioned. I 
would be very interested in seeing it and my party also, 
particularly in view of the comments my hon. friend made which 
basically echoed what we have been saying in this party before 
we were even elected.
<P>
	Is it not curious that we find the New Democratic Party and 
the Reform Party and all of the other groups such close allies on 
this particular point, whereas the government for so long has 
basically put us off? I hope that the Prime Minister will listen to 
the comments just made by my hon. friend and to other 
comments that have been made here by my friends in this party. I 
hope that the Prime Minister will take them into consideration 
and rapidly bring forward a bill based on the constructive 
suggestions that have been made here today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, from time to time, 
including about 15 minutes ago, I have heard  apologists for the 
MPs' gold-plated 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8129"> 8129 </A></B>
<P>
pension plan say that we need something like this to attract 
``good people'' to Ottawa.
<P>
	I doubt very many members would admit that they were 
motivated to come here in order to rip off their fellow 
countrymen. I am sure that if the question were placed on an 
individual basis, the terms most often heard would be civic 
responsibility or love of country.
<P>
	Unfortunately, anyone who favours this outrageous dip into 
the public trough is by definition suspect, and those members 
opposite who defend the system are dirtying the reputations of 
all of us by their actions. Everyone in this place is touched by 
this national scandal, regardless of his or her personal stand on 
the matter.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	A little over a year ago when I made my little pilgrimage 
across Wellington Street to sign on at pay and services, I also 
signed a simple, hand written document regarding the pension. 
It said, in part: ``I have no wish to receive nor will I accept any 
benefits''. My contributions to the plan are still being deducted 
at source because the Prime Minister, in spite of his repeated 
hollow assurances that opting out will be permitted, has 
declined to act because he did not want to embarrass or 
inconvenience the 52 cochons de lait who made their way to the 
trough yesterday.
<P>
	Why did I and about a dozen others, of whom I am aware, 
make that particular form of protest? I certainly did not do it 
because I do not like money. I am not a hair-shirted masochist 
and I am definitely not well-to-do. I did it because my mother 
taught me not to steal.
<P>
	I submit that an elected body in control of its own finances 
which concocts a scheme through which its members can collect 
six or seven taxpayer dollars for every dollar that they 
contribute is involved in something for which an ordinary Bay 
Street promoter would be sent to prison.
<P>
	The suggestion that to attract quality MPs they must be bribed 
with a golden parachute is patronizing and insulting. Some of 
our greatest parliamentarians, besides working virtually ex 
gratia, had to return to their day jobs when they retired or were 
defeated. They knew what to expect when they ran for office. 
They did not sit back and say: ``Oh dear me, no, I could never run 
for office. I need security''.
<P>
	People with visions of sugar plums dancing in their heads 
would be precisely the sort of people we would not want in this 
place. Can anyone imagine John Diefenbaker or Stanley 
Knowles, when contemplating their first run for office saying: 
``What's in it for me?''
<P>
	The non-pension generations forged a nation. They guided 
Canada through depressions and two world wars and then like 
other citizens they relied partly on personal savings and partly 
on the professions, trades or businesses to which they returned. 
Does anyone seriously contend that they were inferior to the 
current crop of  legislators, that they were less worthy than 
members of the Bloc who will receive pensions for trying to 
destroy the country?
<P>
	At this point I must confess I am going to get a little off track 
from some of my colleagues. I support this motion because the 
adoption would lead to major improvements in the pension 
scheme. However, if I had my druthers there would be no MP 
pension scheme at all. Since RRSPs became available, people 
willing to save diligently have been able to build up modest 
retirement nest eggs.
<P>
	In my own case, because I am forced to contribute my $1 in $6 
to this goody bag, I have to stop adding to my RRSP. Surely MPs 
with annual salaries and benefits equivalent to about $100,000 
in the real world should have enough wit to be able to manage an 
honest retirement package. I should be allowed to do so.
<P>
	We are entrusted with running a country, or at least that is the 
theory around here. Are we so dependent and ineffectual that we 
cannot provide for our own old age without participating in a 
scam?
<P>
	In conclusion, in addition to putting a lid on the trough, 
existing pensions should be retroactively adjusted in the interest 
of fairness. I do not suggest that anyone be forced to make 
restitution on money already received, but anyone already 
drawing a pension should be cut off until he or she reaches age 
65. At 65, the monthly payments should be adjusted to reflect a 
fair return on actual contributions and nothing more.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	In this country retroactive legislation to relieve governments 
of contractual obligations is nothing new. The only novelty in 
my proposal is that it would be aimed at politicians instead of 
the public. Saskatchewan did retroactive financial legislation 
with the GRIP. Alberta did it in order to tear up royalty 
agreements. This 35th Parliament has already done it once and 
would have done it twice if the sleepy folks in the other place 
had not woken up and intervened.
<P>
	Remember I am not, I repeat not suggesting that MP 
pensioners be deprived of a fair return on investment. I am 
suggesting that they be prohibited from further looting the 
public treasury.
<P>
	The person I replaced here was an ineffective and rarely heard 
backbencher. He served nine years in this place. He is 53 years 
old and is currently raking in $27,000 a year to augment his 
income as a practising lawyer. If he lives to age 75 he will have 
collected over a million dollars. During the 1993 election 
campaign he made it clear that he would take every nickel that 
was on the table. That might be one of the reasons he came 
within 100 votes of losing his deposit. People opposite who are 
so intent on getting their snouts filled should perhaps bear that 
<P>

<P>
little anecdote in mind when they hear the Prime Minister 
shouting: ``Soo-oo-ey''.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments, 
particularly on the opponent he defeated to come to this House 
and his view of the great waste of taxpayers' money on MP 
pensions.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that we ran an election in 1993 on a 
thing called the red book with promises to the Canadian people. 
In that red book one promise was to reform the MP pension 
package. At the present time the Prime Minister insists this is 
being done.
<P>
	Has the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia given his thoughts and input to the 
committee working on the reform of MPs pensions? We on this 
side of the House are making input daily. We are making 
recommendations on what we feel is appropriate, not to satisfy 
the Reform Party of Canada but to satisfy taxpayers and 
constituents and to bring the pensions into line with those in the 
private sector. We are working on a promise we made in the red 
book and responding to our constituents and taxpayers.
<P>
	Has the hon. member put his comments forward to the 
President of the Treasury Board as he looks to reforming these 
pensions so that we do compare favourably with the private 
sector?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. member's 
question, no I have not. I serve on other committees. No one can 
be everywhere on every subject. If the hon. member would care 
to take my place on the natural resources committee then I will 
take hers on the finance committee. How is that for satisfaction?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps the last question belies the whole problem here. The fact 
that there is a complete lack of understanding is and has been an 
underlying concern on the part of Canadians for an extended 
period of time.
<P>
	I have cited the example of many people who come up to me in 
my constituency. During the course of a day if I talk to 20 or 25 
constituents at least five and maybe 10 of them will raise this 
issue during the conversation. It is a major problem.
<P>
	I also suggest it is perhaps a problem with the news media 
itself. A couple of weeks ago I had occasion to be on Don 
Newman's show which is done in the lobby. The topic of the 
show was RRSPs and the comments the chairman of the 
Standing Committee on Finance had made about RRSPs.
<P>
	Because I along with a number of other members in the House 
like to do better whenever we can, I called a number of people 
and asked them to watch the show and give me an honest critique 
as to what was going on. This was happening in the middle of the 
afternoon in the B.C. time zone so they along with other people 
in their offices watched as they sipped their coffee.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	During the course of the show Don Newman happened to 
mention the MP pension plan. He was interviewing somebody 
and asked why the MPs should actually be asking questions 
about RRSPs when they have a gold plated plan themselves. I do 
not think that discussion between Don Newman and the person 
he was interviewing from the insurance industry took more then 
90 seconds at the very most.
<P>
	I had asked those people for a critique on how I had spoken, 
was my tie straight, how the interview went. However, every 
single solitary one of them, the very first comment they made 
was: ``You guys have got to get your MP pensions under 
control''. This is something that seems to go right over the tops 
of the heads of the Liberals. I cannot comprehend it.
<P>
	I wonder whether the member has had the same feeling of 
frustration that I have had. Somebody like Don Newman or 
perhaps one of the commentators in the print media will make 
comments about this. However when the Reformers say, and I 
am very pleased that one of the NDP members is saying that this 
must be rectified immediately, that never ever appears in print. 
It never appears on television. I wonder if the hon. member has 
felt the same kind of frustration in that the news media will talk 
about it but they will not talk about the people who are trying to 
make things happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have made the same 
observations as the hon. member. This is almost a non-subject 
in the media. I do not know why. People in the ridings certainly 
think this issue is important. They think it is important to the 
extent that it tends to override a lot of major national issues.
<P>
	When talking to somebody, as soon as the words ``politics'' or 
``politician'' are mentioned they do not come at you about the 
national debt or the justice system. The first thing they come at 
you with is the pensions. Then they get into the big issues, the 
justice system, the national debt, and so on. The thing that grates 
them, that burr under every person's saddle from sea unto 
shining sea is this disgusting rip-off pension plan.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this will be a brief comment, and I also have a question for the 
hon. member.
<P>
	I certainly agree with the Reform Party on one point. I think 
giving a pension to someone who is 27 or 30 years old is really 
too much, because these pensions are paid for with taxpayers' 
money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8131"> 8131 </A></B>
<P>
	The question is this: When they compare members in this 
House with the private sector, when they refer to the private 
sector in this motion, what do they mean? Do they mean 
seasonal workers or people in management? Do they mean 
professionals or individuals who unfortunately had to drop out 
of school very early and start work at a very young age? I want to 
ask the hon. member what he is comparing us with when he 
compares us with the private sector?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will have to ask the hon. 
member what he means because I did not follow the gist of his 
question. If what he meant was do I think the same rules should 
apply to people in trades, people who have professions and 
people in business, the answer is yes. Anyone who comes here 
draws the same salary while here. Anyone who comes here 
would be in the same position to contribute to his or her own 
personal RRSP to the same degree. Therefore I see no relevance 
to what a person's background might have been.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I want to 
advise the House that the government speakers from now on will 
be dividing their time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to join this debate.
<P>
	I am a new member to this House. I ran on pension reform and 
have worked toward pension reform since the election. Unlike 
the member for Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia I 
have worked at it since coming here. I have not waited until 
today to do something about it. I have been in touch with the 
minister. I have been in touch with my colleagues. As the 
member for Cumberland-Colchester said earlier this is what 
we should have been doing during this period of time.
<P>
	This debate on MPs pensions is very important, as the Reform 
members say. I am pleased to join it because I am convinced that 
the government is committed to reform MPs pensions. I for one 
am determined to see that the government does.
<P>
	I would like to point out to hon. members and the people 
following this debate that the opposition motion about replacing 
the existing pension plan states that we should replace the 
existing pension plan ``with a pension plan that reflects the 
commitments made in the document entitled ``Creating 
Opportunity'', the Liberal plan for Canada''.
<P>
	That is of course the red book. I am glad the Reform Party 
recognizes the significant contribution the red book has made to 
the debate on MPs pensions, just as it has made a significant 
contribution to focusing debate in this Chamber for the last year 
since the election.
<P>
	That red book with its list of commitments and with its 
articulation of the philosophy of this government has provided a 
tremendous focus for innumerable issues including among them 
MPs pensions. Within that matter  of MPs pensions, it has drawn 
attention to one thing which I noticed the members opposite are 
not discussing very much. It has focused public attention on the 
important question of double dipping.
<P>
	I would like in the short time that I have available to focus on 
double dipping. I know that my colleagues from Halifax, 
Vancouver Quadra, Mississauga South and Vaudreuil have 
spoken on the matter of the age at which the pension should be 
received. I am very interested in and would like to talk 
particularly about double dipping.
<P>
	Double dipping means simultaneously drawing a pension as a 
former member of Parliament and a salary from the federal 
government. It is a practice that has obviously and I would say 
rightly angered may Canadians. I know it has angered many 
people in my riding of Peterborough.
<P>
	Let me remind hon. members of the wording of the red book 
statement on double dipping. We said: ``A Liberal government 
will reform the pension plan of members of Parliament ending 
double dipping. MPs should not be able to leave office and 
receive a pension from the federal government if they accept a 
new full time paying job with the federal government''. I 
suggest nothing could be clearer than that. This is the 
commitment that has been repeated by this government since the 
last election. We will end double dipping.
<P>
	Some of the members opposite have been talking about 
timing. I myself have argued from this side that we should have 
moved earlier on this matter and on the age of receipt of 
pensions. There has been pressure on this House to do with the 
economy, to do with stimulating the economy, to do with 
creating jobs. In that pressure it seems that this matter has been 
left but I personally hope it is dealt with very soon. I am sure it is 
going to be dealt with.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	Before we go any further, we have heard some of this from the 
other side, let me say that I do not want to here cast dispersions 
on former members of Parliament who were entitled under the 
existing act to receive both pension and another federal salary.
<P>
	There are many MPs who have served this country well and 
who are continuing to do good work in other federal positions. 
Clearly it is time for the rules under which those honest 
members of Parliament work to be changed.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you may wonder why this situation cropped up in 
the first place. In the mid-1970s pensions were being viewed 
increasingly as an earned right. Some people viewed their 
pensions as deferred compensation. In their view reducing or 
suspending pensions on gaining another job was similar to 
retroactively cutting a pensioner's salary.
<P>
	In 1975 the government of the day decided that the fairest 
approach would be to allow federal pensioners to draw a pension
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8132"> 8132 </A></B>
<P>
and a salary unless they again came under  the same pension 
plan. As an example, a former MP who joined the public service 
could get a pension and a salary while a former member who was 
later re-elected to Parliament could not get both the MP's salary 
and the MP's pension at the same time. The idea was then that a 
career of a member of Parliament and a career of a public service 
employee are quite distinct, even though they are both paid by 
the federal government.
<P>
	Whatever validity this argument may have, it is clear that 
Canadians today feel that drawing a pension and a salary at the 
same time from the public purse is unacceptable. They have 
strong feelings, as the members have said, about MPs' pensions, 
including the double dipping issue. I agree with them.
<P>
	Whatever hon. members may feel about some of the media's 
comments on pensions, I believe the media at this time is truly 
indicating the views of most Canadians. Let me give some 
examples of what the media is saying on this matter. The Ottawa 
Sun said in a July editorial: ``Today politics is a major league 
profession with major league bucks, whether it's as an MP, a 
lobbyist, a senator, or a budding patronage appointee. We don't 
find many former politicians lining up at food banks or 
unemployment offices, do we?''.
<P>
	There are some people, I suppose, who might challenge those 
sentiments. I am not one. It is a widespread opinion in this 
country and double dipping contributes to the negative image of 
this House and of members in it. I particularly like the mention 
of lobbyists in that editorial that I just quoted. I do think that 
lobbyists might well be subject to the same rules as members of 
Parliament in their pensions and in their remuneration.
<P>
	The Vancouver <I>Sun</I> said in a March 16 editorial: ``Short of 
lowering taxes, the federal government could not do more to 
reverse Canadians' surly mood than to slash the pay, perks and 
pensions of members of Parliament''.
<P>
	I am not sure that pension changes could single handedly turn 
around the surly mood referred to in the editorial. I am 
convinced that removing the right to double dip would help. The 
symbolism of a change in MPs' pensions today is enormous, 
going beyond many of the arguments about what members earn 
or what they should earn and things of that type. A change in the 
double dipping provision and other changes will have great 
impact in Canada and I support them.
<P>
	From the St. John's <I>Evening Telegram</I>: ``Don't count on many 
MPs saying no to the pension cash cow. Preston Manning's 
penny pinching Reformers were quickly converted to the 
spendthrift ways''-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. It is a fine line. The 
member might be quoting from an article. Maybe I lost sight of 
that, but let me just take the time to remind members to the 
extent possible not to refer to members unless of course 
referring to their riding or  other portfolios they may hold within 
the parliamentary precinct.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do apologize for that. In quoting 
the St. John's <I>Evening Telegram</I> I should have said the leader of 
the Reform Party's ``penny pinching Reformers were quickly 
converted to the spendthrift ways of their fellow Commons 
denizens once elected. Meanwhile, the rest of the taxpaying 
public gets stuck with the bill''.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	It seems to me that editorial writers are suspicious even of 
opposition members. This concerns me. This doubt about the 
interests and purposes of members of Parliament is an important 
matter for us all. It is something which is very disturbing and 
which is fundamental to the efficiency of what we do in this 
House.
<P>
	I would like to see us move to a pension plan which is fair and 
equitable, which abolishes double dipping, which sets a clear 
age at which the pension should be received and which sets an 
example to other pension plans in the country.
<P>
	It is my assumption, because it is in the red book, that the 
Government of Canada is going to do just that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, while I agree 
with the member in the areas that he has debated, because they 
were in the book and they are part of the small agenda of the 
Liberals in revamping this plan, I would like to know whether 
the member has any affinity at all for making the plan more fair 
mathematically, more fair from an actuarial point of view.
<P>
	Is it fair that a person like myself in my previous position 
should pay into a pension plan for 27 years to get the same 
benefit that an MP here can get in about six or seven years? 
There is an element of unfairness there that I think is perceived 
by the Canadian people right across this country that the growth 
rate is much too fast, notwithstanding that we contribute 
probably a higher percentage than they do. At the same time the 
growth is way out of line.
<P>
	I would like to know the member's opinion because he seems 
to be quite in agreement with the need to revamp the pension 
scheme.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said the government is in 
agreement with the need to revise the pension plan. It is still the 
government's intention to revise the pension plan.
<P>
	I would say to the member for Elk Island that he and I got the 
same number of stars in the advertisement that appeared in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> the other day.
<P>
	I personally believe although I am not an accountant that one 
of the most serious flaws in the present system is that it is 
impossible to calculate what the payout will be. Any plan of this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8133"> 8133 </A></B>
<P>
type, any insurance policy has to be based on some 
mathematical calculation.
<P>
	One of the reasons for that, and I think the member for Elk 
Island is aware of this, is the fact that there is no set retirement 
date. Without a set retirement date it is impossible to say, to 
calculate, to estimate how long people will collect their pension. 
This I find disgraceful. It is disgraceful that someone could draw 
a pension at 25, and we cannot calculate the fact that they will be 
drawing it for 60 years. That is one point.
<P>
	My second point is that it is not true that if you are in your 
pension plan for 27 years you get the same as in this one at six 
years. In your plan at 27 years your premiums and your 
employers' premiums, if you are employed, are vested after a 
certain period of time and you do retain those funds. Then when 
you reach retirement age if you were not in it for 27 years you 
would draw the benefits of those vested funds.
<P>
	I think in this case the period of time which we might debate is 
simply that, a vesting period. The members who lose an election 
after six years leave if they are not of retirement age. At 
retirement age they collect a pension which is based on the 
vested portion of their pension contributions.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to support the motion put today, which would allow the 
government to keep the promises it made with respect to 
pensions for members of Parliament. These promises were 
published in the document entitled <I>Creating Opportunity</I>, 
otherwise known as <I>The Liberal Plan for Canada</I>, the famous 
red book.
<P>
	As the members know, this document contains two specific 
commitments regarding the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Not only did the government undertake to end double dipping, 
but also to review the question of the minimum age at which 
members may begin to draw their pension.
<P>
	As the member for Peterborough has just spoken about double 
dipping, I would like to look at the second issue, the one 
concerning age.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act 
currently does not require a member to have reached a specific 
age before becoming eligible to receive a pension. Once a 
member has six years pensionable service to his or her credit he 
or she can draw the benefit immediately upon leaving office 
regardless of their age at that time.
<P>
	The philosophy behind this feature was that an MP's pension 
should provide some immediate income which will assist the 
member in making the transition from public life to private life. 
As all members of Parliament know, our tenure in this House is 
by no means guaranteed. Job security is not just a feature of 
public life. Our careers as parliamentarians are frequently up for 
renewal and can be abruptly brought to an end. As well it is not 
always certain that on leaving office we will quickly or easily 
find alternative employment.
<P>
	The availability of immediate income on leaving office can be 
a particularly important factor for members who have young 
families who must consider the need for another source of 
income when no longer receiving a seasonal indemnity but have 
not yet found new employment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This does not mean that I think that the existing provisions 
should remain as they are. I do, however, think that in the 
absence of appropriate transitional measures to help members of 
Parliament who leave office meet their financial needs, some 
members may suffer a loss, especially those who leave office 
when they are still relatively young.
<P>
	Under the existing plan, a member who is defeated after six 
years of service does not receive a lump sum separation 
allowance. Such an allowance is paid only if the member is not 
entitled to a pension on leaving office.
<P>
	Many private companies offer employees whose career is 
unexpectedly interrupted an amount of money to compensate for 
their involuntary departure, even though the employee may also 
be entitled to a pension. This provides the laid-off employee 
with some income while he is looking for a new job and starting 
over in a new career.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If the payment of pensions under the Members of Parliament 
Retiring Allowances Act is deferred so that pensions do not 
become payable until a certain age is reached it may well be 
necessary to introduce improved separation benefits to ensure 
that MPs' immediate financial needs are properly met much like 
the severance pay offered in the private sector.
<P>
	The question is what would be an appropriate minimum 
pensionable age for members of Parliament. Some would argue 
that age 65 should be the pensionable age because this is the 
most usual age for Canadians to begin drawing a pension. Then 
again others might feel 60 is appropriate as this is also a 
common retirement age, especially in the public sector.
<P>
	I feel that age 55 is justifiable since finding alternative 
employment at or after this age is not an easy matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8134"> 8134 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We should also ask ourselves whether there should be a 
minimum age for eligibility for a reduced pension, say 50 years, 
and whether members should be allowed to draw a pension 
before this minimum age in cases of disability.
<P>
	Should we base our approach on the pension plans offered by 
other Canadian employers in order to settle on an appropriate 
pensionable age for members of Parliament, or should we be 
looking at what is done in other Canadian legislative 
assemblies?
<P>
	There are marked differences between the pension plan 
provisions of the various provincial legislative assemblies. New 
Brunswick has no minimum pensionable age. MLAs in 
Saskatchewan, the Yukon and the Northwest Territories cannot 
draw their pensions until age 55; in Nova Scotia, the minimum 
age is 50.
<P>
	A number of provinces use a formula to establish pensionable 
age. In Newfoundland, the age and the number of years of 
service must add up to 60. In Ontario, a member may begin to 
draw a pension when his age and years of service add up to 55.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The province of Quebec provides for a pension to begin when 
a member of the National Assembly reaches the service and age 
of 65. The member must be at least 50 years old before receiving 
a pension.
<P>
	I am confident that I speak for the vast majority of my fellow 
colleagues in the House when I state that none of us were 
motivated to run for public office by mere financial rewards. I 
am sure that I can confidently say that we all knew what we were 
getting into despite the many hardships our families must 
undergo, despite the extra expenses such as clothing, lodging, 
transportation and others.
<P>
	We are debating today pension reform. Those who feel 
underpaid as an MP and those who feel they should be paid what 
the private sector pays are correct, but that makes for an entirely 
separate debate. My concern is that if we undervalue the work, 
dedication and sacrifices made by an MP and their families, we 
stand to discourage Canadians from wanting to offer their 
services for public office.
<P>
	Two questions come to mind immediately. Will people in their 
forties and late thirties be motivated knowing that they may face 
the prospects of re-employment near the end of their career? 
Will we not instead be encouraging only older individuals or 
rather wealthy individuals to run for public office? Canada 
would best be served in my opinion by having young and old, 
small and large business people, young and older lawyers, 
accountants and professionals. The successful as well as the less 
successful must all be motivated to seek public office, not just 
the wealthy.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the hon. members can see, the government should consider 
the various choices it has and take into account a number of 
factors in reviewing the Members of Parliament Retirement 
Allowance Act. The government knows full well that the 
Canadian taxpayers are against former members of the House of 
Commons being allowed to receive generous unreduced 
pensions years before normal retirement age.
<P>
	We also know that this matter of public concern can be dealt 
with in a number of different ways. This government remains 
committed to winning back public confidence and keeping its 
promise with respect to the reform of MPs pension.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, I fully support the reform of MPs pensions. As 
well I support the removal of double dipping and I fully support 
increasing the minimum age to 55 at which an MP may obtain 
their pension.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the member's comments. I want to make a couple of 
comments regarding his speech and ask him a question or two.
<P>
	He said he would certainly support any government 
legislation which would raise the age of anything with a 
minimum of six years service to age 55. Our party I suspect 
would support that in the House of Commons if and only if the 
member's employer-employee contributions would be changed 
from six to one to one to one. For every dollar we contribute out 
of our salary the government would match that.
<P>
	As it is now, and the hon. member should know, the 
government is putting in about $6 for every $1 that we are 
putting in. That is unsaleable from sea to sea to sea in this 
country. I suspect that when he goes home it is not a lot different 
from my situation or from anyone else here when they hear how 
people feel.
<P>
	He talked also about the re-entry to private life in the private 
sector. There is no one in this Chamber who would disagree that 
it may be difficult to get back in and work back into the clientele 
you had before or whatever your professional job was. My 
trough day will be March 13. I hope we have made substantive 
changes before then. It is unfortunate that we missed 52 other 
members. I am willing to say let us make substantive changes to 
the program before my trough day on March 13.
<P>
	If I were to re-enter private life then I would get a pension 
straight through from age 42 on. There is something dreadfully 
wrong about that. My question to this member is, why can we 
not have some sort of a severance package for people who are 
re-entering their private lives? If we are going back into the 
workforce let us have some sort of severance package that the 
government would offer. That is fine. But why not defer 
pensions until a later age? Why should I and other  members get 
a pension straight through from the day after an election? Bang, 
it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8135"> 8135 </A></B>
<P>
takes place the very next day. Why should I, for instance, be 
allowed to get a pension the next day?
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	Why not some sort of generous severance package that will 
help members reintegrate into life and then the pension is 
deferred?
<P>
	I have heard any number of members, including the member 
for Mississauga South, today talking about this being a family 
issue now and how painful it is for each of us to go back to 
private life and get another job. Fair enough. Why not just a 
severance package that would see us into that entry phase and 
not a pension that is going to click in the next day and go on for 
ever and ever, amen?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, I said that in my speech. Part of 
it was in French and the hon. member may not have had her 
listening device on but I said two things in my speech. The first 
thing is that I agree there are two separate issues here. One is a 
question of severance pay when a member is defeated.
<P>
	The general fallacy here is that when we serve six years, we 
seem to be able to collect a pension of a million dollars or so. I 
defy the members opposite to do their records and search. The 
average tenure of a member of Parliament is probably fewer 
than six years. I would say it is somewhere between five and six 
years. That is the average tenure of a parliamentarian. It is 
because of that job insecurity factor that I spoke about.
<P>
	I come from a municipal background. Even councillors and 
mayors have a severance package built in. The law in Quebec 
now is a formal law that allows for a certain amount of severance 
package over a certain number of years.
<P>
	The question of severance is one thing. I agree with the 
member that we should provide for it in the new legislation to 
allow people to reintegrate into the workforce. My own personal 
case is that I had to sacrifice the computer business that I built at 
the age of 29. I do not think that computer business will survive 
without me. I hope it will.
<P>
	The other question is the question of pensions. I disagree with 
the member totally that the amount of the pension is over 
generous. If we bring the age up to 55 like I am proposing, that 
will solve a lot of the problems that the member is speaking of.
<P>
	The average pension of a member of Parliament at age 55 will 
be about $18,000 or $19,000. The hon. member may feel that 
$18,000 is not justifiable in her case. I know that I worked very 
hard in my case. I have made a lot of sacrifices and my citizens 
are telling me: ``Nick, reform the pension, yes because it is 
outrageous the way it is now but make it equitable''. I think 
$18,000 at age 55 is not unreasonable and not inequitable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise on this opposition day to speak to the 
opposition motion, which provides:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to replace the current Members of 
Parliament Retirement Allowance plan with a pension plan that reflects the 
current norms for private sector pensions, with a maximum contribution in 
accordance with the Income Tax Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will try to contribute to the debate by offering some food for 
thought, because I think that the issue of pensions raises 
considerable concern among Canadians, who ask us many 
questions on this subject. They ask us these questions because of 
their perception of members' pensions and benefits.
<P>
	First of all, the Official Opposition is clearly opposed to the 
motion as it stands, and I will tell you why. Adjusting pensions 
in accordance with private-sector standards does not tell us 
anything about the type of adjustment and the type of private 
sector.
<P>
	We wonder if our pensions should reflect the plans 
established for senior officials and company executives or the 
already very inadequate pensions collected by some workers in 
different sectors. The motion does not tell us which way to go. 
We must do more thinking on the issue and set the conditions in 
which this reform must take place, before going ahead with such 
a vaguely worded motion.
<P>
	It is true that people's perception of members' pensions and 
benefits is often shaped by the media, which call attention to the 
significant benefits enjoyed by members of Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	In this regard, we think that the Reform Party's debate on 
members' pensions should revolve around two extremely 
important issues.
<P>
	First of all, the Official Opposition wants to avoid all kinds of 
double dipping, for example when someone retires after 
working for the government and then takes another government 
job, thus accumulating other pensions. I think that, on this, we 
clearly agree with the other parties that the practice of 
accumulating multiple pensions must be eliminated.
<P>
	Our second point is extremely important. Our constituents 
often bring up the age issue. The matter of pensions must be 
dealt with fairly and equitably. In this regard, I think that we 
agree with everyone that the age issue must be reviewed.
<P>
	May I remind you that one of the Reform Party's election 
promises was to cut what the party itself calls the three Ps, 
namely the pay, pensions and privileges of members. That 
political formation estimates that a significant cut in members' 
pensions would save around $1.5 million over five years. The 
approach used is important because members' functions, duties 
and responsibilities must be considered. I think that dealing  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8136"> 8136 </A></B>
<P>
with the issue of members' pensions by cutting government 
spending is entirely beside the point.
<P>
	According to Jean Dion, an editorial writer in <I>Le Devoir</I>, 
cutting members' benefits would, of course, save money. After 
the election, it was estimated that pensions payable to defeated 
members totalled $109 million over a period of twenty years or 
one-quarter of one per cent of the deficit for the financial year 
1992-93 alone.
<P>
	A review of allowances, benefits or pensions payable to 
parliamentarians should not, in our opinion, be seen as a way to 
put government finances on a sound footing, as a way to fight the 
federal deficit or to achieve that great common ideal of fair 
distribution of wealth in our democracy. We should be realistic 
and consider the context.
<P>
	On the issue of pensions, of course pensions and salaries are 
linked because they are part of the total compensation plan. It 
would be irresponsible to separate them. I think we should 
follow certain guidelines when we look at the treatment of 
members' pensions. We should consider making them 
commensurate with the responsibility a member has. I think 
there is a context we must consider. We should be able to take 
this debate a little further. To all the people who are watching us, 
to all those who sent us to Parliament to manage the 
government's affairs, we should be able to explain the 
responsibilities of a member as such, because once we are 
elected, the first thing a member has to do is to take on the 
responsibilities and activities that go with his position.
<P>
	So we should take a good look at the issue of level of 
responsibility, because it is a factor throughout our society in 
every area of activity. A society functions and develops because 
people in a variety of sectors and organizations, both private and 
public, are responsible and take on certain responsibilities. We 
should look at members in the same way, as people who perform 
tasks with a high level of responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Account should also be taken of what attracts people to the job 
of member of Parliament. There is no doubt that most of the 
people elected to this House are people who want to have a 
responsibility in how the government is run, who want to make a 
contribution to society, to help it evolve, to see progress made.
<P>
	We are talking about members from many different 
backgrounds, men and women, with a variety of skills and 
training, who are able to seek office and come here to pool their 
talents and knowledge with other members. In this context, 
there must also exist a certain number of conditions that will 
attract people of quality to political life.
<P>
	Another factor to be considered is our individual financial 
independence, our own resources to draw on in carrying out our 
work, with the expenses that entails, and our independence from 
outside contributions. We must therefore remember that those 
elected to office must be able to operate in a context of financial 
independence.
<P>
	The question cannot be examined without looking at the 
fundamental framework. Earlier, I listened to my colleagues as 
they raised a number of concerns that I share. I would like, on 
behalf of the official opposition, to reiterate a number of these 
points that we feel are essential to the debate on whether to 
reform the pension plan of members of Parliament.
<P>
	First of all, I think that we are all well aware of the 
precariousness of the positions we hold. I often say to my 
colleagues and co-workers that we must never forget that we are 
just passing through, and some do so more quickly than others. 
Our mandate is for a very specific length of time.
<P>
	We must, during this mandate, keep the promises and 
commitments made to the voters. We must deliver the goods in 
the sense of doing what has to be done within the allotted time 
frame, bearing in mind that our time here must be time spent 
doing good work, which means working energetically and 
steadfastly. We are here for three, four or five years, but we must 
put in quality time here. We feel that this reflection I am sharing 
with this House on behalf of the Official Opposition is a 
fundamental one.
<P>
	Second, retirement age. Obviously, as we consider the various 
options, we can see that several different plans are in place in 
our society. In some professions, retirement age has already 
been set at 50 or 55 years of age. We know for example, that in 
the police force, civil service or Armed Forces, you become 
pensionable at 50. It is important to point out that serious 
thought should be given to the age issue, on the basis of current 
developments and what is currently offered in our society in 
terms of quality.
<P>
	Members of Parliament, as it turns out, often launch their 
parliamentary career at a time in their lives when they are at 
their best in terms of energy. Age data show that indeed a great 
many of our elected representatives are at the peak of their form, 
at the peak of their capacity, which does not detract from the 
skill and quality of younger members or those with a longer 
experience. But we can see that this is an important time of our 
lives when we devote to Parliament energies that could 
effectively been put to use in a career in some other field, like 
the one we left to come here, one we are dedicated to and may 
return to when we are done here. But at this important time when 
we devote ourselves to public management, to the development 
and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8137"> 8137 </A></B>
<P>
advancement of our society, we do so with all our energies, in 
the prime of our life.
<P>
	So, this is food for thought at this important time when 
members of Parliament devote time and energy to the state and 
to social development.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	I would add that a political career often interrupts a person's 
significant contributions to existing pension plans. That is why 
we must provide members with benefits that are at least as good 
as those they left behind. It is a matter of fairness. We are not 
saying that members must be paid handsomely and receive 
endless benefits. Members must not come here feeling that they 
will hit the jackpot in four or six years with a good pension 
whatever their age, that they will be happy to take people's 
money. That is not what we are talking about here. We are 
talking about important elements in members' lives.
<P>
	Before coming here, all members of this House already had 
their own careers in the private sector or in business, industry, 
professional services, education, health, etc. They had their own 
lives but they decided to get involved in politics, the vast 
majority of them, I am sure, to make a contribution to and 
benefit society through a political party by participating in the 
legislative and public administration process. Their previous 
lives, careers and pension contributions cannot be dismissed out 
of hand. They should in fairness be taken into consideration.
<P>
	For all the reasons I just listed, the Official Opposition urges 
all members to continue to work on pension reform without 
overlooking any of these elements. In conclusion, I reiterate that 
we are opposed to this motion as long as the alignment of 
pensions on private sector plans does not take into account all 
the elements I referred to earlier involving members' 
responsibilities, precarious position and previous entitlements. 
Pensions cannot simply be aligned on the private sector as if by 
magic; a comprehensive review and clear reference points are 
needed.
<P>
	Of course, the Official Opposition rejects this motion but 
urges everyone to continue working on pension reform, keeping 
in mind the two important factors we recognize. First, the age at 
which members can collect pensions. We do not feel that 
pensions are a privilege to which we are entitled at any age in 
defiance of societal norms. That is something we recognize. 
Second, the issue of multiple pensions. We find it unacceptable 
that someone can retire from a job and receive a pension, then 
turn around and get rehired. We are against this practice. In our 
opinion, these two elements should be an important part of 
pension reform. To achieve a truly comprehensive pension 
reform that is fair to all elected officials, be they men or women, 
we need a very clear guide to the fairness criteria leading to a 
real reform.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the member for his dissertation. I know he spent a lot of 
time talking about financial independence and the importance of 
financial independence for members of Parliament.
<P>
	I wonder how he reconciles that. We have heard a lot in this 
House about independence for the province from which he is 
from. I just wonder how he reconciles those two things, the 
independence of a member of Parliament, the independence to 
receive money from the Government of Canada on the one hand 
and on the other hand that somehow we do not need Canada for 
any other purpose. How is it possible that the Government of 
Canada is good enough to receive a pension from but not 
continually tax the people of Quebec?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure 
that I really understood the question, except that the word 
``independence'' seeems to have led to some misunderstanding. 
The member heard ``independence'' and is confused. I do not 
know. Financial independence is good for anyone. We are not 
talking about independence for Quebec; we are talking about 
financial independence for anyone who holds a position. Of 
course, it is clear that whatever pension rights the Bloc 
Quebecois has obtained for elected members, it will maintain 
them in a sovereign Quebec. A sovereign Quebec would give its 
elected officials the same conditions.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I would like to give a very simple, direct answer on the issue 
of financial independence. A person should be paid for the work 
he or she does on the basis of the expenses incurred in doing it. It 
is also a matter of equity so that elected officials are not placed 
in situations where they always have to seek compensation from 
people or organizations providing some service or other because 
the elected officials do not have the financial independence they 
need to do their job.
<P>
	That is why we wanted to include some expenses required in 
their work as part of the budget members of Parliament have, so 
that they do not have to have any Tom, Dick or Harry pay their 
restaurant bills every time, or their hotel accommodation, 
travel, air fare and so on. We are talking about financial 
independence so that members can act responsibly and 
completely free of bribery by others. It is very simple.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, to the hon. member for Richmond-Wolfe, in the

should be-

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not want to be left out

appreciate your speech to go through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, through you to the hon. member 
for Richmond-Wolfe, in your comments you indicated that age 
was certainly a criteria that should be looked at. The member 
also indicated double dipping in terms of future employment.
<P>
	Would the hon. member also consider previous government 
pensions as a deterrent in addition to an MP pension as we look 
at double dipping?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
subject of fairness, we must be careful not to take away acquired 
rights. There are acquired rights. If it is felt that people have too 
many acquired rights and as a result of some administrative or 
other process they were given too much, if something was given 
which upon analysis and consideration is unacceptable, I think 
that amends must be made.
<P>
	I will qualify that by saying that we must be careful, on the 
issue of fairness, to really state the question responsibly, so as 
not to penalize people who have already obtained certain 
advantages as a result of some regulation or law, perhaps 
entirely in good faith. Withdrawing these benefits would be 
somewhat like going back on one's word. I think that is the 
opposite of what we want to achieve.
<P>
	What we want to do is to get things straight and put them in 
perspective. Above all, we want to be able to answer people who 
tell us that the double dipping which goes on in the present 
system is wrong. An MP is in Parliament for six years and 
regardless of age has a pension that he can take away with him. It 
is the same for the Senate. It is the same with the other House. 
Someone is appointed senator and has a salary until age 75, no 
questions asked, etc.
<P>
	There is a question of fairness for the future. We must get 
things straight and not necessarily attack others.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity-Spadina, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to speak on the motion before us. I am 
delighted because this is an important issue, an issue which the 
government has pledged to resolve.
<P>
	The motion talks about replacing the existing MPs' pension 
plan with a pension plan that reflects the commitments made in 
the document entitled ``Creating Opportunity, the Liberal Plan 
for Canada''.
<P>
	I am glad the motion recognizes the significant contribution 
that the red book is making to the debate on MPs' pensions. The 
red book has helped to focus public attention on the changes 
required such as double dipping and, one step further, the need 
of a minimum age requirement.
<P>
	It is on double dipping that I wish to speak today. As we know, 
double dipping means simultaneously drawing a salary from the 
federal government and a pension as a former member of 
Parliament. It is a practice that many of us have problems with.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me remind hon. members of the red book statement on 
double dipping. We said that a Liberal government will reform 
the pension plan of members of Parliament to end this double 
dipping. MPs should not be able to leave office and receive a 
pension from the federal government if they accept a new, 
full-time, paying job from the federal government. Nothing 
could be clearer than that.
<P>
	This commitment has been repeated by the government since 
the last election. We will end double dipping. Former MPs will 
no longer be able to receive a pension and a salary from the 
federal government at the same time.
<P>
	Before I go further let me say that I do not wish to cast any 
aspersions on former members of Parliament who were entitled 
under the existing act to receive both a pension and a federal 
salary. There are many former MPs who have served this 
country well and who continue to do good work in other federal 
positions. It is clear that the drawing of a pension and a salary at 
the same time from the public purse is unacceptable though. It is 
time that these rules are changed.
<P>
	In the mid-1970s pensions were viewed increasingly as an 
earned right. Some people viewed pensions as deferred 
compensation. In their view reducing or suspending pensions on 
gaining another job was similar to retroactively cutting a 
pensioner's salary.
<P>
	In 1975 the government decided that the fairest approach 
would be to allow federal pensioners to draw pensions and 
salary unless they again came under the same pension plan. 
Today this government believes that double dipping must go.
<P>
	The act which this opposition motion attempts to address is of 
course the Members of Parliament Retirement Allowances Act. 
However, the optimum word is retiring. The act was not 
intended to supplement working former parliamentarians but to 
provide a retiring allowance for them.
<P>
	Many Canadians are expressing dissatisfaction with their 
politicians' pensions and double dipping is contributing to this 
negative image. We must continue changing the attitudes 
Canadians have toward their members of Parliament. Turning it 
around will require time and firm decisions. One of those 
decisions must be to end this double dipping.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8139"> 8139 </A></B>
<P>
	Personally I am not sure that pension changes will 
single-handedly turn around this perception but I am convinced 
that removing the right to double dip will help.
<P>
	I recognize that double dipping is a term that can be applied in 
different ways. There are several types of double dipping: 
governor in council appointments where the salary is met by 
statute; governor in council appointments where the salary scale 
is discretionary; appointments to the public service under the 
Public Service Employment Act; serving as a member of the 
RCMP or the Canadian forces; or by acting as an independent 
contractor to the federal government. Therefore, dealing with 
the double dipping question is more complicated than it appears 
on the surface.
<P>
	Some members opposite speak of the need for urgency to end 
double dipping. There is somewhat of an urgency but not as 
much as some members would like to think as of today. 
Members will not quit tomorrow to get their pensions. Many of 
them work hard and serve their constituents. They continue to do 
so and will continue to do so.
<P>
	There are some members opposite who do not feel the 
urgency. One is already collecting a federal public service 
pension and another is collecting a provincial pension as well as 
their federal salaries. These members have said they earned 
their pensions and will not give them up. Could not the Governor 
General make the same argument?
<P>
	One of the aims of this government since its election has been 
the responsible reform of the MPs pension plan. I am sure that 
hon. members opposite share with us the desire to see that the 
job of pension reform is done well and not in a haphazard 
manner. We will not cut the pension plan in order to appease 
certain interest groups. We must be thorough and fair in what we 
do.
<P>
	The political representatives in this Chamber serve Canadians 
well, as I said earlier, but there is a widespread perception that 
politicians want to feather their nests. That view is wrong. Yet it 
will remain as long as we fail to deal with the irritants such as 
this double dipping.
<P>
	Politics is a noble calling, referred to earlier by the member 
opposite, and reflects members' wishes to serve the people of 
Canada and give something of themselves to their communities.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	I reject the claim that most politicians are in politics for the 
money. No one comes to this place for the sake of money. It does 
not pay. Many members of Parliament were doing better 
financially in other careers before they entered politics. They 
were making contributions to their pension plans and RRSPs 
which reflected their financial positions.
<P>
	We must ensure that entering Canadian politics is not a 
financial drain and that no one is unduly penalized. This place 
must be accessible to all, not only the rich. It must reflect all 
aspects of Canadian society. The sacrifices are not only 
monetary. All members can attest to the time away from their 
families. One member opposite said: ``Of any criticism I ever 
made of a politician I am now biting my tongue, having lived the 
life for a year. It is quite demanding.''
<P>
	Although the sacrifices are real they are not an excuse for 
double dipping. The pension and the salary come from the same 
taxpayer who has a single pocket. That is why I consider the 
government's commitment to end double dipping as a very 
positive signal to the country. It is a sign that this government is 
listening to Canadians and acting on what it believes in. It gives 
me hope that Canadian political life will gain in stature in the 
eyes of the people.
<P>
	Again, Mr. Speaker, it pleases me that this motion was put 
forward today. I am pleased that the movers of this motion saw 
the importance of the red book position, particularly the 
statement on double dipping. I look forward to their support 
when the government introduces legislation in the near future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's speech raises the following 
comment: What a pity the government did not do its homework 
in this case and has no comprehensive proposal it can table on 
this issue, because what we have here is a motion that is 
unsatisfactory.
<P>
	The Reform Party's motion has no really comprehensive 
approach to the questions being asked by all voters. Earlier, the 
hon. member said it contained a point similar to what was said in 
the Liberals' red book. I think some modesty is in order. The 
point was raised by all voters we met during the 1993 election 
campaign. Everyone everywhere, in Quebec and the other 
provinces, at all levels of society, was wondering how their 
elected representatives had managed to get terms of 
employment that were far better than those of most people in 
this country.
<P>
	The government, by the way, has yet to meet its commitment, 
because it has not yet tabled legislation it promised to introduce. 
And of course the Reform Party could be blamed for presenting 
a motion that is so vague we cannot vote in favour of it, since we 
really do not know how the alignment with private sector plans 
would work.
<P>
	It seems to me that in his speech, the hon. member talked a lot 
about avoiding double dipping and also about reviewing the age 
at which members would receive a pension and introducing a 
minimum age, and I think we could agree on that. For instance, 
during the election campaign, people said: Paul, you are 40 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8140"> 8140 </A></B>
<P>
years old, which means that when you are 46 or 47, you will get a 
pension for life, and we pay for it. Nice work if you can get it!
<P>
	Fortunately, I had the right answer, because I kept telling 
them: No sir, I do not intend to sit for more than one term in the 
Parliament of Canada, because I hope I will not have to come 
back, once we have settled the constitutional issue. I must say I 
found this answer very convenient.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to try to modulate the hon. 
member's views, and I would ask him whether he does not think 
it would be advisable for the government to table its bill in the 
near future, because it has already finished its first year. People 
who would like to get into politics during the next election, in 
about three or four years, should have a good idea of what they 
are getting into, and as well, it may be easier to deal with these 
issues at the beginning of a government's term.
<P>
	You have had time to consult the way you consult on all kinds 
of things. We have probably had enough consultations. So, is the 
government going to make a decision very shortly so that during 
its first term, it will have responded to the wishes of all voters 
who want to ensure that their members are well paid but not 
excessively so? Their working conditions should make it 
attractive for talented people to run for Parliament, but at the 
same time, fairness should be a major consideration within the 
Canadian system as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would ask the member 
for Trinity-Spadina for a short reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ianno:</B> Mr. Speaker, first it is our intention to introduce 
what our commitment was in the red book, as we have done with 
many of the commitments we have stated in the red book and 
have fulfilled.
<P>
	There is a slight concern now. That is we want Canadians to 
get back to work. That is much more important than worrying in 
three or four years time about who is thinking about running for 
this Parliament. Our ultimate responsibility is to make sure that 
Canadians participate in the economic viability of this nation.
<P>
	Working with small businesses and many of the issues we are 
dealing with to try to get the economy back in gear is very much 
more important than this aspect the member addresses.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake-Endangered 
species.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak on the motion before 
us. This is an important issue that, as has been pointed out, was 
dealt with in the red book. This appears to be a controversial 
issue. Much has been written in the papers and shown on 
television. The issue  raises a question: Are the current pension 
provisions for members of Parliament appropriate?
<P>
	The motion proposes to replace the existing pension plan with 
a pension plan that reflects the commitments made in the red 
book. It is an issue this government wants resolved. This 
government plans to keep its promises. The Prime Minister has 
given a clear indication that we will deal with this issue. The 
details still have to be worked out.
<P>
	Today I want to place the issue in context. One of the 
measures by which we can judge whether the current provisions 
are appropriate is to look at what other governments are doing 
around the world. In its report on parliamentarians' 
compensation, Sobeco, Ernst and Young compared our overall 
compensation with that of parliamentarians in other countries. 
These countries were Australia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, 
Sweden, France and the United States.
<P>
	As members recall, Sobeco based its studies on our 
indemnities, allowances, services and benefits as well as those 
of senators. The firm looked at compensation practices and 
policies, trying to determine similarities and differences in 
approach from other countries. Then it estimated the value of 
total compensation for parliamentarians in each nation. While 
the roles of parliamentarians differ somewhat in the various 
countries studied, that does not take away from the validity of 
the comparisons in the consulting study.
<P>
	Looking first at total compensation the consultants included 
base salary, the annual value of the pension plan and private 
insurance. The results show that Canadian MPs rank in the 
mid-range of the seven countries studied. The best paid by far 
are American members who receive more than double what 
Canadian, Australian and French parliamentarians get.
<P>
	Australia, Canada and France are closely bunched together 
and they are significantly ahead of the United Kingdom, 
Belgium and Sweden. Taking sessional indemnity, our basic 
salary, we are in much the same position internationally. 
American legislators are way ahead of us. Their salaries are 
estimated at over $169,000, while ours are $64,400. The 
Australians and the French get slightly more and the rest lag a 
bit behind.
<P>
	In terms of pensions alone, we rank somewhat behind both 
Belgium and Australia and ahead of the remaining countries 
examined. The pension rules vary from country to country. 
Parliamentarians are entitled to a pension as soon as they are 
elected in Belgium, France and Britain, while they must serve at 
least five years in the United States, six years in Canada and 
Sweden and eight years in Australia. In other countries the 
pensionable age ranges from a low of 12 years service in Sweden 
and Australia.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8141"> 8141 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	In Britain pensions can be paid to former MPs at 60 if their 
age and years of service add up to at least 80. Some countries 
provide reduced pensions to former members if they are retired 
before the normal pensionable age. The amount of retirement 
pension required for each year of service is lower than the 
Canadian rate in Belgium, France, Britain and the United States. 
It is higher or comparable in Australia and Sweden.
<P>
	There is quite a wide range in contribution rates as well. 
Members do not have to contribute at all in Sweden, while the 
rates are 7.5 per cent of salary in Belgium, 11.5 per cent in 
Australia, and 1.3 per cent in the United States.
<P>
	It is difficult to compare group insurance plans in the various 
countries because of the different social programs in place. 
Group insurance is paid entirely by the government in all of the 
countries studied except the United States where the members 
pay about 50 per cent of their group insurance programs.
<P>
	Australia and Belgium provide severance allowances to their 
parliamentarians. In Belgium it is equal to about one month of 
salary for each year of service and in Australia it ranges from 
three months salary after one year of service to 26 months after 
eight years of service.
<P>
	It is interesting to look at the various allowances available to 
parliamentarians in Canada and other countries. With expense 
allowances there is a wide range of practices. France and 
Belgium have non-taxable and non-accountable expense 
allowances. In Australia and Sweden this allowance is taxable 
but work related tax deductions are permitted.
<P>
	As for travel expenses, Australia, Belgium and Sweden pay 
for all work related travel by their legislators. In France only the 
costs of travel between the constituency and Paris are paid.
<P>
	Most countries have some sort of severance allowance and 
resettlement provisions to help parliamentarians make the 
transition to private life. Interestingly, the personal financial 
situation faced by parliamentarians as they return to private life 
in France and Sweden has an impact on amounts they are 
entitled to receive.
<P>
	From this overall comparison we are neither the best paid 
parliamentarians at the international level nor the worst. While 
our pensions may be better than those of parliamentarians in 
some countries, they are not quite as good as they are in others. 
In overall comparison we lag well behind our American cousins.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the Prime Minister has made clear the 
government's commitment to introduce legislation to change 
the pension plan. Our party is committed to ending double 
dipping. I applaud pension reform. I do think it is important for 
everyone to realize that in terms of overall compensation, 
Canadian members of Parliament are no better paid than 
colleagues in most  other major western countries and we lag 
behind a number of countries.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member just referred to the bill on the members' pension fund 
and mentioned several countries, including the United States. 
The question we must ask ourselves is this: Are the 205 new 
members in this House, who have no vested rights in the old plan 
for MPs, not showing good will by wanting to have a new 
pension plan for members?
<P>
	The Canadian government could show Canadians good will in 
managing public funds by showing its good will, and this is an 
excellent way to do it, by making us elected members do our fair 
share by cutting some of our pensions, which are paid for from 
taxpayers' money. Today the government tends to cut social 
programs, which affects the most disadvantaged people.
<P>
	I think that as parliamentarians, with the salary we are paid, of 
course we work long hours and have many responsibilities, but 
we are paid for the hours we put in and we must realize what it 
involves when we decide to run for office.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	I think that when we talk about cutting the fat, the operations 
of this House and its members, this is an excellent way to show 
good will and show Canadians that we are ready to do our fair 
share.
<P>
	When comparing ourselves with the United States, we must 
consider the ability to pay. Can the United States afford to pay 
into a pension fund for their elected officials? With the debt we 
have in Canada, which forces us to make cuts in all programs, it 
would be rather outrageous if members' pensions were not 
affected.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member a question. Would he agree that 
the government should show once and for all that it is ready to 
make an effort by cutting the pensions of elected members or at 
least eliminating double dipping? We have a 24-year-old 
member. It would be a little ridiculous for him to have a pension 
for life after six years, at age 30. Would you agree with me that 
members' pensions should be cut to prove to Canadians that we 
are ready to do our fair share as members of Parliament?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
question. It is difficult to disagree with a suggestion that there 
have to be certain changes in the pension scheme. Obviously 
that is what we proposed in the red book, one of them being the 
elimination of double dipping.
<P>
	Certainly another aspect that has to be looked at very 
seriously is the age at which pensions do commence. With 
pensions commencing as they do now, it is probably quite unfair. 
The age should be raised. The question would be at what age 
should a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8142"> 8142 </A></B>
<P>
member obtain pension  benefits and as well what benefits 
should be attributed to that member at that age. It is difficult to 
disagree with the comments made by the member.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise today to speak to this motion.
<P>
	Before I begin to refer to the body of my text, I have to 
comment on the waxing eloquence of my hon. colleagues from 
the Liberal Party regarding the red book. I would very much like 
to point out to my colleagues that on August 12, 1993 the Prime 
Minister of today challenged Kim Campbell, then Prime 
Minister, about pension reform.
<P>
	On August 11 he challenged Kim Campbell to recall 
Parliament and said: ``We would pass it in one day'', meaning 
pension reform. He was feisty in his request because he added 
that his party had been proposing these reforms for months:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``It is 1984 all over again'', Chrétien charged. ``They said `here is a fresh face'. 
They promised a new dimension of objectivity and representation. Now it is the 
same speech, the same lies and the same promises''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So much for the red book.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I am trying to 
grasp the context of some of the remarks of the hon. member. In 
referring to lies, I would hope that we are not in any way 
insinuating that any one member in this Chamber from any one 
party would be lying in any way, shape or form. I ask members to 
keep that in mind.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
quoting from an article by William Walker of the Toronto <I>Star</I>.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I too am 
trying to reconstruct the words of the member opposite who 
quite closely linked the word lies with the name of the Prime 
Minister. I would ask that you as Speaker review the blues and if 
you find cause, come back to this House and ask the member to 
please withdraw.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I accept the intervention 
of the government deputy whip and I do take the undertaking to 
the House that I will review the blues. If necessary I will come 
back to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going 
to clarify this right now. This is a quote from an article by 
William Walker and those are the very words that are printed 
here that are attributed to the then Liberal candidate, Mr. Jean 
Chrétien. It is in this article from the Toronto <I>Star</I>.
<P>
	I certainly would never presume to have associated that term 
with our Prime Minister today. I strenuously object to any 
suggestion that I would do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> You never said it was an article before.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> She sure did.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I shall 
continue.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	Because the issue of MP pensions enrages more Canadians 
than any other issue in contemporary politics today, and we can 
certainly see the sensitivity of my Liberal colleagues in the 
House today, today's motion goes to the heart of what matters in 
Canada. Believe me, voters will be looking on this day's debate 
in three and a half years time and they will be looking at what 
was said and who said it.
<P>
	This goes to the core of leadership in government. It 
demonstrates to Canadians that before the politicians ask them 
to make any more financial sacrifices we will lead by example. 
This motion demonstrates our sincerity on this side of the House 
to lead by example, to cut government spending and to inject 
new levels of integrity into this House. We do this by securing 
reform of the MP pension plan.
<P>
	It is ironic to suggest that reforming the MP pension plan is a 
sacrifice for members of Parliament. All we are doing is taking 
our existing, outdated, lavish, unfair and expensive pension plan 
and correlating it with the private sector provisions for 
employees. This is no sacrifice.
<P>
	It is an expectation from our electorate that we reform this 
outrageous pension plan. More than anything else Canadians 
resent that they are asked over and over again to tighten their 
belts, that they must pay higher taxes, that their hard earned pay 
cheques are taxed back to the government. Let us not forget 
about the eight million Canadians who have no pensions at all.
<P>
	Canadians are at a point where they no longer believe their 
politicians are worthy of their support. I know I can speak to the 
constituents of my riding of Calgary Southeast. In town hall 
after town hall on the issues of the day that come up number one 
is MP pensions: ``When are you going to get rid of that terrible 
plan?''
<P>
	The motion today which states that the House replace the 
current members of Parliament retirement allowance plan with a 
pension plan that reflects the current norms for private sector 
pensions with a maximum contribution in accordance with the 
Income Tax Act should be supported by all members of the 
House.
<P>
	I urge members to put their self-interest behind them and to 
recognize this proposal is a sound one. Two legislatures have 
already made cuts to their MLA pension plans. Alberta and 
Prince Edward Island have made those cuts. These provinces 
have taken the lead on this issue and it is time that federal 
politicians followed suit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8143"> 8143 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me share with the House what is happening in my home 
province of Alberta regarding pension reform. In the spring of 
1993 Premier Klein announced that there would be no pension 
plan for members of the legislative assembly after the next 
election.
<P>
	In May 1993 a bill was passed in the legislature to amend 
Alberta MLA pensions. The members' pension was to be 
scrapped after the next provincial election. For MLAs who were 
retiring before the next election their benefits were reduced 
from 4 per cent to 3 per cent. Members of the legislative 
assembly's pensions would be suspended if they worked more 
than a limited period of time for any employer covered by the 
public service management pension plan, thus eliminating 
double dipping.
<P>
	This is a concrete example for change and of a promise that 
was kept. It is also an example of a decision taken by a 
government listening to what Canadians are saying.
<P>
	Let me quote from a letter about pension reform. It was 
written by a constituent of mine and it is addressed to the Prime 
Minister and the finance minister:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Gentlemen,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You gentlemen have suggested Canadians must decide on (1) reduced 
spending or (2) increased taxes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, this redneck from Alberta gives a resounding voice for reduced 
spending-reduced spending and no for tax increases in any form.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A good place to start is by example and reduce those obscene pensions 
enjoyed by MPs (including former MPs as well) to that which is normal for 
Canadians in the private sector. This would be real leadership. You will find that 
such action will be received as a demonstration of responsible stewardship and 
will motivate an atmosphere to undertake a similar we mean business review of 
all government expenditures by our peers and the senior civil servants for the 
same purpose.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You will also find that such action and extension thereof will be required to 
earn the respect of Canadians. It is time for action, not more talk.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday was trough day. Fifty-two more members of 
Parliament qualified for gold-plated pensions worth $53 
million. We call these gold-plated because they give unlimited 
protection against inflation. They are payable after only six 
years in office. We have heard this over and over again and it is 
fair evidence that this needs to be changed. They are payable 
immediately after retirement regardless of age. One of my hon. 
colleagues just mentioned someone who was 24 years old and 
who perhaps in six years would be eligible for one of these 
gold-plated pensions.
<P>
	They accumulate one and a half times faster than the legal 
maximum in the private sector and are funded about 85 per cent 
by taxpayer contributions.
<P>
	I have done my part to reform our pensions. I stated during the 
election campaign that I would reject outright any MP pension 
and I have done that. I take far greater comfort in taking care of 
my own retirement, thank you very much, than a pension plan. 
Many of my colleagues have done the same.
<P>
	I urge the House to realize that we need to reform the pension 
plan. In particular, I challenge the 52 MPs who just became 
eligible yesterday for a pension to take out of the program only 
what they put in plus a reasonable interest that they would have 
received had they invested it for themselves. I challenge them to 
show leadership by rejecting these gold-plated pensions.
<P>
	My message today has been straightforward and it reflects the 
expectations and the emotions of Canadians everywhere. I have 
spoken often about integrity in government. Canadians have lost 
faith in their politicians. The last 25 years of profligate spending 
is clear evidence of the need for reform and leadership in 
government. We all need to demonstrate a willingness to 
change.
<P>
	Canadians want politicians to keep their word, who will bring 
integrity back to government and who will do everything to give 
government back to them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member spoke eloquently about the need for 
pension reform. It is nice to hear that Reform is on side with us, 
that it is in favour of reforming pensions. It is a question of what 
to do.
<P>
	Quite often people who most often ask for pension reform in a 
certain manner and ask for certain changes to be made are, as 
this member very eloquently said that she would not care for a 
pension from the government, are quite often independently 
well to do, have other sources of income, or otherwise.
<P>
	My question is whether this member could tell us how many 
Reform MPs do not have another business such as farming, 
ranching, et cetera, or an income from another source or an 
income from another pension. How many do not have such a 
source of income?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 
aware of the exact number but as far as I know most do not.
<P>
	I am going to take the next few minutes to make a further 
response to the hon. member's intervention because I do have 
something I would like to share with him and with others in this 
House.
<P>
	I was reading in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> yesterday a small article 
called ``Nuspeak'' from <I>The Economist</I>. It was a series of 
definitions that have come forward in the last several years. One 
word I had never heard before was disentitlementarianism 
which is a belief that entitlement programs should be dis-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8144"> 8144 </A></B>
<P>
mantled. I look on this gold-plated MP pension plan as one of 
those entitlement provisions  that over time the House of 
Commons has given to their members.
<P>
	I guess I would have to call myself a disentitlementarian 
because I will continue in this regard as far as a pension is 
concerned.
<P>
	The constituents in my riding are furious. They continue to be 
furious about MP pension plans. In the townhall meeting I had 
last week it did not matter what the topic, it always came back to 
MP pensions. You could see the red start to rise above their 
collars. As I said before, voters, the electorate, will remember 
what has been said today. We have to address that and ignore 
their concerns at our peril.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I recognize that I do not have a lot of time to speak 
on this issue but there are a couple of things I would like to 
respond to that were brought forward, particularly by members 
on the other side.
<P>
	Several times I heard speakers say that MPs have to be 
properly remunerated if we are going to get quality in this place. 
I remind the hon. members that we have a best selling book out 
right now called <I>On the Take</I> written by Stevie Cameron. It 
speaks about MPs who are paid very well and who are 
subscribing to this gold-plated pension plan. The book outlines 
scandal after scandal of abuse of privileges that are available in 
this House. Yet this situation is not of concern to the members on 
the other side because they do not seem to think that the 
remuneration and the gold-plated pension plan will have an 
impact.
<P>
	I suggest that if we can attract people to this place who do not 
want to be on the take and who are not looking at the pension 
plan we will probably get better quality. It is those people who 
are looking for a fleece-lined retirement, looking for that 
paradise that comes with parliamentary service, that we want to 
exclude from this place.
<P>
	I am concerned about these multimillion dollar pensions that, 
for instance, the member for Sherbrooke will be receiving 
should his party be decimated and the final two members moved 
into extinction.
<P>
	The other concern that I have is that if we do not deal with 
some of the perks and particularly the pension, Stevie Cameron 
will write another book and that book will be called ``On the 
Take No. 2''. It will refer to the current Liberal government and 
those members who put their own best interests ahead of the 
interests of Canadian taxpayers, those members who looked for 
every possible excuse and made flowery speeches about how 
deserving they were of all these dollars the taxpayers worked so 
hard for, to which they are entitled after six short years of 
service. It is unconscionable.
<P>
	I urge the other members, in the few remaining minutes and 
seconds we have, to consider the situation, to support the 
Reform motion today and to commit to reforming the MPs' 
pension plan to please Canadians and  to restore respect to this 
place, which is what Canadians are crying for.
<P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GLOBALCLIMATECHANGE">GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in anticipation of 
global climate change, consider the advisability of promoting energy 
conservation and efficiency, as well as placing greater reliance on renewable 
sources of energy so as to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and nuclear power.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, in essence this motion is about climate 
change. It is an issue for the 21st century which has to be tackled 
in this decade. It is an issue that has serious economic and 
environmental consequences.
<P>
	Climate change as predicted by meteorologists and scientists 
all over the world would have serious consequences on forestry, 
on agriculture, on fisheries, on biodiversities. Most important 
from a human perspective are the consequences on sea levels 
and what that might do to populations around the Pacific whose 
existence would be threatened by rising sea levels as predicted 
by some.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	Leading scientists and technical experts are telling 
governments all over the world that greenhouse gas emissions 
resulting from human activities are increasing substantially. For 
instance, according to Environment Canada statistics the 
emissions of carbon dioxide, which I will refer to as CO2, in 
Canada alone are on a constant increase and represent by 
comparison to other nations 2 per cent of all emissions produced 
in the world. That is second only to the United States.
<P>
	If we look at the statistics on a per capita basis then we as a 
nation are at the top of the list when it comes to carbon dioxide 
emissions. This is due to a number of understandable reasons. It 
has to do with our climate. It has to do with the great distances 
and size of our country. It has also to do with lifestyle.
<P>
	However, the result of these emissions is to be found in an 
increase in average temperatures in the earth's surface. It is 
interesting to note there is clear evidence that the average 
surface temperature of the earth has gone up by half a degree 
Celsius over the past century. In the case of Canada alone it has 
been measured as having gone up by 1.1 degree Celsius. The 10 
warmest years of the last 100 years have occurred and have been 
measured since 1980.
<P>
	Consequently climate change was discussed at length and was 
almost central in the debates at the 1992 United Nations 
Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio. On 
that occasion Canada ratified with many other nations a 
convention which calls for governments to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions to at least 1990 levels by the year 2000. We are 
very close to that date.
<P>
	Recognizing the urgency of this issue and recognizing our 
international responsibilities, the government has actually made 
a further commitment. It is contained in the 1993 election 
campaign red book. This commitment is to cut by 20 per cent the 
carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2005.
<P>
	As a result of that commitment, federal-provincial 
negotiations have taken place at an intense pace over the past 10 
months culminating with the meeting in Bathurst, New 
Brunswick a couple of weeks ago. On that occasion environment 
and energy ministers of the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments of Canada discussed this matter at length.
<P>
	We learned on that occasion from newspaper clippings that 
the representatives of the Alberta government were opposed to 
any regulations aimed at lowering carbon dioxide emissions in 
Canada. From the clippings we learned that Alberta wants a 
voluntary approach only and that this position is also favoured 
by certain industries. I quote from the <I>Gazette</I> of November 8 
where we learned the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Alberta won't go along with a plan by Ottawa and other provinces for 
mandatory regulations to reduce carbon pollution and clean up the air. ``We're 
not participating,'' Alberta's Ty Lund said yesterday as he emerged from a day 
of talks among Canada's environment ministers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Lund, who is the environment minister for Alberta, 
scoffed at Ontario minister Bud Wildman's comment that some 
mandatory requirements would have to be put into place to cut 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8153"> 8153 </A></B>
<P>
the amount of pollution from smoke stacks and car exhaust 
pipes.
<P>
	The question is why is the Government of Alberta opposed to 
such regulations? Why does it support regulations in other 
sectors? It accepts regulations and support regulations in 
aviation, agriculture, health and hygiene, you name it, but it 
does not want regulations with respect to climate change. Why 
does the Alberta government not want to help in meeting an 
obligation to the world community and reduce greenhouse 
gases, particularly carbon dioxide which is the most prevalent of 
all the greenhouse gases as we all know?
<P>
	On the other hand, people in Alberta support the environment 
and we know that. People in Alberta understand the 
international obligation that we have. It seems to me that 
Alberta members of Parliament and senators have a role to play 
here in convincing the provincial government to co-operate.
<P>
	In support of what I just said I will quote from the Globe and 
Mail of November 8. According to a poll taken by the Environics 
Research Group Ltd., the paper stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The public apparently supports change, too. The results of a poll of 1,500 
adults taken in August and September showed strong support for strong 
measures, including majority approval of a 10 per cent increase in energy prices, 
if the money was used to cut pollution-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is quite an interesting expression of public opinion. In 
the <I>Gazette</I> of the same day the same point is being made. It 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Apparently, so does the Canadian public. Most people interviewed in a new 
poll said they would be willing to pay 10 per cent more for their energy if the 
money were redirected to reduce pollution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Today and for the next three months leading into February the 
federal Minister of Natural Resources has a very difficult task of 
seeking the co-operation of provincial and territorial 
governments so that a national plan can be forged to reduce this 
type of dangerous emission.
<P>
	The question is, does Alberta want to isolate itself from this 
effort? What good would it serve to be alone, saying no to an 
effort that will attempt to reach the desired goal of reducing 
carbon dioxide emissions and which cannot be left to the 
voluntary sector alone?
<P>
	The question also arises here, to have a complete picture, is 
what needs to be done? Today's energy policies need to be 
looked at thoroughly and they need to undergo a profound 
change at the federal level of government as well as the 
provincial and municipal.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us take, for example, the federal level and in particular the 
federal Department of Natural Resources, formerly known as 
energy, mines and resources.
<P>
	Here we find year after year in the budgets of that department, 
and particularly in the last 10 years, generous subsidies to the 
fossil fuel industry. Alone in 1994 and 1995 natural resources, 
Canada's energy division, just one division within that 
department, expects to spend a total of $383 million.
<P>
	Would you believe it, Mr. Speaker, that 87 per cent of this 
amount will be spent as grants and contributions with most of 
these funds going to fossil fuel projects? Only a very small 
portion goes to energy efficiency, energy conservation, and 
research into alternative sources of energy. In this day and age 
against the background of the climate change issue, this does not 
make sense any longer.
<P>
	Look at the Department of Finance. Here we find generous tax 
rebates and tax expenditures all favouring the Canadian fossil 
fuel industry. Actually, if one looks over a period of time, for 
years the fossil fuel industry sector has enjoyed extremely 
generous subsidies in the form of outright grants, tax 
deferments, write-offs, loans, loan guarantees, and exploration 
subsidies. You name it, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Every year, according to the calculations we have conducted, 
the federal government gives over $5 billion in the form of tax 
concessions to the fossil fuel sector. Over $5 billion in tax 
concessions. If you apply to this amount a tax rate of 20 per cent, 
this kind of assistance or hand-out, depending on how you want 
to call it, results in over $1 billion in lost revenue.
<P>
	As recently as October 1993 during the last campaign, some 
$85 million was given to the Lloydminster heavy oil upgrader 
which finally had to be cancelled some six weeks ago. I 
congratulate the Minister of Finance for that decision. It had to 
be cancelled after a loss incurred on the part of the taxpayers of 
Canada of some $945 million.
<P>
	The amount of $85 million that was made available in October 
1993 exceeds by some $20 million the entire 1994 budget for the 
efficiency and alternate energy program. I repeat, the amount 
that was given to the Lloydminster project, on its deathbed if 
you like, exceeded by $20 million the entire 1994 budget for the 
efficiency and alternate energy program.
<P>
	This does make sense. There is no coherence in these kinds of 
financial decisions and budgetary decisions.
<P>
	To make things worse, the 1994-95 funding for approved 
efficiency and renewable energy projects was cut back because 
of budget constraints. In addition, the government in Ottawa 
currently has a large sum invested in fossil fuel megaprojects, 
notably Hibernia, which represents a commitment of some $3 
billion.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	If you put this picture against the background of Canada's 
commitment to stabilize and then reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions by 20 per cent, these subsidies clearly must be 
examined 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8154"> 8154 </A></B>
<P>
and must be reapplied and  invested in new directions, first for 
the purpose of increasing energy efficiency and, second, in 
reducing over the long term our dependence on fossil fuels.
<P>
	On energy efficiency we find that Canada's global 
competitors, including Japan, Germany, you name it, have 
enjoyed strong economic growth because many years ago they 
understood that energy efficiency means a measure that brings 
about economic advantages at the same time.
<P>
	They adopted strong energy efficiency measures. We by 
comparison must admit that we still have a long way to go. 
Studies conducted in the United States, New Brunswick, 
Quebec, and British Columbia all confirm that investments in 
energy efficiency consistently create more jobs than 
investments in conventional energy supply projects.
<P>
	A 1987 study by the Department of Energy, Mines and 
Resources, which is back quite a while, concluded that 
investments in efficiency create an average of 19 direct and 
indirect jobs per every $1 million invested compared to an 
average of seven jobs per $1 million invested in oil and gas 
extraction. This is quite a stunning comparison for which we are 
indebted to the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources 
which, however, does not seem to be capable of putting its own 
findings into practice.
<P>
	Clearly, money saved by industrial, commercial and 
residential investors in energy efficiency would be freed up and 
could be respent in other areas of the economy. According to a 
report for the British Columbia Energy Council by Marbek 
Resource Consultants and G.E. Bridges and Associates, this 
respending accounts for more than 50 per cent of all new jobs 
created and 90 per cent of the net jobs created over equal 
investments in conventional energy supply projects.
<P>
	To conclude, if we are to act in our own self-interests for the 
long term and if we are to meet our obligations internationally 
because we want to behave as good members of the family of 
nations where the recognition has been made that there is a 
serious problem that must be dealt with, Canada needs a national 
plan on carbon dioxide as other nations already have. Those who 
do not have it are working at it quite laboriously.
<P>
	This kind of national plan would set out for each province 
what each economic sector is to do and what each level of 
government can do through various means, through budgets, 
taxation measures, and regulations. All this would be done in 
order to achieve greater energy efficiency which is an economic 
plus to achieve reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and 
therefore slow down the trend in climate change. Finally, it 
would be to achieve for generations to come this very difficult 
but necessary, gradual shift in our dependence on fossil fuels to 
a dependence on renewable sources of energy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
motion M-168 put forth by the hon. member for Davenport in 
this House today really caught my interest.
<P>
	I have had the opportunity to work on regular basis with the 
hon. member on the Standing Committee on Environment and 
Sustainable Development, of which he is the chairman.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	It is an honour for me to become the vice-chair of this 
committee. When you look at the background of the hon. 
member for Davenport and see what kind of work he does on the 
committee, his care and concern for the important issue of the 
environment really becomes apparent. He is, of course, a great 
conservationist, but he is also a great advocate of federalism.
<P>
	We need not look any further to understand why the people 
opposite, the Minister of the Environment in particular, have no 
qualms interfering with the provinces' jurisdiction in that 
respect. The Liberals wrongly associate the federalist cause 
with that of the environment. In their view, provinces are small 
and incompetent entities which are incapable of looking after 
such a great cause as the environment all on their own, as an 
exclusive area of responsibility.
<P>
	They tell us that air and water know no boundaries-what a 
revelation!-and that this is why the federal government has the 
duty to control, protect and preserve the environment. They 
justify encroaching upon a provincial jurisdiction by claiming 
to be in a better position than the provinces to do so and, of 
course, by arguing that Canada is a big country, so big in fact 
that all activities have to be centralized in Ottawa in order for 
the environment to be protected.
<P>
	Yet, it is common knowledge that the centralized 
administration of this huge country does not necessarily have a 
positive impact in the field. On the contrary, centralizing to 
excess generally puts increased distance between what is going 
on in the field and the decision-makers. It is a phenomenon 
known as ivory tower phenomenon.
<P>
	But the environment is about what happens in the field. So, 
serious thought must be given to the implications of increased 
centralization in that regard.
<P>
	The hon. members opposite also rely heavily on the global 
approach argument to justify increasing federal interference 
with provincial jurisdictions. Their redundant message to the 
effect that pollution know no boundaries has become their creed 
and their justification for set themselves up as great national 
conservationists.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8155"> 8155 </A></B>
<P>
	Basically, the government is creating new structures, 
unscrupulously, without paying any attention to duplication, to 
what the provinces are already doing. Worse, it takes advantage 
of grey areas and non-established areas to impose itself upon 
them. Some have gone along with this federal tactic. It is their 
choice. Others, on the other hand, see things differently and feel 
threatened and bullied by the federal government. But 
regardless of the fears expressed by certain provinces, the 
federal government, in the name of federalism and a 
comprehensive approach, pushes ahead and imposes its way of 
doing things, its standards and its administrative structures.
<P>
	If this twisted line of reasoning were taken to its logical 
conclusion, Canada itself would be subordinated to a broader, 
North American, maybe even planetary, organization with 
overall responsibility for the environment.
<P>
	We do not think that this is the best way to preserve and 
protect our natural environment. We are, of course, in favour of 
harmonizing standards and requirements, and we certainly 
support agreements for specific sectors. But we firmly maintain 
that these standards, requirements and agreements must be 
implemented on a smaller scale if we are to attain environmental 
objectives quickly and effectively. The federal government 
should therefore limit its role, and leave the implementation and 
administration of environmental matters to the provinces.
<P>
	The motion by the member for Davenport mirrors only too 
well his government's desire to centralize and dominate. He 
would like the federal government to step onto an already very 
crowded playing field. When he speaks to us about energy 
conservation and efficiency, the member for Davenport is light 
years behind Quebec and other provinces who have already 
taken action in this area.
<P>
	For several years now, Hydro-Québec, which reports to the 
government of Quebec, has been offering its consumers 
programs promoting energy conservation and efficiency. Again 
yesterday evening, I saw a Hydro-Québec television 
commercial offering information and a brochure on a new 
energy conservation program.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	I wish to remind the hon. member who tabled this motion that 
all provinces also operate such programs through their 
power-producing corporations. The Power Smart Program, 
among others, has been around for a few years. The hon. 
member should also know that the federal Department of 
Natural Resources runs several programs resulting from the 
Green Plan. There is even an Efficiency and Alternative Energy 
Branch within this department.
<P>
	Is the hon. member telling us through his motion that the 
federal government's own actions are inefficient? That would 
confirm what we have known and noted for a very long time.
<P>
	The hon. member's motion shows very clearly once again the 
federal government's lack of recognition for provincial 
initiatives and desire to meddle in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. I ask the hon. member for Davenport: Why should 
the federal government promote energy efficiency in Quebec 
and in the other provinces, when it is already being done, Mr. 
Speaker?
<P>
	Would implementing such a motion not lead again to useless, 
inefficient and costly overlap and duplication, to a waste of 
public funds which would not achieve anything, except for 
spreading federal government propaganda?
<P>
	I am asking myself serious questions regarding the hon. 
member for Davenport's intentions in putting forward this 
motion. Even his wishful thinking lacks vigour. The wording of 
the motion itself is very timid. It says: ``That the government 
should-consider the advisability of promoting-''. Let us say 
simply that one could not go very far with such words. The hon. 
member for Davenport is usually more specific and vigorous in 
his proposals.
<P>
	I want to look at another part of the hon. member for 
Davenport's timid motion, and I quote: ``-in anticipation of 
global climate change-''. The hon. member talks about climate 
change; he is no doubt referring to global warning mostly caused 
by greenhouse gases.
<P>
	I find it a little funny that the hon. member is telling us this 
when the Minister of the Environment recently admitted that she 
was not sure she would be able to honour an ambitious promise 
in the famous red book. This promise in the Liberals' bible said: 
``Our immediate priority will be to work with all major 
stakeholders to design a plan to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 
20 per cent from 1988 levels by the year 2005''. Asked whether 
she was convinced that this objective could be attained, the 
minister replied: ``Oh, my God! Am I convinced? No. I am not 
convinced''.
<P>
	She thus admitted her political inability due to the lack of 
support and backing in Cabinet. Nevertheless, this promise is a 
key plank in the Liberals' environmental platform. So what is 
the motion from the member for Davenport worth when an 
important promise of his party is so easily flouted by Liberal 
ministers?
<P>
	Another disturbing point about this promise is the idea now 
being considered of passing our responsibilities off onto 
developing countries. Indeed, Canada is showing some 
openness to the idea of taking credit on its own account for 
reducing greenhouse gases when it supports or takes such action 
abroad. If that were so, it would be a blatant admission of failure 
and proof of the Liberal government's weakness.
<P>
	The motion of the member for Davenport seems somewhat 
futile to me. First, it asks the government to duplicate what is 
already being done in the provinces and in the federal govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8156"> 8156 </A></B>
<P>
ment itself; second, it highlights a red book promise that will not 
be kept, concerning the reduction of greenhouse gases.
<P>
	The member's motion is not very solid. It shows an obvious 
lack of front-line information. I am sure that the member can 
present us with much more substantial motions.
<P>
	I conclude on an energy-saving note by telling you that on 
December 8, 120,000 Christmas lights will be lit on and around 
Parliament Hill-I repeat, 120,000 lights.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	Also, I invite you to count how many government vehicles are 
left idling on the Hill, with their engines running, all day long. A 
good contribution to saving and the greenhouse effect! I believe 
that the federal government should do its own homework before 
imposing on others.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
one of the main justifications for the use of renewable over 
non-renewable sources of energy is the greenhouse effect. I 
believe this is the rationale for this motion from the member for 
Davenport.
<P>
	The greenhouse effect is the concept that increased emissions 
of greenhouse gases caused by human activity such as the 
burning of fossil fuels will lead to increased temperatures in the 
global climate, hence the move toward renewable sources of 
energy as opposed to the burning of fossil fuels.
<P>
	It is a fact that the earth's surface temperature and human 
emissions of greenhouse gases have both increased over past 
decades. However, to suggest that we must abandon traditional 
sources would be unwise to say the least.
<P>
	It is important that any shift from non-renewable to 
renewable resources be based on the merits of that resource, not 
simply on an anticipation of what may or may not happen. 
Energy policies must be based on economic, environmental and 
industrial concerns. I agree that Canadians need to actively 
participate in energy conservation and efficiency. This does not 
mean the government should be issued a blank cheque to 
promote this concept.
<P>
	The member for Davenport suggests that we should place 
greater reliance on renewable sources of energy over 
non-renewable resources. Many renewable energy technologies 
are available. They are already in use around the globe and can 
provide different alternatives.
<P>
	There are several sources including solar power, wind, wave, 
tidal, and hydro or water power. I would like to go into this a bit 
to show there is really no easy fix in this huge equation.
<P>
	Other less known sources include biomass, which is the 
conversion of plant and animal matter into energy, and 
geothermal energy which is from within the earth and is very 
popular in New Zealand.
<P>
	Converting to renewable sources of energy is not an easy 
procedure. We need to look at the whole picture when we talk 
about non-renewable and renewable forms of energy because it 
is not as simplistic as it may appear at first glance. Renewable 
energy is not without its own problems. There are economic, 
environmental and practical considerations that must be taken 
into account.
<P>
	California uses several forms of solar energy. There are huge 
energy collectors which provide electricity for hundreds of 
thousands of homes at competitive rates. Solar energy is also 
used for hot water heating in buildings and current solar energy 
research is looking into the concept of converting direct sunlight 
into electricity.
<P>
	Although solar energy appears to be a sound environmental 
choice there are still considerations. The manufacture, 
installation and disposal of solar power systems involves 
environmental health and safety considerations. We need to 
question how much fossil fuel energy input is required for solar 
systems compared to fossil energy consumed by comparable 
conventional energy systems.
<P>
	The manufacture of solar cells also uses hazardous material 
such as arsenic and cadmium. Some of these materials can be 
quite hazardous to the people who use them. What I am simply 
pointing out is that every area has its problems.
<P>
	Another concern with solar power is the large amount of land 
required for the plants. Approximately one square kilometre is 
required for every 20 to 60 megawatts generated and this causes 
a problem.
<P>
	Wind energy is another source of renewable energy. 
Windmills have been around for centuries and are still 
functioning in many areas such as California and Denmark. 
Presently wind turbines produce 1 per cent of the electricity for 
California and Hawaii and many nations are currently looking 
into this resource as a positive alternative.
<P>
	What needs to be noted when we examine these various 
sources of energy is that almost every energy source has some 
kind of negative environmental impact. Renewable sources of 
energy are not without their problems and considerations.
<P>
	For example, although wind power produces no air or water 
pollution and does not involve toxic or hazardous substances, it 
faces public opposition because of its visibility and the noise of 
the turbines.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	Our traditional form of renewable energy is hydro power. 
Dams generate the electricity through the weight of water going 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8157"> 8157 </A></B>
<P>
through the turbines. In Canada hydro  electric power produces 
nearly two-thirds of all of our energy consumed.
<P>
	Though hydro power is the main form of renewable energy, 
there are many problems or potential problems connected with 
it. For example, most of us are aware of the Kemano project in 
British Columbia. Because this project was exempted from a 
full environmental assessment by the previous government, 
resource and community concerns remain in debate with hostile 
stakeholders in many areas.
<P>
	The Great Whale project near James Bay also illustrates the 
continuing environmental concerns of many of these energy 
megaprojects. As such, British Columbia has gone away from 
many of the larger projects into much smaller even to the point 
of small streams and rivers generating small areas that are more 
environmentally friendly than a huge megaproject.
<P>
	The seas can also be utilized to create wave and tidal power. 
Temperature differences between deep cold water and warm 
surface waters are utilized as a power source called ocean 
thermal energy conversion.
<P>
	By and large it is going to be in the end market forces and 
public demand that will direct the energy market whether it be in 
favour of renewable or non-renewable sources of energy.
<P>
	To conclude, these are just some of the issues surrounding the 
use of renewable sources of energy which need to be considered 
when we consider whether we should be promoting this form of 
energy. I am mentioning these because it is easy to look at only 
one side of the issue without considering some of the associated 
concerns.
<P>
	When we talk about shifting from one form of energy to 
another it is important that the contribution of energy 
development to the material welfare of Canadians be balanced 
against environmental sustainability.
<P>
	In 1992 the production of energy supplies was valued at over 
$35 billion or 7 per cent of our gross domestic product. It 
employed over 300,000 people. Energy accounts for 11 per cent 
of total exports, 17 per cent of all investments and is responsible 
for an annual trade surplus of over $10 billion. It is a big player.
<P>
	In summary, I am not suggesting that we promote one form of 
energy over another or that we should not consider using more 
renewable sources of energy. However, I do suggest that the 
energy consumption habits of all Canadians are an area for 
scrutiny. Rather than generate more energy we need to learn to 
use less. Therein lies the solution.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank you and the hon. members of this House for 
permission to sit due to a cast on my leg.
<P>
	I heartily endorse the motion introduced by the hon. member 
for Davenport this evening. The House has heard something of 
the history of climate change and what the world and Canada are 
doing about it.
<P>
	I should like to present some thoughts on the economic 
aspects of this issue. Ultimately climate change could have a 
major impact on jobs, business and farms throughout our 
country. That makes it a matter of vital importance to every 
Canadian. We all need to understand and better know what its 
effects will be.
<P>
	The impact could potentially be crippling. A melting polar ice 
cap could disrupt east coast fisheries. Rising sea levels could 
inundate low lying areas of the Atlantic provinces. On the Great 
Lakes water levels could fall sharply, stranding industries. We 
could see more frequent and more violent storms. Draughts 
could worsen on the prairies. New diseases and insect pests 
could infest our crops and threaten human health. Flooding 
could occur in the Fraser River basin. In the north the permafrost 
would no longer provide a solid foundation for buildings and 
pipelines, putting existing installations at risk.
<P>
	These developments would translate into economic loss and it 
could be more severe because of the particular nature of 
Canada's economy. This is highly dependent on resource based 
industries such as agriculture, fisheries and forestry, all of 
which are very sensitive to climate change.
<P>
	In view of that sensitivity, Canada must act vigorously to try 
to mitigate possible climate change. The most direct way that we 
can do so is by reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases, 
especially carbon dioxide.
<P>
	While Canadians make up only half of 1 per cent of the global 
population, we do account for 2 per cent of the worldwide 
emissions of greenhouse gases.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	On a planetary scale we generate far more than our fair share 
of greenhouse gases. Unless Canada and other developed 
countries take the lead and demonstrate that we are serious 
about cutting our emissions the developing world will not begin 
to do its part to bring the problem under control.
<P>
	To remedy the situation we first need to understand why it has 
occurred, where do Canada's greenhouse gases come from and 
why are they so high in proportion to our population. The 
answers to these questions have to do with Canada's geography, 
demography and economic infrastructure.
<P>
	We live in a huge thinly settled country of cold climate and 
long winters. We must make heavy use of transportation, 
heating and artificial lighting. Our population is growing faster 
than that of most developed nations. Our economy relies to a 
disproportionate degree on resource extraction and agriculture. 
These activities are generally more energy intensive than 
manufacturing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8158"> 8158 </A></B>
<P>
	We also rely on abundant reasonably priced domestic energy 
sources such as coal, hydro, natural gas, uranium and oil. We 
sell to other countries mainly forestry products, minerals, 
agricultural goods and various energy products.
<P>
	When the time comes for drawing up international accounts 
the emissions associated with the activities producing these 
exports are attributed to Canada, not to the countries that 
consume the exports. In contrast, Canadian imports are 
generally less energy intensive but we receive no credit for that.
<P>
	However, the last factor affecting greenhouse gas emissions 
cannot be blamed on anyone else and that is the relatively 
affluent lifestyle of Canadians. We regard as necessities what 
would be unimaginable luxuries to most inhabitants of third 
world countries, but those necessities come at a price, our 
disproportionately high release of greenhouse gases. With many 
factors conspiring to drive up our use of energy and our 
greenhouse gas releases it might seem a daunting task to try to 
hold them to acceptable levels.
<P>
	Though the picture I have painted may be grim, there are 
grounds for optimism and the source is the concept that has 
become a rallying cry for our times, sustainable development. 
The idea of sustainability entered the public awareness about the 
same time as the threat of climate change in the mid-1980s. For 
radical problems it proposes a radical dynamic solution; 
re-establishing a balance between human activities and natural 
systems, integrating economic and environmental goals, 
working not for short term profits but for long term benefits and 
enhancing the quality of life.
<P>
	Earlier it had seemed that advocates of the environment had to 
be adversaries of human progress and vice versa. Sustainable 
development taught us that this is not the way things have to be. 
Countless times in the past humanity has turned seeming 
obstacles into challenges and barriers into opportunities for 
advancement. That is what the environmental challenge of our 
time is.
<P>
	That is what the threat of planet change is, a looming danger 
certainly but at the same time a spur to find new and better ways 
of doing business and living our lives. It is an opportunity to do 
things more efficiently, more effectively, more competitively 
and, above all, more sustainably. The problem has been clearly 
identified: rapidly increasing emissions of greenhouse gases 
accumulating in the atmosphere at record levels, altering 
climate in ways that may not be completely predictable but are 
quite possibly very severe. The solution surely is obvious, 
bringing the emissions under control to keep the changes of 
climate within acceptable parameters.
<P>
	The question then becomes how can we control or reduce 
emissions. We need to reduce the energy needed to power our 
economy. We need to continue building a less energy intensive 
economy and choosing a less energy intensive lifestyle. That is 
by no means a fantasy. After  all, over the last two decades we 
have seen the automobile industry wrestle successfully with this 
problem. Today it manufactures cars that go much farther on a 
litre of gasoline and that burn their fuel much cleaner than in the 
1960s. That is only an indication of what is possible but it shows 
us the direction we should take.
<P>
	We need to work toward energy conservation, energy 
efficiency and the use of non-polluting renewable energy 
sources. As representatives of the Canadian public there are 
many ways in which we can further this effort. One of the most 
important is by fostering science and appropriate technology 
development in pursuit of our climate change goals. We must 
support the people who are looking for new knowledge and new 
solutions. We must encourage research and development and we 
must smooth the path from thinking up bright ideas to 
successfully marketing them on a large scale. New ideas are 
central to Canada's environmental industries which make up one 
of the fastest growing sectors of the economy today.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	A few weeks ago the government announced a Canadian 
environmental industry strategy, a co-ordinated approach to 
promoting this sunrise sector. The potential is for this to become 
one of Canada's export leaders, developing new energy saving 
techniques and marketing them domestically and abroad.
<P>
	Infrastructure renewal is still another opportunity for 
promoting resource conservation. The old deteriorating 
installations squander energy and release pollutants. The 
government's municipal infrastructure program is helping 
replace these relics of the past with clean and efficient facilities.
<P>
	I mention as well the high cost of transportation in Canada. 
Now a new expressway beckons us, one that will not become 
snowbound in winter or develop potholes in the first spring 
thaw.
<P>
	I am referring of course to the information superhighway, the 
electronic network with possibilities that organizations and 
individuals are only starting to explore. It is the kind of business 
that Canada should be involved in where distances and weather 
are immaterial and energy expenditures are minimal.
<P>
	These are all measures that promote energy conservation and 
efficiency and do the right thing for climate change. At the same 
time, however, they and other initiatives are creating business 
opportunities and jobs. Another example is the growing 
technology not only of government installations but also of 
private homes, offices and industrial plants.
<P>
	The measures are transforming our country's economy, 
making our companies more efficient, more productive and 
more competitive. After all, the firm that can get more for its 
energy dollar is the firm that can sell at a lower price. In today's 
cost 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8159"> 8159 </A></B>
<P>
conscious, competitive  markets, that is the firm that is going to 
get its customers back.
<P>
	I have heard claims that we cannot afford action to avert 
climate changes, that it comes at too high a cost and will price us 
out of the global marketplace. The very reverse is true. We 
cannot afford not to act.
<P>
	Our major trading partners have plans for stabilizing their 
greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000. They include 
Britain, the United States and Germany. Denmark is a northern 
country with cold temperatures like Canada. Despite that, it has 
a plan to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in emissions by the year 
2005. There may be some doubt about whether all these 
countries will actually achieve stabilization of emissions at 
1990 levels as they are setting out to do but at least they have 
made the commitment and have started along the path toward 
that goal.
<P>
	They are taking steps that all can see and measure. Canada 
must do the same and members can begin by giving their support 
to this motion now before the House. It is only sensible to adopt 
a precautionary approach in addressing the issues of climate 
change. We must take steps now, not wait until later when more 
painful or more costly solutions may and will be required.
<P>
	Granted, climate change poses a great threat to Canada but the 
effort to counter climate change is an undertaking that summons 
all the best qualities of Canadians, imagination, drive, a 
willingness to innovate, an entrepreneurial spirit and a taste for 
hard work. These are the qualities that built our country and 
have repeatedly won for it the number one ranking by the United 
Nations human development index.
<P>
	Those qualities will help us face the challenge of climate 
change and in doing so we will ensure a bright, sustainable 
future for Canada. It is a fine line between a healthy 
environment, a sustainable environment-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I regret, the 
member's time has elapsed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the motion tabled by the hon. member for 
Davenport. We both sit on the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development. Through our 
numerous meetings, I have come to know the hon. member, who 
is a former environment minister and also a man dedicated to 
promoting a sound environment.
<P>
	However, I am surprised that, given his professionalism, he 
would table a motion which, albeit positive, is excessively 
vague and non directive.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	Motion M-168 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in anticipation of 
global climate change, consider the advisability of promoting energy 
conservation and efficiency, as well as placing greater reliance on renewable 
sources of energy so as to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and nuclear power.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	With all due respect, I submit that this motion does not have 
any substance.
<P>
	``The government should- consider the advisability of 
promoting-'' I have often seen laws and regulations designed 
to monitor stakeholders more closely. I am referring to the 
opposite of what is called a toothless piece of legislation. The 
motion says: ``The government should''. Does this mean 
``should'' or ``should really''?
<P>
	At the rate Liberals are examining, consulting and discussing, 
they will consider the issue for a long time. Let me give you an 
example. The health sector: Four years and $12 million later the 
government suddenly realizes that this field falls under 
provincial jurisdiction. It was a mistake. Not to worry. We just 
start all over again.
<P>
	Why this vague wording? Maybe the hon. member knows that 
the government is not able or does not have the will to 
implement its laws. Canada's environmental act is one of the 
most comprehensive and complex. We are in the process of 
reviewing it.
<P>
	The Canadian Environmental Protection Act gives the 
Canadian government several powers to reduce our dependency 
on fossil fuels. However, the act regarding political party 
financing allows oil companies to make substantial 
contributions to the party in power. There may not be a link, at 
least, this is not what I meant.
<P>
	As I was saying, under the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act, the government could have promoted the 
reduction of energy consumption. It is easy to say, less easy to 
prove. I will anyway.
<P>
	The preamble of the act states ``Whereas the government of 
Canada in demonstrating national leadership should establish 
national environmental quality objectives, guidelines and codes 
of practice-''
<P>
	I am not saying I agree with this, but it is in the preamble.
<P>
	Further in the preamble, it says: ``And whereas Canada must 
be able to fulfil its international obligations in respect of the 
environment-''. I will speak later about the failure to meet the 
commitments made by Canada in Rio to reduce at the source the 
emission of greenhouse gases. A lack of will, probably.
<P>
	In section 2 of the same act, we are told that we can take both 
preventative and remedial measures in protecting the 
environment. Preventative and remedial. However in a 1994 
catalogue 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8160"> 8160 </A></B>
<P>
about human activity and the environment, Statistics Canada 
shows that between  1985 and 1991, the net production of coal 
rose from 60,000 kilotonnes to 71,000 kilotonnes.
<P>
	Statistics Canada lists in this report environmental 
considerations relating to coal production, including idle land, 
land cave-in, surface erosion and inorganic detrital matter.
<P>
	According to the same report, with respect to carbon dioxide 
emissions caused by the use of fossil fuel, CO2 levels have 
increased from 387 megatonnes in 1982 to 436 megatonnes in 
1992. What we are talking about here is a greenhouse gas. Given 
these figures, I do not know what to think of the advisability of 
promotion, as the hon. member for Davenport puts it. At any 
rate, let us see what else the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act says.
<P>
	In Part II, Clause 47 reads: ``The Governor in Council may 
make regulations prescribing, with respect to any fuel or fuel 
used for any purpose, the concentration or quantity of any 
element, component or additive that, in the opinion of the 
Governor in Council, if exceeded, would, on the combustion of 
the fuel in ordinary circumstances, result in a significant 
contribution to air pollution''.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	Under the new gasoline regulations made in March 1991, 
Environment Canada carried out 1,141 inspections, but 
conducted only two inquiries and issued five warnings. 
Considering that, based on Statistics Canada figures, between 
five and ten tons of oil are spilled every year in oil-producing 
provinces, one can wonder if this government really has any will 
to act.
<P>
	Before putting forth such a motion, we should check whether 
or not legislation has already been enacted regarding energy 
efficiency, fossil fuels and nuclear power. As it turns out in this 
case, several acts already deal with these subjects.
<P>
	The Oil and Gas Production and Conservation Act, a federal 
act, the National Energy Board Act, the Environmental 
Protection Act, the Canadian Petroleum Resources Act and the 
Oil Substitution and Conservation Act are already in place to 
control this type of energy.
<P>
	As I just tried to explain, Canada has extensive legislation 
dealing with an area that, I may recall, falls under provincial 
jurisdiction. Consider Hydro-Québec, which for many years has 
promoted the cause of saving energy, for instance, through its 
1-800-ÉNERGIE line, which is more readily available and 
accessible than proposals coming from the federal government.
<P>
	Furthermore, as the Minister of the Environment said herself 
in Bathurst, if reducing gas emissions is a provincial 
responsibility, then saving energy should also be a provincial 
matter. In concluding, as the hon. member for Davenport may 
have noticed, I felt that his motion lacked consistency and 
tended to ignore the many jurisdictions around us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot support this 
motion because the framer has used the old debater's trick of 
setting up a straw man in order to knock it down.
<P>
	The motion is predicated on the assumption that because there 
has been a recent warming trend, that we have entered into a 
period of global climate change. This is alleged to be due to 
intensification of the greenhouse effect by increased 
atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide due to combustion of 
fossil fuels. If that sounds convoluted, I guess it is because it is 
convoluted.
<P>
	The framer of the motion, the member for Davenport, has 
inferred that this hypothesis is universally accepted by 
climatologists. I would hasten to say this is not true. In fact, I 
believe that the concept of catastrophic global warming has a lot 
more popularity in the press than it does in scientific journals. 
We are now confronted with doomsday scenarios. The hon. 
member for Cumberland-Colchester repeated a few of them.
<P>
	It reminds me of a quotation from Goethe who said: ``The 
phrases that men are prone to repeat incessantly end by 
becoming convictions and ossify the organs of intelligence''.
<P>
	Climatic changes have been observed throughout recorded 
history and they have been a feature of life on earth for 
millennia. I am not talking about the gross shifts which resulted 
from continental drift many millions of years ago. I am referring 
to changes that have recurred throughout the Pleistocene period.
<P>
	There have been a series of ice ages and some climatologists 
suggest that we are still living within a warm cycle of one of 
them. In any event, it is only a few thousand years ago that this 
site was overlaid by many hundreds of feet of ice.
<P>
	On a smaller, more humanly comprehensive time scale there 
is much evidence of climate change within the last couple of 
thousand years. For example, I have examined ancient mine 
workings in the deserts of North Africa and Yemen. These mines 
date from the very early days of the Islamic period. They come 
complete with very large piles of slag and piles of water-washed 
tailings which to me is absolute proof positive that there were, 
within recorded historical time, large numbers of trees and lots 
of water available in what is now desert. I am not talking about 
simple desertification of the sort that we have going on in the 
Sahel today. I am talking about massive climate change. This 
has been within the last 1,200 or 1,300 years at most.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8161"> 8161 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	There have been cold periods too. The Norse settlements of 
Greenland, which existed between the 11th and 14th centuries, 
disappeared because of a climate change. The glaciers actually 
advanced out over the settlements. They lost all contact with the 
old country and some hundreds of years later when people came 
back they found some genetic vestiges of them in the Eskimos. It 
is only in very recent years that they have begun to find their 
ancient stone and earth works because the glaciers have been 
receding again.
<P>
	Less than 300 years ago Europe had what was called the little 
ice age, when hundreds and thousands of peasants died of 
exposure or starvation because their crops failed. We had this 
terrible cooling period.
<P>
	Cores of ice from Greenland and the Himalayas prove that 
carbon dioxide levels on earth have varied radically over time. 
Curiously one peak period of atmospheric carbon dioxide 
corresponds to the period of the little ice age.
<P>
	How much time do I have left, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Regrettably one minute 
would be about the tops right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> I would like to present some facts and figures.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Well, it might be helpful 
to the House if the member could indicate how long that might 
be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> About four minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent to allow the member from Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia to conclude his remarks?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> I thank the House. We have two 
well-established facts before us. The carbon dioxide content of 
the atmosphere is higher than it was a century ago, and the 
average earth temperature has been increasing for a little over a 
decade.
<P>
	Are these two phenomena related? We do not know. There is 
no convincing evidence to say that they are, and I would say that 
it ain't necessarily so. There are just too many variables and they 
are not well understood.
<P>
	The earth's reflectivity, for example, varies from year to year, 
depending on the amount of frost and snow we get in the polar 
regions, or depending on the amount of cloud cover. Ocean 
currents, particularly in the eastern Pacific, have a gross effect 
on temperatures. Solar flare activity is probably the most 
important, and yet this is a factor that has never been thoroughly 
studied and is only partially understood.
<P>
	However, let me play devil's advocate and say that, okay, CO2 
increasing in the atmosphere is truly a problem. Termites are 
said to contribute 50 billion tonnes a year of carbon dioxide to 
the atmosphere. That is more than is produced by all of the 
human consumption of fossil fuels on earth. If we are having an 
increase in CO2, the major contributor is probably a negative 
rather than a positive effect. I am referring to the destruction of 
the world's rain forests which serve as a carbon sink. If the 
carbon dioxide has nowhere to go it stays in the air.
<P>
	To proceed with an energy plan based on flimsy and rather 
badly scientifically studied evidence I would say is 
irresponsible, and I wonder if the long term motive behind all of 
this might be to excuse the installation of the carbon tax. We 
have discussed that several times in the House.
<P>
	But suppose global warming is a real threat? What are the 
reasonable alternatives? The motion speaks of alternative 
energy sources, but in my experience alternative energy, as most 
people describe it, could more properly be described as 
``supplementary energy''. Wind, solar and biomass all have a 
legitimate place in the energy mix but to quote Dr. Petr 
Beckmann: ``You cannot run a modern industrial state on 
sunbeams, summer breezes, fumaroles and chicken manure''. 
There are only three practical energy alternatives and those are 
coal, oil, and nuclear.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Davenport as a scientifically trained 
man knows that wind and sunlight are very diffuse sources of 
energy. For example, the total energy output from the sun which 
can be received on earth under optimum conditions at the 
equator is not much more than one kilowatt per square metre.
<P>
	I would suggest that my colleague's estimate of land 
requirements for solar thermal conversion are low by a factor of 
about five. I sharpened up my own pencil and using very 
optimistic assumptions of thermal and mechanical efficiency, 
panel spacings and so on, I calculated that a 600 megawatt solar 
plant would occupy a land area of about 50 square kilometres.
<P>
	This monster, according to the Solar Energy Research 
Institute, or some figures I have extrapolated from one of its 
publications would require about 20,000 tonnes of aluminum, 
1,200,000 tonnes of concrete, 350,000 tonnes of steel, 45,000 
tonnes of glass, and 4,500 tonnes of copper.
<P>
	What would be the energy balance? I would hesitate to try to 
calculate it. I do not feel I have the competence but I wonder 
with all of those extremely high energy consuming materials if 
we would not end up with a solar plant serving out its total 
operational life and giving out less energy than what went into 
building it in the first place.
<P>

<P>
	I had a few more words but I think I have run out my four 
minutes. I got in what I really wanted to get in and I thank the 
House and the Speaker for their courtesy.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me ask, colleagues, if 
that same co-operation would allow us to go to the mover of the 
motion. The hon. member for Davenport under right of reply is 
entitled to two minutes to close off the debate on this motion. 
Agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank 
you for this opportunity.
<P>
	Indeed as in every other debate there is a lot to be learned. I 
have learned a lot during this hour from the input given by my 
colleagues whom I would like to thank.
<P>
	The member for Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia 
has done a lot of homework. It seems to me however that he is 
putting forward observations that over the centuries have been 
made by the scientific community and which are geologically 
proven, no doubt.
<P>
	However he is not aware of the fact that in recent times, in 
1988 in Toronto at the international conference attended by 
scientists the scientific community concluded that there is a 
problem here in terms of climate change. Yes, there were a few 
dissenting voices but nevertheless a large part of the scientific 
community was of the opinion that we have to deal with climate 
change resulting from greenhouse gas emissions. That 
conclusion was reinforced and fleshed out in more detail in 1991 
at the climate conference held in Geneva.
<P>
	Next year in March a second conference on climate change 
will take place in Germany at which governments will 
participate to work out a global plan.
<P>
	Evidently the scientific community first and then the 
politicians in the world have come to a conclusion of substance 
here despite all the understandable and justifiable doubts that 
have been expressed by the hon. member.
<P>
	I concur with the member for Comox-Alberni in his warning 
that it is a difficult path. Change cannot be achieved overnight. 
We have to look at a mix if I understood him correctly and not 
rely on a shift from one set of sources, the non-renewable to the 
renewable, and hope that the problem will dissolve. He is quite 
right. We cannot do it quickly and it is a very long and difficult 
path.
<P>
<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	It seems to me that the members for Laurentides and 
Terrebonne missed the point. We, or at least I look at this issue 
as a form of co-operative federalism. They interpret this issue 
as one of interference in provincial jurisdiction. Evidently there 
is a profound ideological difference.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to thank and express my gratitude to 
the member for Cumberland-Colchester for her impassioned 
and very interesting intervention, for her incisive analysis, for 
her support and for warning us about the importance of the 
precautionary principle.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 96 the order is dropped from the 
Order Paper.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ENDANGEREDSPECIES">ENDANGERED SPECIES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on November 17 the Minister of the Environment 
released a discussion paper concerning endangered species in 
Canada. That discussion paper proposes that the laws protecting 
Canada's endangered species be strengthened. I could not agree 
more. In fact there is something in this that most Canadians do 
not know.
<P>
	Canada is one jurisdiction in the world that does not have 
federal legislation protecting species at risk. We do however 
have provincial laws that have been praised for their efforts. In 
Ontario I might mention Jim Wiseman. The NDP MPP for 
Durham West has brought forth a private member's bill that has 
received broad support. Wiseman's bill which passed second 
reading with unanimous consent of the provincial legislature 
last week would promote identification and assessment to 
conserve, protect, manage, restore and reintroduce as well as 
rehabilitate endangered, threatened and vulnerable species in 
their habitats.
<P>
	In spite of this eight out of Canada's ten provinces and two 
territories have no specific legislation protecting endangered 
species. Most provinces do have general wildlife laws, but these 
are directed primarily at regulating hunting of game species. We 
cannot forget that Canada is a nation with a strong international 
reputation for environmental awareness. It is a shame that we 
still do not have federal legislation dealing with endangered 
species.
<P>
	Although Canada does a good job at identifying species at risk 
and preparing lists of species that require attention, Canada does 
not have any laws requiring that anything be done once a species 
is listed in any way. I have heard the situation described as 
operating similar to a hospital which records the names of its 
patients, assesses their illnesses, but does absolutely nothing to 
treat them.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8163"> 8163 </A></B>
<P>
	As a member of Parliament from the prairies I want to bring to 
the minister's attention the example of the burrowing owl. It has 
been listed as endangered for years. It is a small owl with the 
unusual habit of nesting underground.
<P>
	The biggest threat to its survival I am told is the use of a 
particularly toxic pesticide called carbofuran. There are other 
chemicals that could be used to do the same thing. Some farmers 
have joined a World Wildlife Fund program to save the 
burrowing owl by setting aside certain parts of their fields, but 
their actions are purely voluntary.
<P>
	At the same time as this activity is going on at the federal 
level, the registration of carbofuran is still under review by 
Agriculture Canada. If Canada had endangered species 
legislation, alternatives for carbofuran could be mandated to 
protect the burrowing owl before it slides further toward 
extinction.
<P>
	It should be noted that Canada played a leadership role at the 
Rio de Janeiro international United Nations environment 
conference in the negotiation of the biodiversity convention 
now signed by 160 countries. Canada would therefore have an 
obligation in international law to live up to its terms which 
include a commitment to establish legislation or regulations for 
the protection of threatened species and populations.
<P>
	In follow up, the House Standing Committee on the 
Environment in November 1992 unanimously agreed to 
consider the necessary legislation that would act to protect 
species, habitat, ecosystems and biodiversity in Canada. We 
have yet to live up to that commitment or the recommendation of 
the committee.
<P>
	Canada, we recognize, does have divided and overlapping 
jurisdictions but it is essential that Canada's federal, provincial 
and aboriginal leaders work in a co-ordinated way to ensure that 
this happens as soon as possible.
<P>
	The Rio convention on biological diversity was signed by 
Canada on June 11, 1992. The convention stands for the 
recognition of the value measured as economic value, aesthetic 
value, value from ecological services and even the spiritual 
value of maintaining the wealth of plant and animal species and 
of their genetic diversity found on the planet earth.
<P>
	It would be most appropriate for Canada's first federal 
legislation dealing with species protection to be ready for 
introduction on June 11, 1995, the third anniversary of the 
signing of the convention.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment has indicated in the 
discussion paper that she and her department will consult with 
Canadians with an idea to bringing in new legislation. In 
suggesting that the minister consider June 11 as the target date, I 
ask that she plan for a specific date for the introduction of what 
will be significant and important legislation for all of us.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last Thursday the Deputy Prime 
Minister in her role as Minister of the Environment met three 
young children who came from three Canadian cities, Calgary, 
London and Moncton, asking this Parliament to do more to 
protect endangered species.
<P>
	As the hon. member has noted, on that same day the minister 
released a discussion paper for a new framework to protect 
endangered species. That paper sets out a national framework 
for comprehensive protection of all endangered species in 
Canada. Currently there are 236 endangered, threatened and 
vulnerable animal and plant species in this country.
<P>
	We released this paper to stimulate public thought and 
discussion. In January and February there will be public 
consultations. We need the views of scientists, aboriginal people 
and environmentalists, as well as farmers, fishermen, labour 
groups, businesses and local communities.
<P>
	The discussion paper sees federal framework legislation as 
one component of a national approach that could be introduced 
in the House next spring. This legislation could establish a 
national, independent, scientific body and it could also set up a 
process for assessing the status of species considered to be 
nationally endangered. The species listing from that process 
would become a schedule under the federal act but also could be 
incorporated into provincial legislation.
<P>
	The federal government cannot nor does it want to move alone 
to ensure protection for all species. We need to work closely 
with the provinces. A national approach to endangered species 
protection will allow federal and provincial actions to 
complement each other, not compete.
<P>
	We are only going to succeed to save endangered species if all 
Canadians co-operate and if we listen to the concerns of all 
Canadians. We must ensure that federal and provincial laws 
work together. That is the only way we can save our endangered 
species.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 
p.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.28 p.m.)
