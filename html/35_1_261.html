been signed by a number of Canadians from Edmonton, Alberta.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society. They also state that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families that make the choice to provide care 
in the home to preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill 
or the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination  against families that 
decide to provide care in the home to preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order, notice of which I gave the Chair 
this morning.
<P>
	This point of order concerns the government's disregard of 
Standing Order 109, under which it is required within 150 days of 
the presentation of a report from a standing or special committee to 
table a comprehensive response.
<P>
	On June 20, 1995 the Standing Committee on Environment and 
Sustainable Development presented its fifth report concerning its 
review of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act in the House 
of Commons. According to Standing Order 109 the deadline for the 
government to table its response to this report was yesterday, 
Monday, November 20, 1995. As of today, Tuesday, November 21, 
1995 the government has not tabled its response and has given no 
indication of when it might do so.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, on April 19, 1993 your predecessor ruled on two 
questions of privilege raised by the members for 
Scarborough-Rouge River and Winnipeg South Centre relating to 
the issue of the late tabling of documents. In his ruling the former 
Speaker had this to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><A NAME="16578"> 16578 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I find the situation particularly disheartening-There are people in 
departments who are supposed to know these rules and are supposed to ensure that 
they are carried out.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In both of these cases the government failed to do so until after the matter was 
brought to the attention of this House-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As members are well aware, the tabling of documents constitutes a 
fundamental procedure of this House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is part of our rules and ensures that members have access to the information 
necessary to effectively deal with the issues before Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Your predecessor ruled that the Standing Committee on House 
Management should examine the issue of late tabling and the 
House agreed to such a motion moved by the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River.
<P>
	Consequently, the committee tabled its report on this matter on 
June 17, 1993.
<P>
	The committee report stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Speaker's ruling clearly sets out the issues involved.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are provisions in the Standing Orders of the House as well as many 
statutes passed by the House that require documents to be tabled in the House 
within certain time periods.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Non-compliance with a deadline set out in a statute or the standing orders is a 
serious matter. It constitutes a breach of law, or a rule of the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The committee believes that the statutory and procedural time limits must be 
complied with.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I continue to quote from the committee's report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If a document cannot be tabled within the prescribed time, the responsible 
minister should advise the House accordingly before the deadline; it is not 
acceptable that the deadline be ignored.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It may be that the time periods set out in the Standing Orders and certain 
statutes need to be reviewed and, where necessary, amended.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Until this is done, however, it is essential that the deadlines be respected.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask that, as the committee 
that studied this matter recommended, until these time limits can 
be reviewed, you rule that the government should immediately 
table its response to the fifth report of the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development, as required by 
Standing Order 109.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake for putting his point so succinctly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
just discovered the situation that the hon. member has described a 
few moments before the sitting opened. Had I been aware of it 
beforehand, certainly I would have made inquiries in order to 
provide him with more detailed information for the reason for the 
apparent lapse in the filing of this document on time.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member I will take the matter up with the 
Minister of the Environment and make inquiries as to why there 
has been this apparent delay in the tabling of the report.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for drawing the point to the attention of 
the House. The comments that he makes with respect to the 
application of the rule and its importance to the workings of the 
House are extremely apt and timely. I do not disagree with his 
suggestion in that regard.
<P>
	I will have to look into the facts surrounding the preparation of 
the government response to the report and get back to the hon. 
member and to the House at the earliest possible time. I hope to be 
in a position to do that shortly after question period today.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair will take the matter under 
advisement and thanks both members for their submissions. I will 
expect the hon. parliamentary secretary to report back to the House 
as indicated earlier today on this matter.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of

rise on a point of order. I think you might find disposition on the 
part of the House to give unanimous consent to the following 
motion. I am sorry I was not ready to present it at the appropriate 
time in Routine Proceedings. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, notwithstanding the provisions of Standing Order 83(1), the Standing 
Committee on Finance may make an interim report on the matters referred to in the 
said standing order no later than December 12, 1995 and may deposit its final report 
thereon with the Clerk of the House on January 17, 1996.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I understand there have been various discussions among the 
parties in respect of the motion and agreements reached in the 
Standing Committee on Finance. It is the intention of all parties 
that those commitments be fulfilled in respect of the adoption of 
the order.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House condemn the government for having dropped the Canadian

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16579"> 16579 </A></B>
<P>
He said: Mr. Speaker, my remarks in support of the motion I put 
forward will certainly go beyond this motion concerning the latest 
statements made by the defence minister and the Department of 
National Defence about the acquisition of certain pieces of 
equipment.
<P>
	First of all, this motion condemns the government for having 
dropped the Canadian content requirements in the latest helicopter 
contract announcement, when this condition was clearly respected 
and even required in previous contracts.
<P>
	I started by reviewing how this matter had evolved, a situation 
that has prompted us to table this motion. During the summer, the 
minister of defence announced the acquisition of British 
submarines, which were to cost $1.6 billion excluding 
maintenance, staff training, and renovations.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We did not buy them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> You are still dreaming.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jacob:</B> Just one moment. I see that the department is 
reacting rather quickly, and I will give you enough time to respond. 
Allow me to continue.
<P>
	Given the population's strong, I would even say violent, 
opposition to the purchase of these submarines, they came back 
with a new formula. The cost of the submarines went down to $500 
million with ill-defined exchanges of training time whose value 
was somewhat indeterminate.
<P>
	The minister announced at the time that negotiations had not 
started and would be postponed. They waited until the middle of 
August, while it was still summer, before telling us that they had 
bought new armoured personnel carriers for our Canadian soldiers.
<P>
	We see that the Canadian content is very high. The contract was 
awarded without tender to a London, Ontario company, a General 
Motors subsidiary, for the manufacture of armoured personnel 
carriers. I then said on behalf of the official opposition that buying 
new armoured personnel carriers was a waste of money when we 
already had over 1,700 of them in stock and when only about 215 or 
218 were used for the most part during the mission in Bosnia.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	The minister had indicated at the time, during special joint 
committee hearings, that a report had been prepared and that the 
Bloc Quebecois agreed with the procurement of these armed 
personnel carriers.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I do not think that the minister bothered to read 
the Bloc's dissenting report, because this report, drafted by the 
Bloc Quebecois members of the Special Joint Committee on 
Canada's Defence Policy, clearly stated that, in our view, buying 
new APCs for better armour protection was only justified if Canada 
and  its peacekeepers were to continue to take part in warlike 
actions and armed conflicts.
<P>
	My understanding, based on what was discussed at committee 
and elsewhere, was that a review of Canada's peace effort was 
contemplated and that we would only participate in missions that 
did not involve the use of weapons, as was always the case in the 
past for our peacekeepers. It seems very clear to me that, if the 
nature of peace missions was to be changed to focus again on 
peacekeeping-the kind of missions the Canadian Armed Forces 
have always being involved in and carried out remarkably-there 
would be no point in having APCs with improved armour since our 
role would have changed. That was clearly stated in the Bloc's 
dissenting report. In this regard, the Bloc Quebecois always stood 
by its policy, remaining steadfast, regardless of what the minister 
and his department might say.
<P>
	Coming back to the history of the tendering for APCs, a certain 
company was awarded without tender the $2 billion armoured 
vehicle acquisition contract.
<P>
	From then on, nothing could be done. When the government 
makes a decision without taking into account the fact that we 
oppose the acquisition of armoured personnel carriers and awards 
the contract, since all members have the duty to look after the 
interests of the people they represent in their region or province, we 
ask that the government at least acknowledge the existence, in 
Quebec, of a company whose expertise in manufacturing armoured 
vehicle turrets is internationally recognized and that it even go a far 
as demanding that the contract and economic benefits be split.
<P>
	Shortly before the referendum, as I recall, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs had sent a letter to Oerlikon stating that 
it would, of course, be considered for a later turret manufacturing 
contract with GM. Later, we learned that there were no dealings 
between GM and Oerlikon and that it was out of the question for 
GM to be forced to go with Oerlikon. The turrets can easily be 
ordered from the U.S. They had no qualms makings this kind of 
statement. This reminds me that all this love expressed before the 
referendum now appears to be dissipating like some sort of vapour 
blown away by the wind.
<P>
	I would like to add, regarding this famous armoured vehicle 
renewal contract, that this is another instance where there seems to 
be something of a double standard. As far as the work to be carried 
out in Quebec is concerned, no problem, no requirements need to 
be set. On the other hand, for those vehicles to be overhauled in 
Chatham-because Chatham was affected by base closures-the 
minister said the part of the work on the 450 armoured vehicles 
must be carried out in Chatham to offset the losses caused by the 
closure of CFB Chatham.
<P>
	Strangely enough, there is no infrastructure whatsoever in 
Chatham to support the repair and overhaul of these vehicles. This 
means that subsidies will  have to be granted, as this was done-as 
several members probably remember-for the Canadian patrol 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16580"> 16580 </A></B>
<P>
frigates, since Halifax did not have the basic infrastructure required 
to build the frigates. Between $350 million and $360 million was 
spent in subsidies to put the infrastructure in place so that the 
shipyard could secure the contract.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	A competitor for MIL Davie, in Lauzon, which had the required 
infrastructure to execute the contract, appeared out of thin air. 
Something similar is happening now. When there is a closing in a 
place such as Chatham, some compensation must be made through 
economic spinoffs. Consequently, the government requires that the 
upgrading of the 450 armoured personnel carriers be done in 
Chatham.
<P>
	As for the closure of the military college in Saint-Jean and the 
downsizing at the military base in that municipality, the 
government should use the same approach, avoid any double 
standard and say: ``Yes, the Saint-Jean region was adversely 
affected. Consequently, since Oerlikon is located in the area, we 
should tell GM that a portion of the armoured personnel carriers 
contract ought to be awarded to Oerlikon''. But no.
<P>
	The minister tells us that he cannot get involved in the 
discussions going on between the companies. If this is the case, 
why is it that he can require that part of the upgrading be done in 
Chatham, where there is no existing infrastructure, but cannot do so 
when a similar situation occurs in Quebec?
<P>
	I now move on to the helicopter issue, more specifically the 
recent announcement made by the defence minister concerning the 
acquisition of 15 search and rescue helicopters. During the review 
of Canada's defence policy, the Bloc did agree with the acquisition 
of search and rescue helicopters.
<P>
	However, it did not agree with buying armoured personnel 
carriers and submarines and this is clearly stated in the dissenting 
report. It might be worth taking a look at that document, so that we 
are not accused of being inconsistent. The fact is that we did show 
consistency in our approach to this issue.
<P>
	In the case of the helicopter contract, there is again some sort of 
a double standard. There is really no Canadian company that builds 
search and rescue helicopters similar to the Labrador. You have to 
go to Boeing with the Chinook, Sikorsky with the S-70, Eurocopter 
with the Cougar, and Agusta-Westland with the Cormoran, as well 
as another Russian company.
<P>
	In Quebec, there is Bell Helicopter. This Quebec company, 
Canadian company builds helicopters that do not quite meet the 
requirements of the defence department for search and rescue 
helicopters. Therefore, the minister decided to call for tenders. 
Since no Canadian company builds these helicopters, a call for  
tenders can be made. No Canadian content requirement has to be 
met. Yet, in the case of these helicopters, we could, given the 
existing infrastructures, have part of the contract executed by a 
Canadian company, or at least demand that this be done, as in the 
case of Chatham, or in the case of GM, in London.
<P>
	As mentioned by the special joint committee in its discussions 
on the procurement policy, the government is adamant about 
calling for tenders, to save money. However, if you use that 
approach, you have to do it all the time and in a consistent manner, 
regardless of which industry is involved, or whether that industry is 
located in Quebec or in Ontario. It is difficult to see any 
consistency in the approach used by the department, since it applies 
a given measure in one case and different one in another situation.
<P>
	Let me give you another example. The defence minister tells us, 
by calling for tenders, that we do not trust our Quebec companies. 
Bell could bid to provide a portion of the helicopter's equipment, 
and Oerlikon could bid to build the turrets of the armoured 
personnel carriers, because we want some Canadian content and we 
want to award contracts to existing companies. But the minister 
tells us that we do not trust our companies.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	It seems to me that he has a funny way of showing his lack of 
confidence in Ontario companies, since in the past five years the 
federal government has awarded more than $3 billion worth of 
contracts in Ontario without any bidding process.
<P>
	I would like to see the same rule apply. If Canadian unity and the 
federal government are so profitable to the provinces, let them put 
their money where their mouth is. As far as I am concerned, the 
only thing they are giving is one more demonstration that, in the 
case of Quebec and, I might add, some other provinces as 
well-Parenthetically, let me add, in connection with the base 
closures in the west and the expansion of the base in Edmonton, 
when you evaluate all of the costs of closing and reconstruction, 
there are no savings; it will cost $60 million more.
<P>
	There are some unkind souls who would say: ``Tough luck for 
those living west of the Rockies, west of Edmonton, because they 
had the misfortune of voting Reform and that is when the bases got 
cut in their region''. I am beginning to realize that this is a kind of 
repeat performance: if you do not vote for the Liberals, you pay for 
it afterward.
<P>
	If that is how Canadian unity is created, I am even more anxious 
for Quebecers to finally wake up to the reality. I have the 
impression that perhaps our colleagues in the West might 
appreciate that too, at some point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Paul):</B> Like in Northern Quebec?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16581"> 16581 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jacob:</B> The comments of my colleagues across the way are 
most amusing.
<P>
	To continue, I would like to add that, during the defence policy 
review, we discussed procurement policy. A degree of agreement 
was reached that National Defence ought in future to purchase from 
companies already equipped with the necessary expertise and 
infrastructures, in order to make optimum use of the taxpayers' 
funds.
<P>
	Here again, in the Bloc's dissenting report, reference was made 
to certain situations in which it had been found that there had been 
overruns, sometimes extremely substantial, and that the 
construction of certain plants had cost the taxpayers dearly. I 
referred earlier to the fact that Halifax got infrastructure subsidies 
in order to obtain the frigate contract. Under such circumstances, 
the costs are definitely greater.
<P>
	Except where it would be more profitable to acquire systems 
already available within Quebec or Canada, I am convinced that 
this procurement policy is a good thing, nevertheless.
<P>
	We must, however, avoid simplistic analyses of the situation. In 
some areas of activity, there are Canadian and Quebec firms which 
are totally competitive and competent and, contrary to some 
people's desire to see all defence spending curtailed or totally 
abolished, I feel that it is definitely necessary. The defence 
industry, whether in Quebec or in Canada, includes certain high 
tech jobs I feel are very important, if not vital, for certain regions, 
whether in Quebec or in elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
	However, as I said right at the start, it is important to have a 
procurement policy but it must be applied consistently, whether in 
a given sector within Quebec or elsewhere in Canada, the 
Maritimes or Ontario for instance.
<P>
	In the dissenting report, reference was made to the necessity of 
our immediately opposing abandonment of the regional 
redistribution policy, because it might serve the interests of Quebec 
businesses in coming months.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	The systems whose manufacture is currently in the planning 
stages call upon technical expertise located outside Quebec, 
whereas the opposite situation has prevailed in the past.
<P>
	For this reason, Quebec may well find it increasingly harder to 
secure its ``fair share'' in future. It is unthinkable that a policy that 
has been a barrier for Quebec in the past could be terminated now, 
at a time when it could be invaluable.
<P>
	That is what we said in the dissenting report prepared by the 
Bloc Quebecois. When the minister says we agreed, we did have 
certain reservations. The minister says we agreed with the purchase 
of armoured personnel carriers, but we had certain reservations and 
as far as the  submarines were concerned, we were definitely 
against that purchase.
<P>
	I may add that at the Department of National Defence, at 
Defence headquarters, there is a policy for defence procurement. It 
is dated June 1995. This is not old stuff. This is an internal 
document circulating within the department.
<P>
	Here is one item that states: ``Contribute to long term regional 
and industrial development and to achieving relevant national 
objectives''.
<P>
	This is another one: ``Priority shall be given to products and 
services that are respectively manufactured and provided in Canada 
and to certain other products and services if there is sufficient 
competition''.
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign, the Liberals often referred 
to a defence conversion program, and in fact this was part of the 
Liberal Party's wonderful red book. They have now been here for 
two years, and I wish someone would show me an example of 
defence conversion. In any case, it certainly did not happen in 
Quebec. If it did anywhere else, it was a well-kept secret. Maybe in 
the maritimes because I vaguely remember that at some time, the 
Minister of Supply and Services tried to take a certain amount from 
the Department of National Defence for some industry.
<P>
	Unfortunately, in every case the defence conversion program 
proposed by the Liberals-and unfortunately people often call this 
having a selective memory-when the Bloc Quebecois approved 
the cancellation of the EH-101 helicopters, that approval was 
conditional on the implementation of a thorough and practical 
defence conversion policy.
<P>
	It has now been two years and nothing has transpired. Some of 
my colleagues will expand a little on the DIPP and the new 
development fund for defence conversion. Let us face it, this is a 
worldwide phenomenon. Since the end of the cold war, the defence 
industry has not been in the best of shapes. Just in Quebec, in the 
past five years, deliveries of defence products have declined by 48 
per cent.
<P>
	This means Quebec has lost nearly 30 per cent of the jobs 
connected with Canada's defence industry. Neither the policy nor 
the promises in the Liberal Party's red book with respect to defence 
conversion specify how this is supposed to work.
<P>
	Several times the minister of defence told us that his budget had 
no money for defence conversion and that it was the responsibility 
of the Department of Industry. In the red book it was put very 
clearly, but we have seen no results. When we in the Bloc point out 
that certain expenditures seem to be a waste of money and the 
government goes ahead anyway, we have no choice but to ask the 
government to apply the same economic spinoff policies it applies 
to Ontario or the maritimes but not to Quebec.

Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 1994 White 
Paper on Defence, published last December provided a mission 
statement for the basic roles of the Department of National Defence 
and the Canadian Armed Forces in a post cold war context.
<P>
	The Department of National Defence's mission is to protect 
Canada, to help keep the peace in the world and to promote 
Canada's interests abroad.
<P>
	Policy focuses on keeping the armed forces versatile and combat 
ready, buying the broadest possible range of military options at a 
reasonable price in Canada. Maintaining the forces enables us to 
carry out our major defence roles, that is, of defending Canada and 
North America and contributing to world security.
<P>
	The defence policy responds to pressing needs to reduce federal 
government expenditures in order to resolve Canada's serious 
financial problems. Defence programs, arising from the 1995 
federal budget, are totally in keeping with the policy set out in the 
white paper. Military expenditures will be brought below $10 
billion over this year and the coming two years. Even though the 
$1.63 billion reduction over this period represents a 14 per cent 
reduction in absolute terms, the department will in fact lose more 
than 18 per cent of its purchasing power. I see this as a victory.
<P>
	Our budget has been cut. We will nevertheless take a number of 
measures to increase the forces' operational capacity. For Canadian 
forces to be able to retain their combat potential, they will be 
provided with indispensable equipment, such as the armoured 
personnel carriers the government has just announced. I noted that 
the hon. member spoke a lot about armoured vehicles and I will 
come back to this a little later on in my speech.
<P>
	The acquisitions program will focus on extending equipment life 
whenever it is cost effective to do so. Only equipment vital to 
maintaining Canadian forces capability will be acquired and 
procurement will be off the shelf whenever possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us talk about this whole question of off the shelf procurement 
and why it makes sense. I would like to dispel a number of myths 
that have developed about off the shelf buying which have 
appeared recently in the press, certainly in the press in the province 
of Quebec.
<P>
	It is a great oversimplification to think of off the shelf buying as 
getting something that is all packaged and ready to pluck from a 
local hardware store. The department of defence has been 
developing and putting into practice a much broader concept of an 
off the shelf acquisition process, one that incorporates elements of 
a much simplified, less prescriptive acquisition approach.  This 
process can be viewed as buying better and buying smarter in a 
more businesslike fashion in acquiring goods and services. It 
maximizes the use of existing industry products, practices and 
technologies.
<P>
	The underlying rationale for this approach is an attempt to 
reduce costs in buying and supporting equipment. Clearly off the 
shelf acquisition is good for taxpayers since it does reduce costs 
and puts our limited money where it is needed most. It is good for 
soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen because it quickly gets the 
needed equipment to them and ensures we have combat capable 
forces.
<P>
	My colleague the parliamentary secretary will talk a little about 
the former practices of developing ideas, concepts, specifications, 
the contracting process, Treasury Board approval and how long it 
takes. He will talk about that from the perspective of being a 
former naval officer, about what it means to the men and women in 
the forces in relation to the delay in getting equipment.
<P>
	Off the shelf procurement is good for industry. Canadian 
industry, especially in the aerospace sector, is now quite mature, 
has good capability and can compete with the best in the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am surprised by the attitude of my colleague opposite, by his 
lack of confidence in the Canadian aerospace industry, which is 
located in the province of Quebec. He has no confidence in his own 
industries, in his own province. This is further evidence of the 
repressive mentality of the separatists and the sovereignists, which 
views Quebec as poor and fragile. I for one do not accept this 
argument.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the recent past there has been an increasing emphasis within 
defence on off the shelf acquisitions. Basically we are trying to do a 
number of things. Wherever possible we try to purchase equipment 
where the performance has been demonstrated in the field. We try 
to evaluate carefully the cost of marginal increases and the 
capability of new equipment. We try to avoid unique Canadian 
solutions that require expensive and risky research development or 
modification of existing equipment. It sounds to me like that is not 
a bad idea.
<P>
	In other words, we in defence and in the government at large are 
becoming smarter buyers. We are maximizing the purchase of what 
is already available to meet defence requirements. We think this is 
essential for the Canadian forces, because it provides our troops 
with the necessary equipment in a timely and cost effective 
manner. We have been very consistent in moving toward a greater 
alliance on off the shelf procurement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16583"> 16583 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In its 1994 report, the Special Joint Committee on Canada's 
Defence Policy-I see that the hon. member was on this 
committee-recommended that the procedure for buying military 
equipment be simplified. The committee called for a commitment 
to buy off the shelf military equipment and to avoid complex 
procedures for buying custom made products. The report also said 
that DND's acquisition policy should emphasize off the shelf 
products.
<P>
	Favouring off the shelf equipment does not mean that DND will 
not consider the need for regional industrial benefits in Canada, but 
there will be times when it is totally appropriate from an economic 
point of view to buy commercially available products. DND will 
certainly not want to needlessly increase procurement costs and 
pay for extra work in order to provide regional benefits.
<P>
	It is very interesting to note that, in his contradictory comments 
on the report of the Special Joint Committee on Canada's Defence 
Policy, the hon. member from the Bloc stated that procurement cost 
overruns are due in large part to the Canadian content restrictions, 
for which taxpayers had to pay more because the existing industrial 
base could not meet the needs.
<P>
	What you have here is a glaring contradiction. What the hon. 
member said today contradicts his Bloc colleagues' minority 
response to the report of the Special Joint Committee on Canada's 
Defence Policy, as well as all the sovereignist arguments we have 
heard in recent months. They are always contradicting themselves.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to deal with one of the real canards-we use that in 
English, but we do not use it in French in quite the same way-the 
hon. member has thrown on the floor of the House of Commons: 
this notion that the province of Quebec is once again subjected to 
terrible things by the federal government, in this case in the area of 
defence.
<P>
	Quebec has about 25 per cent of the population of Canada. About 
20 per cent of total defence expenditures are spent in the province 
of Quebec, not quite the 25 per cent. However, when it comes to 
capital purchases it is about 27 per cent. That is because much of 
the defence industry in this country is located in the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	The hon. member, as I said earlier, does not seem to have 
confidence that the industry in his own province can compete in the 
case of the search and rescue helicopters and in the case of the 
armoured personnel carriers. He gives the impression that the 
armoured personnel carriers are going to be totally and absolutely 
built, every bolt, every part, in London, Ontario. That is crazy. He 
knows that is not the truth.
<P>
	The GM diesel division in London, Ontario assembles-and it 
does a very good job-the armoured personnel carriers, but most of 
the parts, the motors and other equipment come from other places. 
Guess what? Some of those places just happen to be in the province 
of Quebec, but he would not admit that because he does not have 
faith.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	This is one contradiction we see in the separatist argument, 
whether it is on national unity or on something like defence. They 
do not have confidence in themselves. They do not have confidence 
in what Quebec has attained within Canada. The aerospace industry 
is primarily situated in the province of Quebec, and it does a pretty 
good job. We recognize that. However, it would be nice if 
somebody like the hon. member and his party, the Bloc Quebecois, 
would recognize and have confidence in their own industry.
<P>
	Let us talk about how Quebec has really been put under the 
thumb in recent years. One of the few things the previous 
government did that I could support was direct a contract to Bell 
Helicopter in Montreal. The hon. member stood a few minutes ago 
and lambasted us for directing the contract to General Motors 
diesel division. The Tories did that, and guess who the beneficiary 
was? It was Bell Helicopter. The condition was that they would 
build a brand new plant in Mirabel. I have been through the plant 
and I have been on the new Griffon helicopters, and they are 
outstanding. That is technology that is in Quebec. The hon. 
member does not recognize that. It was a $1.2 billion contract.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A $1.2 billion contract was awarded to a Quebec company, Bell 
Helicopter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Why? Because Bell Helicopter agreed to establish this plant as 
the prime builder for certain lines of helicopters. It gave the world 
product mandate to Bell Helicopter in Montreal.
<P>
	General Motors of the United States has done the same thing in 
Ontario on armoured personnel carriers and with diesel 
locomotives. The diesel division of General Motors has a world 
product mandate.
<P>
	The hon. member could be mired in the isolationist, regional 
politics of Quebec and of the past grievances, but I think even the 
sovereignists in Quebec have to appreciate that the world has 
changed, that we are competing globally, competing in a North 
American free trade environment.
<P>
	After making very painful adjustments, which hurt Quebec and 
hurt Ontario in many of the manufacturing industries, Canada is 
now starting to see some light. It is companies like General Motors 
and Bell Helicopter and a raft of others that are getting the world 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16584"> 16584 </A></B>
<P>
product mandate  for particular equipment, systems, and 
technologies that will be the future of Canada and the future of 
Quebec.
<P>
	The hon. member has consistently attacked the government 
defence policies with respect to closures.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is not true to say that the closure of the Collège militaire royal 
is the only closure in the country under the budget of two years ago, 
it is not true.
<P>
	It is very difficult as a Liberal minister to close bases in 
Cornwallis and Shelburne, Nova Scotia and elsewhere in the 
province, in Ottawa and Toronto and in Chatham, New Brunswick. 
It is very difficult to close these bases. We closed 30 bases across 
the country, but the word is the government closed only the Collège 
militaire royal in Quebec. It is not true. This is another example of 
selection of incorrect information.
<P>
	In the last budget, we announced the closure of the base in 
Chilliwack, British Columbia. One of the measures is to move a 
school-where, you ask-to the Saint-Jean base in Quebec. Oh no. 
The poor people of Quebec do not get their share of military 
installations. Not true. We moved the cadet and recruit school from 
Cornwallis to the Saint-Jean military base, to the big complex, the 
big building. We moved this school, and, in the last budget, we 
announced the move of the Chilliwack school to Saint-Jean.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	He talks about the expansion of the base in Edmonton, Alberta as 
a major base. I know you are very interested in this base because 
you are a member for Edmonton. This is logical.
<P>
	The hon. member neglected to tell the House that we expanded 
the Valcartier base, in his own riding. It is a big, big undertaking. 
He is well aware that a lot of buildings went up and that there was a 
lot of construction in his riding, but he forgets to mention it. It is a 
political issue, because Quebec is always the victim in the 
Canadian yoke. Not true.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What we see here are inaccuracies, half truths, a selection of 
facts that do not add up with what we have done.
<P>
	They want to talk about French speaking Canadians in the armed 
forces. About 30 per cent of the army are francophones. About 27 
per cent of our officer level are francophones. We have had no 
trouble recruiting for the Royal Military College in Kingston.
<P>
	The debate we had was interesting. My good friend, the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands, has successfully worked with 
local officials in Kingston to expand the college.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am proud as a Canadian to visit the Royal Military College in 
Kingston and to see that it is bilingual. It is an institution that is not 
in the province of Quebec, but it is entirely bilingual. Every day, 
both English and French are spoken there. The atmosphere is very 
Canadian, bilingual, and I think it came about as the result of a 
decision to concentrate everything in Kingston.
<P>
	However, I am told the hon. member for Charlesbourg visited the 
college with a colleague and was disappointed. He was really 
disappointed, because he could find nothing to criticize. He spoke 
with young soldiers and cadets, and everyone told him things were 
fine there.
<P>
	We are well aware that it is not exactly the province of Quebec. 
We know that Kingston is primarily an English city, but it has a 
very warm welcome for francophones. The mayor and the people 
of Kingston, the people at Queen's University and all of the 
institutions made a real effort to welcome francophones to 
Kingston.
<P>
	He was really disappointed. I am told he saw no problems. He 
was exasperated, because he would criticize the closure of the 
Collège militaire royal in Saint-Jean daily in the House, and when 
he visited the college in Kingston, he realized that his criticism was 
unfounded.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have here yet another example of the separatists coming to 
the House and provoking people's emotions. Every night on the 
news in Quebec we saw stories of how this was terrible, that this 
particular decision, which was taken for logical financial reasons, 
was somehow anti-francophone, anti-Quebec. That is not the case.
<P>
	I encourage any member to go to the Royal Military College in 
Kingston and speak to francophones from Quebec. They will tell 
you the atmosphere is welcoming and is conducive to study and 
conducive to building a great nation with two official languages. 
That is the by-product of a very tough decision. You do not get that 
when you listen to the speeches of the hon. member. Somehow the 
closing of the Collège militaire royal was the only thing that 
happened in the defence budget that year. The fact is we announced 
close to $7 billion worth of actual and projected cuts including the 
cancellation of the EH-101.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	I want to talk for a few minutes about the acquisition program. 
We are well on target. We have announced the armoured personnel 
carriers. We have announced the search and rescue. We have not 
addressed the other two major procurements in the white paper, but 
those will be addressed one way or the other.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about submarines. How many times does 
a person have to repeat that the government has not made a 
decision on whether or not to buy the submarines? If we decide not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16585"> 16585 </A></B>
<P>
to, then we will announce  it. Then the hon. member will be happy 
but I am sure he will find something else to criticize. He is using 
this as something with which to whip the government and it is not 
based on fact.
<P>
	I say with great respect that this motion certainly does not reflect 
the actual situation in the country with respect to procurement, with 
respect to Canadian content and with respect to defence policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, no 
questions but a few comments.
<P>
	When the minister says there are contradictions in what we say, I 
am sorry, but I think that the problem here is with understanding 
and interpreting what was said. When I said earlier that there were 
extra costs for Canadian and Quebec taxpayers, this was when there 
were no infrastructures, as in the case of the Halifax shipyard for 
the frigates contract. When the infrastructures are there, I made it 
clear that it is possible, and I said that as well, to save money by 
going on the market.
<P>
	When the minister accuses us of bad faith or putting a spin on 
certain things, I think he is very good at that himself, because when 
I made the comparison with Chatham, where the military base was 
closed-in fact I read what the Premier of New Brunswick had to 
say about that-the minister compensated by ordering repair work 
to be done in Chatham. Because the base was closed, the order was 
given, in this case. In other cases, it was not.
<P>
	I also mentioned several times that the Liberal Party's red book 
referred to defence conversion, but neither the minister nor anyone 
else ever brought this up. When we talk about procurement and we 
say that Quebec is not getting its fair share, I do not see why, if the 
infrastructures are there, we should not get the same treatment as 
everybody else.
<P>
	Finally, yes, I did visit the Royal Military College in Kingston 
but the experience did not exasperate me, not at all. This is another 
wrongful interpretation by the minister. I thought it was a very 
beautiful location, except there may have been a conscious effort to 
sugar coat this bitter pill, but it is a nice place, and I did not come 
back exasperated, not at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Mr. Speaker, I forgot to say in my speech that in 
the point that raised by the hon. member, the reference was to 
Chatham, New Brunswick.
<P>
	We made the announcement that there would be some work done 
in Chatham, because closing that base was more difficult than 
anywhere else in Canada, but he again forgot to say, and it is only 
normal that he should forget, that in our announcement we also said 
that most of the armoured personnel carriers would be repaired,  
restored and overhauled in the National Defence workshops in East 
Montreal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In other words, he talks about the small benefit of 270 person 
years and about $50 million that is going to Chatham, New 
Brunswick. However he does not talk about the $400 million and 
all the jobs that are going to be preserved in the east end of 
Montreal. The people in the east end of Montreal knew what 
defence did. When the votes came in on referendum night we saw 
that the no vote was strong in the east end of Montreal, contrary to 
the predictions made by the hon. member's party.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	We have a good story to tell. I only hope that in the future the 
hon. member will admit to some of the great things we are doing in 
Quebec, such as continuing the very competent workshop in the 
east end of Montreal and the preservation of all those jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege to stand today on behalf 
of the people of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt and all 
Canadians in opposition to the Bloc motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the hon. member rising on a question 
or comment? We are still at the question or comment stage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> I am rising on debate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Are there further questions or comments? 
Resuming debate, the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, I find it strange that the 
hon. member for Charlesbourg just a few short weeks ago was 
soliciting members of the Canadian Armed Forces to join a new 
Quebec armed forces and today he is actually trying to appear to be 
concerned about the Canadian Armed Forces. It is quite frightening 
to see this type of motion. I urge the hon. member to seriously read 
section 62 of the Criminal Code and reflect on his actions of a few 
short weeks ago.
<P>
	I also take this opportunity to voice the outrage of Canadians 
over the mismanagement of the defence portfolio by the Liberal 
minister. Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition has its own provincial 
angle on this issue, one which is largely out of touch with that of 
the majority of Canadians, despite the Bloc's sacred title. The 
Reform Party, the de facto opposition party in the House, opposes 
the motion put forward today by the Bloc Quebecois because 
grassroots Canadians want value for their tax dollars.
<P>
	Canadians have told us that Canada desperately needs to replace 
its aging military equipment with new equipment which can meet a 
certain set of performance criteria. We need to buy this equipment 
off the shelf so that we can purchase the best equipment with our  
taxpayers' dollars. I support and I am determined to fight for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16586"> 16586 </A></B>
<P>
removal of all measures which are designed to insulate industries 
from competition.
<P>
	Canada is over $550 billion in debt. Much of our equipment is 
older than the military personnel using it. We can no longer play 
the regional development game when our armed forces need new 
equipment within the current environment of fiscal restraint.
<P>
	This does not preclude Canadian companies in the Canadian 
province of Quebec from bidding on military procurement. I am 
confident that Quebec's military and aerospace industry, like the 
military and aerospace industry in other provinces, is up to the task 
of competition with other national and international firms. An off 
the shelf policy is certainly less threatening to Quebec industry 
than the Bloc's attempts to separate from Canada. That would do 
more harm to the military and aerospace industry in Quebec than 
any government policy to seek the best price for military hardware.
<P>
	The motion is almost amusing in light of last month's 
referendum.
<P>
	Can Canadian industry compete with the best in the world? I 
must answer with a resounding yes. There are dozens of military 
products and industries which are world class and have succeeded 
or can succeed in the international marketplace.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois wants to reprimand the government for 
having dropped the Canadian content requirements in contracts for 
the purchase of military equipment. That is ridiculous. Canadians 
know that buying military hardware off the shelf is the only 
practical way for military procurement in Canada.
<P>
	Procurement is central to the operations of any military service. 
In the modern era when weapons systems are so complex and 
design and delivery stages can extend over a decade, successive 
Canadian governments have too often overspecified Canadian 
forces requirements. Successive Canadian governments have also 
used the military as a tool for industrial benefits and for the pursuit 
of regional economic development. The result has been costly to 
Canadian taxpayers and the armed forces.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	These factors are responsible for the gigantic bureaucracy for the 
management and control of military procurement. The costliness of 
an all Canadian design that has not faced international competition 
has resulted in our armed forces using outdated equipment. Too 
many resources were being spent on one megaproject while the 
modernization and upkeep of existing equipment was put on the 
back burner.
<P>
	In other words, whenever possible the armed forces must 
purchase the most cost effective and capable military platforms, 
such as helicopters, armoured  personnel carriers or submarines. If 
no Canadian defence industry can produce the entire platform at a 
competitive price, then so be it. There will still be room for 
Canadian industry in the development and manufacture of 
subsystems and in the long term, maintenance of the platform.
<P>
	In addition to acquiring military platforms for the armed forces 
in a timely manner, the savings to taxpayers would be enormous. 
The whole procurement process would be simplified. The role of 
government agencies would be eliminated and significant costs 
associated with seeking regional benefits would disappear. The end 
result would be a better equipped armed forces for the money.
<P>
	In some instances, Canadian industry will be able to compete 
and acquire a licence to manufacture an existing platform in 
Canada. I am sure Canadian industries will be highly successful in 
competing globally for manufacturing rights to existing products. 
When this occurs, the armed forces and the taxpayers are again the 
winners. The procurement process will be streamlined. Jobs will be 
created. Spending will remain in Canada and other Canadian firms 
will get the opportunity to compete for subcontracts.
<P>
	My fear is that the Bloc Quebecois motion is actually redundant. 
I am not confident this government is going to follow through and 
implement a true off the shelf policy. Let us look at the 
government's procurement track record so far.
<P>
	In 1994 the Minister of National Defence tabled his white paper 
on defence, the first comprehensive look at Canada's defence 
policy since 1987. In it the minister pays some lip service to the off 
the shelf concept. The white paper states under the heading of 
procurement: ``The Department of National Defence will adopt 
better business practices. Greater reliances will, for example, be 
placed on just in time delivery of common usage items to reduce 
inventory costs. The department will increase the procurement of 
off the shelf commercial technology which meets essential military 
specifications and standards''.
<P>
	While this is hardly a ringing endorsement of an off the shelf, 
taxpayer friendly way to military procurement, it is a start. Maybe 
this government's actions are stronger than its words. Let us look at 
some of the specific purchases by the Minister of National Defence 
since 1993 and see if he shows some concern for Canadian 
taxpayers and Canadian military personnel and determine if he has 
grasped the off the shelf concept.
<P>
	One of the latest procurement contracts I am aware of is the 
minister's $2,000 gold plated pen contract with an Ottawa firm. If 
the minister had a concern for his troops and Canadian taxpayers, 
he would have shopped around for a bargain. He would have gone 
to Grand and Toy and Office Depot, to name two major pen 
suppliers, which have commercially available pens that could be 
purchased off the shelf. But no, the minister had a  number of 
specifications. They had to be quill pens with gold engraved 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16587"> 16587 </A></B>
<P>
lettering and supplied in a crushed velvet pouch. So much for the 
minister and his lip service to off the shelf.
<P>
	Wait. Maybe that purchase was just a fluke. Maybe the 
minister's track record improves when we examine something that 
is not for his personal use. Let us examine the government's track 
record vis-à-vis one of the major equipment purchases this 
government faces. Let us look at this government's handling of the 
replacement of search and rescue shipborne helicopters.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	This sorry tale begins in the dying days of the previous Tory 
government. Prior to the 1993 election the Conservative 
government had set in motion the purchase of the EH-101 
replacement helicopter. By the fall of 1993 hundreds of millions of 
dollars had been spent on research and development.
<P>
	The hefty cost of the EH-101 which totalled $4.4 billion 
including training personnel, spare parts, training manuals and 
training programs prompted the Liberal Party to make a campaign 
promise to scrap the purchase. This campaign ploy is proving to be 
costly to taxpayers and a minefield for the Minister of National 
Defence who has to replace our current deficient fleet while 
showing the taxpayers that the Liberal government has saved them 
money.
<P>
	The fallout from this campaign promise has been great. Our 
military personnel were told they would have to spend more time 
flying obsolete and increasingly dangerous helicopters. Our ability 
to enhance our defences and to get the most out of our new frigates 
has been deferred. Taxpayers have been forced to waste up to some 
$600 million on cancellation fees, but all the costs are not in yet. 
Some experts are saying that the total could cost Canadian 
taxpayers up to $1 billion at the end of the day.
<P>
	Sadly the Liberal cabinet is playing politics again. The defence 
minister has publicly committed himself to purchasing new 
helicopters and finally announced last week that he would purchase 
15 new search and rescue helicopters. He boldly proclaimed that 
they would be purchased off the shelf for just $600 million. Six 
hundred million dollars to $1 billion is the amount the Liberal 
government has forced Canadian taxpayers to spend on helicopters 
since the election of 1993. But where are the helicopters? The $600 
million figure like our aging Labradors and Sea King helicopters 
does not fly.
<P>
	To purchase the 15 helicopters Canadian taxpayers are really 
being asked to spend $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion when the EH-101 
cancellation costs are factored in. That equals about $80 million to 
$100 million each. That is probably more than the average cost of 
each EH-101 helicopter.
<P>
	The only reason the minister is forced to commit himself to an 
off the shelf purchase of helicopters is the political game of 
football the government has been playing with helicopters. The 
EH-101 cost included spare parts, pilot training, manuals and other 
incidentals. The defence minister left these costs out of his 
assessment, making his new search and rescue variant more costly 
to taxpayers.
<P>
	There is more too. The minister has lowered the operational 
specifications for the helicopter by 15 per cent. The EH-101 was 
not an overspecified helicopter. The EH-101 had a set of 
specifications to meet Canada's expansive geography and our 
severe weather conditions. Specifications include a range of 550 
miles; a speed of 160 knots; a hover capability for a 7,500-foot 
altitude; a capacity to rescue and carry nine people; a day, all night 
and all weather capability including severe icing conditions; and 
the capability of making a safe recovery following the loss of one 
engine.
<P>
	The Liberals had wasted so much money calculating the EH-101 
deal they could not afford to purchase an off the shelf helicopter 
that could meet Canada's unique needs.
<P>
	The announcement that the operational requirements for our 
search and rescue helicopters is being reduced calls into question 
the Liberal government's commitment to Canada's search and 
rescue. What are we telling our fishers and their crew off the west 
coast of Vancouver Island in an emergency situation? The 
government is sending them a strong message, scribbled with a 
pricey quill pen that says: ``We may not be able to assist you. The 
weather is too bad and you are out of range. Good luck''.
<P>
	As for the shipborne helicopters, the cabinet and the defence 
minister are still wrangling over the difficulty in deciding how to 
tell the public that they need to spend billions of dollars on a 
project they cancelled as a campaign promise.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	I expect to see the same result with the shipborne helicopters as 
with the search and rescue variety. Canadians will get at best an 
inferior helicopter in less numbers for the same price as the 
EH-101.
<P>
	Who are the losers? First Canadian taxpayers and second our 
military personnel. The Minister of National Defence has an 
approved defence budget and an approved white paper which 
apparently account for the purchase of new shipborne helicopters. 
Yet the minister is unable to get cabinet approval to make this 
important decision. Why? Media reports speculate on the worst. 
They believe cabinet is fighting over the division of regional 
benefits.
<P>
	In August the <I>Financial Post</I> claimed a Parliament Hill lobbyist 
had said that the Minister of Human Resources Development and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16588"> 16588 </A></B>
<P>
the Minister of Transport were  pressing the Minister of National 
Defence for investment in their regions.
<P>
	When looking at other major procurement items on the 
government's agenda it becomes apparent the minister was forced 
into an off the shelf promise on helicopters because of the fiscal 
mess the government has put itself in over the EH-101 
cancellation.
<P>
	The recent press conference the minister held to announce his 
plans for search and rescue helicopters was a non-event, to say the 
least. The minister only announced his intent to accept bids, 
something most of us thought had occurred long ago. Normally the 
minister would announce the items to be procured, the cost to the 
taxpayers and the industry involved.
<P>
	This is exactly what happened in August when the minister 
announced his intent to purchase 240 new armoured personnel 
carriers in addition to a program for refurbishing about 1,200 of our 
existing M-113s, Grizzlies and Bisons. In this example the minister 
threw the concept of off the shelf to the wind. It was lucky for him 
that he had no APC cancellation contracts to contend with. In this 
case the minister knew exactly which companies would be awarded 
the contract. General Motors of London, Ontario was awarded the 
contract to produce 240 new APCs for $800 million, with the 
government keeping the door open to ordering another 411 at a 
future date for a cost of just over $2 billion.
<P>
	To determine whether this contract was value for money, I 
submitted an access to information request in August asking for 
documents showing the minister and his senior officials at DND 
shopped around and bought the best APC for the money. The 
information act states that the department must respond to requests 
within 30 days of receiving them. It is now the end of November. I 
have heard nothing from the Department of National Defence and I 
expect the worst. I imagine the department is stonewalling because 
it knows this is not an off the shelf purchase.
<P>
	I bet those documents are sitting on the bottom of the in basket 
of the deputy minister of defence as we speak. I also bet the next set 
of defence estimates this spring will have a column under the APC 
project entitled regional benefits.
<P>
	While the verdict on the new APCs is not in yet, it is clear the 
APC refurbishing contract awarded to Montreal's 202 workshop is 
an exercise in regional pork barrelling. This was the price of 
cabinet approval for the purchase and represents old style politics 
at its worst.
<P>
	The latest major purchase the minister has made known is the 
option to purchase surplus British Upholder class submarines to 
replace our aged Oberon class subs. The asking price of $800 
million dollars for four Upholders, training vessels, spare parts and 
documentation is a bargain. I suspect cabinet will not  allow the 
minister to announce this purchase because there is no pie to be 
divided among the regions.
<P>
	To conclude, the motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois is 
the exact opposite to what Canada must do to get its fiscal house in 
order. This is not surprising. What is surprising is that the 
government has not embraced the off the shelf concept as a means 
by which Canada can upgrade its aging and increasingly dangerous 
military equipment.
<P>
	If Canada is to maintain its modest military and continue to play 
an effective role in our nation's defences and international affairs, 
it must change and it must change quickly. As the Reform Party 
defence critic I will be watching every aspect of DND's purchases, 
from pens to submarines. I will ensure that taxpayers and our 
dedicated military personnel are getting the most for their money.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on the 
subject before us this morning.
<P>
	The political rhetoric I have heard from the two speakers in the 
main opposition and the third parties somewhat disappointed me. 
The tenor of the debate this morning was not the tenor present in 
the standing special committee of the Senate and the House of 
Commons in which there was a modicum of consensus. This did 
not seem to come out on the floor of the House of Commons today. 
Notwithstanding I should like to get rid of the political rhetoric and 
talk about some of the reasons my party and I will not be in support 
of the motion.
<P>
	Essentially the procurement policies of national defence have 
been developed over a period of time which has seen a lot of grief 
with respect to procurement policies. Perhaps at the time they were 
appropriate to the occasion but now, because of the paring down, 
the lack of resources, the difficulties with funding, the end of the 
cold war and the difficulties in planning defence procurement, we 
have to do it differently.
<P>
	I believe I can quote the auditor general in his 1993 report as 
being objective in his major study of defence procurement policies.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I apologize to the hon. parliamentary 
secretary. It is an opposition day and a Bloc motion. The Chair is in 
the habit of going back and forth and made a mistake. It is not in 
fact the turn of the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	The hon. member has returned to his chair and with permission I 
ask that the hon. member for Shefford speak in proper order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Certainly, as 
we say south of the border, I will concede but I was hoping to ask 
some questions to the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16589"> 16589 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to reverse the 
speaking order so that the hon. member can put his question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rose to ask the member a question, but since Your 
Honour recognized me on debate I thought I would commence my 
debate.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned a couple of things I want to clarify, 
but first I want to make a comment. I was a bit concerned about 
some of the statements made by the hon. member for Charlesbourg, 
some of which were raised by the Minister of National Defence, 
when he suggested the only province that suffered defence 
cutbacks was the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I will say in a different manner and perhaps with a different 
emphasis that I belong to the maritime provinces where the 
economy is in very rough shape, particularly in Newfoundland. It 
hurt me as parliamentary secretary to see my colleagues who 
occupy 31 of the 32 seats in those four provinces being hit with a 
tremendous blow because the necessary reductions in defence were 
done objectively.
<P>
	I refer to the closing of Canadian forces bases Chatham, 
Cornwallis, Shelburne and the reduction in CFB Shearwater. These 
were major economic blows to the Atlantic region. I do not think 
we have heard any of those four members cry wolf. Despite the 
hardship it has caused politically and otherwise, they have accepted 
that it is part of government reduction. It would have been graceful 
if other members had done the same thing.
<P>
	With respect to my question to my hon. colleague in the third 
party, he talked about the procurement policies and how they have 
developed. He used a bit of politics, which I suppose is his duty as 
the defence critic and which I accept in good spirit. I wonder if he 
has read the 1993 report of the auditor general. Does he recall some 
of the discussions we had in the special committee on national 
defence with respect to some of the difficulties that the old 
procurement policies had? The policies took a long time and 
emphasized the wrong things. By the time the equipment was 
developed, it was out of sync.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I also want to make another comment and ask him to respond to 
it. He said that the EH-101 was not an over designed helicopter. I 
wonder if he realizes that the EH-101 specifications and capability 
efficiencies were developed at the height of the cold war. By the 
time the hardware was developed, it responded to a threat that no 
longer existed.
<P>
	I wonder if he has taken that into consideration when he says the 
EH-101 was the best helicopter for the day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are saying that the procurement 
policies of governments in the past were not adequate. They were 
not fair to Canadian taxpayers. They were not fair to the people 
who pay the bills.
<P>
	Under the old system, it could be 15 or 16 years from the time a 
decision was made to purchase a piece of equipment until it is 
actually delivered. The frigate program is a good example of that.
<P>
	I was in the navy in 1973. It was about 1975 that the planners of 
the frigate program started to come around to the ships to talk to the 
sailors and to the people in the military about the purchase of new 
frigates. As members know, we have just recently taken delivery of 
the very frigates that were in the planning stages in the mid-1970s.
<P>
	Our procurement process over the years has not been a good one. 
It has not been value added for the Canadian taxpayer. It has left the 
military personnel who are challenged with these very heavy 
commitments that the government places on them with aging 
equipment, as we see with the Labrador and Sea King helicopters. 
They are literally falling out of the sky while we wait for an 
announcement on helicopters.
<P>
	The helicopters were a big campaign promise. Many would 
argue that the cancellation of the EH-101 helicopter was probably 
what won the Liberal government victory in the last election 
campaign.
<P>
	What is happening now? The Canadian taxpayers are paying the 
cost for cancelling the EH-101. I am not overwhelmingly endorsing 
the EH-101 project but I am not going to say that we should have 
ruled it out and used it as a political football, which is what the 
Liberal Party did during the election campaign.
<P>
	It did not come down to whether the specifications were right. 
We did not talk about that in the election campaign. We did not talk 
about whether it was value for the Canadian taxpayers. The 
Liberals did not talk about that. They just said that they were going 
to cancel it regardless of the requirement for it, the specifications 
for it, the terrain that we have to live with in Canada, one of the 
largest countries in the world. It has excessive weather.
<P>
	They did not talk about that. They made it a campaign promise to 
cancel the contract. The figures run about $600 million right now 
for the cancellation of the EH-101 helicopters. Now the taxpayers 
know that those figures could reach $1 billion.
<P>
	The member shakes his head and says no, it will not reach $1 
billion. Why, since I have had access to information on this very 
subject since the summer, has this government that claims to be 
open, responsive and interested in letting Canadians know all the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16590"> 16590 </A></B>
<P>
information  not been forthright about the actual costs of 
cancellation? It has not done that.
<P>
	These members have not been forthright. If I can use the 
members own words, the government is being opaque on this issue, 
very much so.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	This issue with the helicopters is so much like this Liberal 
government. After spending $600 million in cancellation fees so 
far, after the minister announces that the government is going to 
spend $600 million on a new search and rescue helicopter with a 
decreased capability of 15 per cent, we still do not have helicopters 
today. That is $1.2 billion right there. The costs are not in yet and 
Canadians do not have one helicopter to show for it.
<P>
	This is hypocrisy. The government is going to have to get down 
to real terms. It is going to have to go to the Canadian people and 
tell them exactly what the requirements are for the search and 
rescue helicopter. You cannot even get that information from the 
minister and the department.
<P>
	The government is supposed to be open, consulting with the 
people. Why does it keep secret the information on this 
procurement? It is not right. I will do everything in my power to 
fight this and make sure that the government is held to the fire on 
this one until a purchase is made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to that I would have to tell 
the hon. member I do not know from where he is getting his 
figures. I am disappointed he would use this kind of rhetoric to 
suggest that these things are happening when in fact they are not.
<P>
	I have another point I wish to make which I believe he 
understands but may have miscued. He says the helicopters are 
falling out of the sky. That is not true. Those helicopters are safe to 
fly until the year 2000. He knows as well as I that the Canadian 
forces will not permit their pilots to fly helicopters that are unsafe. 
I want to clarify the record on that. He is looking over at me and 
nodding, with a smile on his face. I know he is playing politics 
again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. member's 
question, on my recent visit to Shearwater, while I was being told 
that the Sea King helicopters were in the best condition they have 
ever been in 30 years, cranes were lifting them off the flight decks 
of the frigates.
<P>
	Canadians might recall the words of a Canadian pilot who was a 
trainer in Sea King helicopters. He was quoted in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>: ``You only fly a Sea King as far as you want to fall''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming the debate, with my apologies 
to the member for Shefford.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
speak about the equity, or inequity if you prefer, of which Quebec is 
a victim with respect to military procurement.
<P>
	The recent government decisions to purchase new armoured 
personnel carriers and 15 search and rescue helicopters are far from 
reassuring to Quebec. It is now a well known fact that Quebec is far 
from receiving its fair share of federal defence spending, and this 
has been the case for some years.
<P>
	All indications are that this inequality will increase rather than 
decrease. In fact, the new National Defence procurement policy is 
likely to affect Quebec even more than before.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Charlesbourg, clearly 
demonstrated this morning just how much Quebec is a victim of the 
federal government's double standard.
<P>
	I would like to add my voice to his in severely criticizing the 
government for dropping any requirement for Canadian content 
from its most recent military procurement policy. What is even 
worse is that it refuses to put into place any true program for 
defence conversion. It is very easy to imagine what the 
consequences will be.
<P>
	The consequences are that this new government policy will 
directly endanger the entire aerospace industry. We all know that 
this industry is mostly concentrated in Montreal, Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	My Bloc colleagues will have the opportunity later today to 
address more specifically the important issue of defence 
conversion.
<P>
	I, for one, want to underline the negative impact the federal 
government's new policy will have on Quebec. I should, however, 
start by reminding you that Quebec has been cheated out of a 
minimum $650 million a year on average in the distribution of 
federal defence spending in the last 15 years at least, and I will not 
go any further because it could be worse.
<P>
	This does not come from me but from the defence department's 
own statements and figures. In concrete terms, it means that, in the 
last 15 years, Quebec has received only 17.9 per cent of all defence 
spending, including 13 per cent of infrastructure costs and 15 per 
cent of personnel expenditures.
<P>
	I should also remind you of the conclusion reached by a defence 
department official, Charles Trottier, in a study he released last 
February. In the last 15 years, Quebec has received 27 per cent less 
than its fair share of defence spending. Mr. Trottier compared this 
loss to the James Bay project or $10 billion over 15 years. This 
represents a $10 billion shortfall for Quebec. In terms of jobs, this 
represents a loss to Quebec of 15,000 direct jobs and  25,000 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16591"> 16591 </A></B>
<P>
indirect jobs per year on average: nothing less than 40,000 direct 
and indirect jobs.
<P>
	In fact, if distribution had been fair, Quebec should have twice as 
many defence facilities as it now has. Twice as many. Such 
injustices to Quebec are systemic within the armed forces. This 
demonstration clearly shows that the federal system is 
fundamentally flawed, as I will try to explain to you.
<P>
	Even the minister of defence confirmed that Quebec has been 
treated unfairly. When he appeared on Radio-Canada's <I>Enjeux</I> last 
April, the minister said about Quebec that they could not afford the 
luxury of being totally fair.
<P>
	I myself asked the minister how he could have the gall to 
consider fairness a luxury. ``Fair''-that is all we ask-to Quebec. 
Guess what he replied to me? In complete contradiction with his 
own remarks and suggesting that Quebec was favoured by capital 
expenditures, which is not true, he said, and I quote: ``The province 
of Quebec generally leads the country in its share of defence capital 
acquisition expenditures and probably will continue to do so in the 
future when the new defence acquisitions are announced.''
<P>
	Let us talk about these new defence acquisitions that Quebec is 
allegedly getting its fair share of. Let us look at this. What are the 
facts? We know that the government has taken a piecemeal 
approach to announcing such acquisitions so that the pill will not 
be too bitter for the taxpayers.
<P>
	Let us start with the new armoured vehicles. What is Quebec's 
share of this huge contract worth more than $2 billion? Try as we 
may to find it, Quebec's fair share is nowhere to be found. Why? 
Because it just does not exist.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that the federal government awarded 
this contract, directly and without a tender call, to the GM plant in 
London, Ontario. Quebec companies were not even invited to 
tender for this contract.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Worse yet, they are not even guaranteed a chance of putting a bid 
with GM Ontario for subcontracts. But everyone is well aware of 
the fact that Oerlikon of Saint-Jean, in the riding next to mine, in 
Quebec, has all the expertise required to carry out at the very least 
the turret part of the contract.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Jean, will certainly 
have an opportunity sometime today to get into this issue of 
Oerlikon. In spite of the official opposition's pressing plea, this 
government, the Liberal government absolutely refused to require 
GM Ontario to go to tender for its subcontracts.
<P>
	As a result, Ontario is the only province benefiting from this 
great $2 billion contract. Two billion dollars is a lot of money. All 
that for Ontario, a province which has a very strong majority in the 
Liberal caucus. So, when  the minister says that Quebec will 
benefit from the new defence procurement, we can only conclude 
that it will certainly not be through the armoured vehicles contract.
<P>
	But let us give the minister another chance. Let us take a look at 
the procurement contract for the 15 new search and rescue 
helicopters. Perhaps we will find that Quebec gets its fair share in 
that deal. After all, it would only make sense, since Quebec was the 
big loser following the cancellation of the previous contract to buy 
the EH-101 helicopters. We are not talking about a $2 billion 
contract like the one awarded to Ontario for the armoured vehicles, 
without any call for tenders, but it is nevertheless a deal worth $600 
million. And $600 million is not peanuts.
<P>
	Let us ask ourselves this question: Will Quebec, as the defence 
minister claims, get its fair share of that second military 
procurement contract? Again, anyone could foresee the answer to 
that. Quebec has no guarantee whatsoever that this will be the case. 
Why? Because the government suddenly changed its military 
procurement policy.
<P>
	This is a strange coincidence, is it not? While the aerospace 
industry is primarily located in Quebec, the government suddenly 
decides to call for tenders, contrary to what it did in the case of the 
armoured vehicles contract, which was awarded to Ontario without 
any call for tenders.
<P>
	This is ironic, especially considering that Quebec was the 
province most affected by the cancellation of the EH-101 
helicopter contract. By the way, that was a $4.8 billion contract.
<P>
	If I raised that issue, I would probably be told that we should not 
oppose the government's decision to call for tenders, since it is in 
the best interests of taxpayers, whose fiscal burden is already heavy 
enough, and we certainly agree with that. Our public finances are 
indeed in bad shape. The state itself is in bad shape. And that is not 
our fault.
<P>
	The Liberals were going to do marvellous things. What 
marvellous things? I can use either an exclamation mark or a 
question mark. In all sincerity, I will tell you that it is surely the 
case. But then why did the government use a different approach in 
the case of the armoured vehicles contract? Why did the Liberal 
government not apply the same policy in the two cases? We are still 
waiting for an answer.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	And why does the government refuse to require that GM Ontario 
allow Quebec businesses to bid on those subcontracts? Again, we 
are still waiting for answers that are not coming.
<P>
	Wise observers might point out ironically that what it good for 
Ontario is bad for Quebec or for the rest of Canada. The problem is 
that the minister lacks the  courage to say so publicly. We realize 
that he comes from Ontario; that is obvious. In any case, if we take 
for granted that calling for tenders is okay where Quebec is 
concerned but that the same rule does not seem to apply to Ontario, 
one question remains relevant. This question is why, in the case of 
the search and rescue helicopter contract, the government has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16592"> 16592 </A></B>
<P>
suddenly dropped all Canadian content requirements. This is rather 
peculiar, especially since it could have disastrous consequences not 
only for Quebec businesses but also for Canadian businesses.
<P>
	Professor Yves Bélanger, who is also director of the University 
of Quebec in Montreal's research group on the defence industry, 
was quoted in yesterday's <I>Le Devoir</I> as saying that, by dropping the 
Canadian content requirement, the Liberals have taken away from 
Canadian businesses the best argument they had to force 
multinationals to negotiate partnerships with them. We are now 
familiar with the word ``partnership'', which came up repeatedly 
during the referendum campaign. Partnerships are the future.
<P>
	The spokesperson for the Aerospace Industries Association of 
Canada also agrees. Let me read you what he said in relation to the 
government's new procurement policy. He is what he said about it: 
``If you push it to the extreme, all Canadian development programs 
would disappear, making it extremely difficult to maintain our 
defence industry.'' Thanks to whom? To the Liberal government.
<P>
	These concerns are especially justified, since, according to 
analysts, none of the manufacturers competing for this contract are 
from Quebec or Canada. Apparently, there are two American 
companies: Boeing and Sikorsky, and three European companies: 
Eurocopter, Agusta-Westland and the Russian manufacturer 
Kamov.
<P>
	In the case of Agusta, there is cause for concern because serious 
accusations of corruption have been made against this company in 
Europe. But not only does the government refuse to investigate the 
circumstances of the EH-101 contract award, as requested by the 
now Minister of Human Resources Development when he was in 
opposition-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is different.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> It would indeed seem that, here, in 
Canada, it is quite a different story, depending on which side of the 
House you are sitting.
<P>
	Also, one can wonder whether or not the government is getting 
ready to offer a ``sweet deal'' to this company.
<P>
	At any rate, let us come back to the remarks made by the defence 
minister on Radio-Canada's program <I>Enjeux</I> in April. As I said 
earlier, the minister had stated on that occasion that Quebec was 
receiving its fair share of defence procurement. He said so. Now, if 
Quebec, and Oerlikon of Saint-Jean in particular, is literally 
excluded  from the $2 billion APC acquisition contract, which was 
awarded to Ontario, and if Quebec is not guaranteed any benefits 
arising from the $600 million search and rescue helicopter 
contract, what does this leave as Quebec's fair share?
<P>
	That is hard to predict, since the federal government is 
announcing its defence acquisitions in a piecemeal fashion, one 
slice of baloney at a time, in the hope, of course, that taxpayers will 
find the pill easier to swallow.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	That way the bill does not seem as steep, but if you add 
everything the result is the same. However, according to the most 
recent statements made by the defence minister regarding that 
issue, we can presume that the government is about to buy, at a cost 
of more than half a billion dollars plus several other considerations, 
four used submarines that England is no longer interested in. That 
country wants to get rid of these submarines and we are going to 
buy them.
<P>
	We will buy four old submarines which are no longer in use. This 
is what we will get. We will then be better protected. What do you 
think Quebec could get out of such a deal? As I just said, there is 
every indication that these are British submarines. Quebec will 
obviously not get anything out of that deal. But it will have to pay 
its share, its 25 per cent. Quebec always gets 13, 14 or 15 per cent 
of everything, but it pays 25 per cent. This is unacceptable.
<P>
	The government's new policy no longer requires any Canadian 
content, unless of course it applies to a procurement contract which 
can help Ontario increase its large share of federal defence 
spending. This creates a double standard. There is one policy for 
Ontario and one for the rest of Canada. I can only conclude that 
Quebec which, as we all know, is far from receiving its fair share of 
federal military spending, will continue to be greatly and unfairly 
penalized by this government.
<P>
	It is no wonder that more and more Quebecers feel that the only 
alternative is, to be sure, a sovereign Quebec. Quebec's sovereignty 
will soon become a reality and, when that happens, Quebecers will 
turn their backs on these injustices, which cost them dearly.
<P>
	In conclusion, I have no choice but to blame the federal 
government strongly for giving up the Canadian content 
requirements in military procurement contracts. These 
requirements were among the last guarantees that, some day, 
Quebec might get its fair share-no more and no less-like the 
others in Canada, that it might be recognized as a province, and that 
it might get what it is entitled to.
<P>
	Therefore, I join with our defence critic, the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg, in blaming the government for its current action.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the 
member's remarks today. He has been very selective in his speech 
and has forgotten some very important historical realities.
<P>
	I would like to go back to the period of 1979 to 1981, when the 
Government of Canada, under the leadership of the Right Hon. 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, basically put the foundation in place for the 
Quebec aerospace industry. The member conveniently did not 
touch on that period of time; he conveniently overlooked it. This 
tends to be the basic strategy of the Bloc Quebecois members. They 
forget the foundation upon which an important industry like the 
aerospace industry was brought to Quebec.
<P>
	I remind the member of the government's decision in 1980 when 
the Government of Canada purchased the F-18A. Almost 80 per 
cent of the offsets that were part of that contract went to the 
province of Quebec. In no way, shape or form do I begrudge that 
because I am a Toronto member, an Ontario member. We 
celebrated that great purchase under the leadership of Pierre 
Trudeau.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	I also remind the member that it was under the leadership of the 
present Prime Minister that the decision was taken to get involved 
with the Canadair Challenger jet. Canadian taxpayers, not Quebec 
taxpayers, invested almost $1 billion into research and 
development to lay the foundation that led not only to the Canadair 
executive jet but also to the Canadair commuter jet, which is now 
being manufactured in the province of Quebec not just through 
Canadair-Bombardier but also through various aerospace 
manufacturers.
<P>
	I will give a third example. There was a contract given to 
maintain the F-18As, I believe about four years ago. The actual 
price submitted by Bristol Aerospace in the province of Manitoba 
was cheaper than the contract price in Quebec. The government of 
the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney made sure under his leadership that 
the maintenance contract for the F-18As, our fighter jet, went to the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
	I do not want to suggest that as a Toronto member I resent any of 
those contracts going to those manufacturers in the aerospace 
industry in Quebec.
<P>
	When we talk about what is Quebec's fair share, I can point to a 
specific example where a Liberal government under the leadership 
of Pierre Trudeau laid the basic foundation for the aerospace 
industry, which I recognize is an industry leader in the world.
<P>
	We have to deal with something that happened during the regime 
of the last government: the free trade agreement. I campaigned 
vigorously against the free trade  agreement. I campaigned against 
it for many reasons. One reason was chapter 14 of the free trade 
agreement, where essentially there was unfettered foreign access to 
our markets, whether it was for procurement, manufacturing, or 
investment opportunities. We essentially gave up a big part of our 
sovereignty under that chapter.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc voted for, supported and campaigned for 
the free trade agreement. We must remember that one article in the 
free trade agreement prohibits us as a nation from dictating 
Canadian content. So when the member from the Bloc in his speech 
today talked about the government not dictating Canadian content, 
the member must realize that his leader campaigned against 
dictating Canadian content when he supported the free trade 
agreement. You cannot suck and blow at the same time. The 
member from the Bloc Quebecois I know is fighting for his people, 
and I respect that. But we must deal with the truth. The truth of the 
matter is that we cannot dictate Canadian content.
<P>
	I believe in the Quebec aerospace industry. When Pierre 
Trudeau, a great Liberal Prime Minister, laid the foundation to put 
that industry primarily in the province of Quebec, I believe he 
made the right decision, not just on behalf of Quebecers but on 
behalf of all of Canada. The member from the Bloc Quebecois is 
forgetting a very important factor in any business equation. I want 
to get to the point about procurement. I have confidence in the 
Quebec aerospace industry in the sense that it does have the 
capacity to produce a quality product at a better price.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	If we were to promote and support the quality product and 
competitive price that Quebec aerospace industry operators 
provide, we could overcome this insecurity the Bloc Quebecois 
member has about his own industry. Any businessman, if the 
product is quality and the price is right, will always get the 
business. Therefore we should not give up on the aerospace 
industry not having the ability to produce a quality product or 
service at a quality price. Rather than throw in the towel and give 
up on the industry, let us rally around it.
<P>
	I do not believe the member from the Bloc Quebecois has that 
confidence. Essentially what he is saying today is that we should be 
dictating that automatically these firms should get the business.
<P>
	Before the free trade agreement I liked the situation in which we 
tended to be a little more protectionist. I fought for a more 
protectionist role. The member's current leader said we do not need 
that kind of protection. We should be consistent when we are 
having this debate. If the member would not be so selective and 
instead would look at all the things in a total equation, I believe he 
would see that the people of Canada and the Government of Canada 
have done their absolute best to be fair to Quebec.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it seems fairly 
obvious that the hon. member considers former Prime Minister 
Pierre Trudeau his guru, since he has referred to him four times 
within one short presentation.
<P>
	What we in Quebec are demanding, and I use the word 
``demand'' advisedly, is to have equity, to see Quebec treated 
equitably, to see Quebec receive what it is entitled to. It is true that 
by around the end of the Seventies, an aerospace system was in 
place in Quebec, and now the government across the way cannot be 
allowed to make use of legislation to kill it off bit by bit. This 
government must not be allowed to use dubious laws, unwanted 
laws, to cause Quebec's aerospace industry to disappear. I feel that 
this is important, and those in the industry say the same. It is one 
thing to establish an aerospace industry, but quite another thing to 
destroy one, and that is what is being done now with the legislation 
being passed and the way Canadian and Quebec companies are 
being treated.
<P>
	Personally, I have no problem at all with insecurity, despite what 
the hon. member said about my seeming to be insecure. What I 
want is to see Quebec treated equitably, fairly, more fairly than at 
present. I think it is important-and there is no question of 
insecurity in working on behalf of one's constituents, the people of 
Quebec who elected us to this House-and I think it is important to 
say so.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the hon. member took seven minutes to ask his 
question, and it seems to me I ought to be able to respond to it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> You may respond within 
the allocated ten minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford): </B>Madam Speaker, perhaps then he ought 
to have taken a little less time, so that I could have as long as he. 
But I respect your decision.
<P>
	I merely wanted to say, in closing, that without the members 
present here in the House when the Conservatives passed the Free 
Trade Agreement-we know that the Liberals were opposed, 
Ontario was opposed. Why? Because Ontario has always been 
Number One. So, without the Quebec members-this is proof that 
Quebecers have a world view. We are open to the rest of the world, 
and we want to be able to negotiate, to trade with everyone.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, before I begin this debate I want to thank my hon. 
colleague from Broadview-Greenwood for his usual intelligent, 
logical, non-political intervention in this debate, which I think is 
slowly starting to rise in its level of intelligence. He has introduced 
some sense and some logic and some good debatable points into 
this debate. Because I have such  respect for the points he has 
made, I am not going to reinforce them in my presentation.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	I want to start with the motion to provide a backdrop for my 
debate this morning:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House condemn the government for having dropped the Canadian 
content requirements in the contracts for the purchase of military equipment 
and refusing to set up a genuine program for the conversion of the military 
industry, thus endangering the Canadian aerospace industry located in 
Montreal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Coming from Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, I would expect 
that it would take into consideration not just the aerospace industry 
in Montreal but the aerospace industry in Canada, and indeed all 
the military industry in Canada. You cannot talk about the military 
industry and relate it to one province. We just do not do business 
that way in our country. The hon. members know that as well.
<P>
	I will give a personal experience, which will provide the thread 
for my thesis. My thesis essentially is that we can no longer 
continue to do business the way we have been doing it. The climate 
is not the same. The military climate is not the same and the fiscal 
climate is not the same. We have changed, and we have changed for 
a reason. If the hon. members opposite would follow the logic of 
my presentation, I give them forewarning that this is the general 
pattern.
<P>
	In my previous incarnation I had the fortune, or some would say 
misfortune, to serve at Department of National Defence 
headquarters. For an operational officer in any branch of the armed 
forces, this is not considered the highlight of one's career. One 
likes to be out in the field driving ships, tanks, airplanes, or 
whatever the case may be.
<P>
	My first tour, which was rather traumatic, came in 1967, my first 
time in Department of National Defence headquarters, or Canadian 
forces headquarters, as it was then called. One of the first projects I 
became involved in was a replacement ship for the 20 St. Laurent 
class destroyers that were built in the post-war period.
<P>
	I have to say in deference to the issue, and I would be less than 
honest if I did not, that they did have Canadian content and were 
considered to be among the best in the world. It was a different 
time, a different environment, different circumstances-post-war. 
In 1967 the debate for the replacement of those destroyers had 
begun. Not only had it begun but it had been going on for some 
time, maybe a couple of years.
<P>
	If you can take a snippet of this point in history, the genesis had 
been set for the four gas turbine general purpose frigates, or 
DDH-280s, as they became known. There were four special ships 
in the making, but they had a long time to go as well.
<P>
	In 1967 the debate had already begun on a replacement for the 20 
post-war destroyers. On  December 22, 1977, ten years later, a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16595"> 16595 </A></B>
<P>
cabinet document approved the construction of the Canadian patrol 
frigates. That was in December 1977.
<P>
	I will now report that the last of that class of frigate will be 
commissioned next year. Actually HMCS <I>St. John's</I> will be 
commissioned in St. John's, Newfoundland on June 24, 1996, and 
the last of that class will be commissioned in Cornwall, HMCS 
<I>Ottawa</I>, in September 1996. After approval in 1977, the last to roll 
off and be commissioned will be practically 20 years later. That is a 
long time. That is 30 years from the conception to the last of the 
class delivery. I do not care what anyone says. I do not care what 
province they are from. I do not care what they represent or what 
discipline they belong to. That is too long.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	During the cold war we produced equipment for something that 
might happen. It is happening today. There are 50 wars going on 
and we are involved in some of them. We cannot have equipment 
for tomorrow; we have to have it for today. We cannot go on 
planning for 30 years, expecting and not delivering.
<P>
	If they do not want to heed what the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of National Defence and Veterans Affairs has to say, I 
refer them to none other than the auditor general. In his 1993 report 
he essentially reinforced more eloquently and more specifically the 
points which I have made. He found three major difficulties with 
the present procurement system in national defence.
<P>
	There were 550 major capital projects under way at one point in 
time. A capital project was in the vicinity of $100 million. That in 
itself is a challenge.
<P>
	I am going to repeat this because if I heard somebody say this in 
the House I would say that they were wrong by a multiplier of 10. 
The first difficulty which the auditor general found was that it took 
5,550 days from the time a capability deficiency was discovered in 
the inventory of capital equipment in national defence until 
Treasury Board approval. Not delivery, approval. It took 5,550 
days which is 15 years. The system is cumbersome. The number of 
man hours used in that process would indicate why national 
defence headquarters was so large and why there was so much 
difficulty in reaching agreement on the kind of equipment we 
needed.
<P>
	The second difficulty was that one of the major pieces of 
baggage the defence program management system had was the 
business of content and industrial regional benefits which were 
always built into the program. As my hon. colleague for 
Broadview-Greenwood has pointed out, that is no longer 
permissible under the free trade agreement.
<P>
	The difficulty was that in trying to build in regional industrial 
benefits and offsets, quite often the major contract was averted. 
The major project which was  proceeding apace, logically and 
reasonably, despite the time frame involved, got thrown off course 
because of an interjection which was too far downstream to be 
brought into the original concept of the contract. That threw the 
system off. The end result was that we did not get the best 
equipment for the money spent. Yes, it was rationalized, but the 
auditor general did not believe the rationalization was reasonable.
<P>
	The third major difficulty which the auditor general found in 
1993 was that because of the length of time it took to produce 
Treasury Board approval for the equipment and because of the 
dynamic instability inherent in the system, by the time the product 
was produced it did not necessarily relate to the threat or the 
deficiency which existed 15, 20 or 30 years before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> The original 
requirement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> The original requirement.
<P>
	I do not want to belabour this, but the case in point was the 
EH-101. It was a good helicopter, but it was too good for what was 
needed at the time. It was designed for the cold war. By the time the 
selection process had come to an end, the cold war was over and the 
requirements had changed.
<P>
	Where did we go from there? We had many discussions in the 
special joint committee on national defence, in which I was 
honoured to play a role, along with other colleagues of the House. 
There was some disagreement, but I thought the work of that 
committee was conducted very co-operatively. The report was 
hailed as a good report from the bottom up. In 10 months of study 
the committee consulted over 1,200 Canadians and every kind of 
group which was involved and interested in national defence, from 
the positive to the medium to the negative. We took into 
consideration all of their concerns.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	One of the major areas we spent time on was the procurement of 
equipment. Major equipment groups, defence preparedness groups, 
Canadian defence associations and the military equipment 
requirement industry came and spoke with us. Our conclusion was 
not in support of the motion the opposition has put forth.
<P>
	In the major discussion one of the things we focused on was that 
the procurement function was central to the operation of any 
military service. If we do not have equipment we cannot really 
have a decent force. This is especially so in the modern era where 
weapons systems are becoming more complex, more sophisticated 
and more expensive, not just because of the escalation in money 
but also because of the escalation in complexity and sophistication.
<P>
	The design and the delivery schedules extend over 10 to 15 
years. I used the example of the Canadian patrol  frigate. I think the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16596"> 16596 </A></B>
<P>
first one was delivered in 1988 and we will be delivering those 
ships until 1996. That is an eight to ten year delivery schedule.
<P>
	The factor that was considered in the special joint committee 
was the regrettable tendency for the Canadian forces to overspecify 
the requirements and generally to use every procurement 
opportunity as a chance to design and build the very best weapons 
system possible. Best was the enemy of good enough.
<P>
	The second point we focused on was that there was a stringent 
set of oversight and accountability requirements imposed over the 
years and probably for good reason by the Treasury Board.
<P>
	Together these factors produced a bureaucracy and a system for 
the management and control of federal procurement that has grown 
out of all proportion to the real needs of the Canadian forces, out of 
proportion to the size of the Canadian forces which over the last 10 
years has been reduced both in size and in budget. I will mention 
some figures on that in a few moments.
<P>
	Our recommendations were threefold. We believed that a 
significant reduction in the unnecessary superstructure was long 
overdue. The recommendation was made that first of all the 
government make a public commitment to purchasing military 
equipment off the shelf and that it avoid the complex, slow moving 
custom designed procurement and production processes that 
characterized too many capital projects in recent years, some 
examples of which I have given.
<P>
	In this spirit the procurement policies of the department and the 
Canadian forces should show a bias toward the purchase of 
commercially available products whenever possible, be it Canadian 
or offshore.
<P>
	The final recommendation, and we felt strongly about this, was 
that the deputy minister and chief of the defence staff working with 
the officials of other concerned departments should take immediate 
steps to modernize and streamline the procurement process. The 
parliamentary secretary for industry and the parliamentary 
secretary for public works will be commenting on that this 
afternoon.
<P>
	The white paper stemmed from our special joint committee. In 
the white paper a considerable effort was devoted to looking at 
capital equipment. The opening thoughts were that we had to 
change security environment and we had to change fiscal 
circumstance. This demanded that national defence radically 
restructure its plans to purchase capital equipment.
<P>
	To put it more succinctly, if we add up all the reductions, in the 
last decade national defence has had funding reduced by $21 billion 
which is a lot of money over a decade and 21,000 people in the 
regular force which is a lot of people. I have not counted civilians 
and I have not counted the reserve force.
<P>
	We cannot give up that amount of funding for whatever reason 
and expect to do business as usual.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Over how many years?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Over a decade. That is a lot. In the last two years 
since 1993 there has been a reduction of $7 billion from the 
department. That is from 1993 to 1999 and is in the 1993 budget. In 
last year's budget there is another $2.8 billion. I am talking about a 
lot of bucks here and a lot of jobs. I am talking about a lot of corner 
cutting which has to be done to make do with the money we have to 
buy the equipment we need. We cannot do business as usual which 
is the point I am making here.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	First of all, we have put emphasis on extending the life of 
equipment whenever cost effective and prudent. With respect to 
new equipment, the acquisition will be only for purposes 
considered essential to maintaining the capability of the Canadian 
forces and for the widest range of defence roles. We want the 
equipment to do as much as possible without compromising the 
role and the major purpose of the equipment. We want to get fewer 
types of equipment, which is now the case, and to purchase 
equipment that is easier to maintain.
<P>
	With respect to planned acquisitions, in 15 years capital 
equipment alone was cut by $15 billion. I talked about $21 billion 
but that involved other reductions in base closures and that kind of 
thing. That is a lot of money.
<P>
	The Department of National Defence had to adopt a better 
business practice where greater reliance was placed on the just in 
time delivery of common usage items to reduce inventory costs. 
Also, in direct response to the recommendation made by the joint 
committee, the department increased off the shelf procurement of 
commercial technology which meets the essential military 
specifications.
<P>
	The Department of National Defence has embarked on a 
program to enhance its partnership with the private sector. The 
most recent and best example of this is the way we are going about 
the acquisition of our 15 search and rescue helicopters, which does 
indicate a tremendous partnership and co-operation with the 
private sector. We have built in a lot of flexibility to the private 
sector.
<P>
	Where business case evaluations demonstrate potential for 
increased cost effectiveness, support activities currently conducted 
in house will be transferred completely to Canadian industry, or 
shared with private industry under various partnership 
arrangements. This again speaks of more flexibility, cost 
effectiveness and efficiency.
<P>
	We are also continuing to seek new ways to support our 
operational forces. If we can contract out to maintain the 
equipment, that is quite satisfactory to the  department. I could 
quote 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16597"> 16597 </A></B>
<P>
examples but because of the time I will finish the main thread of 
my presentation.
<P>
	In Canada today, 60,000 people are employed in high technology 
industries, such as aerospace and electronics, which are directly 
linked to defence procurement. These linkages extend beyond the 
production of defence equipment to include technological spinoffs 
into commercial products and access to international markets.
<P>
	The challenge of lower R and D and capital spending, as I 
alluded to earlier, and more off the shelf purchasing will be to 
maintain and improve the industrial impact of those expenditures 
which remain. To this end, it is the intention of the Department of 
National Defence to work with Industry Canada and Public Works 
and Government Services Canada toward harmonizing industrial 
and defence policies to maintain essential defence and industrial 
capability.
<P>
	In general, the government will seek to foster defence 
conversion despite what the motion suggests. We are going to 
foster conversion not by a vast infusion of money, but through 
other initiatives which the Minister of Industry has espoused in 
very clear terms in this House during question period and in major 
speeches he has made. I am surprised there is so much doubt on the 
other side.
<P>
	We are looking at overall industrial growth and the international 
competitiveness of Canadian firms consistent with our 
international trade agreements.
<P>
	To summarize, what we did before may have been all right when 
we had the budget to do it, when there was the threat climate to do 
it and when circumstances permitted. All of the circumstances have 
changed. We can no longer do business as usual. We have had a 
major overhaul in the way we do business: in procurement, in life 
cycle management, in life cycle maintenance.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	I look forward to the rest of the debate today to see if we can pick 
up some more ideas to further enhance what I believe is already 
tremendous progress in this area.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have two comments and a question for the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	I do not know whether this is a military tactic, but he digressed 
somewhat from the topic at hand-I am actually very glad he did 
so-to discuss timeframes and the whole structure at headquarters 
for supervision, programming auditing, and so forth, all of which 
takes forever. He said as long as 15 years, in some cases.
<P>
	This is indeed one of the problems of defence procurement. The 
Auditor General mentioned this in his 1993 report, and he made his 
case very eloquently. We also discussed this on the special joint 
committee, but I  would like to ask the parliamentary secretary 
what exactly has been done within this whole review process.
<P>
	There was, for instance, the software for maintenance of the 
frigates, for which the military had set certain criteria. After a lot of 
negotiations and unavoidable delay, we finally obtained a small 
percentage what the military had asked for. After spending about 
$30 million on this software, we have yet to obtain what we want.
<P>
	I wonder how the parliamentary secretary can say that things 
have changed within the Department of National Defence. If we are 
going to buy equipment directly on site, will defence testing 
requirements become stricter or will they remain the same after 
acquisition of this equipment?
<P>
	We have now reduced the EH-101 capability to 15 per cent. Are 
we going to upgrade it again afterwards? Because nothing has 
happened to change the whole situation he referred to in the 
department and at headquarters in the past two years. That is my 
first comment. I would like to know whether the parliamentary 
secretary has any specifics.
<P>
	Second, in his speech he said that we could no longer afford to 
use defence procurement as a tool for regional development, as the 
federal government often did in the past. As I said earlier-and I 
appreciate the fact that the parliamentary secretary talked about 
being logical-when there is no infrastructure, I agree we should 
not create a new infrastructure, but when it exists, when a company 
has the infrastructure, then we can use and adapt it to defence 
criteria.
<P>
	When we talk about armoured personnel carriers, I am always 
reminded of the fact that the last deliveries of Bisons, which are 
now judged to be obsolete or old, were made in 1994. If defence 
equipment is old after only one year, I really wonder about the 
future of the Canadian army's equipment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I recognize that he has agreed with some of the things we 
have said, as he did in the special joint committee.
<P>
	I emphasize that the changes I have just related to him and to the 
House are not yet a year old. I assure him from the bottom of my 
heart that the name of the game is what is the most cost effective 
way of doing business. He is right in pointing out that we have done 
things differently depending on the kind of contract we have. 
However, that points out the flexibility in the system.
<P>
	We no longer have to go through a system of hoops, milestones 
and baggage difficulties because it says so in the manual. It is done 
differently depending on which is the best way to do it and what is 
the most cost effective way of doing it.

<P>
	The best example I could give the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg is to tell him about one area of technology, which 
I know he understands, so I will relate it to him very briefly.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	In 1985 the Canadian navy had less than 350,000 lines of code. I 
am talking about software now. A decade later the number of lines 
of code in software in the computer and command control systems 
and technology transfer systems has increased by a factor of 30. It 
has just under 10 million lines of code now.
<P>
	The member knows what that means with respect to software 
managers, the number of people who work in the software 
production areas and who are involved in maintenance and 
producing programs.
<P>
	Different ways have to be found to do this. Some work may have 
to be contracted out as was done in one case. The member alluded 
to the case of Paramax. I think he was satisfied with the number of 
witnesses that were heard who indicated the difficulties we had 
with that and in other areas. That is one area to which I would like 
to respond.
<P>
	However, this system is still evolving. The examples that he used 
indicate that we are prepared to do things differently and hopefully 
in the right manner. We may not get it right 100 per cent of the 
time, which is always the case when we are making a change. But 
we know that we have the major thrust right.
<P>
	I want to respond to comments the hon. member made earlier 
and to clarify, in case there is any doubt in his mind, with respect to 
the submarines. He sat on the special joint committee. I am not 
going to read the recommendation because it is very clear. I can 
almost do it verbatim. The special joint committee said that, 
reluctantly, as much as it believes Canada needs a third dimension 
in surveillance of the oceans, which are the same size as the 
country, a submarine capability is needed to replace the aging 
submarines now. They are at the end of the line.
<P>
	Pretty soon the capability to have people serve in submarines 
will be lost because the submarines will be gone. Therefore the 
capability will go with it. The report said, reluctantly, that Canada 
could not afford to spend the $5 billion needed to get four new 
submarines. However it did say that because Canada is a maritime 
country and because it really needs this third dimension to see 
beneath the surface as well as on and above the water, that if there 
was an opportunity to buy four submarines that were fairly modern, 
advantage should be taken of that.
<P>
	As it turned out the British navy had retired its new submarines, 
the Upholder class. They are not old submarines. One of them has 
never been used. How can Canadian content be put into an 
opportunity buy? The committee agreed and said that its members 
did not  specify a particular country. As it turns out it was the 
Upholder class in Britain, but it could have been other classes. It 
was not specified. The committee members did not restrict 
themselves. They said: ``If we can get something at a bargain price 
that somebody else does not need any more, then buy it''. It is like a 
major capital equipment garage sale. I wanted to clarify that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a question for my 
colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National 
Defence. The thrust of his speech dealt with the whole issue of off 
the shelf. We must be more sensitive to off the shelf purchases.
<P>
	I realize that some of the prime military manufacturers are not 
Canadian yet Canada has some of the best component part 
manufacturers in the aerospace industry. What is the government or 
the Department of National Defence doing to marry our aerospace 
component manufacturers with those prime military 
manufacturers? Is there something that could evolve like the auto 
pact which we have for the automotive sector?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted that the hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry put that 
question. I must tell the House that we did not consult before.
<P>
	The best example I can give him is the announcement made a 
week ago last Wednesday by the Minister of National Defence with 
respect to the acquisition of the capability for 15 search and rescue 
helicopters.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	It allows the aerospace industry to be totally flexible in the way 
it goes about responding to this request. It can either provide 
helicopters by saying that it thinks those are the ones that are the 
best, and if it is assessed, that is the way it goes or the Canadian 
companies can say that they will lease helicopters. Having leased 
or bought them, the maintenance of the helicopters can be 
contracted out using the aerospace industry in a manner that 
perhaps was not conceived before and the inflexibility of this 
cumbersome system that I described in my presentation did not 
allow. More flexibility means more efficiency and better use of 
Canada's considerable aerospace industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is an interesting motion that we are debating this 
afternoon:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House condemn the government for having dropped the Canadian 
content requirements in the contracts for the purchase of military equipment 
and refusing to set up a genuine program for the conversion of the military 
industry, thus endangering the Canadian aerospace industry located in 
Montreal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Right off the top, I have to say that this motion has great 
difficulty with one of the realities of the economic world today. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16599"> 16599 </A></B>
<P>
live in a global economy. The motion fails utterly and completely 
to address the question that Canada must be competitive in that 
world. It seems to  state that looking for subsidies somehow seems 
to be the answer. I could not disagree more with the thrust of the 
motion. I might wish to condemn the government for other things 
but that is certainly not one of them.
<P>
	I would like to take a slightly different approach to this whole 
business and look at it from the industrial point of view, from the 
development of industry and, in particular, innovation and the 
science and technology thrust that ought to happen in Canada. One 
of the first of these is that Reformers encourage investment, not 
subsidization.
<P>
	This country needs to develop entrepreneurs, risk takers, people 
who understand what it means to take a new idea and make it work. 
It is, after all, these innovators in this new technological world that 
are the engine of the new economy that is developing all around us.
<P>
	We need to develop a culture that rewards entrepreneurship, 
innovation and research and ensures that there is a level, 
competitive and honest marketplace in which these people can 
operate. That is what we need. This motion does the exact opposite. 
It throws the whole marketplace and the honesty of the marketplace 
right out the window. Therefore, we cannot approve it for that 
reason.
<P>
	If entrepreneurs are developed with the skills to be innovative 
and to take the necessary risks, we will develop the kind of fibre in 
the people who will make Canada strong and who will get us to the 
competitive position that we need.
<P>
	In order to do that, we need to do something else. We need to 
encourage investment in capital structures, in buildings. We also 
need to develop investment in equipment. That is obvious. The one 
that is not so obvious is that we need to have investment in research 
and development.
<P>
	Let me draw members' attention to what the president of Digital 
Canada had to say about Research and Development Canada: ``By 
far, the most overriding issue is the investment climate for 
innovation in Canada''. We have all heard stories of new Canadian 
inventions. These are not so new. They have been around for a 
while but they were new at one time. One was the heart pacemaker 
and the other was the variable pitch propeller. Both of these 
inventions were exploited not in Canada but in other countries 
because of the reluctance of Canadians to take risks.
<P>
	It is unlikely that Canadians are any more risk adverse than 
anyone else in the world. They will take risks. However, we have 
always had taxation and fiscal policies that encouraged investment 
in enterprises that had hard assets to back them up as opposed to 
enterprises that were based strictly on knowledge. That is the 
direction we will be moving in the future.
<P>
	I am so encouraged to see that at least some of our banking 
community is beginning to recognize this. They are beginning to 
recognize that we need to recognize assets that are not hard and 
fixed but rather rest really in the minds, the capabilities, and the 
skills of individuals.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Then he goes on to an example of a particular company. Guess 
which company it might be? The Digital Equipment Corporation, 
which was founded in 1957 with only $70,000 of venture capital. 
That was put up by a company in Boston called American Research 
and Development. It took 70 per cent of the equity in the company 
but also showed the founders of the company how to build and 
manage a successful company. The result was that when that 
company went public on the American Stock Exchange in 1966, 
less than 10 years later, that $70,000 investment was worth about 
$30 million. That is significant.
<P>
	It was the tax provision that existed in the United States at that 
time that made it possible for these ventures to succeed as they did. 
We need to learn from these successful countries and do something 
very similar. It has nothing to do with the kind of subsidization that 
is being advocated in this motion.
<P>
	We need to go one step further as well. Canadian investors and 
Canadian entrepreneurs need to recognize that they need to have a 
change toward venture capitalists. They seem to have the idea, 
which is only human-I am certainly like that-that if something 
is mine, it is mine, and I want it all.
<P>
	When you get into the idea of venture capital, these people who 
have the deep pockets with millions and sometimes billions of 
dollars in them, and who are prepared to underwrite the venture, do 
not want to just give that away. They want to say this is a good idea 
and they want a part. The company we just looked at took 70 per 
cent, but it became a $30 million investment later and gave a 
tremendous return to the owner.
<P>
	The person who has the great idea needs to recognize that they 
have two options: they have all of the idea with no money to 
develop it, which means they will never make any money and never 
get rich; or they have the option of going to somebody who has a 
deep pocket, venture the thing out, share the major risk on the other 
side, and get rich in the process as well.
<P>
	That attitude needs to develop in Canada. It needs to develop 
among academicians. It needs to develop with our entrepreneurs. It 
needs to develop on the part of parents of people who are seeking 
success in the industrial world.
<P>
	We need to move into another area as well. We need to get into 
the area of management. When we get into high tech specialized 
industries and we need specialized management as well. We need 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16600"> 16600 </A></B>
<P>
managers who understand science. We need managers who 
understand technology.
<P>
	You can be the most brilliant scientist, the most brilliant 
technologist and understand all the machinations and all the 
intricate workings of networks and things of that sort, but if you 
cannot manage people it is no good. It takes a special kind of 
management skill to do this. We need to do that.
<P>
	There are two skills I would like to draw to our attention today. 
The first of these is that these people need to learn how to solve 
problems. That becomes the key. It is not so much are you able to 
push the button or are you able to program the computer, but rather 
can you solve a problem. Then you must recognize that you 
probably cannot do it alone and that your skills need to be 
combined with those of someone else, a third party and a fourth 
party, so that the group together forms a team. That team then 
begins to solve the problem. At different times, different members 
of that team will become leaders. The whole concept of seniority 
and the other things that are traditional with us will go out the 
window.
<P>
	This motion, on the other hand, says no, no, no, do not do that; 
just create a government program for this industry so that it can be 
diverted to peacetime operation rather than military operation. No. 
Government needs to encourage the development of balanced 
people who can do the kind of management we talked about. We 
need to give to the individuals who seek this kind of education an 
opportunity to do that.
<P>
	Members in the House will remember that we proposed a 
voucher system of education so that the student, the researcher, or 
the scientist who wants to advance himself becomes a person who 
selects where, when, and into how much detail he will go to get that 
skill in development. It seems to me that is rather significant, 
instead of having the university decide here is your program, here 
are your answers, come and get them. The student says no, he needs 
this kind of an answer, and asks if they have this kind of expertise. 
He searches around until he finds it and then gives that voucher to 
that institution and says he wants to do this. The institution 
benefits, gets the money, and has the resources to give this student 
what he needs.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	We need those kinds of things. We need new people, we need 
investment, we need all those kinds of things. We need to go 
beyond that as well. We need to develop a sound vehicle for the 
transfer of technology from the place where the brains are to where 
it is actually applied in a profitable way. Canada has a gap here. 
That gap is an inability to adequately, effectively, and consistently 
transfer technology from the research bodies, usually universities 
and governments in some cases, to the development industries in 
order to provide strategic technologies for manufacturing, service, 
and resource based sectors.
<P>
	Usually the best way to do that is to collaborate between sectors. 
The centres of excellence do this to a degree, as does IRAP, but we 
need to do something a little more advanced than that. We need to 
support more industry driven networks like Innovation Place in 
Saskatoon. That is an example of how university, industry, and 
government can collaborate and bring about true advancement in 
technology and the application of skill and innovation to new ideas.
<P>
	It is becoming rather clear that some professors, who all want 
seniority and who all want these great salaries, are having great 
difficulty getting to the level of income they aspire to. At this 
particular centre of innovation these professors are driving the best 
cars around. They are living in the biggest houses. They have the 
kinds of bank accounts they have always dreamed about. Why? 
They have the willingness to take their intellectual property and 
work together with an industrialist or entrepreneur and work 
together with certain elements of the government and say together 
we can build a whole new way of doing things. They have 
succeeded in doing that, and congratulations to them.
<P>
	There is something this government has done that is not too bad. 
It has financed a study called ``The Commercialization of Research 
in Canada''. Get a load of what this report advocates, which is very 
interesting. I hope the government has the nerve to do this: 
``Canada's universities should radically improve their intellectual 
property policies and processes for transferring scientific 
discoveries to industry or lose eligibility for government research 
grants''. Madam Speaker, have you ever heard of this type of thing 
before? This is absolutely unbelievable.
<P>
	The report goes on to state: ``The policy should clearly articulate 
a university stance on the following issues: the responsibility of 
researchers to identify research results with possible economic or 
social benefits; electronic publishing; ownership of the intellectual 
property; a process for reporting and recording the facts of the case; 
routes and options for the protection of the intellectual property; 
options for revenue sharing; guidelines for technology transfers 
and commercialization, especially with Canadian based 
businesses; and exceptions to the policy in particular cases where a 
special contract is more desirable with the terms of the policy, such 
as in contract research, network research, or research involving a 
prior intellectual property''. That is some of the most forward 
thinking I have heard in a long time.
<P>
	It goes on: ``Failure to develop such policies or to hire a person 
responsible for identifying and disseminating intellectual property 
and technology transfer policies to all individual researchers within 
the university should preclude all of the school's researchers from 
eligibility for government-industry targeted funding, such as 
granting council strategic programs''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16601"> 16601 </A></B>
<P>
	Is that not a refreshing sound to hear? This would be absolutely 
amazing. Think of what this would do to the university. This 
would bring together for once the community and the 
academician. It would bring together the industrialists and the 
taxpayers who fund all this stuff in the first place and show how 
we can build a better Canada. That is the kind of motion we should 
be debating today, not the kind of motion that is before the House.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	They are radical suggestions. Should they happen? Yes, they 
should happen. The reason they should happen is because Canada 
is in a globally competitive environment. Competition has become 
the imperative. It is a sad thing to say that science is not sufficiently 
recognized in the House. It is high time we recognized the 
significance of the role science plays in our daily life. We need to 
become aware that it is not only competition; it is also the role 
science plays in our economy and in our industry. While that may 
raise the ire of basic researchers who are afraid of having their 
work hijacked by economic demands, it must be accepted.
<P>
	There will be an inevitable division between the traditionalists 
and the innovators. They will fight with each other. While neither 
can be excluded, the innovators must receive attention. The 
marketplace will ultimately decide that. Their time has come. They 
are the ones who can provide Canada with a foundation of 
economic independence. They will provide global 
competitiveness. The innovators are skilled in technology and 
science. The traditionalists, like all of us, will benefit from the 
country's wealth. Their task will not be lost; it will be assured. 
They will have jobs. We cannot let the naysayers turn us away from 
what is necessary. We must support the innovators, choose the path 
and move forward in that direction.
<P>
	These are major new directions for our country. They are not 
easy to develop. They will not happen overnight. They require 
co-operation at all levels. I am very encouraged by some of the 
things that have happened recently. The important thing to 
recognize is that industry has to get into research. Industry must 
form consortia to share the costs of research.
<P>
	I would like to address the comments of the Auditor General of 
Canada with respect to science and technology in Canada. He had 
some pretty serious things to say. With respect to some of the 
comments, we should stand back and say wait a minute, is it really 
that bad? Yes, it is. He suggests that the lack of progress in previous 
attempts to produce results oriented action plans can be attributed 
to a lack of overall government-wide leadership, direction, and 
accountability for implementing dramatic changes. That is 
probably one of the worst indictments anybody could make about 
the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Seven billion dollars are spent on research and development in 
Canada. This country has a debt of $560 billion. We spend $7 
billion on research. Not one of those dollars should be taken away. 
We need to spend that kind of money. In fact we should probably 
spend more. When the Auditor General of Canada says this money 
has not been focussed, has been spent in a manner that does not 
have a general direction, I say shame.
<P>
	We need a focus. We need direction. We have been waiting for 
over two years for a policy on science and technology. It is still not 
here. I hope it will come very soon. We need it desperately. If we 
are to be an economically viable country, if we are to be 
competitive globally, we must come to grips with this part of our 
development.
<P>
	We must oppose the motion. Instead of doing what the motion 
proposes, we need to encourage investment. We need to encourage 
innovation. We need to develop a new attitude toward venture 
capital. We need to develop specialized management. We need a 
sound vehicle for technology transfer. We need to recognize the 
value of collaborative research. Finally, we must take seriously the 
Auditor General of Canada's caution to get off our butts and get a 
focus and a direction for the country.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research and 
Development), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to the 
motion. The concept that the Government of Canada has not been 
working hard to ensure a strong aerospace industry in Canada is 
totally false. Canadian involvement in space and in the 
development of the Canadian space industry has been exemplary. 
The story of Canadians in space shows clearly that Canadians can 
solve problems.
<P>
	In typical Canadian fashion we have been modest in singing the 
praises of Canada's accomplishments in space. I am here today to 
ensure that Canadian scientists, Canadian engineers and Canadian 
entrepreneurs get their full recognition in terms of the marvellous 
accomplishments they have made and are making in the name of 
Canada in space.
<P>
	Canadians are space pioneers. More than 35 years ago Canada 
launched <I>Alouette</I>. We were the third country in space, a pioneer. It 
is the same today. Just last month we launched RADARSAT, the 
world's most sophisticated earth observation satellite. Canada is 
leading the world.
<P>
	Last week we saw Major Chris Hadfield onboard NASA's 
STS-74 shuttle mission to <I>Mir</I> using Canadian technology to help 
bring together the Russian space station and the U.S. space 
<I>Atlantis</I>. The two events showcased Canadian technology to the 
world in an unprecedented way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16602"> 16602 </A></B>
<P>
	I welcome the opportunity to tell Canada's story in space and 
specifically to underscore today the very important role Quebec has 
played in this effort. Ours is  an increasingly competitive world and 
governments cannot afford to invest time, effort and money in 
ventures that do not bring significant gains both to scientific 
knowledge and to economic and environmental benefits the world 
over.
<P>
	Canada's space program is a growth industry, aligned with the 
new realities of information technology providing us not only 
wonderful new technology for manipulating in space but new 
communications technology. Canada is a world leader in this area.
<P>
	The Canadian space industry provides employment for 4,000 
Canadians and pulls in annual revenues of more than $500 million. 
Over the last decade the average annual rate of growth in the space 
industry has been 15 per cent, with Quebec a particularly high 
performer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Over the past ten years, the space industry in Canada has grown 
annually by 15 per cent, with Quebec being a particularly strong 
performer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The space program was established to meet Canada's needs in 
areas vital to our economy: telecommunications, resource 
management, surveillance and environmental monitoring. Satellite 
communications has been the way for the auto route of 
information, the information highway, the 20th century equivalent 
of the railway providing linkages that help bind the country 
together from one end to the other.
<P>
	The Canadian space program is also driven by a desire and a 
political will to ensure the development of a globally competitive 
economy. In a fashion, all regions of the country have been able to 
draw on the government's space effort, to transfer space technology 
from government laboratories to the private sector, and to 
capitalize on employment and economic activity generated as a 
result of this visionary program.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	The province of Quebec and its aerospace industry have been 
beneficiaries of the program. The location of the Canadian Space 
Agency in Saint-Hubert on Montreal's south shore is testimony to 
the importance of Quebec in this national effort. It underscores 
Montreal's international role in space, in satellite communication 
and in the information age.
<P>
	The space agency has brought several hundred highly educated 
scientific people to the greater Montreal area and has added to 
Montreal's position as a centre of high technology. I am 
particularly heightened by the fact that Quebec has shown 
considerable leadership in the program, the industries and the 
people of Quebec. More than $540 million in contracts have been 
won by Quebec firms since 1988, which is more than 35 per cent of 
budget of the space program.
<P>
	Quebec's leadership position in the space sector is further 
reinforced by strong engineering skills and industrial activities. 
The RADARSAT satellite was built by the Spar aerospace facility 
at Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, as was MSAT, an advanced 
telecommunications satellite scheduled to be launched in the first 
quarter of the next calendar year. Mission control for RADARSAT 
is located at the space station in Saint-Hubert.
<P>
	In building the satellite Spar was able to draw on the skills of a 
pool of highly specialized small and medium size enterprises that 
provided various components of the RADARSAT satellite. In 
economic terms some 60 per cent of the RADARSAT program was 
awarded to Spar and its subcontractors. This is just the beginning of 
the RADARSAT story.
<P>
	Presently a study is under way to look at partnership 
arrangements for the next generation of RADARSAT to ensure 
commercialization of the RADARSAT system and launch of the 
second RADARSAT satellite. It is significant that a major Quebec 
based firm has become involved. I am referring to SNC-Lavalin, a 
firm that has successfully established itself as a world leader in 
project management.
<P>
	Let me take a moment to talk about Canada's RADARSAT 
satellite. It is a remarkable Canadian achievement to have built and 
successfully launched a satellite earlier this month. The satellite 
uses radar to allow continuous monitoring of the earth's surface. 
Unlike most of the previously launched earth's observation 
satellites which cannot see through clouds and cannot therefore 
monitor much of the earth's surface much of the time, RADARSAT 
can monitor it continuously. By using the radar it can peer through 
the clouds and have a continuous assessment of the nature, the 
events and the changes on the surface of the earth.
<P>
	Not only does Canada's RADARSAT provide a complete and 
continuous coverage of the earth's surface but it uses an 
extraordinary technology developed in Canada to provide a 
remarkably flexible, precise and complete coverage. RADARSAT 
can provide full coverage of Canada's Arctic area every 24 hours, 
full coverage of Canada's entire land mass within three days, every 
three days, and full coverage of the total surface of the world, of 
our globe, every seven days.
<P>
	RADARSAT will provide for Canada and for the world a 
remarkably new tool to monitor crop development, to assess the 
status of crops, yield, insect infestations and all sorts of other 
things that may happen to the crops planted and to assess the status 
of forests, the growth, the harvesting, the regeneration and so forth. 
It is a wonderful tool with the ability to monitor the world's forests 
and specifically help Canada better manage its own forests.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16603"> 16603 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	It is very important for shipping to know precisely what is 
happening in terms of ice conditions like those in Hudson Bay or 
the northern Atlantic. RADARSAT will be able to provide that. The 
monitoring of water conditions to better control floods during 
spring runoff not only in Canada but around the world is a 
wonderful new technology that helps people the world over to live 
better and have a higher quality of life.
<P>
	These are but a few of the potential applications of RADARSAT. 
Thanks to the foresight of our government, Canadian industries 
now have an extraordinary commercial advantage in RADARSAT. 
Canadian industry is well positioned to take advantage of the 
benefits of the new satellite. Canadians have expertise in the 
technology and are now actively marketing the potential of 
RADARSAT, its satellite system and its earth monitoring 
capabilities the world over.
<P>
	I want to talk for a moment about the space agency in 
Saint-Hubert, home to Canada's astronauts. Chris Hadfield landed 
yesterday at the Kennedy Space Centre after a seven-day mission 
of historical dimensions. Here again Canadian content in a mission 
characterized by NASA as one of the most technically demanding 
ever undertaken by the shuttle program was significant owing to 
the Canadian role, the role of Canadian technology and Canadian 
astronaut Chris Hadfield, in bringing together the United States and 
Russia, the world's two space superpowers, in a successful 
partnership in space.
<P>
	Marc Garneau, the first Canadian in space, paved the way for 
future Canadian flights on the shuttle. He will once again be space 
bound next year. Julie Payette is continuing her training and we 
expect this will lead to a flight opportunity in the years to come.
<P>
	Canadian astronauts provide a wonderful role model for young 
Canadians. They are very important in a world where such role 
models are too infrequent. It is particularly significant as we try to 
promote the development of the science culture to have role models 
like Chris Hadfield, Marc Garneau and Julie Payette.
<P>
	On behalf of the Government of Canada, the hon. Minister of 
Industry and I unveiled the second long term space plan in June 
1994. We reconfirmed that Canada would be a significant 
contributor in space in the future. We reconfirmed that Canada 
would make a significant contribution to the international space 
station program, the largest scientific endeavour ever undertaken in 
the history of the world.
<P>
	The program will break new ground in fields as diverse as 
biotechnology, physiology, material science and fluid physics, a 
new era in understanding space medicine, to name just a few. 
Canada will provide the technology that will make possible the 
assembly and maintenance of the world's science and technology 
institute in space. The operations of the Canadian contribution, the 
mobile  servicing system, a leading edge robotics system, will be 
located in the space agency's facility in Saint-Hubert. Astronauts 
and space station operators from around the world will come to 
Saint-Hubert to train and to become knowledgeable about this very 
sophisticated and, one could say, intelligent robotic system.
<P>
	I am proud to have been associated with the Canadian space 
program.
<P>

<P>
	I am very proud to be associated with the Canadian space 
program.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since we have become the government we have been privileged 
to participate in and lead many initiatives to ensure the continued 
prosperity of Canada and the Canadian Space Agency, to ensure the 
continuity of our Canadian astronaut program, to ensure a 
continued place for Canada in space, in new technology, in 
communications. Canadians are justifiably proud of our 
accomplishments. We should all be pleased with the social and 
economic benefits that come from this national effort. In today's 
information economy, we are indeed fortunate that Canada has 
such a strong space program.
<P>
	In closing, let me emphasize once more the important role and 
the foresight our government has played in leading the Canadian 
space effort. It has mobilized an effort that will transfer 
increasingly some extraordinary technology to Canadian industry 
and provide at the same time the technology that will help us 
monitor and improve the global environment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is our future, this is Quebec's future, this is Canada's future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Kootenay East. I hope my 
voice will hang in there. If you see my lips moving and no sound, 
you will know it has disappeared.
<P>
	Today's topic is a rather interesting one. At this time I could see 
a lot better wording than might be part of this question. We should 
start off by saying as the last member has, how proud we are of our 
aerospace industry and of our astronauts. Certainly every time we 
hear the Canadarm mentioned, all of us feel proud of what we have 
accomplished. Our future is in the area of technology and that is 
certainly something all Canadians know and are proud of.
<P>
	However, when we talk about this motion, about Canadian 
content and about the protection of some industries over others, I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16604"> 16604 </A></B>
<P>
cannot help but go back a little bit in history. I cannot help but go 
back a little bit in terms of what some of the other members are 
saying.
<P>
	I cannot help but go back to the F-18 contract in Winnipeg. 
Obviously the lowest bid was there and the recommendations were 
there. The qualifications for doing the job were there. Certainly the 
people of Manitoba, the people of the west do not forget the party 
politics that were played in the decision to move the F-18 contract 
to Montreal. Now we hear the other side of that. Now we hear the 
fears that we are going to lose this industry for Quebec.
<P>
	All of us are looking for a free enterprise system in which all 
parts of Canada are treated equally, where one part does not have 
favoured status over the other, where we stop playing party politics 
and we start getting down to what is good for Canada. That should 
be the emphasis instead of what we are talking about today.
<P>
	We also have to look at the criteria when we look at defence 
contracts. Obviously we want to have Canadian content, but not 
Canadian content if it is not competitive. If it is not competitive, it 
better get competitive if that industry is going to survive. If it has to 
be subsidized and protected, then it is obviously very short term 
and very short sighted planning by that company and by this 
government.
<P>
	We also must be aware of globalization and what that means. We 
are now in a global market. We now have NAFTA and the World 
Trade Organization. We cannot talk about protecting industry and 
protecting the inefficiencies of the past.
<P>
	We have to talk about being competitive in the world. We have 
the training. We have the technology. We have the people. Let us 
not hide behind government, behind bureaucracy, or behind rules 
that set up how we are going to give contracts. Let us do it because 
we are the best. Let us do it because we are the most competitive 
and thus we will market our products around the world. That is 
what globalization and free trade means. It is what the World Trade 
Organization will mean in 10 years. Canada can do very well in that 
field. So, let us not be embarrassed and shy and not be out front. 
Let us not hide behind the past.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	We could also be talking about the Department of National 
Defence today. We all know that it desperately needs new 
equipment. All of us know of the helicopters. My hon. seatmate 
here talked about helicopters falling out of the sky. Certainly the 
search and rescue people need that equipment, but let us have a 
game plan. DND must have a real game plan, what it needs and 
what it is going to do. It seems as though we get knee-jerk 
announcements. We have heard announcements about a $600 
million expenditure for helicopters, but the minister does not know 
for how many. I could not believe what I heard in that 
announcement.
<P>
	We obviously need all terrain vehicles. It was shameful what our 
troops used in the former Yugoslavia. With regard to armaments, 
we must keep modern and up to date and have the best for 
Canadians.
<P>
	Looking at the budgets, we can see that for years we have been 
cutting budgets and we have increased the requirement for our 
armed forces. This has done nothing except to cause morale 
problems and equipment problems in the military.
<P>
	We need to become diligent shoppers. That does not necessarily 
mean we have to buy in Canada. Remember, we must be 
competitive.
<P>
	This is a very timely topic today. I would also like to know what 
provisions we have in place to prevent the patronage of the past 
which was so common. Everybody knew about it and it seems to 
have carried on into the present government. We need to make sure 
there are guidelines in place so that this does not happen again. It 
does not give politicians a good name and it certainly does not give 
Canadians a good name when this sort of thing takes place. We 
should not be politicians for sale.
<P>
	We also have to ask questions about DND and the seemingly 
constant turmoil. It appears as though it is constantly having 
problems. No sooner does one crisis go away than a new one 
surfaces. We have to ask what it is doing to get its act together. That 
could easily be a topic for today.
<P>
	I refer to the former deputy minister of DND. I wonder why 
approximately a year ago he quickly disappeared from the scene to 
go to the United Nations as if to get him out of town.
<P>
	What about the EH-101s? How much did it cost to pay those off?
<P>
	The hon. member across the way mentioned that we should be 
very proud of our students and graduates who are filling technical 
jobs. I am very proud of them but I am concerned because at the 
University of Waterloo for example, 91 per cent of graduates in the 
electronics area are going to the U.S. for jobs. I am really 
concerned about that. I am concerned that we spent that money on 
training. That is a costly resource and we are losing them because 
they cannot get a job in Canada. We must work on that because they 
are the best.
<P>
	We have to talk about peacekeeping as well when we talk about 
armaments and DND. We need to know what to expect from our 
military. We need to have that game plan before we actually start 
talking about and worrying about the content of the equipment we 
are buying. We need to discuss it in Parliament. We need to discuss 
what those objectives and criteria are. We cannot keep doing things 
on a knee-jerk basis. We cannot do things where we have 
parliamentary debate and the decision has already been announced 
outside the House. We cannot keep doing that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16605"> 16605 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	We need to do something to restore public confidence as well. 
There is a great pride in our Canadian peacekeepers. There is a 
great pride in what we have, but when we send them underequipped 
and poorly controlled we have problems. We know what that has 
done to our reputation. We can talk about Somalia; we can talk 
about Rwanda; we can talk about the former Yugoslavia. All of 
those are problems which have hurt our reputation. We should be 
concerned about that.
<P>
	We need to set up criteria. We cannot go every place. We are not 
equipped to do that. We do not have the equipment. We know that 
we must ask about the cost, not that cost is more important than 
lives, but that is the reality. We cannot go everywhere. We can only 
afford so much and we have to ask those questions.
<P>
	In looking at these criteria we do need new equipment. We need 
to raise morale. We need efficiency. We need to get rid of the 
bureaucracy that seems to be causing all the problems.
<P>
	In closing, rather than whining about competition and Canadian 
content, we should get competitive. We should worry about our 
place in the marketplace. We should demand a fair and open 
bidding system. We should get rid of the politics, the patronage and 
the old line political games that so often go on. That will do more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with a great deal of interest to the comments made by the 
member opposite.
<P>
	I commend the member for his deep interest in the Canadian 
Armed Forces but at some point we have to fish or cut bait. I am not 
exactly sure of the position of the Reform Party with respect to 
procurement policy for the Canadian Armed Forces. I have listened 
many times and I have heard the Reform Party talk about the 
wholesale cutting of departments, that what the government has to 
do first and foremost is to tame that debt and deficit monster. That 
means wholesale cuts across the board to departmental 
expenditures.
<P>
	The member opposite knows full well that out of the 
non-statutory expenditures of this government, the previous 
government and the government before it, one of the largest 
envelopes of non-statutory expenditures is in national defence. 
What I am trying to ascertain from the member's comments is 
whether he agrees there should be new expenditures in national 
defence. If that is the case it may go contrary to what his party said 
particularly during the last election about going in and cutting 
those departments.
<P>
	Is the member in favour or not in favour of the EH-101 contract 
and its process? Does the member believe and advocate that the 
government of the day go forward with further expenditures in 
defence procurement? In particular, I am speaking about the 
replacement program for the Sea King helicopters. The  member 
mentioned quite correctly that some of the search and rescue and 
Sea King helicopters have had some difficulty because of their age. 
Unfortunately there has even been loss of life as some of those 
helicopters have gone down. I am not necessarily convinced it was 
because of the age of the helicopters.
<P>
	I want to seek something clear and unequivocal from the 
member. Is he in favour of further defence procurement spending, 
yes or no? If the answer is yes, does he wish to see this government 
accelerate its procurement policy with respect to new helicopters? 
Would he and his party support the government spending billions 
of dollars for the replacement of the Sea King helicopters?
<P>
	The hon. member talked a great deal about open procurement 
policies. What he said during his comments was that far too often 
these things are knee-jerk. Is the member not aware that a House of 
Commons committee travelled and came up with a report dealing 
with the future of the Canadian Armed Forces? In response to that 
report the government came out with the defence white paper 
which clearly outlines the government's policies with respect to 
national defence. Last, he says that before these big procurements 
are finalized they should be debated in the House. Is he an advocate 
that House time should be spent debating each and every 
procurement contract of the Government of Canada?
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, I am not sure I will get 
all 20 questions answered, but I will make an attempt.
<P>
	We are saying that national defence must have better equipment. 
However before it gets better equipment, we have to target what we 
are going to do. We have to establish the criteria and then we have 
to do it.
<P>
	He talks about the report that was presented. I was on the foreign 
affairs part of the committee and there was communication 
between the two committees. The point is that the 
recommendations were to cut from the top. That has not been done.
<P>
	If cuts are made at the top that money will be available for the 
bottom. Cuts should not be across the board but certain things 
should be targeted. Some things are gone 100 per cent, other things 
will increase. The sort of slash and burn tactic that the member has 
in mind is totally not what Reform members have in mind because 
we will target. We will set our criteria and then we will have 
something that is efficient. We will apply the same efficiencies that 
business applies, which government has totally ignored for all 
these years.
<P>
	It is a matter of going after the top. Government does not seem to 
be able to do that. It is too easy to cut from the bottom up.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16606"> 16606 </A></B>
<P>
	As for the EH-101s, that should have been looked at very 
carefully. I am sure the government did, but did it know of the 
potential costs of the cancellation? Did it really look at all of that?
<P>
	From what experts say the EH-101 probably was not the 
helicopter that was needed. What the minister is proposing is 
probably a good idea, but he has to have his act together. How 
much does it cost? How many are being bought? How many are 
needed? That is what has to happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
very interesting that we meet here today to discuss a Bloc 
Quebecois supply motion which attempts to get even more 
Canadian dollars to spend in Montreal.
<P>
	On the basis of the number of dollars that have been sent to the 
province of Quebec from the so-called have provinces, Alberta, 
British Columbia and Ontario, one would think there would already 
have been a recognition of the tremendous amount of support there 
has been on the part of all Canadian taxpayers to the idea of the old 
line parties of attempting to buy the loyalty of the people, and I 
think of them as being in the minority in the province of Quebec, 
who would see Quebec secede from Canada.
<P>
	It is also interesting that on this particular day we also note that 
the leader of the Bloc Quebecois has decided that he is going to 
continue in the House of Commons as Her Majesty's official loyal 
opposition, working his attempt to break up Canada, all the while 
waiting to become the premier of the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I seriously doubt the sincerity of the motion being brought 
forward by the Bloc Quebecois. Indeed, in its own way it is rather 
mischievous.
<P>
	Furthermore, after taking a look at the issue of whether there 
should be a Canadian content to our military procurements, it 
strikes me that it runs a very strong parallel to the attitude of this 
old line government, the Liberals, and their predecessors, the 
Conservatives, relative to regional economic development grants. 
It falls into exactly the same category.
<P>
	There seems to be a will on the part of the old line parties to 
create a national level playing field. In a matter of about 25 
minutes, the auditor general's report on regional development 
grants will be released. It will be very interesting to be able to focus 
on a dispassionate review of how these grants have worked and 
whether a national level playing field has been created.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	With respect to the issue of taking military product off the shelf, 
there is an over-arching issue. The over-arching issue is that 
Canada, at the federal level, is not taking into account the 
non-funded liability of the Canada pension plan, which is already 
over half a trillion dollars in debt. It is approximately $550 billion 
to $560 billion  in debt. Much to the amazement of people when 
they actually take the time to think about it, the government is 
borrowing about $100 million every day to pay the interest on the 
money which has been borrowed. Therefore, when talking about 
necessary military equipment procurement, if there is a greater 
value for Canada's tax dollars, that must be paramount in the 
decision making process.
<P>
	The idea of being able to intervene in the Montreal economy, or 
for that matter to intervene in the Canadian economy, is appealing. 
It certainly has been shown to have a tremendous appeal to 
members of the old line political parties. The $100 million which is 
borrowed daily will destroy our ability to fund health care, 
post-secondary education and the Canada assistance plan. Even old 
age security is under threat as a direct result of the desire of the 
government and its bedfellows, the Conservatives, to intervene in 
the economy.
<P>
	If an off the shelf policy for these procurements can be created 
and achieve the savings which Canadians are looking for, then the 
question is: What would that do to business in Canada?
<P>
	As a proud Canadian I am constantly impressed with our ability 
to compete. In the world there is no nation of people who are better 
able to adapt and compete. Canadians do not need this kind of 
over-arching government intervention to help competitiveness.
<P>
	It also drives home the issue with which we were faced during 
the latter days of the referendum. I recall being told that the 
majority of Canada's CF-18s were at Bagotville, Quebec. I also 
recall being told that the vast majority of armaments, that is, the 
munitions for the Canadian Armed Forces, are in the east end of 
Montreal. When the Bloc defence critic, on the letterhead of the 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois, advised people in the Canadian army 
to desert and join the new Quebec army, I really have to wonder 
about the sincerity and the depth of thought which has been given 
to this issue by the Bloc Quebecois. Why in the world would we 
permit ourselves to fall into the situation in which there is even 
more investment in that field in Montreal when the people who are 
proposing this legislation are talking about separating Quebec from 
Canada?
<P>
	The defence critic, I presume, is shepherding this motion 
through the Chamber on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois. His 
comments, in my judgment, were nothing short of sedition. You 
cannot be telling people in the Canadian army to desert. That is 
absolutely and totally unacceptable. I understand that a legal action 
has been commenced. I rather hope it has some success.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	It is just about time to call a spade a spade. If the Bloc Quebecois 
was serious about this motion, if it really wanted to see Canadian 
procurement and if it is talking about taking Quebec out of Canada, 
how in the world  can it not be seen as being totally contradictory? 
As a matter of fact, the two things are absolutely diametrically 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16607"> 16607 </A></B>
<P>
opposed to each other. They simply do not fit. In all good 
conscience, how could any Canadian go along with this motion?
<P>
	To get back to the smaller issue of procurement, because truly 
the larger issue is that of the Bloc attempting to smash Canada, 
Canadians, because of the size of the debt, must demand value for 
their tax dollar. This motion simply would not achieve that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to put a question to the 
member for Kootenay East. It has to do with the issue of Canadian 
content.
<P>
	The greatest dollar value of exports, not just in terms of dollar 
value but number of jobs created in the country today in the 
manufacturing sector, is the automotive industry. The automotive 
sector represents the greatest number of jobs and exports. The 
foundation that has generated that reality today started when the 
auto pact was negotiated with the United States of America.
<P>
	In that auto pact, percentages of Canadian content were 
negotiated. As the automotive industry was developed, the 
taxpayers invested in the foundation stages hundreds of millions of 
dollars in new equipment, in research and in the capacity to 
manufacture a world class, automotive, technology manufacturing 
capability.
<P>
	When we have such a model of proven success in job creation in 
a sector that is bringing literally billions of dollars to the treasury 
right now when it is looked at in its totality, why should we not do a 
careful analysis to see if we could not create the same opportunity 
in the aerospace sector?
<P>
	I realize that the free trade agreement states that Canadian 
content can be dictated no longer. I opposed the free trade 
agreement and that was one of the reasons why I opposed it. I felt 
that it took a piece of our industrial policy making capability away 
from us. However, why would we not take a look at the aerospace 
industry in the same light as the automotive industry?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, I find that question to be very 
reasonable. There is a very significant difference between myself 
and the other member because I look at the aerospace sector and the 
procurement of any of these armaments, be they tanks or 
helicopters, as being dollars spent by Canadian taxpayers, whereas 
the procurement of an automobile is dollars spent by a consumer.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	I also contest and simply do not accept the concept that 
Canadians directly invested dollars in General Motors or the Ford 
plant. These are multinational corporations that have their own 
investers and their own ability to borrow. While from time to time 
they have depended on ill-thought programs the various old line  
governments have come forward with, the reality is that the dollars 
that are being invested are not only being invested by the 
multinational corporations but are being raised by multinational 
corporations.
<P>
	I have a very significant difference of opinion with the other 
member. To underline the major difference I just spoke about, the 
dollars being spent on the procurement of equipment for our armed 
forces are Canadian taxpayers' dollars. The dollars being spent for 
the procurement of an automobile are being spent by the consumer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Barely a minute remains. 
The hon. member for Charlesbourg will allow for an answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would just like to say to the representative of the third party that, in 
his list of figures and in his comments, when he talks of surplus 
military equipment in Quebec, he is completely forgetting to 
mention the navy.
<P>
	There is nothing in Quebec to do with the navy. It is to be found 
in the west and in the maritimes. As far as the F-18s are concerned, 
most of them are not in Quebec. He should go over his figures and 
inform himself better. As regards the awarding of contracts, I might 
propose this list here of the latest contracts worth more than $3 
billion, awarded to Ontario without call for tender. In the west, the 
Western Star was obliged to accord part of this contract to 
Quebec-6.5 per cent. In another contract, there was no mention of 
Quebec at all.
<P>
	All of this to say that often things are interpreted according to the 
figures or information one has available. I would simply like to 
point out to the member from the third party that, if he wants more 
specific information in order to have a better understanding of 
Quebec and its representatives, I would be pleased to provide it, 
because, unfortunately, I have run out of time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
share my time with the hon. member for-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, I believe I was 
asked a question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Sorry, the time has 
expired. I asked him to take 30 seconds. Please go ahead very 
briefly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, I would suspect that the member, 
along with many of the old line parties, sees the military as a make 
work project. We do not.
<P>
	Second, I was not referring to surplus purchases. What I was 
referring to was that there was current active military equipment 
based in Quebec that under the Bloc Quebecois, under the 
separatists, would have ended up,  as far as they were concerned, 
under 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16608"> 16608 </A></B>
<P>
their control in the event the vote had gone the other way. I do not 
think Canadians see that as being rational or reasonable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola: </B>Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with 
my colleague, the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood.
<P>
	I am very pleased to take part in this debate, because I finally 
have the opportunity to set the record straight.
<P>
	The Canadian space program, which has been running for 35 
years already, has allowed Canada to carve out an enviable position 
among developed countries. Canadians have reaped benefits from 
it that have improved their quality of life, if only in terms of 
satellite communications.
<P>
	It is with much pride that I point out the excellent work of the 
Canadian Space Agency, one of the most prestigious federal 
institutions which now has its headquarters firmly established in 
Saint-Hubert, near Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	As a member of the government, I am proud to be associated 
with this success and to have been part of the agency's 
accomplishments since my arrival in the House.
<P>
	The construction of its headquarters in Saint-Hubert, an 
investment of almost $80 million, has created, either directly or 
indirectly, almost 1,000 person-years. According to studies that 
were done to quantify the economic spinoffs of having the agency 
in Saint-Hubert, it is estimated that it has injected about $75 
million into the Quebec economy annually, both in terms of 
salaries and the purchase of products and services.
<P>
	These are the figures, but one of the main economic benefits of 
having the agency in Quebec is its impact on that province's 
industrial base. Here are some concrete examples: the development 
of new cutting-edge technologies in strategic sectors such as 
communications and data processing software; the international 
reputation consolidating Montreal's status as a global player; and 
the establishment in Saint-Hubert of other space facilities such as 
the RADARSAT ground control station, the control centre for the 
mobile servicing system and the astronaut and international space 
station operator training system.
<P>
	One of the main social advantages is the training of the hundred 
or so students who come every year to specialize in high-tech areas.
<P>
	Since 1988, Quebec has received over 35 per cent of the total 
budget of the Canadian space program, which means that $540 
million worth of contracts are awarded to Quebec-based 
companies. Quebecers are among the main beneficiaries of the 
Canadian space program.
<P>
	Spar Aerospace alone, which is located in 
Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue in my riding, has received a significant 
portion of the contracts for the production of MSAT and 
RADARSAT satellites, which testifies to the excellence of Quebec 
engineers. RADARSAT, which was launched into orbit on 
November 4, is the result of more than 15 years of co-operation and 
political will. RADARSAT also ushers in a new global industry. 
The resulting global trade will contribute to the development of a 
new natural resources management and environmental monitoring 
business. And it is mainly in Quebec that this great project has 
materialized.
<P>
	And that is not all. At present, a feasibility study is under way to 
gather all that is required to implement Phase II of RADARSAT. 
But what must be pointed out here is the participation of a new 
player, namely SNC-Lavalin, whose reputation as the world leader 
in large scale project management is firmly established.
<P>
	The Canadian Space Program also promoted the diversification 
of several Quebec businesses, which have gained a world-wide 
reputation of excellence. Take these four for example: CAE 
Electronics, of Ville-Saint-Laurent, with contracts totalling $90 
million; MPB Technologies, of Montreal, whose contracts are 
worth in excess of $16 million; FRE Composites, of Saint-André, 
with a total contract worth of $11 million; and BONEM, of Quebec 
City, with contracts totalling $4 million.
<P>
	The need to adjust to new realities brought about by market 
globalization and by the growing importance of a knowledge-based 
economy represents a major challenge. In this context, it is 
important that we be able to define new partnerships between 
learning institutions and industry. Like the other provinces, Quebec 
has displayed impeccable leadership. Fifteen years ago, there were 
no university programs to prepare for the future in high-technology 
sectors. Through an initiative of the Centre d'adaptation de la 
main-d'oeuvre aérospatiale du Québec, post-graduate programs 
meeting international standards were developed.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Today, a particularly innovative university-industry partnership 
has resulted in a master's degree in aerospace engineering being 
offered in five Quebec universities. This training strategy is 
proving to be very effective in enabling Quebec to keep playing a 
lead role in the space industry.
<P>
	To invest in the space industry is to invest in our children. This 
vision born 35 years ago had not died; it keeps making Quebecers 
and all Canadians prouder and prouder.

	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a short question. Since it 
is almost two o'clock, I would prefer to begin my remarks after 
question period.
<P>
	I would like to build on the member for Vaudreuil's point. He 
alluded to the notion of creating this infrastructure, which 
ultimately leads to exports. This is the point I was trying to make 
earlier to the member for Kootenay East when I asked the member 
of the Reform Party if he did not see the investment that was made 
in the automotive industry from the auto pact until the free trade 
agreement. Under the free trade agreement we do not have the 
same options of opportunity to invest in that industry, but thank 
goodness it has a great foundation now: the auto pact leads, in 
terms of job creation and exports, any sector in our country.
<P>
	The point I was trying to make to the Reform Party is this 
infrastructure we have invested in within the province of Quebec in 
the aerospace industry now leads to tremendous exports not only in 
terms of military hardware, helicopters, et cetera, but also aircraft 
like the Canadair commuter jet, which is now being exported all 
over the world, creating jobs not only within the province of 
Quebec but across the country.
<P>
	Could the member for Vaudreuil confirm for the House that the 
investments the Liberal government has made in the aerospace 
industry are now leading to all kinds of exports around the world, 
which ultimately means jobs for Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, like the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood, I am proud that the commitment by our 
government has always been to promote the industry and sustain 
the industry.
<P>
	I am hearing from the industry that it is not after handouts. It 
really wants to be on a level playing field on an international scale. 
If we take a look at the successes in the aerospace industry, a major 
beneficiary of which is the region of Montreal, we would not have 
to look very closely to see the success of Canadair, the success of 
SNC-Lavalin, Bombardier, and recently the joint partnership that 
Pratt &amp; Whitney announced with Russia.
<P>
	If we are to allow this industry to promote itself and to grow, we 
have to give it the level playing field and the tools necessary for it 
to compete on a world scale.

	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this year the Canadian National Institute for the Blind 
dedicated its annual review to the more than 20,000 people from 
across Canada who work as CNIB volunteers.
<P>
	Volunteers work at all levels of the organization, from national 
policy development to fundraising to the support of core services. 
They enable the CNIB to do much more than would otherwise be 
possible, transforming each $5 donation into an estimated $100 of 
impact for clients.
<P>
	The CNIB values its volunteers because the imagination, 
experience, purpose and insight they willingly provide would be 
difficult to buy at any price. Without volunteers its work would be 
unthinkable.

	I am sure all members join me in recognizing and thanking those 
Canadians who give so generously of their time and energy in

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week I drove 3,300 kilometres around Beaver River conducting my 
fall tour. I talked to hundreds of people at town hall meetings, 
school classrooms and in my office.
<P>
	People are concerned about the government's bills on MP 
pensions, employment equity, gun control and so on. The thing 
they asked more questions about rather than anything else was the 
referendum. Everybody in the meeting asked now what.
<P>
	This morning we find out that now what means another 
referendum. People at home recognize the distinctiveness of 
Quebec with regard to language, culture and civil law. Because the 
term distinct society is undefined they think it would be a lawyer's 
delight to see it enshrined in the Constitution as it would be wide 
open to

interpretation. I even had a Liberal supporter ask me  what part of 
no the Liberals did not understand in the Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	We must move forward to the new Canada, not backward to 
failed ideas and plans. They did not work. They are not working

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
overall reductions to benefits paid to recipients of unemployment 
insurance are adding to the welfare rolls of many provinces 
including Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The cumulative impact of the cuts to the unemployment 
insurance program has been the addition of over 15,000 persons to 
the Saskatchewan assistance plan caseload at a cost of $63 million. 
In addition to the UI reductions, the Liberal government transferred 
responsibility for providing assistance to off reserve status Indians, 
adding another 10,000 people to the welfare roles at a cost of $38 
million. In Saskatchewan, UI payments decreased by over 25 per 
cent from $410 million in 1992-93 to $300 million in 1994-95.
<P>
	The Liberal government was elected on a platform of providing 
jobs. Instead it has thrown more workers on to welfare roles in 
Saskatchewan than ever before, adding to the burden of 
Saskatchewan taxpayers.
<P>
	Canadians get angry when the unemployed are forced to live on 
welfare while in Ottawa a Liberal MP receives a free new suit 
simply for getting off his chair.

congratulations to Chris Hadfield on his voyage in space and best

at school in Lakefield, sister Pat Bowlar in Norwood and Aunt 
Caroline Kitchen in Peterborough.
<P>
	A Canadian has now operated our Canadarm in space and it will 
be the prototype for a giant space crane. Next year Marc Garneau, 
one of our most distinguished astronauts, will be returning to 
space. He will be followed by yet another Canadian astronaut: three 
Canadians in space within a year and a half.
<P>
	The astronaut program is one of the most successful features of 
the Canadian Space Agency which is based in Montreal but which 
has a nationwide science and technology network. Our astronauts 
have inspired students from kindergarten to Ph.D. III. They have 
had a healthy effect on all science and technology in Canada.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="OFFICIALLANGUAGES">OFFICIAL LANGUAGES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, ten years ago, 
Ontario recognized French as one of its two official languages 
before the courts. The province has since passed several provisions 
which have made it increasingly bilingual in the judicial field. In 
fact, a case can now be heard in French at any level of the 
provincial legal system, including that of the appeal court.
<P>
	The Association des juristes d'expression française, which held 
its convention in Ottawa this past weekend, has always been at the 
forefront of the movement to improve our bilingual judicial 
system. This is a complex and difficult task, and I want to 
congratulate the association for its dedication and its determination 
in overcoming any obstacle to that very important goal.
<P>
	The program benefits all Ontarians. It also shows that, in North 
America, the French language and culture have a much better 
chance of being preserved, and even expanding, in a bilingual 
Canada than in separate states.

some of us may be against certain provisions, but all members of 
Parliament would agree that the voice of the people of Quebec and 
of Canada has been heard on this issue, in this House.
<P>
	The debates lasted a long time and several witnesses came to 
express their concerns. The federal government rejected most of 
the amendments put forward by the witnesses who appeared before 
the committee, and the Liberal members rejected the amendments 
proposed by the official opposition members.
<P>
	However, Bill C-68 concerning the firearms was passed by hon. 
members who were democratically elected by their constituents. 
Respect for our democratic values should, in itself, prevent 
senators from opposing this legislation. Whether they are Liberal 
or Conservative, these senators do not speak for the people, they 
only speak for themselves.

to special interest groups, grants for multiculturalism and official

commend Canada's major banks for their corporate citizenship in 
establishing a banking industry ombudsman. This will strengthen 
procedures for handling complaints from small business when the 
operation begins on April 1, 1996. Certainly the framework is 
welcome news to the small business community that has often 
voiced its frustration in dealing with lending institutions.
<P>
	In addition they have announced the appointment of their own 
internal ombudsman. I know that Mr. Al Horton who resides in my 
riding has accepted the challenge involved in becoming the first 
ombudsman for the Bank of Montreal.
<P>
	Canadians should know that expenses to operate the system will 
be borne by the banks and not by the taxpayers. The new 
framework will benefit the small business community, a sector that 
is vital to the Canadian economy and to job creation in Canada.

go from Halifax International Airport to some 20 destinations in 
Europe through Reykajavik. We in Halifax West and in Nova

month is in October of each year. It has come and gone, but the 
challenge to assist those afflicted remains with us.
<P>
	Over 10,000 Canadians are diagnosed each year with a brain 
tumour. A cause or cure has yet to be found for this devastating 
disease. The key to successful treatment of a tumour is early 
diagnosis which is only possible if people become aware of the 
signs and symptoms of the tumour. Researchers are constantly 
opening new doors to the possible causes.
<P>
	The mission statement of the Brain Tumour Foundation of 
Canada is to fund brain tumour research, provide patient and

have been able to fill their pockets at will. Shame on the Liberal 
government for not fully correcting an injustice by removing these 
benefits retroactively.

Edward Island and the rest of Atlantic Canada. The statement 
yesterday by the member for Vegreville oozed with contempt not 
only for local politicians but for the people themselves.
<P>
	This patronizing, condescending attitude comes from a party 
whose solution for the problems of Atlantic Canada is simply to 
move people out. It comes from a party which opposes any form of 
regional development funding for Atlantic Canada. It comes from a 
party which espouses the belief that the only Canadians who 
deserve full health care are those who can afford it. It comes from a 
party which would replace the development of self-reliance in 
strong communities by an individually oriented survival of the 
fittest type society.

regional development in Quebec.
<P>
	Yesterday, it was announced that CP Rail's head office in 
Montreal will be closed and relocated to Calgary, leading to the 
loss of 710 jobs in Montreal. CP Rail justifies its decision by 
saying that an increasingly large portion of its activity is centred on 
the western provinces. Ottawa's policies have always supported 
western railway development at great cost, while encouraging rail 
cutbacks in the east.
<P>
	Does the minister acknowledge that CP Rail's move to the west 
is the result of the discriminatory policies that have always been 
practiced by the federal government with respect to rail 
transportation?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is always regrettable when there 
are layoffs in any sector. I know how difficult job losses are for any 
community. However, this was a decision made by a private 
corporation whose board of directors had to take into account their 
competitive situation not only in Canada but in North America.
<P>
	This decision made by CP affects a number of people across the 
country, including a 28 per cent change in Toronto, a 20 per cent 
change in Vancouver, and also a change in Montreal.
<P>
	On the broader question of what is this government doing to 
ensure that we have a competitive, affordable transportation system 
in this country, the member will know, because he is a member of 
the Standing Committee on Transport, that we are determined to 
ensure that we have a competitive, affordable railroad industry so 
that our shippers and our customers can be well served and we can 
continue to create jobs in the export market.

what does the minister responsible for regional development plan 
to do to compensate for the loss of 710 jobs as a result of the CP 
Rail move to Calgary?

assistance to small and medium business provided by this

pharmaceutical industry, if one looks at the assistance to the 
aeronautical industry located in Montreal, it is very clear that the 
federal government has the well-being of Montrealers at heart.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after thousands of jobs were lost as a result of a decision 
by CN to streamline its operations, a decision that severely affected 
Montreal, this city now faces a decision by CP Rail to move its 
headquarters.
<P>
	Since the federal government is responsible for a shift in railway 
operations towards Western Canada and it has done nothing to 
contain the negative impact of downsizing by CN and the CP 
headquarters move, what excuse does the minister responsible for 
regional development have for failing to deal with the major 
economic problems that have affected Montreal in the past two 
years?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy the member has just 
mentioned CN, because this government has privatized CN, the 
largest share issue in Canadian history, and it has gone extremely 
well. Over $2.2 billion will come back to this government and this 
country by virtue of CN's privatization.
<P>
	Second, it should be noted that Bill C-101 builds on creating 
opportunities for the creation of short line railroads in Quebec and 
throughout the country, creating jobs, creating businesses. That is 
what the government is committed to doing, creating jobs and 
opportunities across the country.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the inference is that a member from Ontario is looking 
after regional development in Quebec.
<P>
	This government claims to take care of the real problems of 
Canadians. Well, the minister responsible for regional development 
identified Montreal's real problems back in June 1992. He then 
referred to innovative policies for defence conversion and a general 
upgrading of the industrial infrastructure.
<P>
	Since he has done nothing to stop unemployment in Montreal 
and has in fact done the exact opposite, why does he not implement 
a program for the economic renewal of Montreal, as he suggested 
in 1992?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in the past year 
66,000 new jobs were created in Quebec. These new jobs were 
created thanks to this government's policies.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to the national infrastructures 
program. This program has helped to create hundreds and 
thousands of jobs in Quebec. The  Bank of Canada's monetary 
policy has helped

to bring interest rates down. The Canadian government's tax policy 
has helped to reduce the deficit-meanwhile, the Quebec

look forward to. I am very proud of our record.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition has decided to depart this 
chamber for Quebec City. He is going to prepare for one last 
attempt to take Quebec out of the federation.
<P>
	The task in this chamber is to prepare the case for federalism and 
to do so with a clarity and a vision that was completely missing 
from the last referendum campaign. In the dying days of that 
campaign, the Prime Minister belatedly promised to fundamentally 
change the way the federal government operates. He promised 
quick action.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister ready to act? What action does the Prime 
Minister propose to fundamentally change the way federalism 
operates so as to strengthen the case for federalism like it has never 
been strengthened before?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we said there were to be some changes and we will 
proceed with some changes.
<P>
	For example, we started more than a year ago signing 
agreements with nine provincial governments to eliminate the 
duplication that is mentioned on this side of the House and the 
other side of the House. We hope we will be able to do the same 
thing with the new government in Quebec so there will be less 
duplication.
<P>
	We will look at what can be done in terms of making the 
federation work better, but I do not believe that dismantling the 
federal government will solve the problem. We need a strong 
federal government that has an active presence in all parts of 
Canada and in Quebec. That would solve the problem. It is not by 
dismantling Canada to make a community of ten communities that 
we will succeed, as is the proposition of the leader of the third 
party.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, no one has argued in favour of dismantling the federation. 
This is typical of so much debate in the Chamber. No one debates 
anyone's real position. The position is moved off to the extreme 
and they debate the extreme, not the real position.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that 60 per cent of Canadians outside 
Quebec and 80 per cent of people in Quebec want some change in 
the alignment of powers between  the federal and provincial 
governments. They want control over natural resources, social 
services, language and culture to be in the hands of the government 
closest to them, and that is not the federal government.
<P>
	When is the government going to do something practical and 
concrete in response to this desire for change and a realignment of 
the powers between the federal and provincial governments? This 
is not dismantling; it is realignment.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is value to having a federal government. For 
example, on this side of the House we are strongly in favour of a 
medicare system that is equal for all citizens in every part of 
Canada. It is not only the desire of the people of Alberta, B.C., and 
Ontario; the people of Quebec want free medicare through which 
all Canadian citizens and all citizens of Quebec can be admitted to 
the hospital not because they have money but because they are 
citizens.
<P>
	When the leader of the third party talks about dismantling the 
five conditions of medicare, he is on the way to dismantling the 
country.
<P>
	When we were fighting to keep Canada together, it was not very 
useful for the leader of the third party to talk about the 
Constitution. That was the time to talk about national unity and 
jobs for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the weakness of the Prime Minister's answer profoundly 
disappoints.
<P>
	We were looking for action and all we got from the government 
was a committee. We were looking for statesmanship at a time of 
national crisis and all we got was political cheap shots. We are 
looking for strength and all we get is tired old answers and 
weakness.
<P>
	The Prime Minister makes a profound mistake by interpreting 
the demand for decentralization in Quebec or anywhere else as the 
dismantling of federal programs.
<P>
	When is the federal government going to propose some major 
change in the alignment between the powers of the federal and 
provincial governments?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are working every day to make the federation more 
efficient. But I am not working from the basis that we have to 
destroy the federal government to be successful. We believe there 
should be a resolution that is a two-way street, not a one-way street 
of devolution.
<P>
	It has always been my position that there are some things the 
federal government should do for the good of all Canadians. That is 
exactly what we are trying to do.
<P>
	The leader of the third party is always talking in terms of 
weakening the central government. If we do that, at the end of the 
road we will not have Canada any more. We are fighting to keep 
Canada united.

	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister responsible for regional development in 
Quebec.
<P>
	In his report tabled today in the House, the auditor general casts 
doubt on the ability of the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec to create sustainable jobs and revenues. In 
Quebec alone, since 1988 FORD-Q has spent $1.15 billion on 
businesses and organizations without first verifying their financial 
viability. Of 11 businesses examined, five had to close their doors 
before receiving the final government subsidy payment.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	How does the minister explain that, in the midst of a public 
financial crisis, FORD-Q is incapable of awarding federal funding 
more judiciously? Why is it taking so long to put a stop to this 
endless wasting of taxpayers' money?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, just in the years the 
member mentioned-between 1988 and 1994-, the Federal Office 
of Regional Development-Quebec committed $1.1 billion. This 
commitment generated investments of $6.4 billion in over 4,000 
projects in Quebec. This is job creation, and we are proud of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the auditor 
general indicates that program overlap in regional development is a 
source of waste, as we all know, and that FORD-Q had no influence 
on the policies of other federal governments.
<P>
	Will the minister finally understand that the federal government 
must get out of this area of jurisdiction and transfer the funds to the 
provinces, which are in a better position to act, in any case?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the report the 
hon. member is reading is different from the one I have.
<P>
	First, I would point out to the member that most of the criticism 
of FORD-Q applies to the 1980s. Things have changed since then. 
That is, the programs of the 1980s cannot perhaps be adapted to the 
1990s. This is why FORD-Q completely changed its programming 
in order to create an SMB access centre, which has led to hugely 
successful SMBs.
<P>
	I would like to quote from the auditor general's report: ``The 
development of the new programming framework is the result of 
strategic reflection. FORD-Q's approach is well structured. Roles 
and responsibilities  were clearly defined, and appropriate 
mechanisms put in place to ensure activity co-ordination and 
follow up. Our examination revealed-this is the auditor general 
speaking-that the department had given reasonable consideration 
to information on past activities and on its internal and external 
environments''.
<P>
	The auditor general congratulated us, and I would like to 
congratulate the department officials here today.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, reliable sources 
confirm that foreign governments are very upset about our 
SIGNET program of communication between our embassies and 
Ottawa. SIGNET is leaking. SIGNET is leaking not only our 
information but the information of our allies.
<P>
	What has the Minister of Foreign Affairs personally done to 
respond to the complaints of our allies to ensure that the secret 
information in SIGNET is kept secret?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said 
yesterday in the House, the government does not discuss security or 
intelligence matters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is the same 
answer I have been getting as I have tried to research this through 
various people. I have talked to the acting director of SIGNET and I 
have talked to security. It is our allies who are telling us to do 
something.
<P>
	In opposition the government whined about patronage, whined 
about SIGNET costing too much, whined about the $100 million 
that was being spent. Now the government risks losing not only 
international trade, it also risks losing co-operation with our allies 
and losing our reputation. What is the minister going to do to 
change this?
<P>

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister responsible for FORD-Q. In the report 
he tabled today, the auditor general points at serious flaws in the 
management of federal regional  development programs. He states, 
among other things, that since 1988, the federal government has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16616"> 16616 </A></B>
<P>
spent $4.5 billion for these programs without knowing if they have 
really helped create jobs and if they were properly spent.
<P>
	Does the minister responsible recognize that it is inadmissible to 
spend $4.5 billion, $1.15 of them in Quebec, without any clear 
creation of jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as a mater of fact, 
quite a number of jobs have been created as a result of the Federal 
Office of Regional Development's activities. I can tell you that 
whenever I visit one of the 13 FORD-Q offices in Quebec, and 
meet business people, I meet individuals who have created jobs 
thanks to the federal office's activities.
<P>
	Indeed, if there were problems with program evaluation, the 
department recognized them and this is the reason why we changed 
our programming and the way we operate. I do accept the 
member's congratulations on our new programming.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously, 
the minister of finance is skating around the issue, but the auditor 
general was very clear. Since the auditor general has pointed out 
that FORD-Q's methods for evaluating program spinoffs are 
flawed, does the minister intend to take corrective actions so that 
taxpayers may have a clear and correct idea of reality?

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	His minister of agriculture was to release the final report of the 
Canada-U.S. Commission on Grains two and a half months ago on 
September 11. The minister of agriculture is rivalling the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Human Resources Development in the 
do nothing department.
<P>
	My question stems from his promises to launch reforms to a 
number of key agriculture areas based on numerous reports and 
studies. Can the Prime Minister tell the House why he allows his 
agriculture minister to delay the Canada-U.S. joint commission 
report, even though the commissioners who have drafted the report 
have suggested the content is complete and is similar to material 
released in the interim preliminary report?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to take this question on behalf of my colleague, 
the minister of agriculture. Let me confess that I do not have the 
kind of knowledge this question requires to give a good answer. But 
I do know that the best minister of agriculture who lives and 
breathes on the North American continent today sits to my left in 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans knows no 
bounds in his attempt to become the replacement for our current 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	One wonders if the minister's delay has more to do with the fact 
that the report will give legitimate fodder for those farmers calling 
for the reform of the Canadian Wheat Board. The minister 
indicated yesterday in the House on a plebiscite that ``this 
plebiscite was not the be all and end all of wheat and barley 
marketing''. It seems that the minister fears allowing producers the 
right to determine how they market wheat and barley.
<P>
	Does the joint commission's report contain definitions and 
content that the minister is withholding from the public's view 
because it might influence the outcome of the Alberta plebiscite on 
wheat and barley marketing toward an outcome the minister does 
not particularly want?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, even a minister of fisheries knows you cannot put the 
cart before the horse. The reality is the plebiscite results will not be 
released until December 5. The member opposite would be the first 
one to stand and complain if the minister of agriculture came to 
conclusions in advance of knowing the plebiscite results and 
finishing the consultations.
<P>

job as usual.

jobs platform has been shredded to pieces by the auditor general's

	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon.

of ideologies between this party and that party. The ideology of that

the Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans, and in particular the minister,

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am not sure about all the terms that are used in 
fisheries and oceans, but I do not think that was very nice. I would 
ask the hon. member to be a little more judicious in his words.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker. We are not 
talking about changing the structure of the Canadian fishery. We 
are talking about getting the cost of administration under control.
<P>
	The fisheries council states unequivocally that the minister's 
plans to drastically increase access fees will make Canadian 
fishermen even less competitive in world markets.
<P>
	Will the minister commit to reducing spending in his department 
by $50 million rather than saddling Canadian fishermen with 
another $50 million in new access fees which are nothing more 
than a tax?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I hope the member knows the difference between 
bilge and bunk because what he is spewing now is bunk.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am not sure I understand but I would like the 
hon. minister to get on with his answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has asked a specific 
question, will I cut the department of fisheries by $50 million? The 
answer is no. I am cutting it by $250 million.
<P>
	I want to advise the member that it is not the Fisheries Council of 
Canada that speaks for the fishermen, it is the Harvesters Council. 
We met them last Monday and the member should try doing the 
same. Talk to a few fishermen once in a while.

	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	Would the minister say whether the CPR consulted with or 
advised the government before cutting 700 jobs in Montreal 
yesterday and shifting its headquarters to Calgary? If so, what 
reasons were given? Does the government have a plan to deal with 
this additional loss of quality jobs in the Montreal area?
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as the hon. member knows, the decision by CP Rail was one taken 
by a private company. I have no knowledge of nor reason to believe 
that the company or any of its directors either consulted or gave 
information to the government in advance of that decision.
<P>
	I point out that it is always regrettable when jobs are lost in any 
community. However, if we are going to address the ability of the 
private sector throughout Canada to create jobs we are going to 
need to do it in a way that enhances and enables the private sector 
to invest and thereby stimulate growth and jobs.
<P>
	It would seem to me that it would be very advantageous for the 
city of Montreal if the kind of co-operation that was offered by the 
Government of Quebec was such that companies potentially 
investing or staying in Quebec could feel that they were doing so in 
an atmosphere of political stability and where they could have 
confidence in seeing their investments grow and improve.

question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	There will be serious budget cuts in 1995-96 and 1996-97 for the 
research funding councils. For instance, the Natural Sciences and 
Engineering Research Council budget for that period will be cut by 
$142.3 million.
<P>
	Is the minister aware that cutting assistance to research carried 
out outside federal laboratories will penalize Quebec most heavily, 
because this is the type of federal merit-based research funding in 
which Quebec receives a fair share?
<P>

to which he referred, are taken impartially with reviewers from 
across Canada in a way that is fair and recognizes excellence.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that from the point of view of Quebec, 
Quebec scientists and researchers are doing very well 
competitively and, from the granting councils in general, they 
receive their fair share and often very much more than that. It is a 
good compliment to Quebec, under the circumstances, with the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of

in response to the hon. member for The  Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake and the point of order he raised this morning about the 
government's lack of response to a report of the Standing 
Committee on the Environment, I understand that the report of the 
committee was a very lengthy one and involved 141 
recommendations for change to the Environmental Protection Act. 
That act is currently under review in light of the committee's 
recommendations.
<P>
	The government is preparing a response, but because of the 
length of the report and the very complete report that was tabled by 
the committee, it was unable to be completed for today. It is 
anticipated that a response should be forthcoming within the next 
couple of weeks.
<P>
	I realize that the standing order requires tabling of a report 
within a limited time, but rather than table a short or incomplete 
report, which would not have answered all the committee's 
concerns, the government chose to take extra time to do this. I 
regret that this fact was not communicated to the House in advance 
to warn hon. members so that the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake would not be in the position of asking 
for this today.
<P>
	I assure the House that the government will proceed with the 
matter with dispatch. I hope I will be in a position to have the 
Minister of the Environment here shortly, within a few weeks, to 
table the government's response to this report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just a short response. First, I thank the hon. member 
for his quick return with an answer to this very important question. 
I appreciate the time he has taken today to bring the government's 
response timetable to the attention of the House.
<P>
	I wish to remind you, Mr. Speaker, that the previous Speaker's 
ruling on a matter like this did indicate that it was disheartening 
when a government missed a deadline.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	The government committee that had studied this issue 
previously said: ``If a document cannot be tabled within the 
prescribed time, the responsible minister should advise the House 
accordingly before the deadline. It is not acceptable that a deadline 
is ignored''.
<P>
	It should be very clear in the House that when the rules of the 
House are put in place to aid and assist members of Parliament in 
doing their jobs, the government has a responsibility to uphold 
those rules. I believe very strongly that something has to be said to 
the government and the minister responsible in this regard.
<P>
	The deadline was missed. The government had an obligation to 
come to the House prior to the deadline being missed. It is 
unacceptable for them to have missed this deadline.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I think the point of order is well taken. I think the 
hon. parliamentary secretary has given a  response and a 
commitment to the House that the information will be forthcoming 
within the next few weeks.
<P>
	I concur that the rules of the House should be adhered to and it is 
regrettable when they are not. I hope that the explanation that was 
given by the hon. parliamentary secretary to the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake at least in this particular case will 
satisfy him.
<P>
	The House has heard the commitment taken by the 
parliamentary secretary. If that is acceptable to the House, I will 
not rule on the point of order because it seems to have been 
resolved at this point.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate having the opportunity 
to share time with my colleague, the member for Vaudreuil, on this 
Bloc Quebecois opposition day motion.
<P>
	It is important to go over the words of this motion presented to 
the House by the Bloc. They are condemning the government for 
having dropped the Canadian content requirements in the contracts 
for the purchase of military equipment and refusing to set up a 
genuine program for the conversion of the military industry, thus 
endangering the Canadian aerospace industry located in Montreal.
<P>
	It is important for all Canadians to know, and specifically 
Canadians from Quebec, people from Quebec who still believe in 
Canada, and even the separatists for that matter, that it was a 
Liberal government that basically set up the foundation of the 
aerospace industry in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	We only have to go back to when the current Prime Minister was 
the minister of industry in 1977. As the Minister of Industry, Trade 
and Commerce, he was the one who bought the rights for the 
Canadair Challenger jet. That Canadair Challenger jet, which 
started out as an executive jet, as we all know today is probably one 
of the best commuter jets manufactured in the world. That industry 
is alive and well in the province of Quebec, which is part of the 
Bombardier Corporation.
<P>
	We just need to go back to 1980-81, when the then Liberal 
government under the direction and leadership of Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau made a multi-billion dollar purchase of the F-18A fighter 
aircraft and 80 per cent of the offsets in that fighter aircraft were 
basically let out to the aerospace industry in Montreal.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16622"> 16622 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	The history of and the commitment of the Liberal government to 
the aerospace industry in the province of Quebec are well laid out. 
There is a great commitment and there is great history. For the Bloc 
Quebecois to suggest that we as a government are not committed to 
supporting this industry is simply incorrect.
<P>
	In the motion the Bloc Quebecois is saying that the government 
dropped the Canadian content requirements. It is forgetting what 
happened when many members of the government were in 
opposition.
<P>
	I would like to return to the free trade agreement. The leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois supported the free trade agreement. Many of us 
on this side of the House opposed the free trade agreement. One of 
the reasons we opposed the free trade agreement was chapter 14, 
which essentially gave people offshore unfettered access to and 
unlimited control over the Canadian industry. As part of that 
agreement, we now are prohibited from dictating Canadian content.
<P>
	We have to remind the members of the Bloc Quebecois that they 
cannot suck and blow at the same time. It is not possible. They 
cannot stand up in the House to support the free trade agreement, 
which essentially gives up our ability to dictate Canadian content, 
and then come back three years later and condemn the government 
for having dropped the Canadian content requirements. That is the 
motion we have before us today.
<P>
	The members of the Bloc Quebecois opposed the notion of 
having control over Canadian content three years ago, and they are 
regretting it today. It was the Liberal Party that opposed the free 
trade agreement as it was negotiated by the previous government.
<P>
	I have always believed that the auto pact was an example of a 
negotiated trade agreement in which we could enshrine our 
interests and our ability to ensure Canadian content. That was a 
unique feature of the auto pact. However, we gave up the 
opportunity to negotiate a similar agreement for the aerospace 
industry.
<P>
	It is very important for us to let Quebecers know that the Liberal 
government is not opposed to the aerospace industry in Quebec 
being a vibrant and healthy sector. The Liberal government will not 
do anything to hurt the industry. If anything, we are going out of 
our way to help it.
<P>
	The question that was brought up by some Bloc Quebecois 
members this morning is what is Quebec's fair share. The Canadian 
space station is based in the province of Quebec. That is one of the 
premier institutes of the industry. The commuter jet of Canadair is 
being manufactured in Quebec. The maintenance of the F-18A, our 
fighter aircraft, is being done in Quebec today. As a Toronto 
member, an Ontario member, I have absolutely no difficulty with 
that. It is a good move. By building a  critical mass of expertise in 
the province of Quebec in the aerospace industry we create a 
capacity to bid on some available subcontracts, prime military 
contracts available throughout the world.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	In other words, we obviously do not have the capacity to build 
total military aircraft or total products in an off the shelf sense. 
However, because of the component specialization that exists 
within the aerospace industry in the province of Quebec, we can bid 
on some component parts with any of the prime manufacturers not 
only in the United States but anywhere in the world.
<P>
	It is very important to make sure our fellow Canadians realize 
this avenue of opportunity is available for people in the aerospace 
industry in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	It is true that in the past we were much more aggressive in 
dictating Canadian content. However, because of the ability to 
make a quality product at a competitive price, there is probably a 
lot more opportunity in the aerospace industry in the province of 
Quebec than Bloc members are giving it credit for.
<P>
	As part of the new defence industry conversion program we are 
trying to say to those people in the aerospace industry that although 
we no longer give direct grants we will make sure we give them 
marketing support. If they have a quality product in that sector at a 
competitive price-and we certainly have an advantage because of 
our Canadian dollar-then the secret would be centred in the whole 
area of marketing. We have to market the aerospace industry in the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
	Rather than stand in the House today and cast doubt on the 
ability of the aerospace industry to compete, we should be boasting 
about the quality products made in the aerospace industry in the 
province of Quebec and figuring out ways of doing things together.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I regret to inform the member that his time has 
expired, but we have time for questions and comments if there are 
any.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on this 
opposition day, the debate is on a subject chosen by the Bloc 
Quebecois, and I must say I have always had a special interest in 
national defence.
<P>
	There are a number of reasons why that is so, the main one being 
that in my riding, we have an important entity that reports to the 
Department of National Defence and I am, of course, referring to 
the Bagotville Base.
<P>
	The base is a major employer in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean 
area. Bagotville provides employment for more than 1,250 military 
personnel and 280 civilians.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16623"> 16623 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	That alone makes it a major economic asset to a region that, need 
I say it again, has the highest unemployment rate in Canada.
<P>
	I am sure that the same could be said of other regions in Canada, 
since there are always substantial economic spinoffs for a region 
where a base is located. Many small industries gravitate around the 
base itself and have often developed expertise in the defence 
industry.
<P>
	Cutting or downsizing at that level does not only affect National 
Defence as such, it also affects small businesses in the vicinity. 
There is cause for alarm when the federal government decides to 
close part or all of its military infrastructures, since residents then 
have to adjust their lives accordingly.
<P>
	On February 22, 1994, the Minister of National Defence in this 
government sent me the following letter, and I will read two 
extracts: ``I regret to announce that the project to develop an air to 
ground weapons range for CFB Bagotville in your riding has been 
cancelled''.
<P>
	The most important part of the letter is this: ``Although we 
considered the importance of maintaining the balance of economic 
and regional benefits, the decisive factor in making these difficult 
decisions is as follows: they must be based on military and 
economic considerations''.
<P>
	The letter says: ``National Defence will work closely with other 
departments and regional development agencies that will help 
communities plan for the future''.
<P>
	You may recall that subsequently, on July 10, 1995, the Minister 
of National Defence replied as follows: ``There are plans to cut 305 
military and 15 civilian positions in the 3rd Squadron at CFB 
Bagotville. However, this information is only an estimate and 
further changes may be made subsequently''. That probably means 
additional cuts.
<P>
	What surprises me is that following these cutbacks, the 
Department of National Defence says it will work in close 
co-operation with other government agencies to help these 
communities plan their future. Well, despite the cuts in my area, we 
have not seen and I have not sensed any willingness on the part of 
other departments to get involved to deal with certain situations. 
Certainly not. And of course a number of bills have been tabled in 
the House, starting with the bill to establish the Department of 
Human Resources Development, the department that is closing 
employment centres. Employment centres are being closed while 
the unemployment rate goes up.
<P>
	We also have trouble retraining or providing new kinds of 
training for people who have been laid off, and I am talking about 
both the military and civilians.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	We must face the federal government's new choices. I think that 
the government has forgotten that the economic development of 
many communities is based on defence. When the federal 
government decides to leave a region or change its equipment, it 
should act a little more responsibly.
<P>
	In the area of defence, a so-called responsible government 
should focus on conversion. As my Bloc colleague said earlier, the 
aerospace industry is one of the areas best suited for conversion. 
Yet, it seems that this sector remains one of the most fragile in 
Canada, at a time when several other countries have opted for 
conversion.
<P>
	The governments of all countries with significant aerospace 
industries actively support this sector. One only has to think of 
companies like General Dynamics in the U.S., which grew because 
it received defence contracts from the U.S. government. The 
governments of all these countries put in place major conversion 
programs.
<P>
	We, in Quebec, have expertise allowing us to believe in this 
reality. We have engineering firms, architectural firms, trained 
technicians who are ready to face these new challenges. In most 
cases, the federal government's policy on projects requiring new 
infrastructures is to go ahead without calling for tenders.
<P>
	I am going to tell you something. Last week, the commander of 
CFB Bagotville and I inaugurated a $2.8 million arena in my 
riding. When this project was on the table, architectural and 
engineering firms from outside Quebec were invited to prepare 
plans and specifications, when we, in the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, have construction firms that 
can build massive dams like the James Bay project. Yet, they are 
incapable of building a small arena for some 200 to 300 people, an 
arena which has, of course, become very important for the military. 
It is very important.
<P>
	The question is not whether or not to have an arena, but rather 
who will be the builders, architects and engineers involved. After 
running around here, there and everywhere in various departments, 
I managed to obtain that a firm from our area would at least be 
allowed to submit a bit. Finally. Many thanks to the government 
employee who told me: ``All right, Mr. Fillion, CEGERGO will be 
invited to bid for building the arena''.
<P>
	It was not a matter of favouring this particular firm over another, 
but a matter of placing this firm on an equal footing, to at least give 
the chance to a firm that is paying taxes to Canada and employing 
hundreds of people to bid on an arena project.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16624"> 16624 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The defence department, through its construction engineering 
branch or what not, said the firm would be allowed to bid because it 
had done some work in James Bay and built a 20-storey building in 
Montreal. I guess they felt it had some credibility, so they decided 
to accept it as a contender. Would you believe that the contract, a 
turnkey contract, was eventually awarded to this very firm, 
CEGERGO. Turnkey means that everything was run from the 
office, using expertise from my region.
<P>
	By going to tender, we give our regions a chance to develop. In 
contracting however, it is important that everyone be given a 
chance to compete. I am sure that we end up saving money this 
way.
<P>
	In the United States, between $4 billion and $6 billion is 
allocated to conversion assistance in the Clinton plan. Of course, 
their population is larger. In Europe also larger sums are invested in 
this area. When you make an effort to look around and see what is 
going on outside of Canada, you realize that, more and more, 
Canada's track record as far as its aerospace industry is concerned 
is not great.
<P>
	In Canada, funding for programs designed to help the Canadian 
defence industry was steadily cut year after year. We are told that a 
great deal of streamlining is happening in terms of cuts to defence 
spending, but at the same time people are left jobless. That is not 
important. It is not important that, at some point, communities find 
themselves in bad shape. However, they do not realize that, even 
though cuts are being made in the defence budget, as well as in 
other departments, Canadians have an increasingly heavier tax 
burden. Try to make some sense out of that.
<P>
	In the late 1980's, the budget was somewhere around $300 
million. This year, in 1995-96, it is only $102 million and it is 
constantly diminishing. The government does not care at all about 
those who relied on the defence industry. As you know, the 
aerospace industry plays a vital role in Quebec's economy. That is a 
reality which we repeatedly stressed in this House. That industry is 
important for many Quebecers, since the salaries paid in that sector 
are quite good.
<P>
	In 1993, close to 20,000 Quebecers worked in the aerospace 
industry. Therefore, the federal government should increase its 
research assistance in that field. In addition to increasing the 
budgets allocated for research and development, Canada should 
change its defence procurement policy regarding goods and 
services as quickly as possible. This is all the more necessary, 
given that the new policy no longer includes Canadian content 
requirements, thereby jeopardizing the development, around each 
and every base, of companies which have developed such 
expertise.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Given the federal government's lack of action, these companies 
are forced to compete with foreign businesses, most of which are 
heavily subsidized by their respective governments. This creates a 
double standard. It is very difficult to be competitive when the 
federal government reduces its subsidies. We are competitive in 
terms of design and work, but we cannot compete at an economic 
level since these foreign companies are subsidized by their 
governments. Yet, we have the expertise. We provide quality 
products and services.
<P>
	How, then, can these businesses be competitive when the same 
types of businesses elsewhere are heavily subsidized?
<P>
	I can understand the concerns of the people who have built up 
these businesses with their time and money and the sweat of their 
brows. We need not be surprised if they also have to relocate 
outside Canada in order to survive. There is no doubt whatsoever 
that if Ottawa pulls out of funding research and development a lot 
of people are going to be worried.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec will be worried as well. The Quebec 
minister of industry is committed to looking at ways his 
government might offset the federal withdrawal. The federal 
government, via the Department of National Defence, creates a 
need and then when it finds itself no longer able to foot the bill 
decides: ``Let us shift everything. The provincial government will 
have to find some solutions''.
<P>
	This is just another way of dumping responsibilities one has 
assumed off onto the provincial government, withdrawing 
gradually and leaving them to take up the slack.
<P>
	In my opinion, this is not a responsible way for the federal 
government to act. It must change its procurement policy in order 
to foster the development of leading edge industries. We must take 
a page from the book of other countries which encourage industrial 
development.
<P>
	I trust that this government will, in future, require a minimal 
Canadian content when purchasing equipment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to respond by making a comment on the hon. 
member's presentation.
<P>
	I congratulate him on coming from a great part of Canada, the 
Chicoutimi area. I know the area quite well. I used to spend parts of 
the summer there with my family staying at the Club de chasse in 
Tadoussac. I fished on Lake Tadoussac at the mouth of the 
Saguenay. It is a very beautiful part of the world.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16625"> 16625 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	With respect to the tenor of his comments, some of the things the 
member said may sound sensible and logical. Perhaps in different 
times we nurtured the idea of Canadian content when we could 
afford it. It was a luxury. I point to the St. Laurent class destroyer, 
to the DDH280 and to other acquisitions that had total Canadian 
content, with some exceptions of boiler equipment and other 
auxiliary machinery.
<P>
	All countries are cutting back. In the course of my duties as 
parliamentary secretary over the last two years I have had the 
occasion to meet with the secretary of defense if the United States, 
the minister of defence of the Federal Republic of Germany, the 
minister of defence of Holland and other defence ministers. If there 
is one thing we have in common it is that we are cutting back. 
There is a peace dividend. The cold war is over. While we are 
peacekeeping and fighting brush fires which are real wars in that 
sense, the scale is different.
<P>
	In the last decade the Department of National Defence has given 
up $21 billion and 21,000 men and women in uniform, 45 per cent 
of its civilian workforce. It has reduced the reserves from 29,000 to 
23,000 in two years. We can no longer do what we used to do and I 
did not find that factored into the equation presented by the hon. 
member.
<P>
	I know he did not intend to mislead. To talk about principles, 
theories and things that would be nice if there were no limitation on 
funding is one thing. However, if he would look at the reality of the 
situation, at the issues that dictate procurement policy in national 
defence, he might come up with a slightly different approach. I 
want to ensure the hon. member has factored that into his equation.
<P>
	It is the same with conversion. The answer to conversion is not a 
massive infusion of money. Canada cannot afford that. Let us try to 
do like other countries have done with initiatives and other ways of 
doing it, as I suggested earlier in my presentation were presented 
by the Minister of Industry and the minister of public works.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, first I think the hon. member should 
come and visit the region before it closes down. As I said earlier, 
we have a very high unemployment rate, and when you add all the 
people who are on welfare, I think the government should go down 
there and reassure these people. I would appreciate it if he came 
down for a visit. I would be delighted to have him as a guest.
<P>
	As for his comments, I must say that when they talk about 
Canadian content and they tell us that when we had a lot of money, 
we could afford Canadian content, we could give the people in our 
regions something to hope for and tell them: ``Get into those fields, 
start factories and small businesses and adjust to what is out
<P>
there''. Today, now there is nothing left, the government has 
dropped the whole thing and we let others do the job.
<P>
	If you consider all the government programs we have in this 
country, I am sure we would be able to find the money to fund 
defence conversion. There are so many programs.
<P>
	In fact, the auditor general himself said today in one of his 
reports that the Federal Office of Regional Development for 
Quebec had spent $4.5 billion without knowing where it all went 
and what it accomplished. In fact, this kind of money could be used 
for programs to help develop this defence industry.
<P>
	My point is, we should look at the various programs that exist 
today, that are poorly managed and that cost us an awful lot in 
terms of time, money, energy and interest, especially, and 
accomplish absolutely nothing. We could give these industries a 
special boost.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	In any case, if these industries are not given financial support, 
they still remain competitive in terms of the products they 
manufacture or the services they offer. And that is where the 
answer lies. Because these businesses are competitive, we can 
develop expertise, using programs that today are not accomplishing 
a thing but could be reviewed and redirected to National Defence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to join in the debate on the 
Department of National Defence and the Canadian industrial base 
as proposed by the official opposition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is the age of information, the age of rapid change. We are 
not just talking about technological change, which most of us have 
managed to keep up with over the course of the past ten years, but 
about change in the very nature of the way people relate to each 
other and the way things are done. With the fall of the Berlin wall, 
we began a period of change more radical and intense than 
anything we have known since the invention of the cold war.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am here today to speak about those changes which affect the 
relationship between DND and the defence industry and suggest a 
view of what that new relationship may look like.
<P>
	Actions in the world have caused a reaction in DND. Let me 
trace the main actions and then the DND reaction. The first action 
was the fall of the Berlin wall, which led to a reassessment of 
Canadian defence concerns.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16626"> 16626 </A></B>
<P>
	The second action is the fiscal situation in the country. We have 
a deficit and a significant debt. The negative effects of the 
situation have been made clear to all of us over the past year. 
There is now widespread agreement that this situation must be 
revised through budget cuts.
<P>
	The third action results from the need to reduce the number of 
employees in the federal public service, including DND. This 
results in a significant reduction in the workforce. All of these 
actions affect DND, resulting in changed roles, reduced budgets 
and reduced personnel.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Now let us have a look at the industry side. We can see that these 
same events-the fall of the Berlin Wall, the reduction in military 
personnel and budget cuts-have put considerable pressure on 
Canadian industry and their export markets. This is the case, 
specifically, for many of the companies involved in Canada's 
defence industrial base, which we want to be able to count on in the 
event of an emergency.
<P>
	As for DND's reaction, it does not require a whole lot of 
intelligence to realize that the department is no longer merely a 
spectator in this age of change. It is a participant and must make its 
own changes. DND must look after its affairs differently and 
change its structure if it is to succeed in this new context.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This need for change led to the defence white paper of December 
1994. In general this document reconfirmed the need for 
multi-purpose, combat capable sea, air and land forces to perform a 
wide variety of tasks at home and abroad: the protection of 
sovereignty and security; co-operation with the United States in the 
defence of North America and contributions to peace and security 
abroad.
<P>
	In addition, the white paper indicated that to accomplish these 
ends, DND would have to operate more efficiently and make 
optimum use of equipment, infrastructure and human resources 
specifically to focus on maintaining core capabilities, reduce and 
refocus regular and reserve forces and the civilian workforce, to 
reorganize the command and control systems and to purchase 
affordable equipment.
<P>
	The white paper also recognized the need for the department to 
exchange or enhance its partnership with the private sector, work 
toward harmonizing industrial and defence policies to maintain 
essential industrial capabilities, transfer activities currently 
conducted in-house to Canadian industry or to share them with 
industry under various partnerships arrangements when a business 
case of the same could be made, modernize and streamline 
procurement process and in general to seek innovative ways to 
support operational forces.
<P>
	It must not only be said of the Canadian defence industrial base 
that DND must adapt to the new circumstances but that our 
industries must also do things in a different way with a different 
structure if they hope to fulfil their corporate visions in the new 
age.
<P>
	It would be worthwhile to provide an overall context for the 
Canadian defence industry through some relevant defence 
statistics. Canadian defence spending is quite small compared with 
that of other western nations. It is about 1.5 per cent of GDP. 
Canadian defence and defence related industry accounts for little 
more than 1 per cent of the gross domestic product and somewhat 
less than 1 per cent of the Canadian labour force which equates to 
between approximately 60,000 and 80,000 direct and indirect jobs.
<P>
	With few exceptions like Bell Helicopter, CAE, the diesel 
division of General Motors, Diemaco and Saint John Shipyard Ltd., 
our industry produces subsystems, components for niche markets 
rather than complete systems. A Canadian defence industry is 
highly specialized with particular strength in the areas of 
aerospace, electronics and communications. This enables our 
industries to be well positioned in the competitive process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada's defence industry has the ability to diversify its 
activities and to come to terms with niche markets, which augers 
well for its future. As you can readily understand, Canada's 
defence expenditures alone will not support Canada's current 
defence industrial base. Our defence industry's survival and 
prosperity depends on its selling or exporting dual purpose 
commercial products.
<P>
	I would now like to talk about the factors and new realities 
governing relations between DND and the defence industry in 
Canada. It is clear, on the one hand, that our present budget 
precludes our supporting an industry base of the size we might have 
had a few years ago. Funding additional resources is totally beyond 
our present means.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our desire today is for a sound Canadian defence industrial base 
which optimizes the number of national sources of goods and 
services available to support the Canadian forces during 
operations.
<P>
	In addition, the scenario for operations today for us and our 
major allies is pretty much accepted to be ``come as you are''. 
Under these conditions, our interests are best served by supporting 
the overall health of a Canadian industrial base which includes a 
broad range of technologies and support capabilities that we need.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16627"> 16627 </A></B>
<P>
	From another aspect, DND has the responsibility to recognize 
the considerable impact which expenditures from the defence 
budget have on the Canadian economy and the Canadian industrial 
base.
<P>
	DND must smoothly integrate other factors and government 
program initiatives such as the development of dual use 
technologies, demonstration of a peace dividend, defence industry 
conversion, development of export markets and the like into its 
procurement process.
<P>
	Let me give some specific examples of our changing relations 
with industry. Although DND's budget has been reduced, the 
department remains committed to the goal of devoting a greater 
share of defence expenditures to capital acquisition.
<P>
	To maximize the return from these expenditures, the department 
will be approaching its future capital procurement based on 
principles such as the following. First, it will accelerate the shift to 
off the shelf technology and commercial specs and standards. 
Second, it will augment our reliance on the private sector in the day 
to day support of commercial items. Third, it will seek to avoid 
unique Canadian solutions that require expensive and risky 
research development or modifications. Fourth, whenever possible 
it will purchase equipment with performance which has been 
demonstrated in the field.
<P>
	As a result of the budget cuts and changes in thinking mentioned 
earlier, it is only logical that the department will have to rely to a 
much greater extent on the private sector to meet equipment 
support needs of the Canadian forces in the future.
<P>
	The trend will be government partnering with industry, that is 
government seeking solutions from industry rather than dictating 
solutions to industry. In addition, in order to allow Canadian firms 
to increase their productivity and competitiveness, DND is looking 
at how it can make doing business with government easier.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	While both DND and the industry try to maintain a sufficient 
industrial base, they are under considerable pressure and must 
adapt to a completely different defence framework in industrial 
terms. Exporting, which in the past was a way to compensate for a 
low demand from Canadian forces, has become a double-edged 
sword.
<P>
	World over-supply and competition from the former eastern 
block and Asian countries will create an increasingly competitive 
market.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As defence budgets around the world began to shrink 
significantly, there was much talk about the need to convert 
military production to civilian or commercial production. 
However, defence firms used to selling to one customer, the 
government, find themselves  ill-equipped for the commercial 
market where tastes change rapidly.
<P>
	The same problem of the conversion to the private sector market 
was faced in the United States. The problem in defence downsizing 
and conversion for the Canadian industry is much less significant 
than that in other western industrialized nations.
<P>
	As I stated previously, the Canadian defence industrial base is a 
highly diversified one. In fact, only a handful of companies make 
complete defence systems such as Oerlikon Aerospace and 
Diemaco.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	Also included in Canada's defence industry are several 
companies that make complete dual use or commercial systems for 
the global market, such as Canadair, CAE Electronics, and Bell 
Helicopter; manufacturers that are primarily oriented toward niche 
marketing and the exports of parts components and 
sub-components, such as Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada, Canadian 
Marconi, and Allied Signal; and several repair and overhaul 
contractors, such as IMP and CAE Aviation. As such, the Canadian 
industry is well placed to respond to and weather the challenges 
posed by defence downsizing.
<P>
	Spar Aerospace, for example, has reduced its defence operation 
and has increased its market diversity. At the same time, it has 
vertically and horizontally integrated its operations by acquiring an 
interest in Telesat Canada. Furthermore, it has acquired Comstream 
and prior data giving an additional technology in the area of 
satellite broadcasting and data compression as well as access to 
additional markets.
<P>
	Other companies, such as Computing Devices of Canada, have 
chosen to remain in the defence market, realizing that there are still 
many opportunities in the global defence market for competitive 
high tech companies.
<P>
	At this juncture I think it would be valuable to give an insight 
into our assessment of what the major features of the defence 
environment are likely to be. Broadly speaking, the following 
characteristics will likely dominate. First, domestic procurement 
expenditure by the Department of National Defence will not see 
any appreciable increase and will decline across the board. Second, 
the nature of what is bought and the size of the buys may change. 
This could mean a move toward non-leading edge technology in 
weapon systems and an increase in demand for repair and overhaul 
items, thereby placing greater emphasis on services. Third, there 
will be an excess capacity in the worldwide defence sector. Finally, 
competition will grow, and worldwide protectionist tendencies will 
be more difficult to maintain under the world trade agreement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16628"> 16628 </A></B>
<P>
	The preceding features will affect government and industry 
equally. However, the appropriate response to the new defence 
environment will need to take into account the complementary but 
unique role each plays.
<P>
	Let me deal with industry first. The rationalization of a North 
American defence industrial base will likely conform to the 
following scenario.
<P>
	First, there will be a gradual movement out of the defence sector, 
particularly on part of those marginal firms that only entered the 
defence business to take advantage of the increased DND 
procurement activity and for which defence sales have always been 
a marginal aspect of their sales. The pressure to exit may be offset 
to some extent by the growth in the use of dual-use technologies, 
giving rise to new marketing opportunities for the businesses.
<P>
	Second, while still searching out export markets firms that 
remain in defence sales will probably reduce still further the 
portion of their business activity devoted to defence.
<P>
	Third, there will be an increase in strategic downsizing, merger, 
and joint venture activities. We must try to reduce risks and offset 
unit cost increases. We have seen a great deal of evidence of this 
with major U.S. contractors already. Firms are selling off 
unprofitable divisions to concentrate on core expertise in particular 
systems or acquiring competitors' divisions to remove former 
competitors and emerge as centres of expertise.
<P>
	Fourth, product lines will be re-evaluated in terms of the civilian 
and military mix. Extra efforts will be made to respond where 
possible to the new demands for innovative products.
<P>
	Finally, there will be a renewed emphasis on technology based R 
and D.
<P>
	In spite of the difficult international environment that lies in 
wait, the bottom line is that the Canadian defence industry has been 
successful to a significant degree because of its outward business 
approach.
<P>
	On the government reactions, the Canadian defence industrial 
base plays an important role in meeting the peacetime and wartime 
requirements of the Canadian forces. As such, we ignore the health 
of Canadian industry at our peril. The role of the government in 
management of change in the industrial base falls into three 
categories. First is the maintenance of a suitable trade environment 
for Canadian industry. Second is to select support through 
established programs or specialized assistance where warranted for 
critical operational requirements. Third is enhancing the 
Canada-U.S. material co-operation.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	In giving the House a brief overview of how the department is 
responding to current challenges, I need to stress two factors. First, 
DND's resources are finite. It  cannot simply throw money at the 
problems faced by industry, as the essence of its corporate problem 
is a significantly reduced fiscal framework in which to operate. 
Second, the fact that much of Canadian industry is focused on sales 
abroad, to the U.S. in particular, presents DND and the government 
with a unique policy challenge. A substantial degree of vitality of 
Canadian industry and its ability to support our operational needs is 
strongly influenced by developments in the U.S. Our industrial 
base planning must take this unusual situation into account.
<P>
	DND must smoothly integrate factors and government program 
initiatives such as development of dual-use technologies and 
demonstration of a peace dividend, defence industry conversion, 
and development of export markets and the like into its 
procurement processes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to let you know that I will share my time with my colleague 
from Terrebonne, who will join the debate in a moment. I 
understand that I will have ten minutes to make my point.
<P>
	To start with, I will say that this morning, when I came back 
from Montreal, I turned on the parliamentary channel and watched 
the debate on the motion before us now. I was surprised to see that 
my Reform and Liberal friends were questioning the legitimacy of 
the motion we moved in this House today.
<P>
	Some were claiming that the leader of the Bloc Quebecois was 
going to be the premier of Quebec, others that my colleague from 
Charlesbourg was basically guilty of insurgency. I could not help 
but remember why I was elected to Ottawa. It should not be 
forgotten that Quebecers pay $29 billion a year to Ottawa, and that 
in return they are entitled to services at an equivalent level.
<P>
	With regard to today's debate, which in a sense is the history of 
the Canadian content requirement in defence spending, it should be 
noted that for decades Quebec has not been given its fair share by 
the defence department. For the past ten years, the shortfall has 
been $600 million a year.
<P>
	I believe that as elected members from Quebec we have every 
right to move such a motion, which is perfectly legitimate, to boot. 
I had a look at statistics. We know that for a long time now the 
Saint-Jean area-and the Montreal area for that matter since 
Saint-Jean is part of the Montreal region-has been the victim of 
this kind of shortfall, which translates in terms of job loss.
<P>
	I have the statistics right here. From 1990 to 1994, we lost 7,800 
jobs out of a total of 13,900. I believe that in the current difficult 
context, these jobs would be very valuable.
<P>
	In my own riding, we too are victims. I do not wish to belabour 
the point, but I will remind the Liberal Party of  the terrible blow it 
dealt Saint-Jean when it closed the royal military college. This 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16629"> 16629 </A></B>
<P>
represents a $32 million loss for our economy every year. Believe it 
or not, this college was the most efficient, which means that it was 
less expensive to train officer cadets in Saint-Jean than in Kingston 
or Royal Roads.
<P>
	In spite of that, the Liberal government decided to close the 
Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean. Thirty-two million dollars; it 
was the most efficient and the most bilingual military college.
<P>
	We all know that the Canadian Parliament often boasts of its 
ideology and its policy on bilingualism. Pierre Elliott Trudeau 
himself, not the greatest advocate of Quebec I must admit, came in 
person to Saint-Jean and said that the college was the greatest proof 
that bilingualism could succeed. Nonetheless, in its last budget, the 
liberal party closed the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean.
<P>
	Another inequity I would like to point out today is directly 
related to the debate and the issue at hand; I am talking about 
Oerlikon.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The Oerlikon case is another example of inequity towards 
Quebec and Saint-Jean. We all remember that the minister 
announced, August 16, that he was planning to award a two billion 
dollar contract to General Motors for the manufacture of armoured 
personnel carriers. At the time-I remember it well-the minister 
explained that the situation in London, Ontario was urgent. He said 
that they were almost out of contracts in London and that, since it 
was the centre of expertise for armoured vehicles, he had to award 
the contract to GM without any call for tenders. Why did the 
minister say that? Because it was also a centre of expertise. He said 
that no other plant in Canada could build better armoured vehicles 
than GM in Ontario.
<P>
	Once again, the minister and the Liberal Party were forgetting 
Quebec.
<P>
	The hon. member just mentioned the case of Oerlikon and I hope 
he is listening to me in the lobby. The Oerlikon situation is clearly 
unfair in this regard since out of the $2 billion contract for 
armoured personnel carriers about $500 to $600 million will be 
used for the gun turret. It happens that Oerlikon Canada is the 
centre of expertise for turrets in Canada.
<P>
	Of course, General Motors said: ``Listen, you are giving us a 
whole contract and you must understand that we have affiliates''. 
Among others, there is one in Santa Barbara, called Delco, which is 
specialized in gun turrets. Therefore, GM seems to be saying: ``You 
give us the $2 billion contract and we will subcontract to whoever 
we want''. And as good capitalists and good business people, they 
give the subcontract to Delco of Santa Barbara, California. So you 
can see the impact of the  department's decision on the Canadian 
content and on Quebec which, once again, is being excluded.
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers are going to pay a $2 billion bill and almost 
half the money will be used to create jobs in the U.S., in Santa 
Barbara, California. I think this goes against the Liberal program 
which we all read so carefully during the election campaign and 
which said in English: ``Jobs, jobs, jobs'' and in French: ``Emplois, 
emplois, emplois''.
<P>
	At the first opportunity it had, the government cut the jobs and 
sent them to California, saying to Canadian workers: ``You pay 
your taxes to Ottawa and as for you, Quebecers, send $29 billion to 
Ottawa and you will get $600 million less''.
<P>
	We have here an opportunity to compensate for this shortfall for 
one year, since the contract is worth some $500 million to $600 
million, but the Liberal Party is missing this opportunity. I find this 
totally deplorable because it shows a double standard.
<P>
	If we recognize GM in London, Ontario as a centre of expertise 
for armoured vehicles, why do we not also recognize Oerlikon as 
the Canadian centre of expertise on turrets? We find this hard to 
explain. As a buyer, the government should use all the means at its 
disposal and ask General Motors in Ontario to have the turrets 
made by Oerlikon in Saint-Jean, the Canadian centre of expertise 
on turrets.
<P>
	Lobby groups are at work. A number of people are trying to 
convince the federal government that my arguments are valid, but 
the government is not budging. Even the Bloc Quebecois has raised 
several questions on this issue, but all the minister can say is, 
``Submit your bids to GM and I might be able to talk to them, 
perhaps we will see if your bid is the best''.
<P>
	The federal government could even use this as an excuse to back 
out, because Oerlikon executives claim that they have sufficient 
expertise to carry out the contract for less than Delco in Santa 
Barbara. Although this would save Canadian taxpayers money, the 
minister continues to turn a deaf ear. I find this totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	If at least the minister said, ``Look, Canadian content 
requirements have been reduced; they are no longer mandatory. So 
let us award the armoured personnel carrier contract to General 
Motors in London and call for bids on the turret contract in a way 
that is open and fair to everyone''.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Even then, Oerlikon claims that it could do better than Delco any 
day. I visited the plant, and it is true that asking them to make 
turrets for armoured vehicles is like asking a Ferrari plant to build 
Volkswagens. They are perfectly capable of performing the task. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16630"> 16630 </A></B>
<P>
They are  already producing Ferraris. The Ferrari of turrets are 
produced in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	Now they want the Volkswagen turret to equip the new armoured 
vehicles to be sent elsewhere, claiming that General Motors was 
awarded the whole contract and that nothing more can be done 
because they do not want to interfere too much. They say: ``Delco 
also makes them. Why meddle in this business. We just want to 
give the contract to GM and have nothing else to do with it''. It 
think that this is utterly unfair to the Saint-Jean area and for Quebec 
as a whole.
<P>
	Oerlikon has been lobbying extensively in the past little while. 
In fact, I think that the company's president is here, in Ottawa, 
today in a further attempt to make the government see reason. I 
also think that those involved were quite forceful, because 
perseverance did not get us anywhere so far. There are people who 
try, day in and day out, to get across to the department that the 
arguments I just mentioned are valid. Unfortunately, the federal 
government is apparently doomed because, any time it 
contemplates giving something to Quebec, it takes longer to make 
a decision than it normally does for any other part of Canada.
<P>
	It certainly did not take the minister very long to decide to award 
the contract to GM. In no time flat, he decided: ``I must help GM. It 
is a centre of excellence and short of contracts.'' As far as 
Saint-Jean and Quebec are concerned, that is another story.
<P>
	That is why I take this opportunity today to try to show, once 
again, that this is unfair and that it is no too late to make it right. I 
ask the Liberal government and all my government colleagues to 
impress on the minister responsible that Canadian taxpayers, and 
indirectly, Quebec taxpayers, stand to save money. The minister 
should take his responsibilities and give Oerlikon the same 
consideration he gave GM when awarding GM the contract. We are 
dealing with two centers of expertise and potential savings to the 
taxpayers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my colleague on his remarks which I 
listened to with great interest.
<P>
	I want him to know I have quite a bit of sympathy for his 
comments on the closing of Collège Saint-Jean. It is indeed a 
beautiful military college with a great history and tradition. I want 
to remind him that the government in closing Saint-Jean also 
closed Royal Roads in British Columbia. A lot of my family live in 
Victoria and I know Royal Roads very well. It was a very fine 
military college with a great tradition.
<P>
	All Canadians feel pain when cost cutting affects jobs and the 
people of our regions. I sympathize with the Bloc member and all 
Bloc members when they bring that kind of position forward in the 
House. However I would submit to my hon. colleague that the 
government did  approach this matter, certainly in the closing of the 
colleges over which it did have control with great equality of spirit.
<P>
	Is the hon. member familiar with Royal Roads? Can he speak 
with the same passion about this college near Victoria as he does 
with Collège Saint-Jean? Does he not agree that however 
unfortunate it was to close Collège Saint-Jean and Royal Roads 
given that we had more college space than we needed in these cost 
cutting times, the government really acted very responsibly and 
with a sense of fairness?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for giving 
me an opportunity to elaborate, particularly on the issue of 
unfairness. There is unfairness at two levels. The first level is 
rather ideological in nature and has to do with culture and 
language. Saint-Jean was the main route for young francophones 
interested in becoming officers in the Canadian forces.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Closing the military college in Saint-Jean-and we have news 
from Kingston today-will have an impact on the number of young 
francophones in the Canadian forces. If I had more time, I would 
give you figures which show that, already, this decision has had 
such an impact.
<P>
	But I want to go back to the financial issue raised by the hon. 
member. It is true that Royal Roads was also closed. But, again, 
there is an injustice related to the compensation given to the two 
military colleges. Saint-Jean, which had an annual budget of $39 
million, was given $5 million for each of the next five years. Royal 
Roads, which had an annual budget of $19 million, was given the 
same compensation.
<P>
	So, Royal Roads, a college half the size, with half the budget and 
half the number of officer cadets, gets the same compensation as 
Saint-Jean. Not only is it unfair to close the military college in 
Saint-Jean because it is the main route for francophones interested 
in becoming officers in the Canadian forces, but there is also an 
economic injustice in that the compensation of $5 million per year 
given by the federal government is the same for both institutions, 
even though one had an operating budget twice the size of the other. 
Saint-Jean should have received $10 million per year, considering 
the size of the two institutions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate, with the 
second half of the twenty minutes allocated now being shared with 
the hon. member for Terrebonne.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to make the House aware of the importance the Bloc Quebecois 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16631"> 16631 </A></B>
<P>
attaches to defence conversion. This is the main reason why we 
selected it for our opposition day. It is important in Quebec and it is 
important in my region. I should point out that I have  SNC 
Technologies in my riding, a munitions plant, and its employees are 
extremely worried about federal government inaction on defence 
conversion.
<P>
	Before addressing the matter we are looking at today directly, I 
would like to take this opportunity to denounce the Canadian 
Armed Forces' lack of respect for francophones in its ranks. Last 
February 22, the Office of the Commissioner for Official 
Languages followed up on numerous complaints about the lack of 
compliance with the Official Languages Act in the Canadian 
Armed Forces. Its letter stated that there would be an investigation 
to compare the situation of francophones in Moosejaw and that of 
anglophones at Bagotville. The report was to be submitted within a 
few weeks of the February letter. Nearly a year later, the report is 
still secret, despite the Access to Information Act, probably 
because the conclusions do not put the government in a very good 
light.
<P>
	All we are asking is for the investigation to be made public, first 
of all, and then for them to comply with their own legislation. Now, 
back to the key point of this debate, defence conversion; this must 
be looked at on the world scale, but also in Quebec, primarily the 
Montreal area, and in Canada. The situation is not a very 
comfortable one. With the end of the cold war, defence industries 
everywhere in the world are in a crisis situation. The market, 
estimated to be in excess of $450 billion, dropped 10 per cent 
between 1987 and 1994. This slump is far from over; according to 
the international experts, there might be another drop of some 25 
per cent within the next few years, which is why it is important to 
have an eye to the future in this sector.
<P>
	The result of this crisis in the industry has been major job losses 
world wide. For example, 700,000 jobs have been lost in the USA, 
and 600,000 in Europe. In Quebec and in Canada we are far from 
being protected from the inroads being made upon the defence 
industry world wide. In Quebec alone, sales figures in the defence 
sector dropped 48 per cent between 1987 and 1992. During that 
same period, lower defence sales resulted in the disappearance of 
11,000 of the 57,000 jobs directly linked to defence.
<P>
	As I have already stated, there is a company in my riding whose 
500 employees are worried at the lack of action. Considering the 
situation in the defence industry, there are two other points that 
must be taken into consideration.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	First, we must remember that jobs lost in the defence industry 
are jobs in a sector with a very high concentration of advanced 
technology. The jobs that disappear are high calibre, lucrative 
positions. In fact, salaries paid in the aerospace industry, which 
plays a major role in the defence industry, tend to be 24 per cent 
higher than the average salary in Canadian industry. Twenty-four 
per cent is a lot.
<P>
	Second, we must consider the fact that these changes in the 
defence sector are particularly hard on Quebec, where a major part 
of Canada's defence industry is located. This is not partisan 
politics. This is the truth. Because of the way the industry is 
distributed within the province, these changes come down hard on 
the Montreal region which is the driving force of Quebec's 
economy.
<P>
	In other words, a lack of federal programs to help the defence 
industry whether this crisis will be particularly damaging for 
Quebec and weaken the ability of Quebecers to make advanced 
technology one of the strengths of their economy.
<P>
	I am referring here to sectors like telecommunications and the 
aerospace industry, where we have to do everything we can to 
promote development and provide a solid basis for competitive 
growth in the long term. If we want to build this solid basis for the 
future, it is important to help the defence industry negotiate the 
rough spots it is experiencing today. This can be done partly by 
helping the industry adjust to changing conditions, something the 
government has failed to do.
<P>
	For instance, we could provide incentives for defence producers 
to develop civilian applications of their products.
<P>
	Since the defence industry uses advanced technology which 
benefits the economy as a whole, it would make sense for the 
government to have programs that provide incentives for defence 
conversion, which is already the case in other countries.
<P>
	In the United States, the Clinton plan provides between 4 and 6 
billion dollars worth of funding for defence conversion. In Europe, 
largely thanks to the KONVER program, hundreds of millions of 
dollars are invested for this purpose.
<P>
	And then Canada. Does this country have a program similar to 
the European and American programs that focus on defence 
conversion? Unfortunately, it does not.
<P>
	The only program that comes close is DIPP, which has been 
around for several years, and it certainly does not focus exclusively 
on defence conversion.
<P>
	Its purpose is also to support companies that work in the defence 
industry, especially in aerospace and avionics, and to facilitate and 
consolidate R&amp;D activities in these companies. It also focuses on 
setting up networks of suppliers of derivatives and components for 
these sectors and promoting investment and exports in 
manufacturing sectors with a high added value.
<P>
	The purpose of the program is to help defence industries remain 
competitive on world and Canadian markets. It provides companies 
in the defence sector with incentives to continue their activities. It 
is only in recent years that part-and it must be remembered that it 
is only a small part-of the budget for this program has been 
allocated to promoting defence conversion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16632"> 16632 </A></B>
<P>
	Here, we could perhaps point out that expenditures under the 
DIPP program have a major economic impact. Every dollar spent 
under the program is estimated to produce more than $40 worth 
of economic benefits. We must not forget that, through its strong 
participation and dynamic role in the defence industry, Quebec 
enjoys a significant amount of these benefits.
<P>
	This therefore is the only federal program with a goal of defence 
conversion, even though it may be both limited and inadequate. 
While the program does not entirely serve the needs of conversion, 
it could at least serve as a basis for the work needed in this area. It 
is simply a basis requiring constant work, but at least it is 
something. Even the Liberals promised to face the challenge of 
defence conversion in their famous red book. They have forgotten 
in the meantime, as everyone will agree.
<P>
	They acknowledged, and I quote: ``The defence industries today 
employ directly and indirectly over 100,000 Canadians. The end of 
the Cold War puts at risk tens of thousands of high-tech jobs''. 
They promised in the red book, and I quote once again: ``A Liberal 
government will introduce a defence conversion program to help 
industries in transition from high-tech military production to 
high-tech civilian production''.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	This then was a promise to build on the existing program to help 
the sector through its difficult times. Where is it at today? 
Forgotten, gone, like most of the other promises the other party 
made.
<P>
	Looking at the record to date, we see that the benefits derived 
from the defence industry are substantial for Quebecers and 
Canadians, but that the industry is facing a serious crisis. Some 
adjustments must be made. Conversion of a significant portion of 
the defence industry to civilian production would help us keep and 
develop high calibre jobs. Other countries have taken on this 
challenge, as I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	In Canada however the federal government has not, truth be 
known, managed to respond coherently to the problem, despite 
empty promises-something that does not surprise us. The only 
reaction to the crisis in the defence industry up to now has been a 
few adjustments to an existing program and cuts to it, on top of 
everything else. And yet, the Liberals had promised much more to 
help the industry survive this crisis.
<P>
	Despite the logic of providing more active support for defence 
conversion, the Liberal government has not kept its promises. The 
DIPP budget is in free fall. It reached its peak in 1989-90 at over 
$300 million. In 1994-95, the figure was less than $144 million. 
New cuts are expected for 1995-96. The DIPP will then amount to 
only $102 million, a 66 per cent reduction over six years, at a time 
when business is facing a serious crisis.
<P>
	These cuts will only continue, and the 1997-98 budget should 
drop to only $24 million. In fact, the program no longer accepts any 
new projects, and the government is honouring only the 
commitments it has already undertaken. This is a funny way for the 
government to keep its promise to facilitate defence conversion, do 
you not agree?
<P>
	At a time when the industry needs it more than ever, the 
government is drastically reducing its participation. Its budget cuts 
are placing an enormous burden on Quebec. While Quebec 
businesses received $168 million in 1989-90, this amount dropped 
to $80 million in 1992-93. This is quite disturbing for the people 
who work in this sector in Quebec and in the Montreal region.
<P>
	In conclusion, I think that so far the federal Liberal government 
has behaved inappropriately and irresponsibly by promising 
assistance while at the same time cutting back on the defence 
conversion program. This is a Machiavellian way of looking at 
things and avoiding the problems by shoving them aside to make 
them disappear. The time has come to initiate an honest program to 
face the real, global crisis everyone recognizes. The government 
must act now.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the hon. member who just spoke. He talked 
about the cold war and the many jobs available during the cold war. 
He seemed saddened by the fact that those jobs have disappeared 
now that the cold war has come to an end. I would like to ask him if 
the economic solution, according to the Bloc, is to go on with cold, 
hot and lukewarm wars and to have jobs that support wars and 
conflicts around the world.
<P>
	Does he really believe that the key to a prosperous economy is to 
perpetuate conflicts throughout the world and base our economic 
future on arms sales?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel like laughing. Where I come 
from, we say of a nice action or activity that it is a good show. I 
would say to the hon. member across the way that she is missing a 
good show. She has missed good, coherent speeches.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Most of all, I would like to remind her of her party's promises. 
You said, my dear colleague, ``The defence industries today 
employ directly and indirectly over 100,000 Canadians''. You 
wrote, ``The end of the Cold War-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I simply wish to 
remind members that they should address their comments to the 
Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The Liberal Party wrote, ``The end of the Cold War puts at risk 
tens of thousands of high-tech jobs''. This does not come from us 
but from the red book. I say through you that I hope the hon. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16633"> 16633 </A></B>
<P>
member agrees. The  Liberal Party also wrote that it would 
``introduce a defence conversion program to help industries in 
transition from high-tech military production to high-tech civilian 
production''.
<P>
	The purpose of the Bloc Quebecois's opposition motion is 
simply to remind the Liberal Party of its red book promises. We 
have never, ever said that we wanted other conflicts. This is totally 
unrealistic and does not make any sense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Ridiculous.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> We heard the word ``ridiculous''.
<P>
	But it is important to recognize that other countries are putting in 
place defence conversion policies while Canada is cutting 
conversion budgets.
<P>
	I think this is a serious problem. We must stop treating this 
matter lightly and start asking serious questions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I enlighten the colleague who has just 
spoken on this issue to what has been occurring in the industry of 
which the motion speaks. He and his colleagues certainly seem not 
to be as familiar with the industry as I would have expected them to 
be.
<P>
	It is somewhat suitable that we are having this debate the day 
after Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield returned from a very 
successful aerospace mission. It is also interesting to note that 
RADARSAT was launched very recently. I seem to recall that the 
city of Montreal was somehow involved in the launching of 
RADARSAT into space. One of the things members opposite might 
do is to watch events in Montreal and to be a little more familiar 
with the ways in which Montreal companies and other companies 
in Quebec are participating in this very prosperous industry.
<P>
	Quite simply, the Bloc Quebecois has it wrong. The hon. 
member for Charlesbourg who proposed this motion would have 
this House believe there is no conversion of the military industry to 
civilian production and that the Montreal companies in the 
aerospace industry are facing hard times as a result. Perhaps he and 
his colleagues were not listening when this House debated defence 
conversion on May 5, 1994. Perhaps they did not participate in the 
debate or perhaps the Bloc Quebecois simply wants to stir up the 
pot, any pot. Let me give the member some of the facts.
<P>
	First, the Canadian aerospace industry is already well on the road 
to converting from military to civilian applications.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Montreal companies have been in the forefront of this trend and 
provide excellent examples of firms that have managed to win a 
niche in the international aerospace industry while at the same time 
remaining competitive.
<P>
	Here are statistics that are well known in the Montreal aerospace 
sector.
<P>
	In the 1980s, 70 per cent of the sales of the aerospace and 
defence industry were for military use, and 30 per cent for 
commercial use.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Today, the mix is reversed, with sales of military equipment 
down to 30 per cent while sales of commercial products have gone 
up to 70 per cent. And the commercial component keeps growing. 
Soon the civilian, commercial component will account for 80 per 
cent of Canada's defence and aerospace sales.
<P>
	If the hon. member took a closer look at the Montreal industry, 
he would realize that these statistics reflect the reality and see how 
Montreal aerospace firms run the entire range of commercial 
aerospace design and manufacture.
<P>
	Is the hon. member interested in final assembly of aircraft? He 
should look at Bombardier and Canadair. They specialize in 
commuter aircraft. Perhaps the hon. members across the way 
should think about that before they raise the issue of defence 
industry orientation.
<P>
	Does the hon. member want examples of Montreal firms that 
design and manufacture helicopters? There is Bell Helicopter 
Textron.
<P>
	Landing gears? Héroux Inc. Does he want to know more about 
world class aircraft engine designers and manufacturers? He need 
only remember that Canada is a world leader in the manufacturing 
of small commercial turbo fan engines. One of the leading 
manufacturers is, of course, Pratt and Whitney. Most of the 
company's R&amp;D is on advanced materials, which can be used for 
any number of commercial purposes.
<P>
	For avionics systems, the hon. member need only think of 
Canadian Marcony.
<P>
	Finally, if the hon. member for Charlesbourg and the other hon. 
members who have taken part in the debate today want information 
about flight simulators, they should talk to CAE Electronics Ltd. 
They will learn that not only are this company's simulators used for 
commercial as well as military aviation, but CAE has begun 
drawing on its flight simulator technology to enter into the health 
field.
<P>
	These Montreal-area companies are world renowned for the 
quality of their design. They have built a solid reputation in serving 
particular niches in commercial aerospace.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16634"> 16634 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I certainly hope members opposite are listening. The Montreal 
industry has prospered because it is part of a broader Canadian 
aerospace sector.
<P>
	Once again, let the hon. member look at the facts about the 
aerospace industry in Canada. We have the sixth largest aerospace 
industry in the world. In 1994 aerospace sales were $9.6 billion and 
the industry employed 53,000 people. The Aerospace Industry 
Association of Canada estimates that the sector will add more than 
$8 billion to Canada's GDP from exports in the coming year. The 
aerospace sector continues to be the one high tech industry where 
Canada maintains a consistent trade surplus, which was $2.5 billion 
last year. Let us go back one more year where more detailed 
statistics are available.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	In 1993 total Canadian sales of aircraft components and related 
products and services were $7 billion, of which almost $5 billion 
were exports. Quebec firms accounted for over $4 billion of the $7 
billion worth of sales, representing 60 per cent of the total sales of 
the Canadian aerospace industry.
<P>
	Almost 200 aeronautics firms with approximately 25,000 people 
are located in Quebec. The companies and the employees clearly 
have a major interest in the continuing success of the aerospace 
industry.
<P>
	What are the keys to success? How did we reach the position 
where Canada is a world leader in aerospace? There are many 
reasons. I am sure hon. members across the floor would be happy to 
list some of them. The skills of our workforce across the country 
including Montreal, the quality of our educational institutions and 
the high standard of living that attracts people from around the 
world are characteristics of the industry and of the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But one of the most important reason for the success of the 
aerospace industry in Montreal is one that Bloc members will never 
mention or recognize, even though they must realize that it is the 
truth. They will have to agree that one of the major reasons why the 
Montreal aerospace industry has become a world leader in the 
commercial aerospace sector is the benefits of a strong and united 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to thank the hon. member for Ottawa West for being so enthusiastic 
in showing how dynamic Quebec aerospace industries are, and for 
being so accurate in reading the directory of aerospace industries 
located in the Montreal region. I do not think the hon. member 
missed a lot of them, he inventory is excellent.
<P>
	However, I want to ask her two very simple questions. There is a 
federal defence conversion program called  DIPP. I would like to 
know the budget of that program and whether the Liberal 
government intends to increase or reduce that budget in the coming 
years.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure that the hon. member will 
realize that I am not the Minister of Industry, that I am not his 
parliamentary secretary, and that I am not a member of the standing 
committee on industry. Consequently, I do not have the budget 
figures in my head. However, I can reassure the hon. member. I 
mentioned the case of CAE Electronics, in Montreal. The member 
may not be aware that this company recently received $5 million 
from the federal government for a project.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to make a comment and a clarification to the deputy whip. I 
have some figures regarding the so-called vitality of aerospace 
industries in the Montreal region. I will simply tell the hon. 
member that, from 1990 to 1994, 7,391 direct jobs were lost in 30 
companies, including 6,684 in the following eight companies 
alone: Paramax, Expro, Marconi, MIL Davie, Vickers, SNC, Pratt 
&amp; Whitney, and Bendix. Again 6,684 jobs were lost in these eight 
companies over a four-year period.
<P>
	The aerospace industry is in fact experiencing a definite decline. 
The 7,000 people who lost their jobs are certainly not proud of the 
alleged vitality of that industry.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	I would also add that, if these companies have somehow 
managed to expand and gain an international reputation, it is not 
thanks to federalism but, rather, in spite of it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall: </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out to my 
colleague across the way that it is Canada which has a good name 
worldwide in the aerospace industry, not the province of Quebec. I 
might point out to him as well, perhaps, that about half of the jobs 
in the aerospace industry are in the province of Quebec, and that 60 
per cent of aerospace industry sales are in Quebec.
<P>
	If he were properly acquainted with the industry, he would know 
very well that it has always been constantly, frequently and rapidly 
changing, and has always had its ups and downs. In general, the 
industry has continued to improve, to grow, to step up its sales 
everywhere in the world and Quebec has played a very important 
role in this success.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Ottawa West has been accusing us for a while now of 
not knowing our own program, of not being familiar with the 
issues. We are not, however, speaking only of the aerospace 
industry, but rather of defence conversion in our opposition 
motion. A while ago, I asked a question about DIPP budgets and 
she replied-this is not really an accusation-that she did not have 
all the figures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16635"> 16635 </A></B>
<P>
	I would simply remind her that, as the result of our efforts, the 
budget has been cut 66 per cent over the past two years, a two 
thirds reduction. Moreover, we plan to bring it down from $220 
million to $24 million for 1997-98. So, I am reminding her of the 
figures. At the same time, the program set out in the Liberal red 
book indicated that investments in defence conversion would be 
a priority.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, does the member not see a dichotomy between the 
reality of short-term abolition of DIPP and the red book promise to 
invest in defence conversion? I am not speaking of Montreal 
aerospace companies, but of a defence conversion program in 
conjunction with a promise about the defence industry and a 
reality.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall: </B>Mr. Speaker, I believe that it is precisely because 
of the change in the world context, referred to by my colleague 
previously, that programs must be changed. DIPP was a program 
for the defence industry and is perhaps not appropriate in the 
current context.
<P>
	We have taken some very significant steps to improve the 
situation, particularly in the very important small and medium size 
industries, promoting world trade which is very important for this 
sector of the industry; another very important thing we are doing is 
promoting specific programs for small and medium businesses. I 
think that the fact that a program has existed in the past does not 
necessarily mean it is the program for the future, and in this case 
DIPP was useful in the past when military sales were more 
substantial than they are today.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before debate resumes, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, it is my duty to inform the House 
that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment 
are as follows: the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt-Department of National 
Defence; the hon. member for Rosedale-Cuba; the hon. member 
for Davenport-nuclear weapons; the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake-Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have great difficulty accepting the proposition that the province of 
Quebec has suffered a disproportionately low share of defence 
spending over the years. I would aver that the greatest threat to the 
Montreal aerospace industry is the unstable economic climate that 
has resulted from the group of politicians who are trying to take 
their province out of the Canadian federation.
<P>
	Canada's aerospace industry, for example Bombardier of 
Montreal and Bell Helicopter of Mirabel, has graduated from being 
a one-product firm or branch plant to becoming full fledged 
industry players capable of manufacturing a full range of aircraft.
<P>
	This growth has placed even greater pressure on federal research 
and development support and new aerospace project start ups cost 
hundreds of millions of dollars. This may not be a large amount of 
money by global aerospace industry standards which are heavily 
subsidized, but the Canadian government has heavy debt and heavy 
deficits and there are insufficient funds to go around.
<P>
	As for Quebec, in the 1960s the Pearson Liberal government 
moved the Air Canada overhaul base from Winnipeg to Montreal 
for political reasons. Later the Progressive Conservative 
government gave the F-18 maintenance contract to Montreal for 
political reasons, despite the fact that Bristol Aerospace of 
Winnipeg had submitted the lowest bid and the best bid.
<P>
	Regional balancing efforts are still apparent and even now 
industry rivals are positioning themselves for the best shot to bid 
for the new helicopters. In the human resources minister's riding, 
the consortium of Westland Group PLC and Agusta SPA is trying to 
sign up Bristol Aerospace's Winnipeg operation.
<P>
	When proposals were placed before the Liberal cabinet to 
purchase the much needed helicopters, submarines and armoured 
vehicles, they were stalled when regional pressures came into play. 
The government must realize by now that it made a mistake in 
cancelling the EH-101 contract. It is now trying to do a balancing 
act to work out communications plans to announce which province 
will get what specific work from contracts for military hardware.
<P>
	For example, the armoured personnel carrier contract going to 
General Motors of London, Ontario, has been balanced with the 
Montreal workshop being given the contract to refurbish the M-113 
armoured personnel carriers, even though the whole contract might 
better have gone to New Brunswick. This is regional pork 
barrelling and represents the essence of old style politics. However, 
poor political decisions and poor planning must be corrected and 
the armoured personnel carrier purchase starts in this direction.
<P>
	Canadian soldiers have for too long been placed at risk because 
of inadequate equipment. Our well trained, combat capable and 
highly respected peacekeepers have been sent to war zones 
outfitted with decades old equipment, some dating from the second 
world war.
<P>
	Morale is affected because the troops feel abandoned by their 
senior leadership who seem to be more interested in pleasing their 
political masters than taking care of their troops. Defence budgets 
have been poorly managed. There has been gross waste at the top 
and a growing rift between the frontline troops and those behind 
desks at national defence headquarters.
<P>
	That buck stops here in Parliament with government. Political 
decisions will re-equip our army with modern armoured vehicles, 
mine clearing equipment and provide  enough helmets, socks or 
flak jackets to outfit all our soldiers. These equipment shortages 
point directly at this government and previous governments that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16636"> 16636 </A></B>
<P>
have carried on their defence commitments without spending the 
money to pay for them.
<P>
	For example, our troops in the former Yugoslavia have had to 
leave behind helmets and other basic equipment so new 
replacement rotations would have these necessary tools. Our 
defence minister has said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We will commit forces to such operations if suitable resources are available, 
and if our personnel can be appropriately armed and properly trained to carry 
out the task and make a significant contribution to the success of the mission.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	Suitable resources have not been made available to protect the 
lives of Canadians and personnel have not been adequately armed. 
If Canada remains unwilling to commit the necessary resources in a 
timely fashion to protect and provide the needed resources for 
Canadian forces soldiers, we will be forced to rely on the heavy 
weapons of other countries or step back and let nations willing to 
spend the money to equip their troops do the job.
<P>
	If the government plans to deploy a larger force on multilateral 
peacekeeping missions, our men and women will find themselves 
short of everything from modern night vision gear to anti-armour 
weapons, heavy machineguns, and updated communications 
equipment.
<P>
	The procurements of new equipment such as the helicopters, 
armoured vehicles and submarines are vital replacements for aging 
equipment, not new capabilities. They meet only the minimum 
requirements to enable Canada to maintain a semblance of 
controlling its destiny.
<P>
	Canada is bound by law and treaty to provide domestic security, 
collective defence, and participation in multilateral peacekeeping 
operations. Each role requires its own capabilities. If the Canadian 
forces are to do the tasks requested of them, they must have the 
necessary tools to perform those tasks.
<P>
	Government has belatedly addressed the need for new and 
refurbished armoured vehicles and it seems there is enough money 
in the defence budget for submarines to replace the navy's aging 
Oberon class vessels, but cabinet is again dragging its feet, while 
affordable options available now could be lost. These replacement 
submarines could be picked up second hand from Britain at a 
bargain price, but the window of opportunity is closing quickly.
<P>
	Over many years the Canadian navy has developed substantial 
experience in submarine and anti-submarine operations. Although 
the cold war may have ended, there are still over 700 submarines in 
service with more than 40 nations around the world and others are 
under construction. Submarines have become the weapon of  
choice for many small nations with limited defence budgets. It 
would seem shortsighted for Canada's defence forces to forgo the 
opportunity to retain and profit from their submarine expertise. 
Canada's three Oberon class patrol submarines, procured in the 
1960s, are now reaching the end of their operational life, having 
become increasingly restricted and expensive to operate. Thus, 
Canada must now choose whether to retain or give up our 
submarine capability.
<P>
	The Liberal government's cancellation of the 43 EH-101 
shipborne and search and rescue helicopters because they were too 
costly means that it will be necessary to buy aircraft off the shelf in 
Europe or the United States. That means the government has 
sacrificed benefits to the Canadian economy the EH-101 would 
have created. The CH-133 Labradors, which have been in service 
since 1963, will finally be replaced with up to 15 new helicopters, 
type and capabilities unknown.
<P>
	I have great difficulty in accepting the government's placing a 
bid for up to 15 helicopters. How many do we need? Do we need 
10? Do we need 12? Do we need 14? Or do we need 15? If we are 
setting a dollar figure and saying we will buy as many as that figure 
will buy, that does not seem to be the way to do the job. We either 
need 15 helicopters or 14 or whatever the number is, and that is 
what we should bid for.
<P>
	Government tenders will be issued early next year for bids on the 
new helicopters. The new fleet is to commence operations by 
December 1998, with all replacement helicopters in service by 
October 2001.
<P>
	Without question, the government has had to reduce the 
capabilities of the replacement helicopters by at least 15 per cent to 
save on costs. These helicopters are to be used to save lives in 
emergency situations and under predictably severe conditions. I do 
not think the people who are on the receiving end of life saving 
efforts will appreciate that they are being served by a less than fully 
capable helicopter. By fully capably I mean all weather, icing and 
night capabilities.
<P>
	Canada is still left without a shipborne helicopter capability to 
replace the troubled aging Sea Kings. In the 1970s DND began a 
long term plan to replace Sea Kings, which at that time had been in 
service for 15 years. It was understood that the Sea Kings would be 
kept in service until the 1990s. Finally, in 1986 Treasury Board 
gave approval to clear the way for industry to submit proposals on a 
replacement helicopter.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Aérospatiale of France and European Helicopter Industries, EHI, 
both submitted proposals. In August 1987 the EH-101 was chosen. 
In 1988 that contract was awarded.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16637"> 16637 </A></B>
<P>
	The Sea King replacement package will be very nearly as 
expensive as the EH-101 would have been, but without any 
Canadian industrial participation and benefits to regions across 
Canada.
<P>
	The government is well into its mandate and is attempting to put 
together a package that will look good to the public. It is 
announcing equipment purchases in bits and pieces to hide the real 
costs involved, talking of leasing and staggering new purchases in 
such a way as to camouflage the real costs.
<P>
	The cost of cancelling the EH-101 may be as much as $680 
million when termination penalties, sunk costs on the program, and 
the acquisition costs are considered. In fact others have estimated 
that the EH-101 cancellation costs will approach $1 billion.
<P>
	British government auditors will review and certify claims for 
compensation submitted by EH Industries to the Canadian 
government. This would not be subject to negotiation, but behind 
the scenes EH Industries could receive favoured status in the new 
helicopter bidding in exchange for reduced compensation for the 
cancelled contract.
<P>
	The government had already paid $336 million toward the 
EH-101 prior to its cancellation. The 1994 main estimates set aside 
a further $250 million for settlement payments. Thus, if these 
earmarked funds are spent the taxpayers will have paid $586 
million without acquiring a single helicopter. This does not take 
into account the loss of work in high tech jobs, the direct and 
indirect compensation for Canadian industry, nor the military, 
which was left dealing with the many problems associated with our 
aging Sea Kings and Labradors.
<P>
	Cancellation of this contract has left the frigates and the Tribal 
class destroyers lacking the capabilities of a new shipborne 
helicopter.
<P>
	The government promised in the defence white paper that it 
would immediately begin to identify options and plans to put into 
service a new, affordable replacement shipborne helicopter by the 
end of the decade.
<P>
	The price tag attached to the EH-101 purchase included 
approximately $1.6 billion to $2 billion for the training of air crew, 
maintenance, spare parts, operating expenses, and administration. 
It was an all-inclusive cost program, unlike any that had been run 
before it, to my knowledge.
<P>
	The 1992-93 fixed cost for the EH-101 program was $4.4 billion, 
but a figure frequently used by the media and by the Liberal 
government was $5.8 billion, which was the inflation adjusted 
projected cost for the end of the program and not a true reflection 
of the actual costs.
<P>
	The EH-101 program was spread over 13 years and its life 
expectancy was 30 to 40 years. Many alternative off the shelf 
aircraft have only light icing capability, while the EH-101 was a 
true all weather aircraft.
<P>
	One of the key factors that led DND to select the EH-101 was 
that it could replace both the Sea King and the Labrador, keeping 
the costs of the new shipborne aircraft as low as possible. 
Replacing both the Sea King and the Labrador with one aircraft 
gave Canada the opportunity to lower the production and long term 
maintenance costs. One aircraft means lower production costs per 
airframe, one spares chain, a single maintenance schedule, and a 
single pilot training program. Government has basically thrown the 
baby out with the bath water because of ill-informed politically 
based election strategy.
<P>
	Now it is all smoke and mirrors. Contracts and announcements 
are dragged out while the Canadian forces wait on their political 
masters to determine their fate. Time is being frittered away. 
Government must move ahead immediately, either to replace aging 
equipment or reduce overseas commitments and obligations.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, we believe that in defence 
spending, as in other spending, the raison d'être should be the best 
equipment at the best price. That means that we do not get into the 
defence department supporting regional development. We buy 
defence equipment based on defence needs and defence dollars are 
spent on defence. Once we get into trying to prop up an area or 
balance that prop with another prop elsewhere, the defence 
department carries disproportionate costs, which do not accurately 
reflect the money that is to be spent on the defence budget.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today as I look at the motion before the House, 
in particular at the last lines of it, I am amazed by its wording. The 
motion ends up saying ``thus endangering the Canadian aerospace 
industry located in Montreal''.
<P>
	What is being said there actually is that we cannot compete with 
other people around the world. That is wrong. We as Canadians 
have proven in the high tech field that we can compete around the 
world and in many areas we lead the world. I will not accept for one 
minute that the aerospace industry in Montreal or Boeing in 
Canada or any others cannot compete.
<P>
	As we talk about the Department of National Defence's support 
for the Canadian defence industry, let us remember that a lot of 
things have been done jointly between the military and civilian 
companies to put success stories together. They have worked very 
co-operatively over the years.
<P>
	Let us look at some examples from the past several years of 
Canadian defence company successes. The contracts awarded in 
the late 1970s and early 1980s to a Quebec firm, Bombardier, for 
jeeps and medium weight trucks are a good example. As we all 
know, under able  leadership the company established itself as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16638"> 16638 </A></B>
<P>
world class while generating significant revenues and employment 
in Quebec.
<P>
	National Defence has continued to contract with 
Bombardier-Canadair for the CF-18 systems engineering support. 
Canadair is now endeavouring to market a CF-18 support expertise 
abroad. The Department of National Defence is supporting these 
efforts by way of making available technical personnel to brief 
foreign defence officials on the Department of National Defence's 
maintenance and support regimes and how Canadair fits in.
<P>
	People who leave the Canadian forces through retirement quite 
often go into other companies and take their expertise with them. 
This is just an extension of defence helping them out during the 
days of active service of a member of the forces.
<P>
	More recently, the Department of National Defence provided 
similar assistance to a Kitchener-Waterloo firm, Diemaco, a 
manufacturer of small arms. The Department of National Defence 
was there to assist Diemaco in its marketing efforts with the Dutch. 
A defence materiel co-operation memorandum of understanding in 
place with the Netherlands facilitated our efforts and those of 
Diemaco.
<P>
	Through our involvement in NATO, specifically in joint NATO 
projects and through the NATO industrial advisory group, the 
Department of National Defence in Canada has played a key role in 
identifying opportunities for Canadian firms and assisting them to 
participate in NATO projects in the development stage. Quebec 
aerospace firms in particular are very active. Among them are 
CAE, Canadian Marconi, Heroux, Oerlikon Aerospace, SNC, and 
Bell Helicopter.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	Examples of important contracts include: CAE simulators for 
NATO AWACS aircraft which enabled the company to become a 
major competitor for simulators on AWACS, airborne early 
warning and control systems type aircraft; Héroux landing gear for 
NATO AWACS aircraft which positioned it to compete for and win 
other 707 aircraft business; allied signal actuation systems for 
military air to air and shipborne missiles known as the NATO Sea 
Sparrow.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	National Defence offered its support along with other defence 
departments in co-operation with other departments to Canadian 
defence contractors. The most recent example is of the firm Héroux 
Québec, which lost its bid for a contract to repair and maintain 
landing gear for the American air force.
<P>
	Héroux had been doing the work satisfactorily for many years. 
However, when the contract came up for renewal, this Canadian 
firm lost out to a bid made by a  USAF depot under rather dubious 
circumstances. Héroux appealed the awarding of the contract to 
American authorities. With the help of our officials here in Ottawa 
and in Washington, the Departments of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade put considerable pressure on the American 
authorities and on the USAF. Héroux and its advisors also made 
very well supported appeals so that the work on the landing gear 
could continue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We realize that if Canadian defence contractors are to survive, 
they cannot depend on Department of National Defence 
procurement alone. This is more true as the Canadian forces have 
been reduced in size. They must export or sell to commercial 
markets or both. National defence has provided assistance in the 
form of loans of equipment, material and personnel for 
demonstration purposes and the use of facilities to test and evaluate 
product enhancements or to demonstrate products. Generally 
speaking, this form of assistance has not placed overly significant 
demands on our resources.
<P>
	We have however over the past three years devoted significant 
time and effort in organizing industry promotional events in 
conjunction with ship visits to foreign ports. Some 25 Canadian 
companies, including the Quebec firms, Loral Canada, formerly 
Paramax and UNYSIS Canada; CAE; Bell Helicopter; and 
Canadian Marconi have participated in ship visits by Canadian 
patrol frigates to ports in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, the United 
States and South America. CAE, a company which participated in 
every ship visit has told us that the ship visit to Korea led directly 
to a major contract in that country.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I have named but a few of the successful Canadian defence and 
defence related companies. These companies are located in 
virtually every region of the country. Canadian defence and 
defence related companies are successful by their own efforts. 
They build on their strengths and their reputations to produce 
competitive leading edge technologies. They aggressively market 
them throughout the world. They diversify into commercial or dual 
use markets and also aggressively pursue those markets.
<P>
	Again it is Quebec aerospace and defence electronics companies 
like Héroux which recently won a major contract for commercial 
aircraft work. Canadian Marconi and Spar Aerospace are in the 
forefront of diversifying their operations and are going after 
increased exports and commercial work. Other progressive firms 
like Indal Technologies of Mississauga, Ontario are also building 
on their expertise and aggressively pursuing foreign markets, 
sonars for the royal navy, helicopter haul down systems for the U.S. 
and Japanese navies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16639"> 16639 </A></B>
<P>
	If I may go back to one of my original comments, Boeing 
Incorporated has branch companies in Arnprior, Ontario and 
Winnipeg, Manitoba. These companies have done well in Canada 
when they have been given a chance to bid openly on the market. 
However, during the latter years of the Conservative government 
they were not even given a chance to bid. They have since revolted 
against that type of attitude. Companies located here in Canada, 
whether they are branch companies or original Canadian 
companies, want a chance to bid on the open market for these 
contracts. It is a healthy situation for all of them.
<P>
	I know that Boeing was very disgusted with the bidding process 
during the Conservative government years. We came to office with 
the promise that we were going to open up the system for bids. 
People were going to have an opportunity to play fair, to be able to 
bid on the open market, to make up their engineering designs and 
submit them and have them properly perused. A successful bidder 
would be picked with integrity and honesty. That is the route this 
government is taking.
<P>
	As today's motion indicates, we are now opening up bids for 
helicopters. A lot has been said about the cancellation of the 
EH-101. Let us remember that particular contract had a bad 
beginning. That was one company which had been given 
favouritism and other companies in Canada did not have a chance 
to openly bid on that contract. Helicopters were built for search and 
rescue that were also built for on board ship helicopters. Those 
helicopters do not have to be the same. Because everything was 
built into both of them, the cost of those helicopters went through 
the roof. That was one of the key problems with it.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	If the best deal is to buy a helicopter off the shelf and put the 
goods into it here, then that is the way we should go, providing 
everybody has the opportunity to buy those helicopters and to put 
the equipment in them. Any subcontracting that would be done 
would be open to Canadian companies. They would have a chance 
to put their expertise and their various engineering departments to 
work. They could sit down, draw their plans and present their best 
effort. Experts in the defence department along with other 
personnel would review these contracts and would decide which 
was the lowest bid and the best bid. We would be getting the best 
product for our money.
<P>
	It is very important that these companies understand they have a 
fair place to bid in the Canadian nation. To come forward and 
insinuate in a motion to this House that a company located in 
Montreal or in any other part of Canada is not capable of competing 
responsibly does not give credit where credit is due to our 
companies.
<P>
	Many professionals are retiring from our armed forces. They are 
going into these aerospace companies with their expertise and 
years of experience having handled the equipment. They too will 
have new ideas. They will  have an excellent idea as to what must 
be in that product if it is going to be the best for Canadian 
aerospace products.
<P>
	Our Canadian forces will be smaller. Therefore it is very 
important that they have the best equipment in the years to come. I 
was rather surprised when a senior person in the forces said to me 
the other day that the new technologies the Canadian forces have 
makes it almost possible for a regiment to do today what it took a 
whole battalion to do a few years ago.
<P>
	People who have worked over the years on aeroplanes, on 
shipborne helicopters and on search and rescue helicopters know 
what is needed in those desolate spots. They know what is needed 
when there are high windstorms. They know what is needed when 
facing great difficulties at sea. Those people are important to the 
companies. They know what is needed and what should be 
recommended.
<P>
	The Department of National Defence with its expertise and 
others it can draw upon put all of that in the bids to begin with. 
There may be some very good suggestions thereafter on the part of 
those experts who work for the companies making bids. 
Suggestions are always welcome in the aerospace business as it is 
in any other business.
<P>
	It is good to have a debate in the House today on the subject of 
the Minister of National Defence having made the announcement 
that we are now open for bids on search and rescue helicopters. 
That is not the route which the previous government would have 
taken.
<P>
	We have told Canadians through the Minister of National 
Defence that search and rescue helicopters are now up for bid. 
Companies can bid on them. May the best company with the best 
product win. In that way our Canadian forces and those who are 
going to be flying search and rescue helicopters in the future will 
be well served. Those for whom the search is made will have a 
better chance of survival because we have a good aerospace 
business. Our people are quite capable of producing a good product 
here.
<P>
	Finally, I say buy the product off the shelf, put into it what we 
absolutely need to make a good and reliable product and let us go 
from there. It is an open system. It is a fair system. It is a bidding 
system. It adds to the integrity that the government is trying to put 
back into the minds of the Canadian public so that the taxpayers 
will know they are getting the best for their dollar because the 
bidding system is open again. It is not back rooms dealing, it is up 
front bidding.

<P>
sell, the chief government  whip, had the floor and had 
approximately five minutes remaining in debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, two weeks ago, when I was interrupted by a member 
calling quorum, I was in the process of discussing the infrastructure 
program, but an incident occurred. It is worthwhile reviewing it for 
the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It went like this. The Reform Party proposed a motion. While we 
were debating its motion it called quorum on itself. Then it failed to 
produce the quorum it had asked for and we had to adjourn the 
House. I understand from the annals of parliamentary history that 
this is rather unprecedented.
<P>
	We always have new things when we deal with the Reform Party 
and calling quorum on oneself is one of those things. If that were 
not bad enough, failing to produce it afterward beat it by a bit. In 
any event it interrupted my speech for two weeks. I am just 
catching my second wind but I will get around to it.
<P>
	We have a motion from the Reform Party about infrastructure. It 
tells us that the government should be in favour of improving 
treatment of municipal sewage and so on. That is exactly what we 
are doing through the infrastructure program, the very successful 
infrastructure program, might I add, which has brought many 
water, sewer and such improvements to a variety of localities in 
Canada.
<P>
	I know the member across the way is saying that is not good.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Not that many.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> ``Not that many'' he says. I am glad he asks how 
many. Let me bring them to the attention of the House. In the 
province of British Columbia water and sewer projects have been 
approved so far in the order of $493 million. That is not enough, 
says the Reformers; they said not many. In Alberta, a place familiar 
perhaps to one or two Reform MPs, it was $149 million.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	We are only talking about water and sewer. We are not talking 
about roads, highways, engineering, non-residential gas and oil, 
equipment, dams and irrigation. We are only talking about those 
infrastructure projects.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan it was $80 million; in Manitoba, $53 million; 
and in Ontario, $355 million again in the area of water and sewer. 
In Quebec it was $537 million; in New Brunswick, $89 million; 
and so on. I could go on and on with the numbers in this wonderful 
program promised by the Liberal Party in the red book and 
delivered for the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
	Those are grants under the infrastructure program for water and 
sewer of the kind the hon. member for Comox-Alberni is asking 
us to support. There is some dissension within the ranks of the 
Reform Party on this subject, particularly in the mind of the 
Reform Party member from Simcoe who denounced some weeks 
ago the infrastructure program. He said that it was a porkfest or 
something like that. Those were words he used.
<P>
	However, not long before he had written a letter to the minister 
responsible for infrastructure, the President of the Treasury Board 
who does a fine job in this regard, by the way. This is the Reform 
MP from Simcoe who had previously denounced such projects as 
porkfests when they were in somebody else's riding. Now that they 
were in his riding he sent a letter asking for the government to 
support not one, not two, but three projects including the same kind 
of arena he denounced in somebody else's riding. That is only a 
coincidence. Yes, Reformers do that from time to time.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> My colleagues are totally upset. I ask them to 
contain themselves. I know it is terribly upsetting for them to see 
Reformers do it, but I am sure the recall process will take care of 
them when they talk out of both sides of their mouths like that.
<P>
	The hon. member for Comox-Alberni has also had a number of 
such projects in his riding. For instance, in the village of Ucluelet it 
cost $2.27 million to repair its inlet. In the regional district of 
Comox-Strathcona it cost $749,000 to upgrade sewage pumps. In 
Port Alberni it cost $113,000 to increase the sewage lagoon 
capacity. In the village of Cumberland, which is a great name in my 
riding as well, it cost $41,000 to upgrade sanitary sewers. The 
government and the President of the Treasury Board should be 
congratulated by the member for Comox-Alberni.
<P>
	I thought I would have a few more minutes because I was 
interrupted for two weeks, but if my time has expired I guess I will 
have to accept it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know the member worked 
diligently over the past few weeks to prepare himself for this 
intervention but the rules must prevail.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I enjoyed the comments by the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. As off target as they were, the hon. 
member talked about some projects that involved sewer work, 
work on the systems. However I think he missed the real intent of 
the bill.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	The member of the Reform Party tried to address that there are a 
number of major cities in the country that fail to treat some or all 
their sewage. In other words, major cities such as Vancouver, 
Victoria, Halifax and even Montreal are dumping large quantities 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16647"> 16647 </A></B>
<P>
of raw sewage  untreated into the harbours. This is what the hon. 
member for Comox-Alberni is trying to get at in the bill.
<P>
	Most towns and cities across the country have sewage treatment 
and sewage carrying facilities. It is difficult to believe that in 1995 
major cities in Canada fail to treat their sewage in any way and 
dump it raw into the oceans and rivers.
<P>
	I mentioned the dumping of raw sewage occurs in Halifax, 
Vancouver, Victoria and Montreal. It is interesting that it also 
occurs in Montreal. Hon. members will be interested to note that 
despite the fact Montreal has a very serious problem with its 
sewage, it was awarded the NAFTA environmental secretariat by 
the Liberal government. I assume a city would get such an award 
because it practises good environmental standards. Yet the city of 
Montreal, a very serious offender in the dumping of raw sewage, 
was chosen by the Minister of the Environment to receive the 
environmental secretariat.
<P>
	Why would the minister overlook a serious environmental 
problem and award a secretariat on environmental issues to the city 
of Montreal? Could it be just another appeasement to the province 
of Quebec that was not deserved in the first place?
<P>
	In 1994 it was reported that 17 major cities in Canada failed to 
treat some or all of their sewage. While provincial governments set 
the standards for sewage treatments, it is up to the municipality to 
actually treat the sewage. Many cities have lagoons that provide 
minimal treatment. In some of the cities I mentioned raw sewage 
minus the solids is dumped directly into the ocean or water basin. 
Needless to say, the dumping of raw sewage poses a serious health 
hazard.
<P>
	In dealing with health hazards, one of the most notable examples 
occurred earlier this year on a reserve in Manitoba when a number 
of residents fell seriously ill because the treatment facility of their 
town had fallen into disrepair.
<P>
	Pollution resulting from sewage not only damages our health but 
damages our economy. Members are aware the cities I mentioned 
are in many cases large tourist attractions in Canada, particularly 
Victoria and Vancouver, where probably a few million tourists 
come to enjoy their aesthetic qualities. However they are shocked 
to find a practice that allows the dumping of raw sewage into the 
harbour. This does not bode well for the tourist industry. Members 
will be aware that in some areas tourism is crucial to the economy. 
Vancouver and Victoria are good examples.
<P>
<B>(1845 )</B>
<P>
	Pollution from sewage is very damaging to the fishing industry. 
Sewage degrades the water quality and dissolves oxygen levels 
resulting in damage to marine life and polluted shorelines. Our 
fishery plays an important role  in the Canadian economy on both 
the east and west coasts. While overfishing has damaged the 
fishery to a great extent, it is shameful that it continues to be 
damaged by our own wilful neglect in not setting some standards 
for treating raw sewage.
<P>
	The member for Comox-Alberni and I certainly think it is time 
to take the matter of untreated sewage seriously. The red ink book 
of the Liberals talks about the detrimental effects of untreated 
sewage. It promises to assist provincial, regional and municipal 
governments to finance new or renewed sewage treatment 
infrastructure.
<P>
	In order to facilitate a clean-up, the Liberal government 
introduced its infrastructure program to look after some of these 
problems. This program was introduced despite the fact the 
government did not have any money, provincial governments do 
not have any money and the municipalities do not have any 
borrowing authority unless by a referendum or some other process 
given to them by their citizens.
<P>
	This program was intended to address some of the serious 
problems in sewage treatment and sewage transport and that is 
good. If specific areas of concern were addressed, then we would 
probably have less problem with the infrastructure program than 
we do even despite the fact that it was done on borrowed funds.
<P>
	Where money was intended to go to water systems and 
infrastructure at the municipal and provincial levels, instead we 
find that a lot of these funds have been used for what we could 
consider quite frivolous and unnecessary things. This should be of 
concern. For example, funds have been used for things like circus 
training centres, snow blowers and boccie courts. The Canadian 
public is angry that we are spending $2 billion at the federal level, 
$2 billion at the provincial level and another $2 billion at the 
municipal level, money that we do not have.
<P>
	There are such projects as $500,000 for a canoe hall of fame in 
the Prime Minister's riding; $18,000 to improve the sound system 
in a curling rink; $72,000 to build two outdoor tennis courts; $14.4 
million for a building for circus training; $15 million for 
renovations to Edmonton's hockey rink; and $173 million to build 
a trade centre in Toronto. When average Canadians think about 
infrastructure, they think about roads, sewers, culverts and things 
that allow communities to grow and to look after some of the waste 
problems they have.
<P>
	The infrastructure program has become quite a joke in many 
areas. The spending goes on and on yet sewage is still being 
dumped into lakes and oceans. It is unacceptable that the 
government did not place some stricter criteria on the spending of 
moneys in its infrastructure program.
<P>
	With respect to the amendment made by the Bloc member, all we 
have here is the Bloc asking for  something for nothing again. The 
Bloc is saying if the government puts money in for a sewage 
treatment plant or whatever in the province, if the province or the 
municipality chooses to opt out they simply get the cash instead to 
do with it as they like. This idea is another example of the Bloc 
wanting something for nothing. It defeats the purpose of any kind 
of infrastructure program funding in the first place.
<P>

<P>
	I ask hon. members in the House to support Motion No. 425 put 
forward by my colleague from Comox-Alberni.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
the opportunity to address Motion No. 425 put forward by the hon. 
member for Comox-Alberni. The motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should support the 
undertaking of a country-wide program of improving the treatment of 
municipal sewage to a minimum standard of at least that of primary treatment 
facilities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The concern I have about the motion is that such a new 
country-wide program would only duplicate existing efforts of the 
federal government, provincial governments and territorial 
governments.
<P>
	Our government initiated the Canada infrastructure works 
program which is geared specifically to upgrading infrastructure. I 
note that sewage treatment was given a high priority in the 
program. For example, in my riding of Halifax West, one of the 
most important and costly projects which the program funded was 
the upgrading of the Mill Cove sewage treatment plant. It is a very 
important program which will provide better service for the whole 
Bedford-Sackville area. That is one of the two largest programs in 
my riding. The other one relates to road building. Both are solid 
traditional infrastructure programs.
<P>
	There are other kinds of infrastructure. These days we have to 
recognize that even things like fibre optics can be important for 
infrastructure and for the ability of a community or a country to 
develop its economic base.
<P>
	I also note that the Reform Party did not support the 
infrastructure program when it was first introduced.
<P>
	I remind hon. members that the primary responsibility of 
implementing standards or guidelines for fresh water, recreational 
or drinking water quality and sewage treatment discharges rests 
with provincial and territorial governments and not with the federal 
government in Ottawa. The role of the federal government is to 
supply leadership and advice in support of the provincial and 
territorial governments through the co-operative establishment of 
national guidelines and appropriate action in the federal domain.
<P>
	National guidelines exist in this area and are constantly being 
updated. For example, through federal and  provincial 
co-operation, health based guidelines for drinking water and 
recreational water quality are developed. In fact, the fifth edition of 
``The Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality'' was 
published in May 1993. This document is popular among those 
who study water quality issues. The document recommends limits 
for microbiological, chemical and radiological contaminants which 
have been found in drinking water and are known or suspected to 
be harmful.
<P>
	The guidelines are used in all parts of Canada. They are 
developed in co-operation with the health and environment 
ministries of the provinces and territories. The guidelines fall under 
the auspices of the Federal-Provincial Subcommittee on Drinking 
Water. It is important work which is in progress.
<P>
	The process began in the 1970s. For this reason among others, 
Canada's drinking water is one of the safest drinking waters in the 
world. We have to recognize how fortunate we are in this country to 
have this supply of safe fresh water.
<P>
	The impact of standards for sewerage is to protect raw water 
sources which might be used by Canadians for drinking water or 
recreational purposes. It is the raw water sources which we are 
talking about.
<P>
	The environment is one of the key determinants of population 
health. We all know these days about the increase in allergies and 
respiratory illnesses which seem to be traceable to environmental 
causes. Water quality is an important indicator of our efforts to 
protect human health in this area.
<P>
	Of the many environmental factors, the quality of their drinking 
water is of major concern to Canadians. We know this from a 
number of public surveys and consultations which the government 
has undertaken. We also know that Canada is in the enviable 
position of having great riches of fresh water within its boundaries. 
I believe that Canada has the greatest resource of fresh water in the 
world. Approximately 83 countries in the world do not have access 
to fresh drinking water. It is atrocious. The problem is the greatest 
in those countries which are highly populated.
<P>
	Our infrastructure program is a co-operative effort of federal, 
provincial, territorial and municipal governments. It is already 
being used to upgrade and improve sewage treatment across the 
country, just as it is in my riding with the upgrading of the Mill 
Cove sewage treatment plant. This is in keeping with our red book 
commitments.
<P>
<B>(1855 )</B>
<P>
	In our present situation, the federal, provincial, territorial and 
municipal governments are prioritizing the infrastructure works 
program to benefit all Canadians because we have to look at what is 
vital to Canadians. Microbiological characteristics of the water are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16649"> 16649 </A></B>
<P>
still  considered to be vital to public health protection and for that 
reason guidelines are under continuous scrutiny.
<P>
	There are microbiological guidelines for coliform and total 
bacteria in drinking water. In fact, it was recently updated and 
sections on viruses and protozoa in finished water are being 
prepared. Microbiological contaminants will not be removed from 
source water if we adopt this motion. This motion will not reduce 
trace chemical contaminants in the fresh water supply to our 
municipal drinking water systems.
<P>
	It will not help, for example, in the case of Five Island Lake 
where the lake system is contaminated by a PCB site or actually an 
orphan site which has a number of toxins which need to be cleaned 
up. This motion will not address the problem of that water system.
<P>
	The establishment of a national primary sewage treatment 
standard will not improve the microbiological qualities of drinking 
water, nor will it significantly improve fresh water quality.
<P>
	One of the important things we should be moving toward in this 
regard and one of the things happening in Halifax, for example, is 
the work toward the removal of toxins and other contaminants at 
source. That is a very important step we have to take. It is a matter 
of taking responsibility for the quality of our water and what we 
dump into our sinks and into our water system.
<P>
	We have an obligation to all Canadians to expend our resources 
in the most efficient manner possible. Every dollar we spend must 
have the maximum possible health benefit to the Canadian public. 
Health Canada has a duty to Canadians to address serious health 
issues affecting water quality. We are concerned with 
disease-causing organisms and cancer-causing chemicals in our 
water. We have to be concerned about those things more and more 
these days.
<P>
	These are the serious issues of the day that Health Canada is 
addressing. These are also the issues that will not be touched on by 
this proposed motion. Since primary sewage treatment will not 
reduce organic substances found in source water from municipal 
drinking water and disinfection is essential to maintain a safe 
drinking water supply that will protect the public health, the 
establishment of a minimum standard of primary treatment will 
have little public health benefit with respect to drinking water.
<P>
	Water quality improvements are already occurring under the 
Canada infrastructure works program, the Canada-Ontario 
agreement to clean up the Great Lakes and the Quebec-Canada 
entente to address issues in the St. Lawrence River basin.
<P>
	I believe the member for Comox-Alberni had the best of 
intentions in putting forward this motion. Unfortunately, it does not 
address the real problems facing Canadians today. An isolated 
program to spend large sums of money on municipal sewage 
treatment will  cost Canadian taxpayers dearly without doing much 
to increase public health protection.
<P>
	Health Canada is working now in partnership with other levels of 
government to improve water quality across the country. These are 
the initiatives we must continue to develop to ensure that the 
quality of our drinking water remains the envy of the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by saying I have a particular 
interest in this topic, because the riding of 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, which I have the privilege to 
represent in this House, happens to have one of the largest waste 
water treatment plants in Canada.
<P>
	Officially opened on November 2, 1987, the Montreal Urban 
Community waste water treatment plant today has an average 
capacity of more than 23 cubic metres per second, so that between 
January 1, 1995 and October 15, and this is just an example, the 
plant processed about 578 million cubic metres of waste water. To 
give you a better idea of what is involved, this is the equivalent of 
the volume of the Olympic stadium.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	And to give you some idea of the amount of sludge left after this 
process, imagine a line of 25 tonne trucks all the way from 
Montreal to Ottawa, in other words, it is a plant operating at full 
capacity.
<P>
	I may add that to carry out these operations, the plant in my 
riding has a total budget of about $43 million, in fact slightly more, 
and employs a total of 290 people in treatment operations, 
maintenance, engineering, mechanical engineering and data 
processing, in other words, all the people who work in this plant. 
Generally speaking, waste water treatment plants have become 
indispensable in our modern cities.
<P>
	That being said, the Bloc Quebecois takes the position that we 
support the principle of protecting the environment, but to us it is 
obvious that the environment is better protected when each 
government does what it is supposed to do.
<P>
	That is why the amendment moved by the hon. member for 
Laurentides is so important, since if motion M-425 presented by 
the hon. member for Comox-Alberni were adopted in its present 
form, without any changes, this would give the Liberal 
government, the present government, further opportunities to do 
what it always has done, which is to invade jurisdictions that are 
not its responsibility. Basically, that is the reasoning behind the 
motion of the hon. member for Laurentides.
<P>
	Motion M-425 before the House today asks this House to 
support the undertaking of a country-wide program of improving 
the treatment of municipal sewage to a minimum standard of at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16650"> 16650 </A></B>
<P>
least that of primary treatment  facilities, in other words, facilities 
that will eliminate phosphorus deposits.
<P>
	Currently, managing the environment is largely a municipal 
responsibility. Municipalities are responsible for supplying clean 
water, as we said previously, for sewage treatment and garbage 
collection and disposal.
<P>
	Under the Constitution, and that is the crux of the matter, 
municipalities are administrative units that receive their powers 
from the provincial legislatures. Consequently, the federal 
government has no legitimate right to deal directly with 
municipalities.
<P>
	Of course, in Quebec we are accustomed to seeing the federal 
government proceed in this way. I may recall that it was this kind of 
behaviour by the federal government that caused nearly half the 
population of Quebec, nearly 50 per cent, to vote yes on October 
30, and it will certainly be a little more than 50 per cent next time.
<P>
	Since this government has shown it has no intention of changing 
any of the bad habits we have been criticizing for the past 30 years, 
we can assume that, at the time of the next referendum on Quebec, 
more and more Quebecers will understand they have only two 
choices left: become a majority with full control over their destiny 
or remain a minority, with their interests subjugated to those of the 
majority to which they will not belong.
<P>
	To say the least, it is disappointing, but nevertheless, quite 
incredible, that this motion is being proposed in this House by a 
member of the Reform Party. We all know our friends in the 
Reform Party claim to want to decentralize Canada. They see it as 
the likely solution to our political problems. It might not be 
constitutional decentralization, but a real decentralization of 
powers to the provinces. Obviously this bill invades provincial 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	I find it unfortunate that the Reform Party is sponsoring this bill. 
This party, it must be remembered, initially set itself up as the 
alternative to the impasse Canada found itself in federally 
following the failure of the Meech Lake Accord and all that 
followed. The text of the motion before us, however, shows that the 
more things change, the more they stay the same. They are still 
talking about more centralization, as if nothing happened in 
Quebec.
<P>
	As we know, and as the English language papers pointed out, our 
Prime Minister succeeded to some extent in lulling Canada into a 
bit of a stupor over what was actually happening in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	Events in Quebec woke people up somewhat. Now they are 
trying to pretend nothing happened and settle everyone down 
again, while they go on centralizing in Ottawa, as if nothing has 
changed.
<P>
	By voting in favour of this motion without the necessary 
amendments-one of which has been proposed by my colleague 
for Laurentides-the federalist parties in this House will simply 
confirm to Quebec voters that the no side did not favour change, 
despite what they hoped and continue to hope.
<P>
	That is why my colleague from Laurentides put forward an 
amendment to this motion that would give all provinces the right to 
opt out with full financial compensation, so that they themselves 
could spend the money on the environment and not on anything 
else.
<P>
	This amendment would have two advantages among other 
things. First, from a constitutional point of view, it would allow all 
levels of government to exercise their powers properly in their 
respective areas of jurisdiction, contrary to what is now the case. I 
would like to remind you that the environment is not among the 
areas of jurisdiction explicitly assigned by the constitution. It has 
often been said that the environment was not on the agenda when 
the constitution was drafted, but still. This is a so-called ancillary 
power deriving from the areas of jurisdiction explicitly mentioned 
in the Canadian constitution.
<P>
	Before the mid-1980s, the Quebec government, which has 
jurisdiction over local and territorial matters, played a key role in 
assuming most environmental responsibilities. As provided for in 
the constitution, the federal government was happy to get involved 
in areas complementary to its jurisdiction, and everything was just 
fine.
<P>
	In 1985, the federal government started to become much more 
involved in environmental matters. It did so mostly by using its 
spending power and the new powers it had been granted by the 
courts. This has led to many cases of overlap and duplication. This 
situation has gotten worse since the election of the present Liberal 
government, which is trying to further centralize decision making 
in Ottawa.
<P>
	If there is one thing that is perfectly clear about the bills that I 
have seen tabled in this House, it is that almost every bill 
introduced to amend other bills or to encroach on areas of 
jurisdiction that may previously not have been clearly defined 
gives ever more authority to the ministers.
<P>
	At present, there is a great deal of duplication and overlap in 
federal and provincial environmental regulations. Therefore, 
private sector enterprises often have to spend time, energy and 
money on gathering information on a large number of programs, 
answering inquiries from both levels of government, attending 
numerous committee meetings, preparing for inspections that are 
often conducted by both levels, meeting requirements that are often 
different depending on the level of government involved, and the 
list goes on ad infinitum.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16651"> 16651 </A></B>
<P>
	For instance, there are currently eight federal regulations 
overlapping existing Quebec regulations on the same subject. Yet, 
they keep wanting to make more regulations and centralizing more 
and more. Cases in point are the storage of PCB material 
regulations and pulp and paper effluent regulations.
<P>
	There are also environmental benefits, since appropriate 
solutions to problems to be dealt with locally will be easier to find. 
You will no doubt agree, Mr. Speaker, that local authorities are in a 
better position than anyone else to find solutions suited to the 
particular circumstances of their respective communities. As far as 
the environment is concerned, government's ability to understand 
local problems and challenges depends on how far removed it is 
from the field. The further it is, the less it is able to find practical 
solutions likely to gain acceptance and generate co-operation 
within local communities. That is the spirit behind the amendment 
moved by my hon. colleague for Laurentides, which we support.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am here today on behalf of the government to address MotionNo. M-425 put forward by the member for Comox-Alberni. It calls 
for a country-wide program of improving the treatment of 
municipal sewage to a minimum standard or at least that of primary 
treatment facilities.
<P>
	A basic weakness of the motion is that it proposes to solve the 
problem of municipal waste water through the use of a specific 
directed technology. Since when have Reform Party members 
believed in imposing the use for every province of a uniform 
method when they do not even believe in the consistent application 
of a basic health care principle.
<P>
<B>(1910 )</B>
<P>
	What we should be concerned about is not the process used to 
effect treatment of municipal waste water, but the quality of the 
final product and its subsequent short and long term effects on 
humans and the ecosystem. The shortsightedness of this bill is 
typical of many Reform motions: immediate, quick fixes that show 
the lack of experience that comes from not really understanding 
how other jurisdictions of government work, how the municipal 
political mind works.
<P>
	While the Canadian Federation of Mayors has been consistently 
requesting an infrastructure program, the first government to take 
the request seriously was the Liberal government. A minister was 
put in charge of the program who has been a well respected, long 
serving mayor and he tailored the program to suit the unique and 
individual needs of all municipalities, municipalities that are 
fiercely protective of their jurisdictions.
<P>
	Under the federal Fisheries Act, for example, no person 
including a municipality, is allowed to discharge  water where fish 
are found or treated water which contains any substance that is 
harmful to fish. The focus should not be on what technology is used 
to treat municipal water waste, including domestic sewage, but on 
the final quality of the water.
<P>
	As a technology for treating municipal waste water, primary 
treatment is a physical, mechanical process, very simplistic at best. 
It can remove material like sand, grit, stones, twigs and larger 
objects like wood and plastic. It can settle out the heavy organics of 
domestic sewage, but that is about all primary treatment can 
achieve.
<P>
	A fundamental concern related to municipal waste water is how 
much oxygen demanding matter it contains. Oxygen demanding 
matter takes up oxygen from its environment to decompose. A 
primary treatment system, if efficiently designed and operated, can 
only reduce up to 40 per cent of the oxygen demanding substances 
found in municipal waste water. The remaining 60 per cent will be 
discharged into the system.
<P>
	It is important to remove as much organic matter as possible that 
requires oxygen to decompose from municipal waste water so it 
does not consume oxygen that fish need to thrive. Such matter does 
not then demand heavy chlorination and subsequent disinfection 
processes.
<P>
	Primary treatment cannot address concerns related to toxins, 
including removal of heavy metals that are commonly found in 
Canadian municipalities.
<P>
	A country-wide program of improving the treatment of 
municipal sewage to a minimum standard of at least that of primary 
treatment facilities will not in all cases adequately conserve and 
protect the environment. More important, in the jurisdiction of 
water treatment, municipalities will, en masse, cry foul if the 
federal government presumes to tell them how to achieve a 
technology that many of them have to this date perfected in an 
extremely economical manner.
<P>
	I would not like to be the federal politician who attempts to tell 
Mayor Hazel McCallion of Mississauga, a mayor well known for 
her strength of character, how to treat her water system rather than 
what minimal standards should be maintained coming out of 
Mississauga. In fact, when the current infrastructure program was 
designed and offered to Mississauga, the city council did not 
request money for water treatment. The basic structures were in 
such good shape that Mississauga requested a one-third portion 
contribution for a living arts centre which created, as an aside, 950 
jobs.
<P>
	The standard of water in Mississauga is absolutely one of the 
highest in the country. No government has ever told the city how to 
do this.
<P>
	Improving the treatment of municipal sewage is a commendable 
objective, but it does not fully address the issue of conservation and 
effective management of  Canada's water sources. What is urgently 
needed at the municipal level is sewer use bylaws to restrict access 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16652"> 16652 </A></B>
<P>
to the sewer systems of substances not amenable to treatment. Also 
municipalities should charge water users the full and true cost of 
both supplying drinkable, usable water and treating waste water 
after its use, as is done in Mississauga. At this very time water 
charges in Mississauga are double, water amount going in and 
water amount going out.
<P>
	Municipal water in Canada has traditionally been underpriced in 
comparison to other utilities or essential services. Many years of 
water prices set at artificially low levels by municipalities have not 
allowed Canadian communities to accumulate adequate reserve 
funds for renovation and upgrading of water infrastructure. Also 
low water prices have offered no incentive for technological 
advance. Thus, the municipal water industry has been left with old 
technologies, inefficient plants and very low levels of innovation.
<P>
	A country-wide program to improve sewage treatment to at least 
the level of primary treatment would still leave all current pricing 
problems intact and without resolution.
<P>
<B>(1915 )</B>
<P>
	According to 1991 statistics, which are the most recent figures 
available, the level of revenues collected by Canadian 
municipalities for water use and sewerage charges is in the order of 
$3.3 billion. With the probable exception of property taxes, 
revenues from water use are the largest source of income for 
municipal governments. At current prices, for many Canadian 
municipalities this revenue source is still insufficient for 
municipalities to operate and maintain their water infrastructures.
<P>
	What are Canadians to do to deal with this apparent shortfall? 
Surprisingly, researchers have found that as the price of water 
increases, the demand decreases. This is not witchcraft. We have 
all seen this in the pricing of many commodities.
<P>
	In accordance with the polluter pays principle, municipal water 
customers should pay for waste water treatment according to their 
level of water use. The federal government cannot be big brother 
and pay for all minimal water treatment across the country. 
Treatment according to the level of water use is the most important 
product of proper water conservation.
<P>
	Similarly, industries that use municipal sewers and treatment as 
their primary or only method of waste water abatement should pay 
for the extra stress they place on water treatment plants. Perhaps 
municipalities should even pay their provinces in proportion to the 
level of contamination of their effluent for the right to deposit their 
waste water in lakes, rivers, and other communal waterways.
<P>
	Cheap water in Canada has led to unnecessarily high water 
usage. Higher water usage has led municipalities to  install water 
systems that are larger than would be needed if realistic pricing 
policies were implemented by Canadian communities to bring out 
true water conservation.
<P>
	I believe water conservation is the real way of the future. Pricing 
based on quantity of water used provides each user with the 
incentive to conserve water. This leads to cost savings by water 
consumers as well as municipalities themselves in terms of their 
capital expenditures and maintenance costs of waste water 
treatment plants. It also encourages less reliance on unpredictable 
purification chemicals, which in the future may cause other 
problems.
<P>
	Let me emphasize that there is wastage by the consumer, who 
has no incentive, financial or otherwise, to conserve water supplies. 
In addition, public utilities find it cheaper to process and pump 
more clean water through the system than to find and repair 
expensive leaks. In some areas of Canada, system leakage accounts 
for 40 per cent of total pumping. Country-wide primary treatment 
for municipal sewage, as proposed by the hon. member for 
Comox-Alberni, will do nothing to correct that.
<P>
	If I may call the attention of the hon. members to the 1987 
federal water policy, the concept of full cost pricing, which 
includes extra sewer charges for industrial waste and the promotion 
of universal metering, is a cornerstone of that document. The 
infrastructure related components of the federal water policy 
accord well with the policies outlined in <I>Creating Opportunity</I>, our 
Liberal plan for Canada.
<P>
	The 1987 federal water policy is based on a user pay principle. 
This means users should be responsible for funding a particular 
service in approximate proportion to their consumption. User pay 
wherever possible is an appropriate principle for our times and one 
this government endorses.
<P>
	To monitor the progress of implementation of the 1987 federal 
water policy, Environment Canada undertook in 1991 a survey of 
water piping practices among Canadian municipalities of at least 
1,000 inhabitants or more. The results were somewhat of a 
disappointment. The Government of Canada had spent the four 
years since the release of the 1987 federal water policy promoting 
the benefits of full cost pricing as a means of water conservation 
and adequate financing of water infrastructure programs. 
Environment Canada found, however, that half of the surveyed 
municipalities were still charging a flat rate for water use.
<P>
	Under such circumstances there is no incentive for water 
consumers to lower their consumption. In addition, water 
customers often have no idea of how much water they are actually 
using, as there is no meter attached to their facility or home, 
counting and then compiling the number of cubic metres of water 
used.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16653"> 16653 </A></B>
<P>
	In summary, a country-wide program that would have the sole 
goal of improving municipal sewage treatment to the minimum 
level of primary treatment will not solve Canada's problems in 
the area of municipal waste water treatment. Minimal chemical 
purification and ultimately a serious concern for conservation of 
this valuable resource is the true direction this government should 
be taking. Therefore I will not be supporting a very shortsighted 
bill at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
wager that if Motion M-425 came from the other side of the House 
it would be getting a different hearing in the House.
<P>
<B>(1920 )</B>
<P>
	I cannot imagine anyone concerned about clean water and health 
issues saying that this bill will not look after all the problems of 
Canada in terms of our water supply. Who says it would? Motion 
425 simply calls for raising the standard in Canada to a minimal 
standard, a standard that would have solid settling, chlorination, 
and discharge of sewage in a much different manner from what we 
have today. Is it simplistic to try to raise the standard of water 
treatment in Canada? Where I come from it is not.
<P>
	I would like to tell a little story relating to water quality. I am a 
fisherman. I enjoy sport fishing. The river that flows through the 
community near me is world class as a sport fishing river, the Bow 
River. In my youth I fished in that river and was unable to eat the 
fish. They were beautiful rainbow trout, wonderful to catch. A 
24-inch rainbow would take me 20 minutes to land, but I released 
every one. They were oily downstream of Calgary. There was a 
huge amount of waste going into the Bow River.
<P>
	I have a cousin in England who is a very keen fisherman. He 
came all the way from England to fish in the Bow River with me. 
He asked me whether I expected he would catch a wild trout in this 
beautiful stretch of water. I pretty well guaranteed him that he 
would. I told him what time of year to come. I said that I had some 
experience there and had the opportunity to just about guarantee 
him that unless there was a change in weather, a tremendous 
amount of extra mud in the water, he would be guaranteed a fish.
<P>
	He did catch the first wild rainbow trout of his life. I will never 
forget him holding that beautiful fish out of the water and asking 
for a picture to be taken, then saying to me, ``I must release this 
fish, it will be polluted''. I was able to say to him, ``No, Derrick, 
that fish today is edible''. Over the 25 years since I had been 
fishing this river Calgary had cleaned up its act to the point where 
this beautiful fish could be eaten. He said, ``I am a conservationist, 
I think I will release it anyway''. And he did.
<P>
	Does the treatment of effluent downstream of a big city make 
any difference? I believe it does.
<P>
	I heard all kinds of praise for the infrastructure program from 
members opposite, an infrastructure program that I flatly think is 
an abject failure. To borrow $6 billion and mortgage the future of 
my children and my grandchildren to provide short term jobs in 
Canada is fundamentally flawed.
<P>
	I will give one example of how badly the infrastructure program 
failed. This is a municipality I am responsible for in my own 
constituency.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Are you going to make the announcement?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> You bet. I am making that announcement 
here in front of everybody in Canada.
<P>
	The infrastructure program was a pronounced failure in a 
constituency at home. What did the municipality do for 
infrastructure in my own constituency? It bought a grader, a 
Yankee-built grader. It shipped it home by a U.S. trucker. It paid for 
it with borrowed dollars. It produced one job, just one job. The 
infrastructure program in this municipality produced one job. Is 
that an advantage? That is an advantage for whom? It is an 
advantage for a U.S. manufacturer with a grader. The infrastructure 
program is an abject failure.
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	This bill will simply raise the standard in Canada. Will it solve 
all the problems in Canada? It will not. If this bill were coming 
from the other side of the House, there would be effusive praise for 
such a bill. Since it is not, I am convinced it will not gain support.
<P>
	I ask members opposite, how can they argue against cleaner 
water in Canada? How can they argue with that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to speak to Motion M-425 because I want 
my Reform colleagues to know that I support it wholeheartedly. I 
am delighted indeed that the Reform Party has brought it forward.
<P>
	I regret that my colleague from Mississauga West and I find 
ourselves on different sides of this debate. The reason I support this 
bill so wholeheartedly is that not only does it address a very serious 
problem and address it in a very responsible way, but it also 
addresses the problem of federalism versus regionalism. I find to 
my absolute delight that the Reform Party has put a motion on the 
floor that actually argues for a strong central government rather 
than regionalism, as that party tends to support generally.
<P>
	I am very aware of the sewage problem that occurs in Victoria, 
where sewage treatment consists of building a longer pipe into the 
ocean so that the effluent does not come back to the beaches of 
Victoria. I am also aware that the United Kingdom is very angry 
right now because constantly on the beaches of the Hebrides and 
the  Orkneys and the northern coast of Scotland are effluent, plastic 
materials, and garbage that can be identified as coming from 
Canada. This is absolutely an intolerable situation.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16654"> 16654 </A></B>
<P>
	Why can we not rely on municipalities to spend the money to 
give the kinds of treatment facilities that are demanded by this 
motion? The answer is that municipalities are driven by local 
interests. Often they have priorities that are very local and are 
unwilling to support things that actually pertain to society at large 
and to our global environment. In other words, if it is not in one's 
own local backyard then it is easier to spend elsewhere.
<P>
	We have a situation where regional interests cannot look after 
the problem and we must look to a strong federal government to 
provide the money and the leadership to attack this problem. I 
regret absolutely that we do not have in the Constitution some 
provision that says the federal government would have the power to 
prevent Victoria from simply dumping sewage into the sea.
<P>
	Not only is this motion well taken, but it is ironic, because it 
shows that the third party-and I have great admiration for the 
third party on certain issues-supports the kind of concept that we 
Liberals have when we see a strong central government showing 
leadership in many ways.
<P>
	I have to add that implicit in this motion is the suggestion that 
the federal government should have the necessary funds to provide 
minimum sewage treatment in various municipalities across the 
land.
<P>
	In conclusion, I do not support the Bloc amendment because that 
is a regional amendment, but I want the Reform Party to know, 
especially the member for Comox-Alberni, that this is a very fine 
motion. I congratulate them on bringing it before the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 98, the order is dropped to the bottom 
of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFNATIONALDEFENCE">DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise pursuant to Standing Order 38 on behalf of the 
constituents of  Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt on an issue of 
national importance.
<P>
	On October 3, 1995 I asked the Minister of National Defence a 
question pertaining to Colonel Kenward who ordered the 
destruction of video tape evidence of an airborne regiment hazing 
video. The minister's response was, to say the least, insufficient.
<P>
	The video tapes that were ordered destroyed impeded the 
investigation of the military police. Lieutenant-Colonel Kenward 
who was subsequently promoted to full colonel by the chief of the 
defence staff despite the minister's own reservations ordered the 
destruction of the video tapes. It was later revealed that three 
copies of the video tape existed.
<P>
	This does not justify the actions of Lieutenant-Colonel Kenward. 
There will never be any way of knowing whether the three copies 
match the one destroyed by Lieutenant-Colonel Kenward's order.
<P>
	This case is an example of the serious problems with the system 
of justice at the Department of National Defence. This case may in 
fact be providing details of a miscarriage of justice within the 
senior command of the Department of National Defence.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence notified me in his response on 
October 3 that the chief of defence staff, General John de 
Chastelain, would hold a press conference on the issue to clear the 
air. I personally attended that press conference and I would like to 
say that it did not clear the air. It muddied the waters further.
<P>
	The CDS presented the official side of the story with a 
documented audit trail detailing how Lieutenant-Colonel Kenward 
was promoted to full colonel. What became clear from these 
documents was that the chief of defence staff had intervened on 
behalf of Lieutenant-Colonel Kenward to ensure his promotion.
<P>
	Documents he released showed that he wrote to the Canadian 
Armed Forces judge advocate general on behalf of 
Lieutenant-Colonel Kenward. The correspondence included quotes 
from Kenward himself denying that he had intended any 
wrongdoing. The judge advocate general, after considering this 
counsel from his superior, the chief of defence staff, cleared 
Kenward's name and cleared the way for Kenward's promotion.
<P>
	This type of shenanigans underlines the culture of cover-up at 
the highest level of the Department of National Defence. 
Kenward's promotion to full colonel was secured despite the 
concerns of the military police and the Minister of National 
Defence.
<P>
	The minister has publicly admitted that he expressed his 
concerns regarding the promotion to the chief of defence staff and 
the chief of defence staff refused to heed them. Clearly the minister 
has no confidence in the CDS and the CDS has little respect for the 
minister's judgment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16655"> 16655 </A></B>
<P>
	This case is indicative of the problems with our military justice 
system. It is difficult to believe that the military police had their 
investigation thwarted by the chief of defence staff and the judge 
advocate general.
<P>
	I believe that justice was not served. Canadians still want the 
Minister of National Defence to clarify his position. When did the 
Minister of National Defence learn that Colonel Kenward had 
destroyed video tape evidence? Was it before or after the 
promotion? Why did he have reservations about the promotion of 
Kenward to full colonel?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this all relates to Somalia and the airborne. The hon. 
member is clearly misguided in his attempts to discredit the 
Minister of National Defence and the government.
<P>
	The Reform Party platform of using specious arguments and half 
truths for partisan gain has done nothing to help Canada deal with 
the issue at hand.
<P>
	By contrast, the Minister of National Defence and the 
government have acted forthrightly and effectively. I believe this is 
what Canadians are seeing and what they are asking for. They are 
rejecting the disparaging arguments being put forth by the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	Let us look at the facts. It was this government that called for an 
inquiry. More specifically, it was this member as opposition 
defence critic who asked for the inquiry two and a half years ago, 
not the Reform Party. It was this government that ensured the 
inquiry would be public. It was this government that made the 
commitment to make Canadian forces members available to the 
commission when they were called upon to testify. It was this 
government that encouraged people with any information that may 
be of interest to the commission to go forward to the inquiry. It was 
this government that ensured the Somali inquiry was provided with 
complete and accurate information and that relevant documents 
were made available to the commission.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	DND and the Canadian forces have and will continue to 
co-operate fully with the commission that has been established. 
Not all our actions have been easy. The public rightfully demanded 
that the government address this serious issue in an expedient 
manner, but this had to be tempered with prudence. Where others 
may have attempted to score quick political points, we stayed the 
course waiting for the Westray mine decision so that justice would 
not later be undone as a result of a legal technicality.
<P>
	These actions point toward leadership, integrity and a 
willingness to get things done. There is nothing to sustain the 
utterly fallacious and ultimately destructive arguments being put 
forward by the Reform Party. We will certainly not be goaded into 
taking ill advice and  precipitous action. We are monitoring the 
commission proceedings. Canadians can rest assured that 
appropriate actions will be initiated when and where they are 
warranted.
<P>
	Now is the time to let the commission do its work. We look 
forward to hearing the recommendations of the commission. In 
summary, the Canadian forces have a long and proud heritage that 
we are not prepared to discard. I suggest that the Reform Party 
shares this sentiment.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CUBA">CUBA</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, some time ago 
I had occasion to ask the minister about the issue of the 
Helms-Burton bill dealing with an embargo against goods from 
Cuba. I should like to introduce my question this evening by 
reminding the representative of the ministry about some of the 
facts of the bill.
<P>
	We in Canada share the interest of American legislators and 
Americans generally in seeing Cuba begin to respect human rights 
and to open up its economy to forces from outside so that it has a 
liberal, open economy for the benefit of all Cuban citizens. What 
we are talking about here is the methodology whereby this change 
may be obtained.
<P>
	We believe, it seems to me in our government, in a form of open 
trading whereby we can liberalize trade relationships by having 
relations with one another. The United States, for some reason not 
difficult to understand because it is rooted in U.S. domestic 
politics, has chosen in respect of Cuba an embargo that flies in the 
face of its policies with respect to other countries and that seeks to 
penalize the Cuban government and the Cuban people for the fact 
that they are unwilling to conform to U.S. standards and practices.
<P>
	We do not deny that the United States has the right to embargo 
Cuba if that is what its domestic policies call for it to do. What we 
object to, what I will ask for further information on and what I 
asked in the question I earlier posed to the minister was what we 
were doing in Canada to ensure that the measures being adopted by 
the American congress do not proceed in a way that would violate 
international law, violate international obligations of the United 
States to Canada and violate our rights to conduct our relationships 
with Cuba and the Cuban people in a way that we can ensure 
Canadian policies and Canadian law are respected.
<P>
	The bill on which I asked the question, known colloquially as the 
Helms-Burton bill, has in it several items that are very problematic 
to us as Canadians. They prohibit U.S. persons from extending 
financing to businesses that traffic in property confiscated by the 
Cuban government. A U.S. person is defined in the bill in such a 
way that it could extend to subsidiaries in Canada. It denies entry 
into the United States of persons, individuals or shareholders of 
corporations who traffic in  U.S. property. It gives to the United 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16656"> 16656 </A></B>
<P>
States courts the jurisdiction to decide compensation claims for 
property confiscated by any foreign government.
<P>
	In all respects we have serious problems with these propositions. 
It represents in many ways a secondary boycott which the United 
States has said in the past it totally disapproves of in respect of the 
Arab boycott of Israel. It represents extraterritorial measures 
against Canadian corporations carrying on lawful business in this 
country and with Cuba. It gives to the United States courts a 
jurisdiction that frankly would introduce extraordinarily difficult 
measures in respect of dealing with the United States in United 
States courts.
<P>
	These measures reflect a view of the United States congress that 
is willing to take measures against the interests of the United States 
in many respects, against international law, and against its 
international obligations to Canada and other nations. As such, it is 
a dangerous precedent because it reflects a sense of the United 
States power which says it is above the rules it has set and in which 
all of us participate.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	I would be anxious to know what measures the Government of 
Canada can take to tell the U.S. Congress what we can do to protect 
ourselves. How can we use the Extraterritorial Measures Act which 
we already have? How can we respond to Congress to let the U.S. 
know that we in this country intend to pursue our rightful place in 
the international community in a way that respects our interests and 
our proper commercial relationships with a friendly country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Rosedale and the chairman of the parliamentary Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade will agree 
with me that Canada and the U.S. share common objectives of 
democracy, human rights and market oriented reforms in Cuba. 
However, we differ on the best way to achieve such goals. Canada 
favours engagement and dialogue.
<P>
	Currently there is legislation before the U.S. Congress which 
would extend the U.S. embargo against Cuba. When the legislation 
was first introduced in February, the Canadian government 
examined it and found provisions which could be harmful to 
Canadian interests. We made our concerns known to both the 
administration and Congress. As well, businesses and other groups 
on both sides of the border have opposed the legislation. Many 
other countries have also expressed concerns over the legislation.
<P>
	Canada's key concerns related to proposals which would restrict 
imports of sugar and sugar-containing products from countries 
which import sugar from Cuba and which would allow U.S. 
citizens to make claims in U.S. courts against foreign companies 
investing in  property expropriated by the Cuban government. This 
approach to claims would be contrary to generally accepted 
principles of international law and could have repercussions on 
international investments beyond Cuba. The proposals would 
restrict entry into the U.S. of officers of certain foreign companies 
which have business dealings with Cuba.
<P>
	What is the current situation? Different versions of the bills have 
been passed by the House and the Senate and these now have to be 
reconciled in a conference committee. Canadian efforts were 
successful in having the proposed sugar restrictions removed from 
both versions of the bills.
<P>
	Our other key concerns have been partly addressed. While the 
version of the bill passed by the Senate removes the provisions on 
investment claims and temporary entry, these remain in the House 
version of the legislation. Canada is continuing to press for the 
controversial provisions dropped from the version passed by the 
Senate to not be reintroduced in any final version of the legislation.
<P>
	It is not clear when the conference committee will present a 
reconciled version of the legislation or if the common bill would be 
able to muster enough votes to pass both the House and the Senate. 
If passed, the final stage would be to send the bill to the President 
for his consideration. As the hon. member knows, the U.S. 
administration shares many of Canada's concerns. The U.S. 
Secretary of State has told Congress that he will recommend that 
President Clinton veto the bill if an unacceptable version is passed. 
Should the objectionable provisions be reinserted, Canada would 
urge a presidential veto of the bill.
<P>
	I compliment the hon. member. I know he has many connections, 
communications and dealings with colleagues in the United States. 
He has also been playing a very important role in helping us to keep 
a Canadian foreign policy, while letting the United States keep its 
foreign policy in relation to Cuba.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NUCLEARWEAPONS">NUCLEAR WEAPONS</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
November 8 I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs why Canada withdrew its sponsorship of UN 
resolution L-3 which seeks a stop to nuclear weapons tests.
<P>
	Nuclear tests are presently being carried out by the French 
government and are being planned by the Government of China. 
Both governments are contravening the spirit of the extended 
nuclear non-proliferation treaty and negotiations toward a 
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.
<P>
	It might be recalled that on September 5 the foreign affairs 
minister issued a news release in which he deplored the tests. He 
stated: ``Canada's policy on testing is clear: no testing by any 
nuclear weapons state  and speedy progress toward concluding a 
comprehensive test ban treaty''. In keeping with this policy, on 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16657"> 16657 </A></B>
<P>
October 31, Canada and the United Nations chose to co-sponsor 
UN resolution L-3 which seeks a stop to nuclear weapons tests.
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	Suddenly, on November 7, Canada and the United Nations 
decided to withdraw its co-sponsorship. The reason? It would 
appear that the sponsorship was a mistake. Whose mistake is the 
question.
<P>
	The next day, November 8, the Prime Minister from New 
Zealand re-emphasized Canada's position, stating that Canada 
deplores the actions of the French government and that Canada 
hopes the tests will stop rapidly.
<P>
	Today, on November 21, the question is: How can we deplore 
nuclear testing at the level of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
the Prime Minister, except to co-sponsor an important UN 
resolution against testing and then a week later withdraw our 
co-sponsorship of a resolution that is not only consistent with the 
views of government leaders, but also consistent with our stated 
unequivocal policy on nuclear weapons testing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
respond to the hon. member for Davenport on the subject of 
Canada's position on nuclear testing.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that today, November 21, 1995, 
Canada's position on nuclear testing rests on a bedrock of Canadian 
tradition in support of a comprehensive test ban treaty. On this 
issue, as the hon. member said, our position has been consistent 
and clear. It remains unchanged to this day: no testing by any 
nuclear weapons state.
<P>
	The government has repeatedly stated Canada's deep 
commitment to the early conclusion of a comprehensive test ban 
treaty. Such a treaty should prohibit all nuclear testing regardless of 
size, in all environments for all time. For Canada, this remains our 
most important and immediate arms control and disarmament 
priority.
<P>
	Last week, in the first committee of the United Nations General 
Assembly, Canada voted in favour of a resolution strongly 
deploring nuclear testing. Canada was also a lead co-sponsor of the 
resolution which calls for the early completion of an effective 
CTBT. Together these resolutions represent Canada's firm position 
on testing.
<P>
	Canada played a leading role in securing the indefinite extension 
of the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons last May. 
The indefinite extension of the NPT provides the foundation for 
real disarmament.
<P>
	Among the decisions agreed by all the countries of the NPT 
review conference, was the need to complete a comprehensive 
nuclear test ban treaty no later than 1996.
<P>
	Canadian actions since then have been calibrated to ensure that 
everything possible is done to meet the commitments taken in May 
and to reinforce the integrity of the non-proliferation treaty.
<P>
	Canada's active role in the CTBT negotiations in Geneva and our 
efforts to develop the necessary political support for the early 
conclusion of the CTBT within multilateral fora such as the OAS 
and the recent Commonwealth heads of government meeting have 
been buttressed by the welcomed announcements made by the 
U.S.A., U.K. and France that they support a zero threshold 
comprehensive test ban treaty. A zero threshold CTBT would ban 
all tests for all time.
<P>
	We believe that these public affirmations by three of the five 
nuclear weapon states will greatly assist the negotiations in 
reaching an early and successful conclusion to the CTBT.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me repeat yet again that Canada's position on 
nuclear testing is clear and firm. We oppose all testing and remain 
committed to a CTBT in 1996.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANWHEATBOARD">CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one of the most important issues facing prairie people 
today is the future of the Canadian Wheat Board. The vast majority 
of prairie producers support the Canadian Wheat Board and yet 
they feel that its future is being threatened. There are many reasons 
for this, not the least of which has been the federal minister of 
agriculture's complete reluctance to stand up for the board 
whenever it needed defending.
<P>
	The latest threat, however, is the continued freelancing of wheat 
into the United States by individuals who seem to think they can 
ignore the law to further their own goals.
<P>
<B>(1950 )</B>
<P>
	There have been numerous organized attempts to cross the 
border from Canada into the United States to sell wheat. These are 
strictly prohibited by Canadian law. In doing so, these freelancers 
are exacerbating trade tensions between Canada and the United 
States, are risking the complete shutdown of agricultural trade 
between Canada and the United States, or at the very least are 
risking the imposition of yet another cap on the sales that currently 
occur under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Things are not getting any better out there. Canada has enjoyed 
some very good wheat sales into the United States. Millers and 
pasta makers want our high quality durum and the Canadian Wheat 
Board has been taking full advantage of that in promoting the high 
quality Canadian product throughout the U.S. marketplace.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16658"> 16658 </A></B>
<P>
	But U.S. farmers do not like this. There is a lot of political and 
public pressure on U.S. congressmen and senators to stop the 
cross-border traffic in wheat. Canada could very well find itself 
squaring off with the United States in the near future, not just 
across our border, but in the world marketplace as well. This is 
looking more and more likely as the new U.S. farm bill comes 
into being.
<P>
	The Americans are looking at maintaining a dominant role in the 
world marketplace. They are looking to increase their grain 
production. They are expecting to leave their export enhancement 
program in place. When you add this into the pot with the negative 
feeling toward those north of the border, that could certainly be bad 
news for Canada.
<P>
	In maintaining friendly trading relations with the United States, 
the Canadian Wheat Board has successfully sold tonnes of wheat 
into the United States over the years. The wheat has moved quietly 
and quickly into the U.S. market and Canadian farmers who respect 
the board have been rewarded with increased payments from the 
board.
<P>
	In supporting the board, Saskatchewan's minister of agriculture, 
Andy Renaud, said: ``The Canadian Wheat Board can move grain 
into the U.S. for the benefit of all prairie farmers, not just a few, 
and do it in a way that minimizes as much as possible the threat of 
new trade restrictions''.
<P>
	He also said that the Saskatchewan government supports strong 
action to stop illegal sales to ensure that the U.S. market remains 
open for all farmers.
<P>
	The Americans, and in particular the American multi-national 
grain corporations, realize the strength of the board and have been 
campaigning to force us to get rid of it. The board has been so 
successful that the U.S. feels threatened by it. Now some Canadian 
farmers are joining forces with these Americans to try to kill the 
board.
<P>
	They falsely believe that without the board they will have better 
success at marketing their own grains in the United States. The 
board is defending itself in the marketplace, but it needs help from 
Canada's minister of agriculture. Good words are one thing, but 
actions are more important.
<P>
	At a recent grain industry general meeting, the minister said that 
those who cross the border with grain for sale are law breakers and 
that those who violate the law are harming their cause to get 
changes to the Canadian Wheat Board Act.
<P>
	In response, I urge the minister not to make changes to the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act. And one more time I ask him, is he 
prepared to take whatever action is necessary to defend single desk 
selling and enforce the rules and regulations as they have been set 
out in Canadian law?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question and his 
comments.
<P>
	I say at the outset that many, if not all my constituents, are going 
to be surprised to see me stand up and answer a question on prairie 
farmers and the Canadian Wheat Board, but as you know the duties 
of a parliamentary secretary are many and varied, particularly 
during the adjournment debate.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board Act and Canadian Wheat Board 
regulations, as the hon. member knows, state that any export of 
wheat and barley requires an export licence issued by the Canadian 
Wheat Board. The law is very clear on this point.
<P>
	The Customs Act, administered by Revenue Canada, is applied 
in support of the Canadian Wheat Board program, requiring 
exporters shipping wheat and barley to the United States to first 
obtain an export licence. It is very clear.
<P>
	Proceeds from the sales of the unauthorized exports are not 
deposited into the Canadian Wheat Board pooling accounts. 
Therefore, when this occurs, producers who comply with the wheat 
board export program receive no benefit and are hurt by the 
resultant loss of the potential export opportunities engendered by 
the legal freelancers, as pointed out by the hon. member.
<P>
	Within the democratic system of government in Canada there are 
other ways to work for change without deliberately engaging in 
unauthorized and illegal activities which may create unnecessary 
problems with the management of our international trade relations.
<P>
	The western grain marketing panel process was put in place so 
that grain farmers, industry and other shareholders, could have an 
opportunity to participate in a number of grassroot forums to 
discuss the current grain marketing system, including the Canadian 
Wheat Board.
<P>
	On behalf of the minister of agriculture, I would advise those 
who are dissatisfied with the current marketing system to 
participate fully in the western grain marketing panel and its 
process to improve the system and to do what the hon. member is 
suggesting is a more orderly method of conducting business.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 
38, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at2 p.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.56 p.m.)
