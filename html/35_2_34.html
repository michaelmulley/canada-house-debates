second time and referred to a committee, and the amendment and 
the amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have an opportunity to talk about the budget bill which is 
before us today.
<P>
	The budget is very much about preserving the future for 
Canadians. A major thrust is preserving our social programs and 
particularly the pension plans which have done so much to alleviate 
poverty among the elderly and provide Canada's seniors with a safe 
and secure retirement from an economic point of view. We want to  
make sure that we are able to continue to offer that same sense of 
security to today's young people when they are retired.
<P>
	The budget is also about preserving economic opportunities for 
Canadians, with a very heavy emphasis on enhancing trade 
opportunities, removing internal trade barriers as well as getting 
more Canadians out there in the international marketplace trading, 
producing jobs and economic prosperity here at home.
<P>
	It is about recognizing that the knowledge industries are where 
the job opportunities of the future will be and investing 
strategically what limited resources we have in those areas of 
technology that we think offer the greatest potential.
<P>
	We promised Canadians that we would deliver efficient, 
effective government. We have done that through putting Canada's 
economic and fiscal position in a much better state and moving 
toward a balanced budget and eventually debt reduction. We have 
done it with no tax rate increases at all in this budget. In fact, in the 
last three budgets there has not been an increase in personal tax 
rates.
<P>
	Part of the plan has been smaller, more effective, more 
affordable government, to look at what we do as a government, to 
look at how we do it and to look at how we can do it better. Part of 
that has been examining the best ways to deliver services. Some 
measures involve privatization and the setting up of special 
agencies which will operate in a much tighter and more 
accountable way.
<P>
	Part has simply been to stop doing things that we felt 
government no longer needed to do and sorting out with the 
provinces what is their proper area of activity and what is ours, 
especially in those areas of government endeavour where there is 
overlap and duplication between the two levels of government.
<P>
	As we have been going through this change there is no question 
at all that it has had a significant impact on employees, many of 
them my constituents. The fundamental principles, as we have 
gone through this period of change and as we continue through it, is 
to be fair to employees, to make changes in a way that will be less 
disruptive to them, to their lives, to their careers and to their 
families.
<P>
	I want to put a few comments on the record on areas where we 
have achieved that with some success because some comments 
were made in the House yesterday that  did not quite accurately 
reflect things that have been done and things that are planned. 
When my colleague from the Reform Party, the hon. member for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1994"> 1994 </A></B>
<P>
St. Albert spoke, I hope he was ill-informed and was not being 
mischievous with the facts of the situation.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	I will put on the record a couple of facts that may correct some 
misapprehensions arising from his speech yesterday. He talked 
about air navigational service employees. It is important to know 
these employees will receive their severance pay when they move 
to NavCan. The employer has respected the collective agreement 
which was in place at the time the agreement was signed. 
Subsequent negotiations have occurred on the treatment of 
employees who will be affected by alternative delivery 
mechanisms, some of which I have mentioned.
<P>
	The majority of public service unions, although not those 
representing the majority of employees, agreed to changes in the 
collective agreement such that severance payments will not be 
made at the time of transfer, but the liability for that severance 
payment will be transferred to the new employer when the 
collective agreement is transferred through successor rights.
<P>
	This agreement with the unions was conditional on the 
government introducing successor rights through amendments to 
the Public Service Staff Relations Act and the Canada Labour 
Code. While one of the public service unions does not agree, I can 
only say to those unions which were involved in concluding this 
agreement that they bargained well for their members.
<P>
	I know the kinds of things they achieved for their members and 
this is one measure that would not have been accomplished without 
their involvement and without their working and fighting very hard 
for their members. The government has honoured its commitments 
to the 13 unions that did sign this agreement by introducing these 
amendments and legislating them in Bill C-31.
<P>
	During question period yesterday, the member for St. Albert, the 
Reform critic for human resources, pointed out the difference in 
treatment of these workers with air navigation services and other 
employees with respect to severance pay. The hon. member also 
commented that the introduction of successor rights in budget 
legislation seems to be the employer's way of avoiding negotiating 
with its union on each transfer case.
<P>
	Our employees want to know exactly where they stand when new 
arrangements come into place. I believe their unions have 
bargained well for them and have provided the kind of security that 
anybody in a climate of significant change in their place of work 
would want to have. I do not want to get into the details of that 
issue, but this is a continuation of our commitment to the 
employees to change government without drastically altering their 
lives.
<P>
	I am pleased to note that the budget has announced that the 
Public Sector Compensation Act, which froze federal government 
wages for five of the past six years, is due to expire in 1997. The act 
will expire as planned. It was introduced under the previous 
government. We have let it run its course but we do not intend to 
renew or extend it. We intend to get back to collective bargaining 
with our employees.
<P>
	We are also reinstating this June the normal process of 
increments and performance pay for government employees. There 
is no question that our fellow citizens who work for the 
Government of Canada have borne a major portion of the cost of 
starting to restore fiscal order to Canada's house.
<P>
	I hope this return to collective bargaining and the way in which 
the reduction of employment in the public service has been handled 
has been a signal to them that we value and respect the work they 
do. I hope they are looking forward, as the government is, to a 
return to collective bargaining.
<P>
	No budget is perfect, no piece of legislation is perfect. However, 
this legislation represents a reasonable balance of many of the 
objectives we are trying to accomplish.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on the budget 
implementation bill. I would not be standing here speaking today if 
this government and previous governments had done their jobs.
<P>
	The situation we find ourselves in today is a very serious one 
indeed. It compromises the lives of every Canadian, every social 
program and not only the lives of Canadians today but the lives of 
Canadians tomorrow.
<P>
	Today we see, through the budget implementation bill, the facts. 
The government is having to borrow on the futures of children of 
today and tomorrow to pay for what it is spending today.
<P>
	Three years ago we gave the government our zero in three plan. 
It was a definitive, specific plan to get Canada's economic house in 
order. It told the government where to cut, how to cut and how 
much to cut. It was not some nebulous plan, not some mythological 
plan, but a highly specific plan to get Canada's house in order. 
What did the government do? It ignored it. It ignores it at its peril.
<P>
	The finance minister has repeatedly said ``we will stay the 
course because we are doing just fine. Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. 
Public, Canada is doing just fine with out economics. The Liberal 
government has a hold on things. We are in control. We are staying 
the course''.
<P>
	Staying the course for what, so the Canadian economy can run 
head first into a brick wall? That is not a course the Canadian 
public wants to take. It is not a course it wants for its future or the 
future of its children.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1995"> 1995 </A></B>
<P>
	We have solutions. We put them forth. I implore the government 
once again to look at the zero in three plan so that we do not need 
to bring forth budget implementation plans.
<P>
	We have been accused many times by the government and by 
members of the public of being a slash and burn party. I would like 
to refute once and for all that the Reform Party is the slash and burn 
party. We are the only political party that has the plan to save social 
programs in Canada. It flies in the face of conventional wisdom. It 
flies in the face of what has been put forth by members across the 
way. Those are the facts, and I will explain why.
<P>
	The single greatest compromise to social programs is the 
inability to get our fiscal house in order. Why is that so? When we 
were first elected three years ago, one-quarter of all the money the 
government spent went to interest. It went to service the $550 
billion debt which saddles all of us. It is our responsibility.
<P>
	Today because of government overspending, because of repeated 
deficit spending, we have added to the national debt. I am speaking 
only to the federal debt. Provincial and municipal debts are another 
matter. We have added to the federal debt and the interest payments 
have increased.
<P>
	Imagine the pie once again; one-quarter three years ago and 
today that number has moved around to about 35 per cent of that 
pie. As time passes the amount of the pie to be eaten up and eroded 
by interest payments will increase. It will swallow up the ability of 
this government or any government to spend on education, on 
health care, on welfare, on pensions; in short, to provide for those 
people who need our justifiably laudable social programs.
<P>
	It compromises not the rich, but those who are poorest. One 
thing we pride ourselves on as Canadians is our ability to take care 
of those who are less fortunate than ourselves. It is in a sense a 
defining aspect of being Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	Therefore it is the inability to get control of government 
spending, the inability to get our deficit to zero and attack the true 
ogre in this equation, the debt, which compromises our social 
programs and our economy. If interest payments rise, the amount 
of interest will increase, greatly impeding the ability of the 
government to provide those things we hold dear, things Canadians 
rely on.
<P>
	It also crushes the life out of the economy. Why? Repeated 
deficit spending and the debt force us to have higher relative 
interest rates than other countries.
<P>
	There was a superb article which looked at relative interest rates 
compared with other countries. Although our interest rates are 
apparently low, the real interest  rates are some of the highest in the 
world. It is those interest rates that compromise the ability of our 
companies to invest and spend. They also compromise the ability 
of Canadians to spend because of the relatively high tax rate on 
Canadians in order to service the debt.
<P>
	There is a terrible vicious circle and the only way to break it, 
save our social programs and kick start the economy and get people 
back to work, provide for education and for a stronger economy is 
to bring the debt down.
<P>
	The finance minister has said they are doing a great job, contrary 
to what the International Monetary Fund said at the end of last year. 
It gave a stern warning to the finance minister: ``Stay the course 
and your country will hit the wall. The budget projections are 
completely inadequate. You must upgrade them in order to have a 
strong economy for Canadians in the future''.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party have absolutely no desire to compromise 
social programs for the poor. The reason many of us here gave up 
good careers and a comfortable lifestyle was to get Canada back on 
track. There is a narrow window of opportunity to do that. As time 
passes it will be increasingly more difficult to get the country back 
on track.
<P>
	The failure to address the problem today will produce the biggest 
compromise Canadians have seen in the last 75 years. Solutions are 
there. We have provided them. I say to the government that its 
failure to ignore this will imperil Canadians from coast to coast. Its 
failure will show up at the next election. I implore members to 
work with us and use some of our ideas. We do not have all the 
answers but a lot of them are backed up by Canadians through our 
grassroots process. Use the ideas. Do not just talk about them 
repeatedly. Do not study them again for the 100th time. Put them 
into effect and take action on the problem now.
<P>
	During the election campaign the Liberals told the Canadian 
people they would abolish the GST, knowing full well it is a 
financial and economic impossibility. Now they are doing a mea 
culpa and eating crow. Some members volunteered to give up their 
seats if the GST were not abolished. They know full well they 
could not get rid of it. It think it is reprehensible that they have 
pulled the wool over the eyes of Canadian taxpayers by this myth, 
this illusion that they will get rid of the GST.
<P>
	The harmonization process they are proposing to the Canadian 
people that will somehow get rid, eliminate or decrease the GST is 
another illusion put forth by the magicians across the way, bad 
magicians at that.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	The harmonization process is nothing but a gerrymandering of 
dollar figures. It is inequitable and unfair to Canadians outside the 
maritime provinces. They are asking the rest of Canada to give $1 
billion to the maritime provinces. Furthermore, the maritime  
provinces do not accept harmonization because they know it will 
cost them more at the counter, particularly the poor and the middle 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1996"> 1996 </A></B>
<P>
class. As well, the tax base will broaden to include essentials. The 
rich will not suffer; the poor and the middle class will suffer.
<P>
	The government should take a long, hard look at harmonization. 
The public will not accept it, which the government will find out at 
the next election.
<P>
	Economically it is fundamentally wrong. There are good 
solutions. The government must control spending and decrease 
taxes. Once it has decreased the debt it can lower the GST rate. 
That is the responsible thing to do.
<P>
	The debt and the deficit will not go away by themselves. Strong 
leadership is required. The budget implementation act will not 
solve the problem. However, using the solutions we have suggested 
will solve the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to join my colleagues in a few words about Bill 
C-31 and the related issues of the March 6 budget.
<P>
	The hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca made much 
about his party's commitment to a zero deficit in three years, the 
so-called zero in three program. We heard a lot about that when the 
Reform Party introduced it. However, this year as preparations 
were being made for the federal budget the promised Reform Party 
alternative budget never materialized. We really have to ask 
ourselves whether zero in three has gone by the boards. The 
program should be renamed zero in one. If the Reform Party 
continues to behave as it has recently, in one year there will be zero 
members of the Reform Party in the House.
<P>
	We are here to work together for all Canadians. We understand 
the cut and thrust of Parliament and the need to criticize, but that 
criticism must be fair. It must not be designed to confuse people so 
they do not know where a party is going.
<P>
	Good government can be best exemplified by the historical 
expertise this party has brought to government in Canada. We have 
the best country in the world. The Prime Minister has said that 
many times. I have said that many times. My constituents know we 
have the best country in the world.
<P>
	In December I spent a few days in Russia observing the 
parliamentary elections to the duma. I can confirm that even 
though that great superpower has an important political place in the 
world, few of us would choose to live there or in many other 
countries. Canada is a beautiful country, built on the honest effort 
of people around the world who believe that working together and 
co-operating is the only way to build a country. I dare say to my 
colleagues across the way that we have the best country in the 
world because we have had good government for most of the past 
century. For that I think  we should thank the Liberal Party of 
Canada and the excellent leadership it has provided.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Good government is not perfect government. During the next 
election campaign I will be questioned on certain matters but I 
know I will be able to stand proud in front of my constituents and 
say that we did a good job in this last term. We did not do a perfect 
job but I suggest that nobody could do a perfect job. Anybody who 
said they could do a perfect job would be attempting to pull the 
wool over the eyes of voters. We have done a very, very good job.
<P>
	Our approach to the problem of getting Canada's deficit in hand 
has been very responsible and reasonable. We have not done it on 
the backs of middle and low income Canadians. We have not done 
it on the backs of those who can least afford it. We have provided a 
transitional means of cutting back on federal expenditures. It is our 
commitment to have the federal deficit down to 2 per cent of GDP 
by the end of fiscal year 1997-98 which literally is just around the 
corner. We will have achieved that without putting the country in a 
state of confusion and uproar.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance reminded us in his budget speech that 
we went into our mandate with four very key principles or areas of 
concern.
<P>
	The first is to secure our financial future which means that we 
provide stability for those in the business sector who must plan for 
the future. We provide stability for Canadians who unfortunately 
find themselves out of work, who must themselves plan for the 
future. In so doing we have introduced the employment insurance 
legislation. As they study it more and more, Canadians will find it 
is the right answer to the dilemma this country is facing as far as 
balancing the need to protect those who are unemployed against 
those who are able to work but who must be more able to respond 
to the changing workplace.
<P>
	The second major principle we must pursue is to secure our 
social programs, and Canadians agree with us on this point. 
Another signal or sign of a good government is one that does not 
sacrifice in this process those least able to take care of themselves: 
the handicapped, single parent families, those who find themselves 
at the lower end of the economic scale, those who are 
disadvantaged for one reason or another. These people will not be 
forgotten under a Liberal government. Other parties might not be 
able to accomplish what we have been able to accomplish thus far 
in this regard.
<P>
	The third key area the finance minister outlined in his budget is 
investment in the future. This is where we recognize the 
importance of high technology for the future of this country and for 
the future of the world. We must not only engage business and all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1997"> 1997 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians in general, but more specifically our young people who 
find  themselves facing a workplace that has changed drastically. It 
changes dramatically year by year.
<P>
	When I graduated from engineering school more than a few 
years ago there were jobs for all the graduates. The world of work 
was more stable, more predictable. One could expect to be with a 
company for their full career. It is the nature of the world that this 
has changed. With the flow of information, the vast improvement 
in the availability of high technology and the fact that these things 
change almost every week, it is true that graduates now must be 
flexible, adaptable and prepared for a workplace that will require 
them to learn throughout the rest of their lives. Our young people 
are prepared for that and it is our job to assist them in their 
preparation.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	The fourth significant area, which is the subject of Bill C-31 
which we are debating today, is getting government right. I remind 
my hon. colleagues across the way that my constituents, and I am 
sure Canadians from coast to coast, in expecting good government 
do not expect perfect government.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister outlined the other day, we have already 
completed three-quarters of our campaign commitments. I would 
expect that by the next election call we will have nearly completed 
the balance of those commitments.
<P>
	I look forward to standing in front of my constituents during the 
next election campaign at various all-candidates meetings and 
saying that we accomplished the vast majority of our campaign 
commitments and the only reason we did not complete the others 
was that the opposition parties would not allow us to do so or the 
province of Ontario would not allow us to do so. I will be able to 
say that the Reform Party was full square behind the idea of 
harmonizing the GST and the provincial sales tax but it made so 
much to do about the issue it made it more difficult for us to get the 
agreements with the provinces. It gave Canadians the wrong 
impression about where we were going.
<P>
	This is a good government for Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my turn has come 
to speak on Bill C-31, and I will be better able to concentrate on my 
speech as soon as I have some quiet.
<P>
	This bill is aimed at privatizing certain services and gives the 
government the opportunity to dispose of rail stock. It makes minor 
changes to the old age pension-until the real thing comes along in 
five years-provides for the Canada social transfer, in other words 
it combines three transfer programs to the provinces into one. Of 
course, it will be transferring cuts to them at the same time. It gives 
more power to the Minister of Industry and it modifies the Student 
Loans  Act. But mainly, the bill enables the Minister of Finance to 
give $963 million in compensation to the Atlantic provinces in 
exchange for harmonization of the GST.
<P>
	My colleague, the finance critic for the Bloc Quebecois, has 
addressed this at length, so I shall concentrate my remarks mainly 
on unemployment insurance.
<P>
	So Friday has arrived, the end of the week, and what a week we 
have had here in the House. A rather special week, since the 
government imposed two gag orders, the first on Bill C-31, on 
which we are speaking today, and the second on the committee 
stage of Bill C-12 on unemployment insurance, in the human 
resources development committee. But Bill C-31 also addresses 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	It is a bit odd. With this approach, the government could be said 
to be wearing both a belt and suspenders. In other words, the 
amendments to the unemployment insurance plan are in two bills 
that are being considered at the same time. Different.
<P>
	Furthermore, Bill C-31 is worse than Bill C-12 in that its effect is 
retroactive to January 1, 1996. People should be reminded that, 
while we are being gagged and while the time spent by the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development in consideration of 
this bill is being limited, as it was this past week, here we are 
passing another bill containing two measures: the reduction in the 
ceiling on insurable earnings to $39,000 and its effect being made 
retroactive to January 1, 1996. This is quite something. They are 
not taking any chances. Perhaps they are afraid of protests against 
this bill in the Senate, the House or somewhere outside Parliament. 
They are not running any risks; they are going at the unemployed 
with two bills.
<P>
	Worse yet, there was contempt of the House this week. This is 
why I called this the week of the gag. I am not talking about 
yawning but about being gagged. I am talking about being very 
wide awake and being gagged. We were very much awake in 
opposition, even if we did go to bed very late, even going without 
sleep Tuesday night, because we tried to convince the government 
and the whip opposite that it did not make sense, at the stage of 
considering the bill clause by clause, to allow only five minutes per 
clause.
<P>
	What is more, I showed that clause 5 alone-my only 
example-took 12 minutes to read. So, with the time limit the 
government wanted to impose this week, it was not even possible 
to read the clauses. It was not permitted. It was impossible. So, as 
you can imagine, there was no time for answers to our questions, 
and we could not complain, obviously. So, they pushed it through. 
The government, for the second time in this Parliament, is setting 
time limits with this bill against unemployment insurance, as it  did 
with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1998"> 1998 </A></B>
<P>
the bill sending railway employees back to work, where we sat here 
on a weekend.
<P>
	What is worse, they are so contemptuous that, on January 1, they 
issued an employer's guide, a job statement I have in my hands, 
asking that contributions be made on the basis of $39,000 instead 
of $42,400. Employers were advised to comply since a bill to that 
effect would be passed. They said one bill, not two. So this measure 
has already been implemented.
<P>
	We know that this measure, which would reduce maximum 
insurable earnings from $42,400 to $39,000, represents an amount 
of $900 million that the government agreed to forgo on a 
retroactive basis. I wonder what kind of game they are playing.
<P>
	Then they accuse us of wasting the government's money because 
we want to take our time to study the clauses. The government, for 
its part, can give a present to business and to people making more 
than $39,000 to make them more receptive to its bill. Meanwhile, 
people who did not have to pay premiums before will now have to, 
including those working less than 15 hours a week, whose 
contributions represent another $900 million.
<P>
	This is the exact opposite of Robin Hood, who tried to help the 
poor by robbing the rich-although the means might not have been 
the most appropriate. The government, however, gives to the rich 
so it can take more from the poor. What is the world coming to? 
This is a week of muzzling; nothing makes sense any more.
<P>
	They send this to employers, thus showing their contempt for 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	I will not say much about the GST. As we know, the Prime 
Minister does not want to acknowledge the statements he made 
about the GST, although the Minister of Finance admitted that they 
indeed made a mistake, that they did promise to kill the GST but 
that it was not feasible. I am not talking about the red book, but 
about the Prime Minister's statements.
<P>
	The Prime Minister refuses to acknowledge his comments, but 
he may recognize the letter he sent Mouvement action-chômage on 
March 26, 1993. I would like to read it, as it is not very long:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you for your fax expressing your opposition to the legislative measures 
taken by the government-the Tory government and former minister Valcourt-to 
amend the unemployment insurance plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I can assure you that the Liberal Party shares your concern about this attack 
against the unemployed. We do not believe either that the recent superficial 
amendments will change the fundamentally unfair nature of these measures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our country is still in the throes of the worst economic crisis it has gone through 
since the thirties.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will skip the next paragraph as it contains figures.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Given how serious the crisis is, the Liberals have urged the government-the 
Conservative government-to take steps to stimulate the economy and create jobs. 
Yet, the Minister of Finance says not only that he will renew the same fiscal, 
monetary and trade policies that have plunged us into this recession, but that he will 
go after the unemployed in order to reduce government spending.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Liberal Party is appalled by these measures. Obviously, by reducing benefits 
and further penalizing those who leave their jobs voluntarily, the government shows 
very little concern for the victims of the economic crisis. Instead of getting to the 
heart of the problem, it goes after the unemployed. These measures will have a 
disturbing impact, for they will discourage workers from reporting harassment cases 
and unacceptable conditions in the workplace.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Finally, you can be assured that the Liberals will continue to call on the 
government-the Conservative government-to withdraw this unfair bill. As Leader 
of the Opposition, I appreciate your taking the trouble of sharing your views on this 
matter with me.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sincerely,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Jean Chrétien,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Leader of the Opposition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is not a statement but a letter. I will not repeat it. Now, 
through Bill C-31, and especially Bill C-12, the government will 
reduce UI benefits even further. People will no longer qualify.
<P>
	In conclusion-you are indicating my time is up, but I know you

the end of the honeymoon and the beginning of the end for this 
Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Nunatsiaq, Lib.):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's note: Member spoke in Inuktitut</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about 
the 1996 budget, the government's third budget.
<P>
	In October 1993 when the Liberal government took over from 
the Conservatives, the country's deficit and debt situation was out 
of control and swift decisive action was needed. The deficit had to 
be reduced and the role and priorities of the government had to be 
clarified.
<P>
	Steps were taken immediately to get the country back on track. A 
comprehensive review of all federal government programs and 
services was launched. As a result of that review, some programs 
have been eliminated, others have been cut and still others have 
been transferred.
<P>
	By the end of the 1998-99, program review measures will have 
reduced program expenditures by $9 billion. In that reduction 
process, however, the government is being careful.
<P>
	Protecting the most vulnerable is paramount. Better targeting of 
spending is crucial. While the government is reducing overall 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1999"> 1999 </A></B>
<P>
spending, it has at the same time identified its core role and 
refocused its resources on priority areas.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	I am pleased to note that the needs of the aboriginal people have 
been identified as a government priority. Accordingly, while 
aboriginal programs are experiencing some reductions, they are 
comparatively few compared to other areas of government 
spending.
<P>
	In this regard, I am also happy to say that the government has 
decided to maintain the food mail program, which is very 
important to the health and well-being of northerners. Under this 
program, the government funds the transportation of nutritious, 
perishable foods to isolated communities. Without this program, 
most people could not afford a healthy, nutritious diet. I am pleased 
that the government has recognized the importance of this program 
to the future health and well-being of northerners.
<P>
	Securing the future of Canadians is the main theme of the 1996 
budget. Investing in the future is another major theme. The jobs 
and growth initiatives of the budget focus on youth employment 
opportunities, technology and trade. Protecting the most vulnerable 
is another key feature of the budget.
<P>
	The 1996 budget contains some good measures for families, 
particularly low income families. It provides more support for 
children, youth, women and the elderly. There are no tax increases 
in this budget. Affordable, accessible social programs are being 
ensured.
<P>
	Support for seniors is being maintained and support for low 
income seniors is being enhanced. Pensions are being protected. 
Under the new seniors benefit to be introduced in 2001, guaranteed 
income supplement recipients will get an additional $120 a year. 
The spouses allowance will be increased by $120 a year. Seniors 
will only have to apply once when they turn 65, although they will 
have to continue submitting annual income tax returns.
<P>
	Support for children is being ensured. New child support awards 
after May 1, 1997 will not be considered as income of the recipient 
for tax purposes. The age limit for the child care expense deduction 
is being increased to 16 years from 14 years.
<P>
	Support for low income families is being increased. The working 
income supplement under the child tax credit will be increased 
from $500 to $750 in July 1997 and to $1,000 in July 1998.
<P>
	The budget contains additional support for youth education and 
jobs with an additional $165 million over three years through the 
tax system to help students and their families deal with the costs of 
education.
<P>
	Single parents will now be eligible for the same child care 
expense deductions as are available to couples. High school 
students will now be eligible for the child care deduction.
<P>
	There will be an additional $315 million over three years to help 
create youth employment opportunities, in addition to existing 
youth internship and youth service Canada funding. Some of the 
funds will go to summer jobs. Funds for 1996-97 student summer 
employment are doubled to $120 million.
<P>
	There is more help regarding the information highway. Every 
school and library in Canada will be connected by 1998 and more 
rural communities will also be connected.
<P>
	Federal transfers to provinces and territories for health, 
post-secondary education and social assistance, the Canada health 
and social transfer, will be secure, stable and will grow.
<P>
	The budget also contains some cuts. While the budget's positive 
measures will benefit my constituents, they are also being asked to 
assume some of the restraint in areas of direct concern to them. 
Spending on Indian and Inuit programs is being restrained. The 
increase in growth of spending will be reduced.
<P>
	The changes to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
also affect my constituency. The budget indicates that CMHC is 
getting out of social housing except for housing on Indian reserves. 
Provincial and territorial governments are being offered the 
opportunity to take over the management of existing social housing 
resources.
<P>
	I would like to say a little more about the housing situation in my 
constituency. There has been no ongoing funding for new social 
housing units since 1993. For the Government of the Northwest 
Territories, the decision by the former Conservative government to 
discontinue funding new social housing units meant a reduction of 
$47 million. The Government of the Northwest Territories has been 
unable to replace the $47 million lost in 1993, yet it spends more of 
its budget on housing than any other jurisdiction in Canada.
<P>
	Housing need in the NWT is severe. In recognition of this fact, in 
October 1994 the federal government announced a special one-year 
strategic housing initiative for northern and remote communities. 
Seventeen million dollars was made available for emergency 
housing needs in northern Canada. The NWT was allocated $9.5 
million of this amount.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	The assistance was gratefully received, but there are still major 
outstanding needs, particularly among aboriginal people. 
Twenty-five per cent of northern NWT households are in need. 
This is the highest proportion of households in need in any 
Canadian jurisdic-
<P>

<B><A NAME="2000"> 2000 </A></B>
<P>
tion. Over  87 per cent of the NWT households in core need are 
aboriginal people.
<P>
	In the NWT aboriginal people make up nearly 98 per cent of the 
social housing client base. There is only one reserve in the 
Northwest Territories and the Inuit do not live on reserves at all. 
Therefore, assistance for housing on reserves does not benefit the 
vast majority of aboriginal people in the NWT This fact is 
important for members of this House to understand.
<P>
	Most Indian and all Inuit people of the Northwest Territories do 
not qualify for the department of Indian affairs' housing program 
because they do not live on reserves. Housing assistance for 
aboriginal people in the Northwest Territories comes through the 
NWT government, so any cuts to NWT housing mean cuts to 
aboriginal housing.
<P>
	Most communities in the NWT are almost totally dependant on 
government for shelter. Aboriginal people have moved off the land 
into permanent communities only during the last 30 to 40 years. 
There has never been enough housing in the NWT to adequately 
house all the people requiring shelter.
<P>
	In addition, the NWT population is young and is growing 
rapidly. The birth rate in the NWT is almost twice the national 
average. Forty-one per cent of NWT children under the age of 12 
are living in overcrowded conditions. This negatively affects their 
health, social development and school performance.
<P>
	In conclusion, housing remains an area of great concern to me 
and all northerners. I continue to urge the federal government and 
the territorial government to work together to address the serious 
housing needs of northern aboriginal people.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the area of southeastern British Columbia that I represent 
is a great place to visit at any time. When I moved there in 1976, it 
was only intended to be a temporary move, but the beauty of the 
area and the warmth of the people soon convinced me there was no 
better place to be.
<P>
	This summer there is a further special reason for Canadians to 
visit this jewel of the B.C. interior. The cities of Trail and Castlegar 
are combining to host the 1996 B.C. summer games from July 25 to 
July 28.
<P>
	Both of these communities and other local surrounding 
communities will be pulling out all the stops  to ensure that visitors 
have a very rewarding experience. In addition to the games, visitors 
will be able to experience restored and preserved wild west history, 
pristine lake fishing, championship golf courses, hot springs, 
hiking trails, areas of breathtaking beauty and much more.

	Mr. Speaker, over the years Inuit have been teaching the rest of 
the world their language. Because the rest of the world is awfully 
slow, we teach them about one word every 10 years, such as kayak, 
igloo, umiak, anorak. Over the years we have taught the world 
about 60 Inuit words and it will take a few thousand years for 
people to learn the Inuit language.
<P>
	I would like to teach Canadians one more Inuktitut word which 
they can remember for the next 10 years. That is the word ``nanuq'' 
which in English means polar bear; majestic, strong, powerful and 
mysterious, the creature which now graces our two dollar coin.

	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
October 17, 1996, in the middle of the referendum campaign, the 
Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne issued a 
press release stating that the assimilation of francophones in 
Canada had declined. But the federation made a mistake. Its 
president, Jacques Michaud, recently confirmed on the CBC that 
indeed an error had slipped through when the announcement was 
made in October last year.
<P>
	It is surprising enough that the federation would make such a 
mistake concerning the assimilation rate of francophones, but the 
fact that it did not rectify its mistake and make a public apology for 
this blunder is inexcusable. This incident has sullied the credibility 
of an organization on which francophones outside Quebec depend.

hon. members to reflect on the horrendous tragedy of accidental 
death and serious injury of Canadian workers on the job. Our most

are also renewing our determination to reduce and prevent 
accidental deaths and injuries in the workplace.
<P>
	The federal approach to occupational health and safety dealt 
with in part II of the Canada Labour Code is based upon the internal 
responsibility system. This system recognizes that an employer has 
the right to manage its enterprise in an effective manner and at the 
same time the employer has a responsibility to protect the safety 
and health of its workers.

from the public and to wilfully deceive taxpayers, the media and 
members of this Parliament.
<P>
	However, based on new documents and testimonies, the chief of 
staff may have been more than aware of this dishonest practice and 
may even have taken part in it.
<P>
	Who runs the Department of National Defence? Is the minister 
capable of running that department? Is he a mere puppet whose role

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday in Montreal, Vera Danyluk, Chairperson of the 
Montreal Urban Community, Patrice Simard, President of the 
Metropolitan Montreal Chamber of Commerce, and Serge Ménard, 
ministre d'État à la métropole spoke out, on behalf of all Quebec 
industries dependent on marine shipping, against the government's 
intentions regarding new fee scales for aid to navigation.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans realize that he will be 
placing American Great Lakes ports at an advantage over Canadian 
and Quebec ports, since a ship taking the seaway en route to 
Chicago, for instance, will not be subject to the new fee scale, 
whereas one taking the same route but stopping at Montreal will 
have to bear the burden of the increased charges the minister 
proposes?
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows that marine services fees are 
user fees that pay for the use of public facilities which taxpayers 
pay for right now. He also knows that the charges are applied fairly 
across the country. The system was developed over a period of five 
months, stemming from recommendations made by the Marine 
Advisory Board.
<P>
	With respect to being fair and equitable, 850 consultations were 
conducted in this period of time. I believe the standing committee 
itself looked at 26 industries.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that the fees levied in Montreal are 
as fair as those levied in any other part of the country, including the 
Great Lakes area. If there is a difference in the total cost, it relates 
to the volume of traffic.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the answer I am being given is unbelievable.
<P>
	What I am saying to the minister is that a ship going to Chicago, 
U.S.A.-it is not in this country, it is in the U.S.-will not pay. Our 
jobs are being exported to the U.S. Yesterday those in charge of 
metropolitan Montreal, speaking on its behalf, were asking what 
the ministers,  the Liberal members for Quebec, were waiting for 
before criticizing this policy.
<P>
	The minister speaks of integrity, equity. He is also proposing that 
part of the costs that ought to be borne by Newfoundland, and all of 
the costs paid by the northern ports, including Churchill, Manitoba, 
be assumed by the other regions. How then can the minister justify 
the fact that the user pay principle is not applied in these two cases, 
unless it is to favour those two regions? I would point out to you 
that, just by chance, one of the two is Newfoundland, the minister's 
own province.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am not in the position nor will I ever be in the 
position of pitting one region of the country against another. I 
simply want to say two things to the hon. member.
<P>
	First, he asked why the opposition in Quebec would not go along 
with the concern which he has expressed. I do not know the full 
details, but I believe its reasoning was that it would be prepared to 
look at these fees if indeed the Quebec government would look at 
some of the fees which it is contemplating for the little guy, the 
small taxpayer, for bridge tolls and that kind of thing.
<P>
	Second, if the member is looking at one region against another, I 
will tell him one more time that the fees that are paid are based on 
the level of services provided. To make sure that this will work 
properly there are two impact studies in place which will show 
what is in fact happening.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the regions pay for their traffic. Is that the principle? How 
can it be, then, that the other regions pay for part of the traffic that 
goes to Newfoundland? This proposition represents a precedent, 
and one that makes no sense. He will have no reply to that, since he 
knows very well that this is true.
<P>
	Capt. Tremblay, the Trois-Rivières port administrator, has 
estimated that the coast guard could save up to $90 million if the 
icebreaker fleet were better managed.
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that it would be wiser to declare a 
one-year moratorium, as three-quarters of the witnesses have asked 
the committee to do, and to wait for the impact studies to be over in 
September, rather than to impose his policy before they are ready? 
In the meantime, some housekeeping could be done in the coast 
guard, for there are savings to be made there.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I say to the hon. member in response to his concern 
that if he is suggesting Newfoundland is being subsidized, he 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2005"> 2005 </A></B>
<P>
should get in touch with the premier  of Newfoundland who 
yesterday suggested that Newfoundland was paying more than its 
fair share.
<P>
	Everybody thinks they are paying more than their fair share. 
Everybody believes in user fees, but nobody wants to pay one cent. 
I will tell the hon. member that the taxpayer of Canada can no 
longer assume the cost of these kinds of services. We have to move 
forward.
<P>
	We are moving forward with the lowest possible tariff: 10 per 
cent of what it costs to do this. We have to move forward at this low 
level. At the same time we have to reassure ourselves and those 
companies that are saying they are going to lose everything that 
paying less than 3 per cent of the port cost at the taxpayers' 
expense, paying less than 3 per cent of a voyage cost and paying 
less than 10 per cent of the cost of the services is fair and equitable. 
I believe it is fair and equitable, as do most people in the country.

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in response 
to a question by the official opposition, the Minister of National 
Defence said yesterday that the military police had reopened its 
investigation of allegations of document falsification and 
destruction against the chief of staff, General Jean Boyle. New 
documents submitted to the commission of inquiry have rekindled 
serious suspicions against the chief of staff.
<P>
	How can the Minister of National Defence justify the chief of 
staff's remaining in command of Canada's armed forces, when the 
military police are investigating him in a matter involving the 
falsification and destruction of documents?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the military 
police are investigating events in the division of our department 
concerned with documents. They are not investigating an 
individual.
<P>
	It is usual for military police, as it is for the RCMP or any other 
police force in Canada, to reopen an investigation if there are new 
witnesses. It is standard procedure.
<P>
	As regards the chief of staff, I have confidence in him. I met with 
him this morning. Canadian forces operations are going smoothly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is crazy. 
When an enlisted man is involved, he is relieved of duty during the 
investigation, so is a police officer, so is a public servant. The 
minister is waiting and doing nothing.
<P>
	What sort of credibility does the minister think our forces have 
with our allies, when serious allegations weigh against the chief of 
staff, who is being investigated by his own military police?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has heard my answers in the last couple of weeks on this 
issue. There is a commission of inquiry that is looking into all these 
matters, and the answers will be forthcoming.
<P>
	With respect to the military justice system, it is a system of 
justice that is upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court of 
Canada. As the chairman of the commission, Justice Létourneau, 
said a few weeks ago, the hearings will go on and if there is any 
wrongdoing, either the military or the civilian authorities will then 
take their responsibilities.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is to the acting Prime Minister.
<P>
	Millions of Canadians who thought the Liberal government 
would scrap, abolish and kill the GST are disappointed and 
confused. The finance minister said on Tuesday he is sorry the 
Liberal government broke its election promise.
<P>
	Yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister said she had loose lips and 
regrets her promise to resign if the government failed to scrap the 
tax. But the Prime Minister, reading chapter and verse from the red 
book, maintains his government has honoured its commitments.
<P>
	Which is it? Is the government sorry or is the government not 
sorry for breaking its 1993 campaign promise to kill the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the year or two 
run-up to the 1993 election there were many conferences, including 
the Aylmer conference, developing policies for the election. Those 
policies were instilled into a book called ``Creating Opportunity''. 
Some words of mine made it into the book and some words did not.
<P>
	However, every one of the 295 Liberals who ran in the election 
in 1993 ran on ``Creating Opportunity'', the red book. That 
includes page 22 in the English version and page 20 in the French 
version which says we would replace the GST with a system that 
generates equivalent revenues, is fairer to consumers and small 
business and minimizes disruption to small business and promotes 
federal-provincial co-operation and harmonization. That is what 
we did.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
response fails completely to answer the basic question troubling 
Canadians who place their trust in the government: can voters 
count on politicians to keep their word?
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister blames her pledge to resign on loose 
lips. Far from it. Her comments were deliberate, calculated and 
repeated over and over again on the campaign trail.
<P>
	Will the government keep at least one promise? Will the Deputy 
Prime Minister, the member for Hamilton East, do the honourable 
thing on her word to Canadians and resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
</B><B>Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned in the 
previous answer, every one of us who ran for the Liberal Party ran 
on ``Creating Opportunity'', and those were the words. Never was 
the Canadian public better informed as to what a government 
would do in advance of an election.
<P>
	I had in my riding alone some 2,000 copies of the red book 
handed out from my campaign office. We stand by what we said in 
the red book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the acting 
Prime Minister is not speaking for two Liberal members, certainly 
not for the member for York South-Weston.
<P>
	With the Prime Minister's promise to kill the GST the 
government has called into question the basic integrity of all 
politicians on both sides of the House. The Deputy Prime 
Minister's claim that the Liberal government has fulfilled the 
essence of its GST promise leaves Canadians to believe that 
campaign promises are completely worthless.
<P>
	Despite the Deputy Prime Minister's contention, voters cannot 
take the government out of context. They counted on the Liberals 
to keep their word.
<P>
	Will the government keep its promise to drop its scheme to 
spend $1 billion to hide the GST in Atlantic Canada, go back to the 
drawing board and come up with a plan to honour its pledge to 
Canadian voters and scrap the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was listening with great interest to the hon. member 
strong protestation for the need for consistency because I had taken 
the time to look back at what the Reform Party had said about the 
GST.
<P>
	In 1990 the Reform Party leader said ``let's rip up the GST''. In 
1991 he said ``oh, no, we cannot repeal the GST because it would 
affect the deficit''. Then in 1992 he said ``what we need to do is 
reduce it in stages''. In 1994 in front of the finance committee the 
Reform Party said ``let's harmonize the GST and  congratulate the 
government for moving toward harmonization''.
<P>
	If there is any example of inconsistency on the position on the 
GST, the hon. member should be asking questions of his own 
leader, the leader of the Reform Party.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

the agreement between the parties to the conflict in southern 
Lebanon is. This is a preliminary agreement whereby both parties 
agree to put an end to their show of force. A task force will be

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the ``get over it'' Deputy Prime Minister announced amendments 
to the Copyright Act, introducing a new tax on blank audio and 
video tapes. This measure is in direct violation to the finance 
minister's boastful misleading claim that in his budget this year 
there are no increases on personal taxes, no increases on corporate 
taxes and no increases on excise taxes. He bragged about no new 
taxes.
<P>
	Now the government cannot even keep a promise for two 
months.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Industry have special permission from the 
finance minister to implement this tax and how much is it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will correct at least a few of the errors in that question.
<P>
	First, the home copying charge will apply to audio tapes. 
Second, it is not a tax. It might be useful if the government could 
retain that revenue but the levy will be established by the copyright 
board and will be distributed on behalf of the producers, the 
performers and the composers who, after all, are entitled to it.
<P>
	If the hon. member wishes to countenance the unauthorized 
copying of artistic works then perhaps he should explain his 
rationale for why he feels those who compose, produce and 
perform artistic works should have their works randomly copied, 
easily copied, with no compensation whatsoever for the economic 
value they have created.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
saddened by a response like that, that they have no compensation 
altogether.
<P>
	The minister knows full well there is a system of royalties in 
place for artists and producers. Some in the industry think they 
even get too much. It has nothing to do with that. His definition that 
this is not a tax leaves a lot to be desired.
<P>
	Why does the government insist on breaking election promises 
and now even breaking a budget promise?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of  Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is really convoluted. Of course there are private 
royalty arrangements. The very reason one would impose a home 
copying charge is so that one can ensure producers, performers and 
composers receive compensation for their work.
<P>
	Unauthorized home copying is a way to avoid people being paid 
for what they have created. Does the hon. member think that is 
unfair?
<P>
	They do not pay attention to what is written in the red book but if 
they did they would see a clear, explicit promise to introduce 
copyright reform in this Parliament, and that promise we are 
fulfilling.

fighting. It gives all countries, including Canada, time to take 
measures to begin to work on those difficulties. We have to make a 
very concerted effort for the implementation of resolution 425 at 
the Security Council. That is an important legal basis that the 
international community has established.
<P>
	At the same time, we have to work as part of this new 
consultative work in the reconstruction areas. Third, we have to 
support those individuals, those governments and those groups in 
the Middle East.
<P>
	There was a sign of it yesterday with the decision by the PLO 
and by the Labour Party in Israel to pursue the peace process, to 
give every support to those who are interested in peace and to stand 
up against those who are interested in terrorism or disruption. That 
is the major contribution we want to make.

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the finance minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, the finance minister rejected tripling CPP 
contributions from 5 per cent of worker's income to 15 per cent. 
Does that mean he intends to double them now and take only 10 per 
cent of worker's income?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the CPP is a joint 
federal-provincial arrangement set up with the provinces. It has 
been that way from the beginning.
<P>
	The consultation committee is out consulting right now and no 
decision will be made until the provinces and the federal 
government have both agreed to those changes.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the minister that his worker in the field 
has already mentioned this doubling of CPP contributions so we are 
concerned about the issue.
<P>
	You cannot expect the workers to pay an additional 5 per cent or 
more of their income without reducing benefits to seniors. Will the 
Minister of Finance tell the House how much the CPP payment to 
seniors is going to come down? Will it be 50 per cent or more?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the finance minister 
answered that question yesterday.
<P>
	Unlike the Reform Party that is going to destroy pensions for low 
income Canadians, we are sure that we can maintain a public 
pension system for the benefit of Canadians and that is what we 
intend to do.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

answer to this question is quite straightforward. There is an 
agreement already between the general contractor and the 
subcontractor.
<P>
	When issues of this kind come to our attention of course we are 
concerned. At this time there are discussions between our 
department and Labour Canada to work toward strengthening 
anti-discrimination clauses in contracts. An agreement has already 
been reached between the general contractor and the subcontractor.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it seems clear that the government is taking full advantage 
of an out of court agreement. The problem nevertheless remains 
unresolved. It also seems clear that the government does not wish 
to take any action against sexual harassment committed by 
subcontractors. Would this by any chance be because the 
government thinks that the Canadian Human Rights Act is worth 
no more than the paper it is written on?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

want to reiterate what I said before. An agreement is already in 
place between the general contractor and the subcontractor. That 
settlement does not speak to any sentiments that we have with 
respect to human rights legislation.
<P>
	Let me also point out that there are a couple of outstanding 
issues in this regard having to do with moneys owed. The 
government is concerned about that. It has appointed a facilitator to 
try to work out a settlement so that all parties can be satisfied with 
the outcome.

web of deception coming from the government now covers Atlantic 
Canada as well. In addition, it involves provincial Liberal 
governments.
<P>
	The cost to this government in terms of its credibility is 
mounting, not to mention the $1 billion it tacked on in out of 
control debt.
<P>
	Would the finance minister please explain to us beleaguered 
taxpayers listening from coast to coast why he considers it good 
financial planning to spend another $1 billion of their money to 
rearrange a tax, simply to bail this government out of an election 
promise it had not intended to keep in the first place?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is simply 
nonsense. The government has never pitted one region against 
another.
<P>
	When the government enacted tax reform in 1972 every single 
province received compensation over a five-year period. When 
Ontario was hard hit by the recession in 1991 and 1992 it received 
$1 billion in stabilization payments. When grain marketing dived 
in the late eighties the federal government provided $7 billion in 
assistance to western farmers.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	I could go on, but all of these things are compensation. This is a 
further example of the federation working properly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
doubt whether a response like that would be acceptable in British 
Columbia where I come from.
<P>
	If the finance minister will not explain to Canadian people how 
deceptive Liberal governments can be, I would be glad to do so.
<P>
	The tax grab is under way in Nova Scotia already. Yesterday it 
announced the first new tax to help cover the inevitable shortfall 
which harmonization has created.
<P>
	How could the finance minister sit there yesterday and say 
nothing when the people in Atlantic Canada demanded an answer 
to this question: Why did he tell them they were going to get a tax 
break during the election when it is plain that taxes will increase in 
Atlantic Canada, not decrease?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is simply not true. 
Taxes will be reduced in Atlantic Canada. Taxes will be lower. The 
sales taxes will be considerably lower in Atlantic Canada. Our 
calculations show that in each of the provinces in Atlantic Canada 
that have harmonized individual families will be paying lower 
taxes. They will be paying as much as $400 less in Newfoundland. 
It is less than that in the other two provinces, but there will be 
substantially less taxes in each one of those provinces.

my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	With the tabling of his crab fishery plan, the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans has spread confusion, once again, by 
allocating part of the quota to other categories of fishermen. In so 
doing, the Minister has sown division in the ranks of the fishermen 
and thus weakened the industry.
<P>
	Since the traditional crabbers are taking twice the available 
resource, does the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans intend to 
finally speed up and improve the plan for buying back permits, as 
in the B.C. salmon fisheries?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question, but I think 
there may be some confusion as to what is happening.
<P>
	I would like to set the hon. member straight. The total allowable 
catch was 16,100 tonnes. The traditional catch was basically 
divided between the traditional crabbers, the large crabbers, and the 
non-traditional crabbers, those smaller ships and boats of the 
inshore fleet. Therefore, 77.5 per cent went to the large crabbers 
and 22.5 went to the inshore fleet.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	Essentially this was done in the years when we had larger than 
traditional quotas in such a way so there would be a balance 
between the inshore fleet and the large crab fishermen at a time 
when fishermen have a great deal of difficulty coping with the 
situation.
<P>
	I think the tenor of his question is that he may have been against 
the inshore fishermen. I am sure that is not his intent.

stack the meeting and get people who agree with you or else ignore 
what they say.
<P>
	Recently at a meeting of the fisheries and oceans committee, 35 
of the 42 users who came in said: ``We accept the user pay concept, 
but let coast guard first rationalize their costs and do a 
socioeconomic impact study so that you do not destroy the surface 
of the ocean the way you have destroyed what is underneath it''.
<P>
	Can the minister explain to the House why expensive hearings 
are held if the wishes of the 35 of the 42 of those people who came 
forward are ignored?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let us put this in context.
<P>
	First, the study of the fees is a decision of the Government of 
Canada passed by Parliament. The system fee was put forward by 
the marine advisory board that controls what happens in this regard 
in Canada. There were 850 consultations with members of the 
industry and there was a final look by the committee, as the 
member suggested. The majority report of the committee said that 
the fees should go forward with the system which is very complex 
and developed.
<P>
	The premise of the hon. member that their views were not taken 
into consideration is very wrong. It is for that very reason that I am 
still studying the minority report as well as the majority report. He 
is wrong.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today is the 10th anniversary of the disaster of the 
Chernobyl nuclear station. On behalf of all Canadians I express 
anew our profound sympathy and condolences for the survivors of 
this tragic accident, for those who lost family and friends, for those 
who lost health and peace of mind and for those who lost their 
homes and their livelihoods.
<P>
	We pay particular tribute to the courage, commitment and 
competence of the many Ukrainians, Russians, Belarusans and 
others who took determined and effective action to contend with 
the costs and impact of the accident, often at the risk of their own 
lives. Many have since perished.
<P>
	Chernobyl symbolizes the necessity for the operators of nuclear 
reactors worldwide to put safety first. We must all learn the lessons 
of Chernobyl so that such a tragedy never recurs.
<P>
	The Moscow nuclear summit contributed to this goal by 
highlighting the absolute priority of the safe use of nuclear energy 
and by strengthening international co-operation in security and 
safety issues.
<P>
	Both the Canadian government and the Canadian private sector 
have provided assistance through many channels to the victims of 
the accident. We have committed some $32 million to projects 
aimed at relieving the suffering caused by the accident and to 
nuclear safety projects aimed at ensuring such an accident will not 
happen again.
<P>
	Canadians have shown their solidarity with the citizens of the 
affected areas in many different ways, from inviting to their homes 
young people living in areas exposed to radiation to participating in 
projects setting up systems to monitor the environment in radiation 
fallout areas.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	Canada has been particularly active in the G-7 to enable Ukraine 
to meet its energy needs while closing the Chernobyl nuclear 
station and containing its lingering dangers. As the chair of the G-7 
last year, we led the successful negotiation of the memorandum of 
understanding on the closure of Chernobyl signed with Ukraine in 
Ottawa last December by the Deputy Prime Minister. The Prime 
Minister was also active at last week's Moscow summit in 
reaffirming the mutual commitment to the implementation of this 
agreement.
<P>
	Our decision to organize and host the Winnipeg conference on 
Ukraine's economic transition has served as a catalyst for the 
subsequent efforts of leading  industrialized nations to come to the 
assistance of Ukraine.
<P>
	We intend to continue our political and economic co-operation 
with Ukraine in nuclear safety and energy sector development and 
other vital fields both bilaterally and multilaterally. We will work 
to help Ukraine lend meaning to its precious new independence and 
to win a better life for its people. That is the best way to help the 
victims and to honour the memory of those who lost their lives.
<P>
	Today, the 10th anniversary of the disaster at Chernobyl, I speak 
on behalf of all Canadians in expressing our support and friendship 
for the people of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus who have all suffered 
the consequences of this accident. Let us keep working together to 
ensure a similar tragedy never happens again.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, April 26, 1996 marks the 10th anniversary of the tragedy 
in Chernobyl. According to the Ukrainian authorities, this tragedy 
has, in the ten years, killed over 4,220 people, more than half of 
whom had been assigned to decontaminate the site after the 
explosion.
<P>
	The official opposition wishes to offer its most heartfelt 
condolences to the survivors of the tragedy and to all those who lost 
someone near to them in this accident.
<P>
	In addition, it is estimated that more than 3.5 million people, 
including thousands of children, have been seriously affected by 
radiation, which continues to wreak its devastation. We wish all 
these people the courage they need to get through this terrible 
ordeal.
<P>
	The members of the Bloc Quebecois, on behalf of all their 
constituents, wish to thank all people and governments providing

	Chernobyl is a tragedy with a lesson for us all. It must lead to a 
tightening of standards and safety requirements for nuclear power 
plants. However, most importantly, we must not forget that no 
technology is perfect, however sophisticated it may be.
<P>
	Political decisions compounded the effects of the catastrophe at 
the time it occurred and subsequently. While the events at 
Chernobyl may be due to a technical error, they were due just as 
much to political error, from which no government can claim to be 
exempt.

<P>
	Chernobyl is only the tip of the iceberg. Massive dumping of 
nuclear waste into the Bering Sea has occurred in Russia, twice the 
amount of the other 12 nuclear countries in the world. Western 
Siberia is an ecological disaster. The people themselves have called 
western Siberia an ecological disaster as there are massive levels of 
long lived radionuclides, cesium-137, carbon-14, strontium-90. 
They have all existed and they are affecting humans with radiation. 
The fallout is affecting our arctic regions and is found in our 
indigenous peoples.
<P>
	The result is that over the last 25 years there has been a 75 per 
cent increase in cancer rates and a 250 per cent increase in birth 
defects in children in this area. Our arctic does not have similar 
amounts and yet, as the minister well knows, the cancer and birth 
defect rates of aboriginal people living in the arctic are higher than 
they ought to be.
<P>
	On the Kola Peninsula there has been a massive nuclear waste 
dump. Large parts of the peninsula are contaminated beyond what 
we have seen virtually any where else. There are high levels of 
these radionuclides found in the tissue of animals, plants and 
indigenous peoples
<P>
	Russia is decommissioning its nuclear submarines. Over the next 
10 years it will have to decommission 200 nuclear submarines and 
ships. Historically it has dumped most of its nuclear waste into the 
environment. This is not isolated in the former Soviet Union but it 
is something that affects us all.
<P>
	We have to push together with the international community for a 
comprehensive test ban treaty and the enforcement of its 
principles. We have to push the non-signatories to the nuclear 
proliferation treaty, those  with nuclear capabilities, to sign it. 
International co-operation will be required to do this.
<P>
	We have to work with the former Soviet Union states to 
catalogue and identify these waste dump sites and also have 
international groups to monitor the clean-up and the fallout.
<P>
	We must encourage trade and economic ties with the former 
Soviet Union states. By doing this we will push forward trade 
liberalization, movement toward democratic principles. We will 
dampen the rise of ethnic nationalism occurring with the likes of 
Mr. Zhirinovsky and dampen the rise of the Communist Party in the 
former Soviet Union. By increasing ties we do much for increasing 
international co-operation between our countries.
<P>
	We have in the former Soviet Union an ecological and nuclear 
disaster which most of us do not know much about. It is the 
Chernobyls of the future that are waiting to occur. They will affect 
the former Soviet Union and our people through the ebb and flow 
of waters and through the movement of air masses. These nuclear 
materials will affect all arctic countries. Because these 
radionuclides spend so long in the food chain they it will affect 
Canadians with higher levels of birth defects and higher cancer 
rates.
<P>
	I implore the minister to work co-operatively with the 
international community and the former Soviet Union states to 
develop methods to get this under control to avoid the Chernobyls 
of the future.

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as hon. members know, April 28 is the National Day of 
Mourning. Every year, we pay tribute to Canadian men and women 
who were killed or seriously injured in the workplace.
<P>
	Since, this year, April 28 falls on a Sunday, I would like to take 
this opportunity to draw attention to this commemoration.
<P>
	In Canada, work accidents requiring workers' compensation 
benefits to be paid out happen every 39 seconds on average. Every 
day, one worker out of every fifteen is injured at work and two die. 
These figures speak volumes. The loss of lives sustained, and the 
ensuing pain and suffering of family, friends and coworkers, are 
unbearable. Such losses are simply unacceptable.
<P>
	In economic terms, work accidents cost the Canadian economy 
more than $15 million per day, or 10 times the total number of days 
lost to strikes and lockouts.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2015"> 2015 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	In 1994, the direct and indirect costs of work accidents amounted 
to more than $10 billion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The good news is that occupational injuries, illnesses and 
fatalities in Canada have declined substantially over the past 
decade. While we are making progress, these tragic incidents are 
still far too high. It is imperative that we improve occupational 
safety and health.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why, on the occasion of the National Day of Mourning, 
we pay tribute to those injured or tragically killed in the workplace. 
We reiterate our commitment to reducing the incidence of 
accidental death and injury.
<P>
	We can be proud of Canada's occupational safety and health 
expertise, which is recognized worldwide. I believe that to a large 
extent we owe our success to the approach we have taken. Canadian 
occupational safety and health legislation is based on the internal 
responsibility system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe it is important for hon. members to note that the federal 
occupational safety and health system has three partners: 
employers, employee and government. All three have rights and 
legal responsibilities to ensure safe and healthy working 
environments.
<P>
	This is the continuing challenge we are facing. This is what the 
national day of mourning accomplishes. It raises our awareness 
about these issues, the awareness of all Canadian employers and 
employees who must address occupational safety and health 
concerns on a daily basis if we are to reduce work related injuries 
and deaths.
<P>
	This challenge must be met by strengthening our effectiveness, 
developing innovative measures to prevent loss of life, and finding 
viable alternatives to increase efficiency. To that end we must 
consider the impact of new technology, frequent changes in duties 
and the international competitive market.
<P>
	The foundation upon which this system functions is evident in 
the roles of the federal, provincial and territorial authorities. They 
are responsible for helping to ensure compliance, to monitor how 
responsibilities are fulfilled and to address matters of 
non-compliance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is clear that occupational safety and health concerns are 
always on the minds of Canadian workers and employers. We all 
share in this responsibility. And the Government of Canada 
recognizes and fully appreciates the vital role played by unions and 
employee representatives in that regard.
<P>
	I now urge my hon. colleagues to join me in paying tribute to 
Canadian workers who paid such a high and tragic price. They will 
not be forgotten. Their memory  will act as a constant reminder of 
our duty to preserve and to work together to substantially improve 
occupation health and safety conditions across Canada.
<P>
	If you do not mind, after my hon. colleagues are through with 
their remarks, we could observe a minute of silence in memory of 
all those killed in the workplace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the official opposition wishes to join with the government 
and the other parties in this House in paying tribute those who died 
or were seriously hurt in the workplace.
<P>
	These injuries were undoubtedly an important, a disturbing 
moment in the lives of those concerned, and it is our duty as 
members of Parliament to remember, so that such accidents do not 
happen again.
<P>
	We are fully aware that, despite the laws now in effect across the 
country, two workers are killed every five working days in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Every two minutes, a worker is seriously injured in one of 
Canada's workplaces. In total, each year, 57,000 workers are 
involved in sometimes fatal accidents. On an economic level, $100 
million in compensation is paid to workers who can no longer earn 
a salary as a result of an accident; last year, 860,000 work days 
were lost to accidents, which could have been prevented in some 
cases.
<P>
	Let us hope that we can work together to improve health and 
safety in the workplace. The best way to do so is to co-operate so 
that the workers, unions and employers can arrive at the wisest 
decisions and work on prevention together. In this regard, the 
official opposition wants to work on improving the existing 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the Reform Party of Canada, the national 
opposition, I am pleased to join my colleagues in paying tribute to 
the victims of work related accidents and to those suffering from 
occupational injuries or disease.
<P>
	Work conditions and occupational health and safety have 
evolved greatly since Confederation and are now fundamental to 
managing the workplace. The rights and duties of employees are 
now embedded in our laws and regulations.
<P>
	It is one thing however for Parliament and legislative assemblies 
to pass occupational health and safety laws but it is another to 
ensure they are followed. The time to become safety conscious is 
not after an accident occurs. Prevention has to be foremost in our 
minds.
<P>
	Laws, regulations and governments play an important role in 
accident prevention. In the final analysis however, it is the employ-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2016"> 2016 </A></B>
<P>
ers and the employees who are  responsible for preventing, 
eliminating or controlling hazards in the workplace. This is a 
responsibility no one can shun.
<P>
	Preliminary statistics for 1994, the last year for which I found 
them available, show that there were 709 workplace related 
fatalities, 152 of which occurred in my home province of British 
Columbia. That is an increase of 124 from the previous year.
<P>
	Workplace fatalities, whether they claim one life or 26 as was the 
case in the 1992 Westray mine disaster, are devastating not only for 
the family and friends of the deceased but for co-workers and 
employers as well.
<P>
	Workers make this country productive. We have to do our utmost 
to ensure that the workplace is health and safety conscious, that 
those are necessities, not options.
<P>
	The world economy is becoming increasingly competitive and 
technologically advanced. New challenges abound and workers 
face previously unheard of hazards. Labour and management must 
work together to provide a healthy, safe and prosperous workplace 
necessary to secure and maintain a competitive edge.
<P>
	Let us use this national day of mourning to promote awareness of 
the vital role that health and safety play in the protection and 
preservation of our Canadian workers.

Act (registration of political parties).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the bill is to amend the 
Canada Elections Act to allow the registration of political parties 
by the chief electoral officer only when the party nominates 
candidates in at least seven provinces that have in aggregate at least 
50 per cent of the population of all the provinces and in at least half 
of the electoral districts in each of those seven provinces.
<P>
	For the purpose of the Canada Elections Act, the provinces 
include the Yukon and the Northwest Territories.
<P>
	There are four principal aims of this bill. First is to ensure that 
those parties entering into federal elections are nominating 
candidates in a majority of ridings across Canada so that their 
support and point of view will be national in scope. Second is to 
ensure that each party provides a platform which is reflective of 
national interests and not of regional scope. Third is to provide 
greater access to the majority of Canadians to pass judgment via a 
national convention or a general election on a party's political 
platform. Fourth is the aim to keep Canada as one, united and 
indivisible.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion, the amendment 
and the amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to such a full house today on such an important 
issue as the budget of the country.
<P>
	Several comments were made by my colleague in the Liberal 
Party which bear repeating. One is ``we have done a very good 
job''. Having been here for two and a half years, I sort of missed 
where the good job came in and so have a lot of people where I 
come from in British Columbia.
<P>
	``We cannot expect perfection in this country''. It had to do with 
the remarks on GST, which I will get into a little later. Canadians,, 
although disappointed with the lack of perfection, are probably just 
as disappointed with the mediocre performance we have seen thus 
far.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance made a great deal of his claim in the 
budget speech: ``We are not raising personal taxes, we are not 
raising corporate taxes, we are not raising excise taxes. In fact, we 
are not raising taxes''.
<P>
	Unfortunately in this country we tend to get duped with that kind 
of statement. When people think they are safe this year with no 
more raising of taxes by the government they miss some important 
points. Since this government came to power two and one-half 
years ago, it has overspent an accumulated debt of $100 billion.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I could ask people sitting in the gallery or anyone else in this 
country how much that is. I speak to a lot of high schools and I ask 
them how much $1 billion is. How much does the country owe in 
debt? I have yet to go to a classroom that can tell me.
<P>
	The young people in the country have no idea what is coming at 
them and I think a lot of adults have no idea what is coming at us, 
particularly when the finance minister stands up in the House and 
says we have not raised taxes. They think they are safe for today.
<P>
	Since I have been in the House the debt has risen from 
approximately $450 billion to $575 billion. That is five hundred 
and seventy-five thousand million dollars. When you ask students 
they say $5 billion, $10 billion, but when you say five hundred and 
seventy-five thousand million dollars they look at you with this 
blank stare and say ``I guess somehow it will go away''. It will not 
go away.
<P>
	Taxes will increase under this government. We have to deal with 
the annual borrowing of the government. This  year it will likely be 
around $30 billion. Overspending one's budget by that much is 
almost criminal when the debtload is $575 billion. Somehow, some 
way we have to make people aware exactly what is coming at them.
<P>
	There are all kinds of places to cut budgets. The Liberals say 
they have done a very good job, but they have made no cuts in some 
areas. These are the kinds of things they are spending money on. 
When you are overrunning a budget by $30 billion plus every year, 
do you really need to give $33,000 in grants to promote and 
develop music in alternative spaces? Grants of $280,000 are given 
to various professional small ensembles to produce or rehearse for 
special events.
<P>
	Lots of people would say we need that, we have to keep our arts 
going and so on. However, in view of the fact we are collecting and 
overspending by $30 billion plus a year, must we continue to do 
this at this point? The Axis Mime Theatre got $65,845. The 
Buddies in Bad Times Theatre got $65,000, and on and on it goes.
<P>
	I have negotiated many collective agreements in my day. I 
negotiated at the other side of the table with the Canadian 
conference of Teamsters. I find it ironic the government gave them 
$138,000 last year with a membership as large as theirs. When we 
are running this kind of deficit and debt one wonders hello, is 
anyone home over there? Today it does not look good.
<P>
	The Canadian Federation of Labour got $297,368; the Canadian 
Labour Congress, $3.7 million. What is wrong with the 
government that in the face of borrowing all of this money it is still 
throwing it out the door like there were no tomorrow?
<P>
	I would think a message would have been received by the way 
we dismantled the Tory organization, but I guess not. Do we have 
to give $500,000 to complete a nine-hole golf course in 
Newfoundland? Is that a necessary expenditure of the taxpayers 
who contribute their hard earned money from where I come from? I 
do not think so. Do we have to pay $5,400 for somebody to travel to 
Tennessee to gather information on sprout farming?
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	I could go on. There are books full of this stuff. I bring it up year 
after year but no one is home. No one is listening. That is sad. They 
will listen when young people are short of jobs, as they are today, 
and when their taxes are so high they cannot afford to live in some 
areas of the country. They are going to say ``what have you baby 
boomers done? You have borrowed enough money to sink a fleet of 
ships and now you expect us to pay it back''.
<P>
	I have two children in university. One is graduating this summer. 
What will he do with his engineering degree? He is looking at 
leaving Canada for a job, and that is really sad.
<P>

<P>
	I believe we have an uncaring government when it cannot make 
as its top priority balancing the budget and paying down the debt.
<P>
	Are there any other areas where we could save money? I could 
list a host of them. I do a lot of work in the criminal justice system, 
especially in the solicitor general's department, and I can think of a 
host of things we could do there.
<P>
	A couple of weeks ago I found out that in one of our maximum 
institution, where all the real bad guys are going, they are now 
allowing prisoners to buy rollerblades. They spent $4,000 
refinishing the pool tables for them.
<P>
	They are provided legal aid at the expense of taxpayers to sue the 
crown. For those who do not already know, Clifford Olson has 
approximately 32 litigation cases against the crown. I wonder if the 
government has thought a minute about that, about the kind of 
money we are spending on this creep when victims have to wait 
their turn in court behind this guy to get their day of justice.
<P>
	Are we spending any more money in prisons? I found out 
something this morning I would have loved to raise in question 
period. I could have had a lot of fun with it. I have a real problem 
with a prison system that talks about zero tolerance for drugs and 
gives one ounce bottles of bleach to prisoners to sterilize their 
cocaine needles so they will not spread HIV. Talk about convoluted 
messages. It is a contradiction, much like saying ``we did a very 
good job but we overspent only by $100 billion in the last two and a 
half years''.
<P>
	I knew about project bleach a year ago and I have been hollering 
about it ever since. I did not know about this little memo that just 
came from the commissioner's office which says a bleach kit pilot 
project has been operating successfully in Matsqui institution since 
June 1995. That institution is in my riding and I happen to know 
that success is somewhat over rated. Even the staff disagrees with 
it. The staff in many prisons disagrees with it. What does the 
government do? It is giving bleach to sterilize cocaine needles 
belonging to prisoners for cocaine intake at the same time as it has 
a zero tolerance for drugs.
<P>
	If that member leaves, I am calling for quorum. I will not stand 
in the House talking to some television across the country with an 
embarrassing crowd like this in here.

<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	The government has frozen the RRSP dollar contribution limit at 
$13,500 until 2003. What does the government do? It gives itself a 
gold plated pension plan. Congratulations. There are 51 out of 52 
Reformers in this House who refused that plan. While these people 
fill their fat faces with their own pension plan, they tell the rest of 
Canadians sorry, but you do not get much for yourself. Talk about a 
contradiction in terms. Open the  doors and let the rest of these 
people come in. Hello, is anyone home?

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the privilege today of taking part in the debate on 
Bill C-31. It is a privilege since the debate at second reading began 
late Wednesday and will already end today. Obviously, the Liberal 
government prefers to gag the Bloc Quebecois in the House 
regarding Bill C-31, just as it did when the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development considered Bill C-12 on 
unemployment insurance reform.
<P>
	The Liberal government is in such a hurry to pass these bills that 
it resorts to undemocratic measures rather than taking part in the 
debate and explaining the real objects of these bills, as well as their 
negative impact on Canadians.
<P>
	Bill C-31 seeks to enact a series of controversial measures which 
will hit Quebecers and Canadians hard, and which will result in the 
continuing deterioration of their living conditions. All this in the 
name of the fight against the deficit.
<P>
	Sure, order has to be restored in public finances. We are all 
aware of the situation. However, this must not be done on the back 
of the poor and the unemployed. Shovelling into the provinces' 
backyards is not a solution either: winter is over.
<P>
	Part III of Bill C-31 amends the Unemployment Insurance Act so 
that maximum weekly benefits will drop from $445 to $413. This 
change will make claimants even poorer, and this means young 
people and single mothers mostly.
<P>
	Moreover, the maximum insurable gains are being lowered to 
$39,000 per year. This means that it is primarily high income 
earners who will make lower contributions to the unemployment 
insurance fund. The change will result in tax savings of $900 
million for high income earners. These measures directly affect the 
unemployed and will be applied retroactively to January 1, 1996.
<P>
	Oddly enough, these two provisions are also found in Bill C-12 
on unemployment insurance reform. Is the government trying to 
use the back door, in case the UI reform does not go through soon 
enough?
<P>
	Despite all the demonstrations against this reform, particularly 
in Quebec and the eastern provinces, the party in power, the Liberal 
Party, is reiterating its intentions and including measures that will 
penalize the unemployed in Bill C-31.
<P>
	This bill also affects the Canada social transfer, especially in 
Quebec. Unfazed, the government will continue to cut social 
program funding, which in Quebec will mean a shortfall of $5 
billion over the next four years. The government is cutting but, in 
the same breath,  maintaining national standards so that it can tell 
the provinces what to do. We have said this over and over: the 
government must withdraw from social program funding and give 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2020"> 2020 </A></B>
<P>
the provinces what they need to fund these programs. All that the 
government is doing now is reducing the deficit on the backs of the 
provinces, by cutting transfers and continuing to call the shots on 
standards.
<P>
	What is more, social program transfers will now be based on the 
population of provinces, instead of taking real needs into account. 
It is therefore the richer provinces who will benefit from the social 
transfers. Finally, with this bill, the red book government is 
reforming the GST.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	The announcement by the finance minister this week concerning 
the agreement reached between the federal government and the 
provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick 
showed us without a shadow of a doubt how this party really 
governs.
<P>
	During the last election campaign, the Liberals made the 
abolition of the GST one of the main planks in their electoral 
platform. Back then, the Prime Minister told the public that the 
GST had to be scrapped.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister, for her part, was heard on CBC on 
October 18, 1993, just a few days before the election, saying, and I 
quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I have already said personally and very directly that if the GST 
is not abolished I will resign''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This morning's newspapers show that, surprisingly enough, the 
Deputy Prime Minister herself admitted talking through her hat 
when she made that statement. In this morning's <I>Le Devoir</I>, the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage gives her own version of history 
with respect to the GST: ``I never said it would be scrapped without 
being replaced; no one ever said that''.
<P>
	Barely six months after being elected, the Prime Minister 
repeated on May 2, 1994: ``We hate this tax and we will kill it''. I 
think the statements made by the Prime Minister and the Deputy 
Prime Minister could not be any clearer. As recently as last 
Wednesday, the Minister of Finance himself admitted that 
promising to kill the GST had been a mistake. In fact, the real 
mistake is not that the Liberals promised to kill the GST, but that 
this government, which has no qualms about reneging on its most 
important election promises, was elected.
<P>
	The hon. members for York South-Weston and for 
Broadview-Greenwood did not hesitate to condemn the 
government's refusal to honour its commitments. There were at 
least two members on the other side of the House who did not 
suffer from collective amnesia.
<P>
	No matter what is written in the famous red book, all the people 
in Quebec and Canada heard key government figures promise to 
kill the GST. Not only does the agreement between the three 
Atlantic provinces and the federal government not kill the GST, it 
reinforces it.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance talked about harmonizing provincial 
and federal sales taxes; in fact, provincial taxes will not be 
harmonized with but absorbed into the GST to become a national 
tax fully administered by the federal government, depriving the 
provinces of their autonomy in controlling their own tax rates.
<P>
	To add insult to injury, the Minister of Finance is making the 
other provinces pay for this agreement. In fact, $960 million will 
be paid to the three Atlantic provinces concerned, including $250 
million taken directly from the pockets of Quebecers. And this is 
only the beginning, as this measure will be implemented in the 
same way after the federal government negotiates agreements with 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	To top it all, the government is paying to renege on its promises 
while pretending to honour them. The GST stays, and the 
government continues to dump its deficit onto the provinces. 
Obviously, things could not be any better.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to 
be able to stand in Canada's Parliament and talk about the one issue 
which is probably more important to Canadians than almost 
anything else.
<P>
	Canadians are concerned about the justice system and its 
failures. They are concerned about the fact that these days they are 
not represented in Parliament by their MPs because the rules of the 
party do not permit that to happen. Undoubtedly what hits people 
the most across the country is the problem of jobs, of balancing 
their budgets and paying their bills. With that comes that greatest 
of all expenses for most Canadians, the largest single expense that 
they incur, their monthly tax bill. That is the biggest item in family 
budgets.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	We are in this House today debating on behalf of the Canadian 
people whether or not their money should be spent wisely or 
foolishly and how it should be allocated. I am somewhat appalled 
that there is little accountability here.
<P>
	I do not know exactly how to put this. I need to stay within the 
rules of debate. I will studiously attempt to do that. It is totally 
unconscionable for individuals, for citizens of this country, to go 
around during an election campaign laying out their plans so that 
the voters can presumably make a decision on who to send to 
Ottawa to represent them while during that campaign, the words 
they use cannot be trusted. We have heard so much  rhetoric these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2021"> 2021 </A></B>
<P>
past days about what we meant, about we said and about what we 
wrote. Frankly, those three should coincide.
<P>
	We should write what we intend to do. We should communicate 
what we intend to do and we should intend to do what we say and 
write we intend to do. How can the voters during an election make 
an informed decision if they cannot trust the words that are being 
used?
<P>
	That is really the crux of the matter. There are 295 members of 
Parliament. I am very honoured to be one of those. We have that 
awesome responsibility of being, in essence, the board of directors 
of this giant corporation called Canada.
<P>
	Some people say that government cannot be run as a business. I 
am afraid in some areas there is no choice but to run it as a 
business. That is when it comes to budget.
<P>
	We can certainly debate what we want to spend our money on. 
That is a legitimate debate. How much should we spend on 
welfare? How much should we spend on health care? How much 
should we spend on education?
<P>
	I am appalled that the governments of the past 30 years have 
arranged our affairs so that right now Canadians from coast to coast 
to coast are being cut down at the knees. There is no longer 
sufficient money to support education. There is no longer sufficient 
money to support a proper level of health care. There are cutbacks 
all over the place.
<P>
	Every week I get letters and phone calls from people who say 
that my son cannot get a job, therefore he will not be able to 
continue his education. I get others who say that mom is in the 
hospital and if we were not there to care for her, she would have no 
care at all because all of the nurses have been let go. That is not 
acceptable.
<P>
	Our predecessors in this place over the last 30 years have not 
been honest with Canadian taxpayers. They kept telling them 
election after election: ``We will do this. We will do that. Elect me 
and you will have this in your community especially if I become a 
cabinet minister. There will be all sorts of grants and special 
privileges available. If I am already a cabinet minister, be sure to 
re-elect me. Those goodies will continue if you do''.
<P>
	Meanwhile the government is spending $1,000 each second 
more than is taken in. That is unconscionable. To add the greatest 
insult of all to Canadian taxpayers, at election time, when their 
candidates say that they are going to do this and this with taxation, 
that they will eliminate the GST or whatever the issue of the day is, 
the word, eliminate does not mean eliminate.
<P>
	Usually in the English language, we have come to a consensus. I 
am sure it is the same in French. There is a consensus on the usual 
meaning of words. In the fall 1993 election campaign not once did I 
hear the Liberal candidate for Elk Island tell the people in our 
constituency that if elected the Liberals would harmonize  the tax. I 
do not recall hearing that word once, yet the Liberals are now 
saying that eliminate means harmonize. A new synonym. A change 
to the dictionary.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	The poor taxpayers do not have any input which is not right. It 
has happened year after year. The taxpayers are given a choice, but 
once elected the people sent to this place do whatever they want. 
There is no accountability. I do not want to hang my head in shame 
because I have done everything I could to resist this. I will have to 
exclude myself, members of my party and frankly, some members 
of the other parties in the House.
<P>
	I have spoken to some government members in private 
conversations. I will not divulge names but they have said: ``Keep 
hammering the budget. You guys are right on''. Liberal members 
have said that to me, yet they are not permitted to rise in the House 
of Commons to speak against the budget or to move amendments.
<P>
	How can taxpayers, through their elected representatives, ever 
get control of the spending of their hard earned money if we are not 
going to permit members of the House to speak and to vote 
according to their own conscience and according to the wishes of 
their constituents? If that does not happen, I do not hold out much 
hope for Canadians. It has to happen.
<P>
	I am very proud to be a member of the Reform Party of Canada 
which, since its inception, has endorsed this as part of its 
principles. In fact it is one of the things which drew me to the party. 
I will stand here and try to communicate as forcefully as I can for 
as long as I can that what this country needs is a system whereby, 
like in the Reform Party, members not only have the right to 
represent their constituents when they debate and when they vote, 
but they also have the obligation to do so.
<P>
	I would be out of step with my party if I went against the wishes 
of my constituents. I do not know whether my party would kick me 
out of the caucus; we have not discussed that. I really doubt it. 
Although it might because I would be breaking a very fundamental 
principle of what Reform stands for and also what is right for the 
country.
<P>
	I will say one more thing about the budget and the fact that the 
government is overspending so greatly. The government proclaims 
how wonderful it is because it has brought the amount of 
overspending from $40 billion to $35 billion, from $35 billion to 
$30 billion, and down it goes. The present number it is projecting is 
somewhere in the area of $17 billion. Some Canadians, because of 
the way the words are spun and because some people do not bother 
to explain the difference between the debt and the deficit, really 
think that the debt is being eliminated.
<P>
	I do not wish to embarrass him, but it just so happens that last 
week I hauled out the campaign literature from my riding and I 
looked at the Liberal literature to see what that candidate said. 
Believe it or not, in the  brochure which he distributed to the voters 
of Elk Island, his statement was that a Liberal government would 
bring down the debt to 3 per cent of gross domestic product. The 
debt. Of course, the official platform of the Liberal Party was to 
bring the deficit, the amount of overspending per year, to 3 per cent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2022"> 2022 </A></B>
<P>
of the gross domestic product. I will forgive him. I think it was a 
legitimate error. He did not know any better. However, I think it is 
unconscionable.
<P>
	When there are deficit budgets it means the debt is still growing. 
I want every member of the House and every Canadian to 
understand that the debt is not decreasing under this government. 
The debt is still increasing. Admittedly it is increasing at a slower 
rate than it did before. If I can give any commendation to the 
government I will give a reluctant one on that issue. At least it is 
not putting us into the hole as fast as it could.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	When the government continues to add to the debt, right now at 
$17 billion per year, that is premised on a very important 
assumption. Those who have lent Canada the money it is 
borrowing, whether they are foreign investors or domestic 
investors, all expect their money back. That is based on the 
assumption that sometime in the future we will have a surplus of 
over $50 billion a year for 25 years in a row before we can pay off 
that debt.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you do not know how much I regret that my time is 
up because I am just starting, but thank you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak on the government's third budget. In 
speaking against it I hope to ring the alarm bells across Canada that 
this is not the budget which is being portrayed by the government 
as a be happy, do not worry, go back to sleep budget, this is a 
budget that all Canadians should be alarmed at.
<P>
	There were two major election promises made by this Liberal 
government which are not even mentioned in this third budget. The 
first is jobs, jobs, jobs which Canadians were so desperately 
looking for and the second of course is the GST. The words goods 
and services tax do not even appear in the budget. The only 
reference is to a federal sales tax. In this budget two major election 
promises that were broken are not addressed. All Canadians should 
be deeply concerned about that.
<P>
	A third promise has been destroyed in this budget and has been 
magnified this week. It is the promise by this government to do 
something about the level of cynicism across the country today 
which has developed between the voters and the politicians. There 
was an opportunity for the government to do something about it.
<P>
	As a matter of fact the Liberals alluded to it in their famous red 
book under the chapter ``Governing with Integrity'' on page 90. At 
the beginning of chapter 6 it states: ``The most important asset of 
government is the  confidence it enjoys of its citizens to whom it is 
accountable. If government is to play a positive role in society, as it 
must, honesty and integrity in our political institutions must be 
restored''.
<P>
	Instead of restoring it in this budget, what has happened in the 
House today has shattered it. What the government once described 
as sleaze by the Conservative Party is now depicted as an honest 
mistake: ``We did not know what we were doing''.
<P>
	At least there is some disagreement here between the Prime 
Minister and the finance minister. The finance minister says it was 
an honest mistake but the Prime Minister does not agree. He still 
says it was not a mistake, that the government is living up to its 
word in the red book.
<P>
	To suggest that government members do not know what they are 
doing, they are not new members of Parliament; most of the people 
in cabinet have been here for many years. To suggest that all of 
those years in opposition have been wasted and that they have 
taken over the reins of government and do not know what they are 
doing is an absurdity Canadian voters will not accept.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	When our current finance minister was in opposition he was very 
much opposed to harmonization of the GST; harmonizing the GST 
with the PST would entrench it forever and we would never be able 
to do anything about this hated tax. How the rhetoric changes when 
one moves from opposition to government. One wonders which 
statement to believe, the statement that was made in opposition or 
the statement being made by the government today.
<P>
	This is the old style politics of saying one thing to win votes and 
doing whatever once elected. The promise to scrap, abolish, get rid 
of the GST was a cold and calculated vote grabber. It was made 
with every intention to win votes. When we consider that some of 
the ridings were won by as few as two, three and eleven votes, the 
promise that was made in less than good faith could very well have 
swung those seats to enable the government to win its mandate on a 
policy of deception and not one of being honest with the voters.
<P>
	When the Deputy Prime Minister, a veteran politician and by no 
means a rookie to this House, said that she would resign if the GST 
were not abolished, it was done in a cold and calculated way. She is 
currently suggesting it was done in the heat of the moment but that 
is not a fact. The videos of past press conferences will prove that. It 
was said more than once. It was said repeatedly during the 1993 
campaign.
<P>
	Canadian voters will not miss the glaring contradiction this week 
in the Prime Minister's reaction to two members of this House. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2023"> 2023 </A></B>
<P>
There was his reaction to the member for York South-Weston who 
stood on principle and said: ``This is not what we said to the 
Canadian  people. This is not what I said to the people in my riding 
and in all conscience I must resign from this government. I must 
step aside. I cannot face my people on anything less than that''.
<P>
	The member for York South-Weston was reprimanded for 
being honest with the voters he represents in this place. I should not 
have said he resigned. The Prime Minister removed him from 
caucus on the basis that the member should not represent his voters 
and be honest to himself but that he must do as he is told.
<P>
	Contrast that situation with the situation of the Deputy Prime 
Minister who said to the voters: ``I will resign''. The Prime 
Minister sees no problem there. She did not really mean it and she 
will remain as a member of this House.
<P>
	That contradiction, that double standard has not been missed by 
the voters across Canada. The public has lost confidence in this 
place and in their politicians. On the basis of what has happened 
here, that loss of confidence is certainly with good reason.
<P>
	I mentioned in question period that all of us will pay because of 
the lack of integrity displayed by the government in not living up to 
and honouring a promise that was made to the voters. Members on 
both sides of the House, federal, provincial, municipal, all 
politicians will be tarred by this brush that the voters cannot trust 
what politicians say when they are out seeking their votes. We will 
all pay very dearly for that, which is the tragedy of what has taken 
place here this week.
<P>
	The Prime Minister referred to the red book and said: ``There is 
not one promise I will not keep. Point to any page, any time and ask 
me''. Let us take a moment to do that.
<P>
	We have covered the GST. Compensation is now being offered to 
provinces to come onside at the expense of all of the provinces. 
Pressure is being put on Ontario. Ontario's finance minister has 
made it clear that the province of Ontario is not in the tax 
increasing business, it is in the business of decreasing taxes and 
giving some relief to taxpayers.
<P>
	Concerning NAFTA, the government promised to renegotiate, 
although that promise was not kept.
<P>
	MP pensions were not dealt with. There was some minor 
tinkering but the overhaul Canadians were looking for was not 
done. I am very proud to say that 51 out of 52 members of my party 
opted out of it where 97 per cent of government members stayed in. 
The government has lost all credibility in not dealing with that 
issue.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Freer votes were promised in the red book. I believe three private 
members' bills had free votes but not one government bill in two 
and a half years has been put to a free vote.
<P>
	The Liberals promised that old age security would not be cut and 
yet 25 per cent of seniors are going to be cut by 10 per cent. 
Universality, as they had promised, is dead.
<P>
	Let us go to the infrastructure program. Let us quote from page 
60 exactly what was outlined in the red book on infrastructure.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The term ``infrastructure'' refers to undertakings for the common benefit, 
such as transportation and communications links, and water and sewage 
systems.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Nowhere is there talk about boccie courts. Nowhere is there talk 
about a canoe museum. Nowhere is there talk about trade centres or 
hockey arenas. It talked about benefiting all citizens.
<P>
	That program was a $2 billion shell game that was played on the 
voters across Canada. What a great offer, a two for one. How could 
anyone resist it? The one taxpayer was being bribed with their own 
tax dollars?
<P>
	Finally, the ethics counsellor. On page 95, getting right to the 
core of returning integrity to government, the red book says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Ethics Counsellor will be appointed after consultation with the leaders of 
all parties in the House of Commons and will report directly to Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That did not happen.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I regret to tell the member his time has 
expired. Is there unanimous consent to let him continue?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak on this legislation 
which will allow the enactment of certain provisions of the budget 
for this year.
<P>
	It distresses me somewhat when I talk to people who do not seem 
to understand the serious financial situation in which this country 
finds itself. I believe it was a Liberal government about 30 years 
ago that started us on some very serious deficit financing and that 
was carried on by the Conservative Mulroney government which 
preceded this Liberal government.
<P>
	Canadians felt that when we entered into the election debate in 
1993 that the people who now represent this government 
recognized that this trend to go into serious deficit budgeting had to 
stop. It distresses me that although we hear them talking about 
lowering the deficit from $40 billion to $38 billion or $36 billion 
that they seem to believe that is going to solve the problem. It will 
not.
<P>
	Canadians are looking for a government that is committed to 
reducing government spending in very serious and real ways. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2024"> 2024 </A></B>
<P>
Speaking for voters and taxpayers of British Columbia, I know it 
concerns them when they  see that the government seems to deal 
differently with different parts of the country.
<P>
	The Liberals talk about things like equalization payments. There 
is a program which is supported by most if not all provinces where 
those provinces that do not have the ability to provide some of the 
basic services for their people that the taxpayers in those provinces 
who are in a better position economically are more than willing to 
add financial support to see that the basic services are provided to 
those have not provinces.
<P>
	Not only is there this equalization payment act that allows for 
this up front, but we are also finding, over and over again, that in 
different government policy programs there continues to be special 
financial considerations for these other provinces above and 
beyond the equalization payments that fall under the equalization 
payment act.
<P>
	The people in British Columbia are getting a little bit tired of 
carrying not only the additional burden under the equalization 
payments but a continual added burden in various legislation, 
whether it is the regional development grants, whether it is in the 
infrastructure program or whether it is the billion dollars that is 
going into Atlantic Canada to convince them to co-operate with the 
federal government in its harmonization of the GST and the 
provincial sales tax.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	The people of British Columbia are getting tired of having to pay 
for these programs in order to convince the have not provinces to 
co-operate with the federal government. To be quite honest, it is not 
fair to the taxpayers of British Columbia to have to support the 
equalization payments which give money to the have not 
provinces. It is not fair to the taxpayers of British Columbia to have 
to support Quebec's $90 million grant for settlement services for 
their immigration program.
<P>
	British Columbians know that the number of immigrants and 
refugees that province is going to be taking in is a very small 
portion of the total number of immigrants and refugees coming into 
Canada. It is not fair for taxpayers outside of the have not provinces 
to not only be hit with the equalization payments, but to continually 
support government programs which favour one region over 
another.
<P>
	The west coast fishery is struggling. It is proposed that the 
fishing fleet be cut in half. Hundreds and hundreds of west coast 
fishermen will be put out of business. They will not be able to 
afford their boats, their homes or look after their families. What is 
the response of the federal government? To throw a few pennies in 
that direction compared to the financial and other support that went 
to the east coast fishery when it was in difficulty.
<P>
	It is these inconsistencies in how the country is operated which 
promotes questions about being part of this country. Canadians do 
not understand the differences. Canadians do not understand why 
they pay  for the equalization program, the Canada-Quebec accord 
and again for the billion dollar buyout of Atlantic Canada. They 
have paid for programs which built hockey rinks and boccie courts. 
I do not know what boccie is, but that is okay. I do not have the time 
to play it anyway.
<P>
	Canadians do not understand how the government with a 
national debt I believe of $575 billion and growing, knowing that it 
is going to be $600 billion in debt in 1997, can continue to spend 
money for these programs at the expense of three provinces of the 
country.
<P>
	It is also difficult for Albertans to understand how it could be hit 
with the national energy program, where it put $900 billion more 
into confederation that it has received. It is continually being asked 
to spend more and more to support government programs such as 
the billion dollar expenditure to convince some of the have not 
provinces to let the federal Liberal government walk all over them 
one more time.
<P>
	I would suggest that with the exception of a few of the younger 
members of the House, the real tragedy is for the future 
generations. The real tragedy will be the young people of today 
who are having a difficult time affording a post-graduate education 
and when when they do get that education they are not able to find 
work. When they do find work it is at minimum wage which does 
not allow them to buy a house, buy a vehicle or establish a base to 
start a family. That is the real tragedy.
<P>
	Part of the tragedy is that the federal government continues a 
process which expects those individuals who are already struggling 
to make their place in Canadian society to pay for programs and 
policies which they are not going to receive any benefit from. It is 
my children and my grandchildren who are going to see most of 
their income going to pay the debt of the federal government, the 
debt of the provincial government and to pay the cost of municipal 
government.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	That is not fair. It is not fair to these young people who are 
looking to the future with some hope and excitement to find out 
that all they are doing is paying for programs of which I and my 
parents have had the benefit.
<P>
	In my two and one-half years in this House I would like to say I 
have seen some change in attitude from the government side, but I 
cannot honestly say that I have. I do not see any difference between 
the Liberal government of today and the Brian Mulroney 
Conservative government of days gone by. It has an attitude of 
largesse when spending money, of not understanding that the 
government's money comes from the taxpayers and that the 
government does not have this great big money tree growing 
outside of Centre Block.
<P>
	I can honestly say I do not see any difference in attitude and that 
is the greatest tragedy of all. We are no  further ahead now than we 
were three or four years ago when the Canadian people said they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2025"> 2025 </A></B>
<P>
wanted something different. They wanted a government to take 
control of government spending.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I might indicate that I have to interrupt 
the debate 1.35 p.m.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to start off by doing something just a little 
different. I have to offer the House a correction of what my own 
colleague, the hon. member for Simcoe Centre said.
<P>
	He pointed out that the Prime Minister had said: ``There is not 
one single promise I will not keep,'' and he suggested that he did 
not live up to that. I have to point out to my hon. colleague that the 
Prime Minister, in fact, did. The Prime Minister said there was not 
one promise that he would not keep and he is absolutely right. 
There is a whole pile of them.
<P>
	The Prime Minister likes to twist things around and use 
semantics. By doing that, he is technically correct but it is a bigger 
shame to say that he did not keep one promise. He did not keep any 
of his promises, relatively speaking.
<P>
	I am the Reform Party's transport critic. I might add the national 
transport critic. I would like to focus my comments on those 
transport issues that relate to this budget.
<P>
	One in which I have had a lot of involvement is probably one of 
the bigger and more scandalous pieces of legislation that this 
Liberal government has been involved in, and that is the Pearson 
airport development contract.
<P>
	I did not see anywhere in this budget proposal money allocated 
for the cost that this government is going to incur because of its 
unwarranted interference in the private marketplace and its 
overturning of the rule of law in the mess that it has started with 
this Pearson airport legislation.
<P>
	There are all kinds of costs involved in that legislation and one 
cost which is huge and growing daily are legal costs. I see nothing 
under transport that shows the cost of defending this absolutely 
unconscionable legislation originally called Bill C-22. Now I 
believe it is Bill C-28. It was hardly worth giving it a new number 
when it came through the House again. It only took one minute and 
35 seconds. Nobody was allowed to speak on it. I do not think it 
was worth the costs for that second time around.
<P>
	The government had to involve its legal and justice departments 
in order to draft this terrible piece of legislation. Then when justice 
did seem to prevail a bit and it could not get this bill through the 
House and through the Senate, the consortium, as is its right in 
normal society, took the matter to the Supreme Court of Ontario.
<P>
	First the government used the might of the tax dollar, the 
Canadian taxpayers' money, and mounted first a legal challenge to 
try to prevent it from going to court.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	That cost us a bundle of money right there. There is nothing in 
the budget about that. When they lost all their stalling tactics and 
ran out of things they could do, they finally went to court.
<P>
	The court case was dealing with whether there was a contract and 
if so was the government in breach of that contract. The 
government mounted a tremendous defence with a battery of 
justice department lawyers and lost.
<P>
	There were big costs involved in that. There is nothing in the 
budget dealing with that or future legal costs. Having lost it and 
having the unlimited resources of Canadian taxpayer money, they 
mounted an appeal.
<P>
	They did all their preparation, it went to court and through the 
whole appeal process. They lost again. Millions and millions more 
of taxpayer dollars were wasted. Now they are in court for a third 
time, with the court having recognized that there was a contract and 
that the government was in breach of that contract.
<P>
	The government, having exhausted its appeal rights, is now in 
court asking what compensation should be given. When we get the 
compensation, the consortium that had a contract, which the courts 
have said was a legal and binding contract breached by the 
government, is asking for over $600 million in compensation.
<P>
	Most of this is lost opportunity for profit. This is a normal thing 
to sue for when one unjustifiably has a contract taken away. Once 
again, the government has its battery of lawyers trying to defend 
the terrible piece of legislation the Liberal government brought 
forward.
<P>
	Again it is costing untold amounts of taxpayer dollars. This is in 
this fiscal year, but nothing in the budget. There is nothing in the 
budget about the compensation package either.
<P>
	Are we getting our money's worth for all these millions of 
dollars in legal costs? Here in the House the government said for 
two years while this bill was going through that this was a terrible 
contract, that it was far too rich and that the developers would make 
too much money. That was the justification for the cancellation.
<P>
	What have these lawyers done with all the money they are 
spending, money that is not in the budget? What are they using for 
a defence? They are saying to the court there should not be any 
costs awarded to the contract holder for lost profit. It was such a 
bad contract with such a likelihood of the contractors going broke 
that they probably would not have made any money at all.
<P>
	It seems like one side of the justice department lawyers should 
get together with the other side and get their stories straight. If the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2026"> 2026 </A></B>
<P>
government is then to squander  millions of dollars on legal 
defence of this legislation, at least we might get something by way 
of some value for our money.
<P>
	Let us look at the financial impact of the contract. Thousands of 
jobs were involved in this contract at not $1 cost to the Canadian 
taxpayer. One of the many utopian schemes the Liberal government 
came out with is jobs, jobs, jobs; it would create jobs.
<P>
	Before the government started running on this, there were 
studies done that indicated that it cost the government $75,000 to 
create a $35,000 job. For this, it gets $10,000 worth of economic 
benefits, tax revenues versus paying out on social programs, for a 
net loss of $65,000 a job. That is the cost to the Canadian taxpayer 
of the government's buying jobs.
<P>
	Now that the government has run through its infamous job 
creation program dealing with infrastructure, if we take the number 
of permanent jobs the government claims it created and divide it by 
the amount of money spent, we find $75,000 a job. Is that not 
interesting?
<P>
	Thousands of jobs could be created by the contract the 
government cancelled with not $1 of cost to the Canadian taxpayer. 
The contract holders were to spend over $800 million at not one 
dime cost to the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	I do not see anything anywhere in the budget dealing with 
replacing those jobs at Pearson airport at the cost of hundreds of 
millions of dollars.
<P>
	Because this construction is not going on, we have tax loss of all 
kinds.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	The government specifically banned passenger facility tax to the 
consortium to build this. Now it has to build the facilities itself at a 
cost now of over $1 billion. There is nothing in the budget for that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
Pursuant to an order made earlier today, it is my duty to interrupt 
the proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to 
dispose of the second reading stage of the bill now before the 
House.
<P>
	The question is on the amendment to the amendment. Is it the 
pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment to the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the amendment to

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>

	The House resumed from March 27, 1996 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-216, an act to amend the Broadcasting Act 
(broadcasting policy), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-216 
entitled ``An act to amend the Broadcasting Act (broadcasting 
policy)'', which was introduced by the hon. member for 
Sarnia-Lambton, gives me an opportunity to rise in the House 
today to address this issue.
<P>
	I am doubly pleased to do so since I share the hon. member's 
concerns, and I congratulate him on supporting the protection and 
preservation of cultural industries in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	The bill before us proposes to amend section 3 of the 
Broadcasting Act to protect consumers against the questionable 
practices of certain cable companies and to question the almost 
abiding role played by the Canadian Radio-Television and 
Telecommunications Commission, the CRTC.
<P>
	We will recall that, over a year ago, cable companies were 
authorized by the CRTC to increase their revenues through 
negative option billing. What is this high handed method used by 
cable companies?
<P>
	In 1994, the CRTC licensed eight new specialty services, 
including the Réseau de l'information, or RDI. These services were 
available starting on January 1, 1995. That is when the new 
channels were added, in most cases, to the basic service provided to 
subscribers, who then had to pay a monthly surcharge without ever 
having been notified or consulted.
<P>
	Cable companies had introduced negative option billing before 
finding themselves confronted to angry subscribers. They have 
since had to backtrack and apologize to their customers, promising 
that, in the future, when they introduced new services, they would 
give subscribers a choice.
<P>
	Is it not paradoxical for the CRTC, whose mandate includes 
looking after the interests of television service consumers, did not 
say a thing and that circumstances led the cable companies to 
self-regulate? In light of the CRTC's neglect of duty, Bill C-216 
proposes to legislate to prevent this kind of situation from ever 
occurring again.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2027"> 2027 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	We agree with the spirit of Bill C-216, which seeks to give 
consumers greater control over the programming services they get 
and, of course, over the costs of such services. We certainly hope 
that Canadians and Quebecers can enjoy adequate protection, so 
that no company can demand from them money for programming 
services that they never requested or accepted. TV viewers must 
pay for the services they want, not for those a cable distributor or 
the CRTC wants to impose on them.
<P>
	That being said, we wonder, as the hon. member for 
Sarnia-Lambton did on March 27, about the federal government's 
authority to legislate on this matter. As the hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe pointed out, Quebec already has a consumer 
protection act to prevent abuse such as negative option billing.
<P>
	The member for Richmond-Wolfe also said that such bill 
tabled in this House is very clearly a duplication of regulations and 
an intrusion of the federal government into the jurisdiction of the 
state of Quebec. It is not ill will on the part of the member for 
Sarnia-Lambton, added my colleague, it is because his own 
government has not taken its responsibilities and he is calling it to 
order. He is also reminding the government that many provinces 
have no consumer protection legislation and that the present 
government, with the CRTC, is sending a very clear signal to cable 
distributors to take whatever action they see fit.
<P>
	This bill reminds us once more of the ineffectiveness of 
Canadian federalism. The Consumer Protection Act is a provincial 
law, while broadcasting is regulated by federal legislation. The 
result is that when consumer rights need to be protected in the 
broadcasting sector, there is overlap.
<P>
	Even in the case of something as simple as consumer protection, 
regarding which there seems to be a consensus, the whole issue 
turns into a federal-provincial tangle. Last year, the former heritage 
minister himself thought that broadcasting was a field of provincial 
jurisdiction. A few days later he revised his position and stated that 
broadcasting came under federal jurisdiction. If the former 
Minister of Canadian Heritage had trouble making sense of all this, 
how can ordinary citizens figure out these contradictory signals?
<P>
	Let us be clear, Quebec, just like Nova Scotia, has already passed 
legislation to protect its consumers against negative option billing. 
The problems experienced by Canadian subscribers in January 
1995 did not happen in Quebec. Quebec has, for some time now, 
assumed its responsibilities with its Consumer Protection Act.
<P>
	What Canadians and Quebecers want is a government that is 
effective, able to act rapidly in the interests of the public, not 
governments that overlap, contradict each other and duck issues. In 
the area of consumer  protection, we believe that the provinces can 
best meet these needs. If people in the other provinces are not 
happy to find themselves subscribing through negative option 
billing, they must urge their provincial governments to take action.
<P>
	Incidentally, when all this happened, at least three provinces, 
British Columbia, Ontario and Manitoba, indicated their intention 
to step in to prohibit commercial practices such as negative option 
billing. Why does the federal government now want to bring in 
legislation, unless it is to duplicate what the provinces are doing or 
make up for others' failure to act.
<P>
	The other question raised by Bill C-216 concerns the 
appropriateness of adopting such a measure at this time. The 
disputes in question took place over a year ago and were resolved 
subsequently, under pressure from consumers. Well after everyone 
else, when the problems are a thing of the past, when the provinces 
are beginning to assume their responsibilities, when the cable 
companies have regulated themselves, the federal government 
would now like to pass this bill today. Why? The Liberals know 
why and we have a good idea.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	We repeat that the provinces are best placed to regulate the 
business practices of cable companies, including negative 
optioning.
<P>
	The member for Sarnia-Lambton and the federal government 
should, instead, look at the new challenges created by 
technological developments in telecommunications, which will 
increase in both number and complexity. We already have a pretty 
good idea of what to expect at the turn of the century. It is only a 
matter of time before consumers have broadcasting services on a 
pay-per-view basis. Apart from a few common interest channels, 
people will make their own choice and pay only for the services 
they want.
<P>
	The choice available to consumers will be ever more vast, and 
government control will be increasingly difficult. This is where the 
government will have to be more vigilant than ever before in order 
to ensure the survival of Canada's cultural institutions.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois shares the concerns of the member for 
Sarnia-Lambton and, as we said earlier, the principles underlying 
Bill C-216. However, for the reasons given earlier, including the 
duplication of provisions of the Quebec consumer protection act, 
we cannot support this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to speak 
to you briefly, you and those assembled here, on bill Private 
Member's Bill C-216 on negative option billing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2028"> 2028 </A></B>
<P>
	First of all, I wish to congratulate my colleague from 
Sarnia-Lambton for his unflagging, and finally successful, 
efforts over recent months to get this question onto the Order 
Paper.
<P>
	Most Canadians will recall the launching of the new Canadian 
specialized services some 15 months ago. It is unfortunate that this 
excellent opportunity to discover these Canadian programs was 
overshadowed by the issue of what is called ``negative option 
billing''.
<P>
	The public did not criticize the choice of programming, but 
rather the fact that they were trying to force subscribers to pay for a 
whole package of programs and then burdening them with the need 
to reject the options they did not want.
<P>
	My colleague's proposal will amend paragraph 3(1)(<I>t</I>) of the 
Broadcasting Act on distribution undertakings, making use of the 
negative option approach illegal.
<P>
	It is important to point out that the Minister of Heritage and 
myself, as well as the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton, are all 
vigorously opposed to the practices that were common early in 
1995, and we hope that the committee debates will cast more light 
on the optimum way of solving this question once and for all, so as 
to implement an approach that is better suited to the concerns of the 
Canadian consumer.
<P>
	You may be aware that the Broadcasting Act is mainly concerned 
with key principles and objectives in the area of culture, and not 
with trade practices such as negative option billing.
<P>
	Therefore it might be worthwhile if, during their discussions on 
the matter, committee members considered referring it to the 
CRTC with a view to amending its regulations or the mechanisms 
governing the licensing process.
<P>
	By changing the regulations, the commission might set new 
requirements for negative option use, or make the standards 
imposed upon industry for customer service more stringent.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Perhaps it is time for a national approach to the rights of 
consumers. Despite the need for Canadians to know about the 
diversity of quality Canadian programming on the newer specialty 
channels, it cannot be done at the expense of consumer choice. It is 
the right of Canadian consumers to have Canadian choices but not 
to have these forced upon them.
<P>
	New information technologies are transforming the traditional 
parameters between producers and consumers. New players can 
offer an ever increasing range of viewing choices that transcend 
territorial boundaries and pose new challenges for the 
dissemination of our cultural products. Canadians know this. 
Therefore, it is important that all distribution undertakings follow 
the  same rules and recognize the consumers' right to be consulted 
before subscribing to new services.
<P>
	The CRTC is preparing to re-examine a wide variety of new 
applicants ready to deliver to Canadians new and exciting program 
venues. Previously the CRTC has expressed its concern about 
negative option marketing. The minister is strongly behind the end 
of negative optioning and is prepared to support measures which 
ensure that all future programming entries are evaluated on their 
own merit without resorting to a marketing instrument such as 
negative optioning. This point will be made clearly to all persons 
concerned with broadcasting regulations.
<P>
	This reminds me that the issue of Canadian content and 
programming which underlined this episode provoked some very 
strong views, particularly from the western provinces. In my view, 
the past 25 years or so of Canadian content regulations have 
allowed us to grow from a fledgling music and television industry 
to one that has gained international acceptance and recognition. We 
should take great pride in everything that has contributed to forging 
our identity.
<P>
	The competition will be fierce for the specialty channels that 
want their programming to go to the largest possible number of 
Canadian households. However, we know the CRTC has received 
as many as 40 proposals for its May hearing on new specialty 
devices or services. This large number of proposals demonstrates 
that Canada's creators and broadcasters still contemplate original 
concepts and remain optimistic about the Canadian public's 
reception of their offerings.
<P>
	At this critical time when tensions and divisions loom to tear us 
apart, we must call on the ideals and values that bind us. We must 
affirm our commitment to Canada's cultural objectives which 
define our national identity.
<P>
	In the era of a multichannel universe and the information 
highway, the challenge to keep our domestic content on the 
airwaves can be both frightening and exhilarating. The new 
opportunities created by technical advances also translate into 
global consumer empowerment, making McLuhan's global village 
a reality. McLuhan could also have said that in this global village 
the Greek democratic ideal is resuscitated in a modern form in 
which the consumer is poised to become a pivotal player in a newly 
emerging marketplace.
<P>
	I personally support the project put forward by the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will also speak in favour of Bill C-216.
<P>
	Bill C-216 is interesting in that it deals with regulating the 
broadcasting industry so it cannot bill somebody for something 
they really do not want. It cannot force somebody to take a service 
and then charge them for it unless that person indicates they do not 
want the service.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2029"> 2029 </A></B>
<P>
	During the debate when this actually happened I was taken 
aback by the consumer response. My riding has two cable 
companies. One of the cable companies chose to use negative 
billing while the other company chose not to do so. It reminded 
me of when I was in municipal politics and was phoned at all hours 
of the day and night about barking dogs, garbage not being picked 
up, and all those other issues that hit so very close to a person's 
home and environment. This issue really seemed to catch 
consumers and get them up in arms trying to find some way to 
change the policy.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The amount of animosity from these individuals when they 
phoned my office, came to see me or wrote letters was interesting. 
What most concerned them was that the concept was supported by 
the regulating body. The CRTC supported it then and as I 
understand it the CRTC continues to support the concept of billing 
individuals for something unless they indicate they do not want it. 
The consumers had a feeling of helplessness in trying to deal with 
the issue. I find it a little distressing that a Canadian licensing body 
would support such a concept.
<P>
	I heard the argument from across the way that it is important to 
protect Canadian content and our Canadian heritage through the 
broadcasting industry but I do not buy it. If Canadian content and 
Canadian culture is done properly, it will sell itself. People will be 
more than willing to pay for that programming and will want to 
watch it. Canadian artists do not need a regulating body which is 
forcing consumers to pay for something they do not want.
<P>
	The Bloc member mentioned that Quebec and Nova Scotia had 
legislation in place which prevented this kind of negative option 
billing. What she failed to mention is that British Columbia also 
has legislation which prevents this kind of negative billing but only 
in some services. Unfortunately broadcasting falls under federal 
legislation and therefore the provinces do not have control over the 
broadcasting companies, such as the cable companies.
<P>
	With the new conversation of today, the information highway, 
and the competition among the telephone companies, the satellite 
companies and the cable companies as to who is going to control 
the information highway, we should be looking at how they 
practise business. If there are companies in the cable industry 
which choose to exercise their monopoly and control over 
broadcasting and the delivery of this service to the consumer by 
using these kinds of practices, there are Canadians other than 
myself who would be very concerned about allowing them to 
control the new technology of the information highway.
<P>
	We would be very uncomfortable with a company which thinks 
nothing of providing people with something they do not want 
without asking them, billing them for it and then hiding behind the 
federal regulatory body saying that it agrees so it is okay. I have 
extreme  difficulty in suggesting that the Canadian government 
should be supporting cable companies having control over the 
information highway.
<P>
	I want to get back to the two cable companies in my community, 
the one which chose to use negative billing and the one which 
chose not to do so. The reaction and attitude of the consumers to 
those two companies was interesting.
<P>
	One local company chose to offer the new programming at an 
extra cost but provided it to the consumers I believe for a period of 
60 days so that they could see what was offered on the new 
channels. The consumers appreciated that. They could decide 
whether or not they wanted to purchase the service. Consumers 
appreciated and supported that approach. I would imagine many 
consumers chose to take on these new channels.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	On the other hand, consumers were outraged at being billed for 
something they did not want. However, if they asked not to have 
those new channels they would also lose channels they had 
previously and still wanted but which were tied into these new 
channels.
<P>
	I do not think that is right. Consumers indicated to the 
companies which did this that they did not think it was right. 
Unfortunately the biggest voice consumers can have is to cancel 
their service or refuse to buy the product. That was precisely what I 
presented to them, that if they did not like what was happening, the 
consumer has a choice. That choice is to say they no longer want 
the services because they do not appreciate what you are doing.
<P>
	These people will not have the choice anymore because, as in 
many other communities, one cable company has bought out other 
cable companies. In my community now there will be no choice. 
There will not be two cable companies to provide different ways of 
dealing with these situations. There will be a monopoly, a cable 
company with no competition to do whatever it wants.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party caucus will be quite interested in 
supporting Bill C-216. The bill proposes to amend the 
Broadcasting Act to disallow this type of negative billing. It will 
amend section 3 of the Broadcasting Act by providing in the 
context of broadcasting policy that a cable distributor or other 
distribution undertaking should not demand money from a person 
for the provisions or sale of a new programming service where the 
person has not agreed to receive the new service.
<P>
	It is important that it will include other distribution 
undertakings. We have competition for control of the information 
highway. There are telephone companies and satellite companies 
that want to move into this new field.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2030"> 2030 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill and the amendments it suggests would include any 
other companies coming into the system, be they telephone 
companies, satellite companies or more cable companies. I believe 
this is an important consideration for us today. It is clear to anyone 
who has taken an interest in this that there will be distribution 
companies outside of cable companies. This is very important, 
knowing what happened last year, to make sure it does not happen 
again by anyone involved in providing those services.
<P>
	We are pleased to support this effort. We feel it will be an 
important contribution to the Broadcasting Act, even though many 
of us question whether the CRTC even has a place in Canadian 
society. It would put some controls on it. I believe that is important.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in support of Bill C-216.
<P>
	Negative option billing has been used by cable companies in the 
past to the consternation of tens of thousands of Canadians. As 
parliamentarians we face a clear choice on this issue. We can lead 
Canadians into the 21st century by creating laws to regulate the 
manner in which cable companies market their increasingly vast 
array of channels or we can leave it to the industry to formulate 
these policies.
<P>
	Parliamentarians are accountable to citizens. The industry is 
accountable to its shareholders. It is up to us to determine whose 
interests are paramount. We must take a leadership role and ensure 
Canadians are presented with clear choices from cable companies. 
Our decision on this matter will send a clear signal on the manner 
in which parliamentarians view the role of government in the large 
communications revolution sweeping Canada and the world. The 
cable industry is part of this phenomenon, which includes the 
Internet and soon direct to home satellite television.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	The emergence of these new technologies has evolved to a level 
where we can truly say we are witnessing the evolution of a new 
frontier. It is a frontier without political or geographic boundaries, 
a frontier which offers infinite choices to consumers and a frontier 
where entertainment and productivity share the same medium.
<P>
	We must be mindful that it is also a frontier in which the roles of 
government and large corporations remain largely undefined. We 
are faced with the choice of how to approach this frontier. We have 
demonstrated we are not afraid to act in the best interests of 
Canadians with respect to the Internet.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has indicated that he intends to introduce 
legislation to deter the promotion of hate propaganda in 
cyberspace. I applaud the minister for this initiative which 
reinforces the principle that government should become involved 
in an issue when it is in the best interests of Canadians.
<P>
	From an ethical perspective this is certainly the case with respect 
to negative option billing. The notion that a consumer can be 
charged for a product which they have not explicitly indicated they 
wish to purchase contradicts the principles of the free marketplace. 
Specifically, the principle of consumer choice which is central to 
our economy is threatened by such schemes.
<P>
	The unprecedented consumer protests of early 1995 against 
negative option billing strongly suggest Canadians support the 
salience of consumer choice. Bill C-216 recognizes this reality. 
Canadians joined together to protest negative option billing. Now 
is not the time for parliamentarians to abandon them to cable 
companies.
<P>
	There is certainly a great need for clarity among the billing 
practices in the cable industry. A poll by Compass Research in 
1993 found that 66 per cent of cable subscriber recipients believed 
they are receiving basic cable service, the lowest priced channel 
package. The reality was that only 8 per cent of the subscribers 
actually received basic services. Ninety-two per cent of cable 
subscribers received extended services of some kind but only 34 
per cent were aware they were paying more than the basic rate. This 
is unacceptable.
<P>
	I am confident it would have been remedied if we had been 
dealing with any other industry. In all fairness to the cable industry, 
there is currently a lag between the technology available to allow 
consumers to pay for only those channels they want and the 
technology which offers a virtual universe of channels.
<P>
	Cable companies are feeling pressure from consumers to expand 
the choices available to them. In response to these demands they 
have assembled packages of specialty channels. The element of 
choice which cable companies are trying to promote through this 
scheme is lost with negative option billing.
<P>
	The president of Rogers Cablesystems stated that without 
negative option billing subscriber acceptance rates would be cut 
and new channels would have difficulty surviving. While I have 
only the best wishes for new speciality channels, this cable 
company is pinning its survival on successfully deceiving 
Canadians into make a purchase they otherwise would have 
refused.
<P>
	It is time for a new plan. It is not acceptable to implement a 
billing regime whose purpose is to deceive consumers into making 
a purchase. The cable industry has admitted this the main appeal 
and function of negative option billing. In the interests of Canadian 
consumers it is time we put an end to this practice.
<P>
	I congratulate the member for Sarnia-Lambton for introducing 
this much needed legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure and with the confidence and backing of my 
constituents that I stand in support of Bill C-216.

<P>
	This bill is about protecting the consumer's right to choice and 
the banning of a marketing practice which should have never been 
allowed to take hold in this country.
<P>
	Negative option marketing is a practice by which a company can 
automatically add a service and its related charges to contracts 
without the prior consent of the consumer. The service and charge 
remain as long as the consumer does not notify the company that he 
or she does not want the new service. It is like someone dropping 
off a package at one's door and demanding payment unless it is 
returned. The difference is that the consumer who receives the 
package at the door can call upon laws to protect his right as a 
consumer. No such protection is available to the consumer of 
broadcasting and telecommunications services.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	We know we are here today debating Bill C-216 because of the 
cable revolt in 1995. It is regrettable it took a revolt to bring us to 
the point of debating legislation that guarantees basic protection for 
cable subscribers. For all of us, that revolt served as a real eye 
opener as to the true consideration given to consumers by the 
CRTC and the cable companies.
<P>
	The CRTC in pursuit of its mandate and the cable companies in 
pursuit of profit forgot the consumer who did not want new 
channels, new packages, or new fees. Hundreds of people called, 
wrote and faxed my office to protest the changes and the practice.
<P>
	My response was simple. As consumers, we hold the ultimate 
power. If one is dissatisfied with a cable company, cancel the cable 
or reduce it to basic service. Send a strong message. They did and I 
did. Within a few days, our local cable distributor announced new 
packages, new fee schedules and new trial periods for new 
channels. Consumers were successful, but should they need to 
resort to a revolt to protect their interests? No.
<P>
	It is our job as responsible parliamentarians to listen to 
consumers and implement a ban on negative option marketing. 
This is only common sense. A company should not be allowed to 
introduce a new service into an existing agreement unless the 
consumer expressly consents to accepting the new service.
<P>
	The legitimacy of a contract depends on mutual intent and 
agreement: an intent to enter into a contract; an agreement on the 
subject matter of the contract, an agreement on the party's 
respective obligations to one another and an agreement on the 
consequences for failing to meet those obligations.
<P>
	A reasonable consumer would not agree to let another 
unilaterally modify the conditions of the contract without prior 
consent. Nonetheless, the courts allow negative option marketing. 
The CRTC accepts it as a necessary  evil and the Government of 
Canada permits its continuance.
<P>
	Recently I read media reports that stated a government 
preference for industry self-regulation and market solutions to deal 
with negative option marketing. I truly hope this is not the case. 
Canadians know and appreciate the advantages of competition and 
the discipline of the markets, but we are not dealing here with open 
markets. We are dealing with cable companies that have CRTC 
sanctioned monopolies.
<P>
	Consumers do not have a choice as to their cable distributors. 
This represents a significant disequilibrium in power in favour of 
the companies, unless of course consumers revolt from coast to 
coast to coast. Such astute market based solutions are not a viable 
option for protecting subscribers.
<P>
	Recently Canadians witnessed the CRTC approve the 
introduction of the V-chip as an effective tool to empower parents 
and to combat violence on TV. It is ironic that the CRTC did not 
extend this support for consumer empowerment to the elimination 
of negative option marketing.
<P>
	Certainly, the logic behind the power to choose what programs 
we view applies to the channels we want to receive in our homes. 
Bill C-216 does just that. In the heat of the cable protest, the 
experts told us that yes, the situation was regrettable and yes, the 
CRTC was the broadcasting regulator but it did not have the power 
to eliminate the practice. We were told that the responsibility for 
the regulation of marketing practices was couched in the legislative 
powers of the provinces, presumably under section 91(13), the 
provincial jurisdiction over civil rights in a province.
<P>
	The hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton has proven the experts 
wrong. The member must be congratulated for his determination 
and ingenuity in devising constitutionally valid legislation that will 
stop negative option marketing. I know the hundreds of Canadians 
who called my office in January 1995 to protest against the cable 
companies and the thousands of others who felt powerless faced by 
the decision of a monopoly support, thank and commend the 
member for Sarnia-Lambton.
<P>
<B>(1415 )</B>
<P>
	It is said that negative option marketing is a necessary evil, a 
necessary tool to assist the introduction of Canadian broadcasting 
services. Few question the need or desirability of Canadian 
programming nor the urgency to establish a strong presence prior 
to the inundation of American programming in the 500-channel 
universe.
<P>
	However, we must question the method of achieving those 
objectives. The CRTC will not win over supporters for Canadian 
programming by permitting cable companies to introduce new 
channels without obtaining the prior consent of subscribers.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2032"> 2032 </A></B>
<P>
	Equity and fairness is at the heart of this bill. It is our duty as 
responsible parliamentarians to respond today to a situation that 
has for too long been tolerated. Consumers have not only asked, 
but demanded, an end to negative option marketing. Protecting 
subscribers from an unconscionable marketing practice is central 
to this bill. It establishes a legislative framework in which the 
consumer matters despite a monopolized marketplace. Protecting 
the consumer does not only benefit the consumer but it benefits 
the industry. It sets out the rules for commercial transactions in 
the sale of broadcasting services. This creates stable and 
predictable rules and a more level playing field.
<P>
	However, more importantly, it ensures the long term viability of 
the industry by guaranteeing that the consumers will determine the 
success and failure of new channels. If this is not done, consumers 
will turn away from cable and embrace new mediums that better 
reflect their choice of programming. I do not believe that such a 
situation would benefit Canadian programming and the Canadian 
film and television industries. We must seek a balance between the 
recognized need for Canadian voices on our airwaves and respect 
for the consumer.
<P>
	I believe that banning negative option marketing is an important 
step, not by far the last, in re-establishing this balance.
<P>
	I stand in support of Bill C-216 and invite all my colleagues to 
join me in that support. After all, it is a bill that was demanded by a 
vast majority of our constituents. In closing, I would like to once 
again thank the member for Sarnia-Lambton for his efforts on 
behalf of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Sarnia-Lambton has 
the right to briefly summarize the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as the sponsor of this bill it is my pleasure to be the last speaker.
<P>
	I will speak very briefly. I hope that all members of this place 
will support this bill. As many members have stated, people want 
this bill because they want control over what comes into their 
homes. People do not want to give control to the CRTC. The CRTC 
can determine who will be on the airwaves but people want some 
mode of governance of what they see on their televisions and what 
they are going to pay for.
<P>
	This, to me, is not a question of Canadian culture. It is a question 
of choice for Canadians. That is the reason I brought in this bill and 
why I am going to ask all members of this place to support it.
<P>
