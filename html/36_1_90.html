</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to offer my congratulations to Hillcrest School in my 
riding of Bruce—Grey which will be celebrating its 50th 
anniversary reunion this weekend in Owen Sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1948 Hillcrest has provided primary and junior high school 
education in the Owen Sound area.  It has grown from a building 
housing 150 primary students to a large junior high school of 700 
students and a staff of 60. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reunions are always full of memories.  Returning staff and 
students will relive the thrill of the first day, remember 
obstacles they had to overcome and meet with friends. They will 
all get together to think about the dreams they had in the past 
and the future they will have together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As both the present and past students assemble at Hillcrest this 
weekend to celebrate I offer them my best wishes and 
congratulations.  I know that this weekend will be full of 
youthful memories, old friends and good times.

mainland and it has nothing to do with the Pacific Ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hundreds of large blue tarps are hanging from condominiums in a 
last ditch attempt to protect properties from extensive water 
damage during repairs due to second-rate building practices.  The 
Condominium Owners Association of British Columbia estimates the 
repair costs to be in the neighbourhood of $1 billion—similar to 
Canada's other recent natural disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These disaster victims are looking for help now.  It is a 
serious crisis and not even the Minister of National Revenue, 
whose own constituents are many of the troubled condo owners, has 
spoken a word about it in this House.

RRSP funds, make interest payments on loans deductible, or even

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as hon. 
members are aware, on April 7, 1868 a remarkable father of 
Confederation was assassinated.  However, 130 years later the 
legacy of Thomas D'Arcy McGee is symbolized by the goals that we 
as parliamentarians strive to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>McGee's important contributions reflect his Irish descendancy, 
defined by struggle and suffering, and his compassionate 
conscience which assisted in the development of the Canadian 
economic, social and political nature we have inherited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>McGee's work with immigrants led him into the political arena 
with a Montreal seat in the House of Assembly of the Canadas in 
1857.  He was responsible as a Reform MLA for legislating 
progressive social and health conditions and for providing a 
stable foundation for the Canadian fabric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also his participation in the Confederation debates that 
fostered his historical legacy as a compassionate visionary, 
encompassing an equitable partnership between two peoples which 
would result in what he called a new nationality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>McGee saw Canada as a nation that would bridge differences—

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
December 1997 we heard the justice minister say that she was 
meeting her provincial counterparts in Montreal to discuss 
changes to the YOA and she would get back to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1998 she was still in consultation, but she would 
get back to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week she tells us that she will respond in a timely 
fashion.  I guess that means she will get back to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need today is a commitment from the justice minister to 
announce changes to the YOA before we recess this summer.  I only 
hope that she will give us that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems all we get are words, words, words and no action.  For 
me everything boils down to either you cannot do something or you 
will not.  It is obvious that she either cannot make these 
changes to the YOA or she will not.  I wonder which it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope when the senior minister from Alberta returns to her 
riding she can explain to her constituents and the rest of 
Alberta why her bleeding heart eastern colleagues have torpedoed 
her law and order.

action, especially in terms of the safety of our children and 
grandchildren.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is Earth 
Day, which offers us the opportunity to reflect on our 
relationship with the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent generations, the human race's ability to modify the 
world ecosystem has increased in a spectacular way, because of 
our exploding population and our technological progress.  World 
economic activity, for instance, is 20 times what it was in 
1900.  Consequently, many human activities surpass our planet's 
ability to replenish its resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A short-sighted view will not enable us to solve these problems. 
We need to start to again incorporate environmental 
considerations with our day to day decisions as individuals, 
managers and legislators.  It is possible for economic 
development to go hand in hand with respect for the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International Earth Day reminds us that there is no time to 
waste in making the still theoretical concept of sustainable 
development a concrete reality.

right and wrong.  It is a moral issue.  It is morally wrong to 
abandon the sick.  It is even worse for the health minister to

billion, which could rise even higher when the end-of-year 
corrections come out this fall.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</b>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Health has stated that he is concerned about the 
integrity of the health care system.  It is not the integrity of 
the health care system that is in question.  It is the integrity 
of this government and the minister which are in question because 
the compensation being offered to some hepatitis C victims is not 
the compensation package that the minister promised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister do the right thing today and commit to 
compensating all hepatitis C victims who were infected through no 
fault of their own? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member refers to this government but she must also refer to 
the provincial governments who have taken the same position on 
the basis of public policy, Tory governments, her own party in 
Prince Edward Island, her own party in Ontario, Manitoba, 
Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week Canadian researchers disclosed that thousands of 
people lose their lives every year because they use prescription 
drugs as directed but have adverse consequences. Is the member 
suggesting we pay cash compensation to the estates of all those 
victims?  The implications of that approach for the health system 
are serious— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Speaker:</b>  The hon. member for Saint John. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</b>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Health cannot continue to hide behind other 
governments. Instead he must take a leadership role.  There is 
nothing wrong with anyone in this House who has made a decision 
standing up and saying “we have made the wrong decision, we are 
going to correct it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we measure the health minister's words carefully we will 
conclude the real reason the government will not compensate all 
the victims of hepatitis C is money.  The government wasted half 
a billion dollars on a botched helicopter deal, three-quarters of 
a billion dollars on Pearson airport and the list goes on. If 
money was found for these deals, why is the minister denying 
compensation to all of the innocent victims? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
as I have made clear, when confronted with a situation where 
there are people harmed by risks inherent in the medical system, 
governments have to choose.  Part of leadership on the part of 
the government is making tough decisions to protect the long term 
sustainability of the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the age of the class action.  It is the age of claims 
against governments.  Just last week we were sued in a class 
action by those who claimed that mercury fillings are causing 
health risks. Is the member suggesting the government should make 
cash payments to all those who have claims arising from the 
system?

Canadians without anybody really knowing what it is all about and 
without holding proper consultations, et cetera.

petition is from petitioners mostly in the Kamloops region.  They

that managing the family home and caring for preschool children 
is an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society.  They also point out that the Income Tax

health problems, and particularly that fetal alcohol syndrome and 
other alcohol related birth defects are 100% preventable by 
avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

interests of the child” not parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners go on to say that Canada is creating a 
bureaucracy to police parents and enforce the guidelines in a UN 
charter which has never been approved by parliament.  Not only 
are parental rights being undermined by implementing this UN 
charter but they are concerned it will create greater incentives 
for families to abdicate their parental responsibilities to the

care, aboriginal parents will be better able to work or 
participate in employment training to improve the financial 
prospects of their families, thereby contributing to the 
development of their communities.

developmental funding of $72 million over three years.  The

spaces.  Proposals are received at Human Resources Development 
Canada stating the purpose of the grants and subsidies, but are

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 20 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-39, an act to amend the Nunavut Act and the Constitution 
Act, 1867, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Deputy Speaker:</b>  When debate on this item was last

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will not take 15 minutes.  My intervention will be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been brought to my attention since I last spoke in this 
debate that we were being somewhat critical of the people of the 
Northwest Territories which is not so.  If we are critical of 
anyone, we are critical of the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, particularly the minister, for its 
handling of the entire Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The territories suffer a 30% unemployment rate and high suicide. 
They have poor health, reduced life expectancy, not to mention 
other social problems.  This has happened during the 
administration of the previous Tory and current Liberal 
governments.  We feel that the previous government completely 
failed the people of the Northwest Territories in developing its 
economy and its society.  This bill should be amended and passed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that the new government being established will have a 
far greater chance to develop a vision for its people, to 
implement it and to give its people hope.  It has been written 
that without a vision people will perish.   We want to see these 
people and their families move ahead and prosper economically and 
socially.  We want the very best for these people which they have 
not been getting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation moves power downward toward the people who will 
be governed.  That should mean that the people of the Northwest 
Territories will have more influence on their government.  I am 
sure this will produce better government in the eastern Arctic. 
We support them in that endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We call for an elected senator and we make our support for this 
bill conditional upon that.  We feel that better government 
includes people being able to pick their representatives in this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We question the government on its evasiveness and lack of 
preparedness in answering questions about cost.  Early estimates 
of the cost of establishing Nunavut were in the range of $150 
million.  That did not happen.  A later estimate made in October 
1997 set the price in the order of $300 million which is double 
the cost.  If they know why that is, they are not willing to say. 
So we do not know. We know it will cost more to increase the 
government because there will be another government in place in 
Nunavut.  We would like to see a reduction in the size of DIAND 
to compensate for the increased cost of establishing and 
maintaining this new government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as the official opposition have a responsibility to the 
taxpayers of Canada to ask questions about this and to get direct 
answers from the government on these matters.  We cannot simply 
stand by, clap our hands, say that is wonderful and whatever the 
cost, we approve of it 100%.  We are not standing in the way of 
these people achieving their goal but we want to know what the 
cost will be and how it will be offset in reduced costs for 
DIAND.  That is a major concern our party has with this 
legislation at this time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and 
Youth), Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill 
C-39, an act to amend the Nunavut Act and Constitution Act, 1867. 
This is a critical piece of legislation that is necessary as we 
move toward the creation of Nunavut on April 1, 1999, which is 
less than a year from now, to complete the whole process of the 
division of the Northwest Territories. As the member of 
parliament for the Western Arctic, I am in full support of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a coming of age in the Northwest Territories as there 
has never been before.  The political destiny of the north has 
been decided.  We are going to divide the Northwest Territories 
and create the new territory of Nunavut with all the tools of a 
democratic society.  This will include a governance structure. 
This would not be possible without the approval of this bill.  We 
need this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an exciting time in the north.  It is a time of much 
progression.  The north is very political.  If people from any 
other part of Canada or the world go to the north they will speak 
to some of the most knowledgeable and well travelled people.  We 
live in a microcosm of all the things that affect people from 
other parts of our country and from abroad.  Northerners travel 
the world.  Northerners are very political.  They are very 
knowledgeable about the politics of the day nationally, 
internationally and territorially.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are rife with activity.  We have many resource based 
activities that affect both of the new territories which will 
emerge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have three of the biggest diamond mining companies in the 
world right at the back door of those people who will be 
responsible for running their own activities.  We have Aber 
Resources and Rio Tinto.  We also have the Broken Hill 
Proprietary, BHP, Monopros and DeBeers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also being bombarded continually with the attempts of 
many groups to explore for other resources such as oil and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have in our midst a very friendly invasion of tourists 
who are captivated not only by the environment of the north but 
by the various aspects and phenomena of our environment such as the 
aurora borealis.  We have captivated Japanese tourists and other 
people from around the world who come to the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the opportunities and tools and armed with the legislation 
we have here we believe that people of the north will be able to 
take full advantage of that potential.  That is not to mention 
the collective leadership and wisdom, the corporate knowledge, 
the linguistic and cultural strength of peoples from both 
territories which will be reflected in the kind of leadership 
that leads those people once we have made the commitment to pass 
this legislation.  All the work that has already been undertaken, 
all of the preparation, all of the visionary strategies, the 
far-reaching planning and the training must not be ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be said that if you want to do the right thing in 
creating a democracy the principles of democracy are not 
necessarily predicated on price or cost.  Sometimes democracy is 
costly.  We would not have ten provinces and two territories if 
we did not endure cost.  If that were not the case, Newfoundland, 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan would not be provinces today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we talk about self-sustaining entities of governance, some of 
those provinces would not be provinces today.  Why apply one set 
of rules to them and another set of rules to the territories? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 is about making democracy work.  Without this bill 
Nunavut would not have a fully elected territorial leadership 
from its beginning days.  This legislation provides for the 
election of a legislative assembly before the territory 
officially comes into existence.  That is very important. 
Without that amendment to the Nunavut Act a commissioner without 
a mandate from the people of Nunavut would govern the new Nunavut 
government.  We cannot return, however briefly, to the early days 
of the Northwest Territories when governance was done from afar, 
in absentia, when the Northwest Territories was run from the 
south without having those people resident to really experience 
and be part of what needed to be done at the time.  We now have 
an opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people have been assigned their duties and they must be 
empowered to carry them out.  As legislators we can agree that 
locally elected representatives must govern Nunavut from day one. 
Elections in the north are very difficult.  Having firsthand 
experience in campaigning in the last three elections in the 
north, I know how difficult it is and how much lead time is 
required before an election.  The sheer distance, the remoteness, 
not to mention the severe inclement weather and environmental 
experiences can create problems during an election.  These are 
some of the things that are to be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of an election is also something that is quite 
prohibitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also addresses other important issues to ensure 
democracy.  Bill C-39 proposes amendments to guarantee 
representation of both Nunavut and the Northwest Territories in 
both the House of Commons and in the Senate of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague, the hon. member for Nunavut, would be happy to 
confirm, all Nunavutmiut, all northerners and all Canadians 
have a basic right to be represented in both institutions of 
parliament.  This bill is necessary to ensure that both the hon. 
member for Nunavut's constituents and my constituents have this 
basic right.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill ensures that both Nunavut and the Northwest 
Territories will have their own representatives in both the 
Senate and the House of Commons, which is not unlike anywhere 
else in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House and all Canadians listened with great interest to the 
debate of two days ago in this Chamber.  Unfortunately the Leader 
of the Official Opposition was trying to use this legislation as 
a springboard to advance the Reform Party's cause for Senate 
reform.  Senate Reform is something that we all think about, but 
I do believe that timing and appropriateness is everything in 
terms of politics.  We have to know the right time to speak on 
the right issue.  Unfortunately this type of grandstanding and 
manipulation is unacceptable.  It does nothing to make gains on 
the issue that is being promoted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Official Opposition is trying to steer the 
debate away from one of the most exciting and interesting events 
that is happening in our country.  It will shape the history of 
Canada.  I do not believe that was necessarily intentional.  I 
hope with the appropriate understanding of the north itself that 
would change.  I hope it was not intentional.  Given the right 
information, anyone can become informed, make the right choices 
and have the appropriate sensitivity about such an exciting 
opportunity as this for the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of highlighting the good work done by the parties 
involved in the creation of Canada's newest territory and 
celebrating the biggest event since Newfoundland joined 
Confederation, the Reform Party is trying to advance its own 
agenda on the backs of northerners.  I regret having to say that 
because to attack on the basis of partisanship is not part of my 
personality and normally it is not part of my political dialogue. 
I like to deal with the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very different view of the chamber of second sober 
thought.  Next year will be my 10th year in the House of Commons. 
When I was elected in 1988 there were many senators who had lives 
before they came here.  Some had been members of parliament. 
Some were business people who were renowned and revered in their 
communities.  They were my mentors and taught me many things.  I 
think of Senator Allan MacEachen, bless his soul. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat on the Charest committee, the Beaudoin—Dobbie committee 
and worked on Meech Lake.  Much of the basic fundamental 
understanding I gained on constitutional issues came from some of 
those senators who were there from the very beginning.  They had 
the collective wisdom, experience, education and knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To paint that picture of all senators and of that chamber, to 
put it in disrepute, is unacceptable to me.  I have no political 
motives in saying that, except perhaps to say that my experiences 
have been different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of highlighting the good work done by senators from all 
parties, it was as if they were trying to make their case by 
using a few extreme examples.  There is no Utopia.  There is no 
absolutely perfect system.  Every system has its bugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that we have a bicameral system of governance. 
Northerners are entitled to be fully represented.  In my opinion 
the two chambers are effective as they exist today.  Perhaps some 
individuals, in both Houses, could be faulted at different times. 
After all, they are only human.  But the present system is the one 
we chose.  It is the one that has been upheld and it works.  In my 
opinion it works well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be honest, this is a very non-partisan issue for me.  I think 
about Conservative appointed members like Wilbert Keon who is 
renowned around the world for his work as a heart surgeon. 
Landon Pearson is extraordinary in her work on behalf of children 
internationally.  She serves as an adviser to the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs.  I have worked with Landon Pearson.  I know her 
commitment, dedication and untiring efforts.  Jack Austin comes 
from a business background.  He is known throughout Asia for his 
work.

nothing to offer.  These people have something to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be proud when we are elected or appointed.  We should 
be proud of what we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of Senator Jacques Hébert and his tireless work on 
behalf of young people, specifically Katimavik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sister Peggy Butts is a nun from Atlantic Canada who was 
appointed to the Senate.  It is an unusual and great opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was given literature to read when I first came here as a young 
MP.  One of the first pieces I was asked to read was done by 
Senator David Croll.  It was an outstanding piece concerning 
poverty.  Some of its elements are still as relevant today as 
they were when he first wrote it.  It is very thought provoking, 
very sensitive and all encompassing.  Have a look.  These people 
have something to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Eugene Forsey was one of the great thinkers, the big 
dreamers.  In my language a big dreamer is not someone foolish; a 
big dreamer is someone who has a vision, who understands more 
than their own vision or more than their own internal little 
world.  They can see many things.  He was one of those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Serge Joyal was a former secretary of state.  He had 
vision.  He is the person who made the agreement with the 
Northwest Territories for the first Canada-NWT language 
agreement.  Not only did he provide for French-language services 
or bilingual services, he gave the Northwest Territories the 
opportunity, with $16 million, to develop an aboriginal language 
component for its government in which unilingual jurors and 
unilingual members of their legislative assembly could serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people have something to offer.  It is not all bad.  Who 
better represents the views of the people of Labrador than Bill 
Rompkey, a former member of parliament?  I have heard him. I 
worked with him on the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on.  These are just a few examples, but they are 
positive ones.  These are people who work just as hard as any 
member of parliament.  They are just as committed as any member 
of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill goes further than allowing for fair and equitable 
representation in the Nunavut legislative assembly and in 
parliament.  It is necessary to enable the interim commissioner 
for Nunavut to enter into formal agreements and contracts that 
are essential to ensuring that the new government is functional 
from day one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scope of the agreements needed range from the supply of 
materials to the delivery of medical and educational services for 
Nunavut residents.  This bill makes sure that the essential 
services and functions of a territorial government will be in 
place on April 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without this legislation the interim commissioner and his 
officials would not be able to enter into these agreements.  This 
means that those reciprocal agreements for health care could not 
be set up.  The agreements allowing Nunavut youth the opportunity 
to attend southern post-secondary schools could not be negotiated 
without this legislation.  That is why this legislation is so 
important to the people of Nunavut and to the whole of the 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation also deals with the division of assets and 
liabilities between the Government of the Northwest Territories 
and the Government of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new territory will require new laws relevant to its own 
jurisdiction.  The original Nunavut Act provides for an initial 
legislative base for the new territory by grandfathering the 
application of territorial laws currently in force in the 
Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 clarifies how these laws will be applied to Nunavut by 
defining the practical results in a variety of situations.  For 
example, the grandfathering of laws would normally mean that all 
bodies that have been created under Northwest Territories law 
would automatically exist in Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are a number of instances where the creation of 
parallel bodies will not be necessary.  With this in mind, Bill 
C-39 will ensure that the duplicating effect does not include 
bodies which have no relation to Nunavut, such as municipal 
corporations in the other region, the Mackenzie Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the proposed amendments will allow some exceptions to 
the duplicating effect where it is agreed that a single body such 
as the Workers' Compensation Board can continue to serve both 
jurisdictions effectively. 
These are practical amendments that all Canadians have an 
interest in.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
stated on Monday, Bill C-39 includes amendments that clarify the 
creation of a Nunavut court system similar to that of the 
Northwest Territories.  The proposed amendments also ensure that 
cases pending before the courts at the date of division will be 
clearly sorted out between the Northwest Territories and the new 
Nunavut courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With as much work as there is to finish, we cannot forget the 
work that has already been accomplished in the creation of 
Nunavut.  One of the most critical issues being addressed is the 
need to train Inuit for positions at all levels of the Nunavut 
public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1996 the government announced a $39.8 million fund for 
human resources for Nunavut. More than 500 Inuit have been 
enrolled to receive training in the use of computers, in 
administrative skills and financial planning, all of the 
functions of a modern government.  Many are also learning from 
their participation in building the new Nunavut government 
buildings and staff housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This not only shows how committed the federal government is in 
establishing the new Nunavut territory; it also shows how 
committed Nunavut residents are to their new territory by taking 
advantage of the opportunities to learn these new skills.  These 
skills are very important to the success of the Nunavut 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a section which we have to become very aware of, that 
of Senate reform.  I need to deal with the specific issue of 
Senate reform.   On page 27 of Bill C-39 it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>45. The member of the Senate who represents the Northwest 
Territories immediately before the day that section 3 of the 
Nunavut Act comes into force shall, on and after that day, 
continue as the member of the Senate who represents one of the 
following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) Nunavut, if the member resides in the part of the Northwest 
Territories referred to in section 3 of that Act immediately 
before that day;  or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) the Northwest Territories, in any other case. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is legalese.  My point is that the legislation is such that 
once the Nunavut Senate seat is approved, if the current sitting 
member in the Northwest Territories seat as it is now is from the 
east, he or she will slide over into the newly created Nunavut 
seat and a new senator from the west will be appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a great opportunity.  We have a great tradition in 
our country.  We have created 10 provinces and two new 
territories.  We are now dividing the Northwest Territories.  We 
are going to empower those people, give them the tools, give them 
the support to do for themselves what we have not been able to do 
for them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</b>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
intent to speak to Bill C-39, an act to amend the Nunavut Act and 
the Constitution Act, 1867.  It is not my intent to speak on 
other matters which have nothing to do with this bill, as other 
members of this House have done. I would like to make that very 
clear at the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a historic piece of legislation which will create a new 
territory on April 1, 1999, Nunavut, meaning our land in the 
Inuit language. This new territory is being created as part of 
the Nunavut land claim agreement signed by the Progressive 
Conservative government in 1993. The new territory will be 
2,242,000 square kilometres, approximately one-fifth the size of 
Canada and 69% of the existing Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of creating a new territory in the northern region of 
Canada was brought to the Parliament of Canada in 1965. 
It was not until the plebiscite in 1982 that the residents of the 
Northwest Territories voted on the creation of a new territory. 
The 1982 plebiscite achieved 54% approval with a 90% yes vote in 
the eastern regions.  Those eastern regions will become the new 
territory of Nunavut.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next step was to determine a boundary between the two 
regions and a plebiscite was held in 1992 to ratify this 
selection.  This was followed in 1993 with the signing of the 
Nunavut land claim agreement that sets out the creation of the 
Nunavut territory.  This land claim agreement is the largest of 
its kind in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with setting out the creation of Nunavut it gives Inuit 
title to 350,000 square kilometres with about one-tenth of this 
including mineral rights.  It also gives the Inuit a stronger 
voice on some management boards and a share of royalties from 
oil, gas and mineral development on crown lands.  As well it sets 
out the creation of three new federally funded parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the pleasure of visiting the Northwest Territories last 
fall and spoke with a number of people who expressed concern over 
the readiness of the new territory to meet the deadline in 1999. 
There are still a number of questions that need to be addressed 
to ensure a smooth transition to the new territory and no loss of 
service as this occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation we are now speaking on today addresses 
a number of concerns arising from the division of the Northwest 
Territories on April 1, 1999.  Specifically the legislation 
decreases the number of members required by the western region to 
form a government.  This recognizes that the 14 members left 
after division will be sufficient to govern, not the current 
requirement of 15.  As well the legislation will provide for two 
seats in the House of Commons and the other place, again to 
ensure that both regions are represented and have a voice in 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Division of assets and liabilities is also considered, as is the 
establishment of a judicial system that will be prepared to 
operate in a fair and ongoing manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eastern and western regions of the Arctic however have not 
satisfactorily dealt with the division of some of the essential 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few weeks ago the Nunavut leaders rejected a proposal by 
the Government of the Northwest Territories to divide the 
Northwest Territories Power Corporation.  The proposal was for 
60% ownership by the western region and 40% by the eastern 
region.  While the two sides agree that economies of scale and 
other such factors support maintaining one enterprise for the two 
regions rather than the establishment of two separate bodies, it 
is necessary to reach consensus on how this should be achieved. 
The eastern region feels anything less than a 50:50 split is 
insufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I use that as an example of some of the hurdles that are still 
in the way of this becoming reality by April 1, 1999.  It is this 
kind of problem that must be dealt with by the western and 
eastern regions prior to that date to ensure continuation of 
operations and services when the new territory comes into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this legislation states that the law which is currently 
in place in the Northwest Territories will also apply in the new 
territory, any disruption in service could have a significant 
impact on the new region's ability to govern.  Financial 
considerations must also be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The western region will also be facing significant changes as it 
is downsized from its current operations and focuses on service 
provision for the western residents.  This will mean changes in 
government office space and staff requirements.  Conversely the 
eastern region will be building and hiring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A report prepared by the Government of the Northwest Territories 
regarding transition costs and the creation of the new territory 
estimates that $3.8 million will be needed by the western region 
to modify office space for new requirements as the size of the 
government changes the focus on the western region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well the western region will continue to provide services in 
the eastern region on a contractual basis until the new territory 
is well established.  This will be an additional cost to both 
sides.  The Government of the Northwest Territories estimates the 
cost of retention and recruitment of staff to fulfil these 
contractual obligations will be in the vicinity of $2 million in 
the first year, 1999 to 2000, and $1 million for each subsequent 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the cost of contracting services from the 
western region will be an extra cost for Nunavut as it pays for 
the construction of its own infrastructure and staffing 
requirements.  The cost of having to rent space in the western 
region while also facing the cost of infrastructure in Nunavut is 
an additional cost that has not been accounted for by the 
government in making this plan.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another estimate by the Government of the Northwest Territories 
report is that only 10% to 15% of its workforce directly affected 
by division will seek employment in Nunavut.  This will 
exacerbate a problem already faced by Nunavut, obtaining the 
necessary workforce estimated at 600 people. As well, employment 
opportunities created by other provisions of the land claim 
agreement could create competition among employers for 
experienced staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal transition funding plan estimates that only 150 
Nunavut staff will be hired by the time division occurs.  This 
means Nunavut will not be in a strong position to assume control 
of operations necessary for the daily operation of government 
services. At the same time, according to the transition action 
plan of the Government of the Northwest Territories, experienced 
staff are already leaving because of job insecurity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an immediate problem for this government which certainly 
needs to be addressed by this government.  To date we have not 
seen anything put forward by the government to recognize the fact 
that there is even a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will address some of the concerns I mentioned 
earlier.  These amendments will provide the interim commissioner 
with the authority to enter into contractual obligations with 
staff to ensure that employees do not have to be hired on a short 
term or temporary basis.  This should alleviate some of the 
problems with job insecurity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major component of Nunavut public government that will 
represent all residents of the eastern region, Inuit and 
non-Inuit alike, is the decentralization of government.  This was 
an important provision in the land claim agreement that set out 
the government's structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Decentralization it is hoped will provide everyone, even those 
people living in remote areas, with a voice in government.  Given 
the size of Nunavut and its sparse population, this is laudatory 
but harder to implement.  The chances of attracting qualified 
staff to the 11 communities of the decentralized government may 
be difficult especially in the short term. These uncertainties 
increase the risk of stoppages in services at a critical time 
when Nunavut is to be created. With the infrastructure not 
scheduled to be in place until the year 2000 for the outlying 
communities of the decentralized government, this will place an 
additional burden on office space in Iqaluit which will be the 
capital of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there is some uncertainty surrounding the creation of 
Nunavut, and I have tried to set that uncertainty forth today so 
that everyone in the House can understand it, this is a historic 
event that is deserving of praise for those people who have 
worked so long to see this happen.  The Inuit both as individual 
community members and through the different organizations 
operating on their behalf have worked hard to see their goal 
achieved.  This will be accomplished on April 1, 1999. This 
legislation ensures that a government will be in place to begin 
operations at that time.  At least we hope this legislation 
ensures that a government will be in place to begin operations at 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the people of both the eastern and 
western Arctic regions who have helped to attempt to bring this 
to reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to support this bill in principle and look forward 
to studying and amending it at the committee stage. It will be at 
the committee stage that we will continue to try to address some 
of the inadequacies and some of the problems that threaten this 
piece of legislation which is by far a piece of proactive 
legislation and should be commended.

</I></B></P><P align=left>9.2(8) The arbitrator is not bound by any legal or technical 
rules of evidence in conducting any matter that comes before the 
arbitrator— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would perhaps be better for the rules of law and equity to 
prevail in cases of disagreement over management of a pension 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In clause 9.2(15), it would be interesting to have clear 
answers.  This clause provides that the executive of a union 
shall represent its members, but not its former members, such as 
retired individuals. 
There are questions for officials, such as why this does not 
apply to retired individuals who used to pay into the pension 
plan.  The Bloc Quebecois prefers to ask all these questions in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally, however, I can tell you that this bill improves 
everything to do with the management of private pension plans 
and could have prevented certain problems of management and 
responsibility.  If provisions such as these had been available 
in the past, a number of disputes over private pension plans 
could have been resolved.  I am thinking of Singer employers, 
among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that, in the course of its work, the 
Standing Committee on Finance will try to obtain answers to 
these questions.  With reservations, we are in agreement with 
the general thrust of this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I also 
want to say a few words in the debate, not for any longer than my 
colleague in the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to register a very general complaint. Once again we have 
a bill here that originates in the unelected Senate.  In the name 
of democracy I do not think that is a very wise practice and I do 
not think it is a practice that would be supported by the 
overwhelming majority of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many dedicated individuals in the Senate but the fact 
remains that it is a non-democratic house, a non-democratic 
legislative body.  Over the years going back in the history of 
the CCF and NDP and more recently joined by the Reform Party, 
they objected to this kind of practice in the House of Commons 
where a bill that should originate in the House of Commons 
originates in the other place, in the Senate of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before the House today is an administrative bill and a 
highly technical bill. The main debate on the bill should be done 
before the committee at the committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 is an act to amend the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 
1985 and also the Office of the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions Act.  The bill was first introduced under a 
different name.  It was called Bill C-85 in the last parliament 
and it was introduced in March of 1997.  When the writs dropped 
for the election on April 27, 1997 all legislation at that time 
ceased to exist as the Parliament of Canada was dissolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has been reintroduced and was passed by the Senate on 
November 20, 1997 and here it is now in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill covers a number of things.  First of all, it governs 
private pension plans set up for employees working in businesses 
under federal jurisdiction.  I think of the interprovincial 
transportation companies and telecommunication companies.  I also 
think of the Canadian chartered banks and any other institutions 
under federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not cover MP pensions or pensions of federal public 
servants.  It covers only private sector pension plans of 
companies under the jurisdiction of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 would also introduce to the Pension Benefits Standards 
Act the same philosophy that governs the changes to legislation 
governing federal chartered financial institutions in Canada. 
That of course is of interest now with the talk regarding the 
merging of big Canadian banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the bill would deal with the office of the 
superintendent of financial institutions.  It would basically 
enhance the powers of this office to supervise a pension plan in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of details in the bill in general that can 
summarize it. It seeks to clarify ground rules for housekeeping 
and codify the rules of how to handle controversial issue of the 
treatment of surplus assets on pension plans.  It restores a 
better balance between the employer and those who benefit from 
the plan. It enhances the ability of the minister to enter into 
agreements with provinces to apply and enforce provinces' pension 
legislation. It sets a prudent person approach as long as the 
definition of a prudent person remains broadly based. That is 
really the general purpose of the bill, very administrative and 
very technical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to at this time without going into detail, flag a number 
of concerns we have in the New Democratic Party of Canada. 
Regulations can be drafted by order in council that would 
unnecessarily pass the parliamentary process.  In other words, we 
are handing too much power to the bureaucrats, a few unelected 
officials, to draft legislation that is never scrutinized by the 
House of Commons or by the appropriate parliamentary committee. 
That is a major concern for us.  All too often as 
parliamentarians we cede too much of our power and authority as 
law makers of the land to bureaucrats who, despite their good 
intentions, draft regulations that are accountable to no one. 
Even the minister and her office would be at a loss to explain 
the regulations.  It could change the whole intent of the bill. 
We have seen that happen many times in the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about the solvency ratio in the bill.  The 
solvency ratio is much too high.  That is something we should get 
into at the committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about a number of other things.  There is the 
question of a surplus withdrawal.  The whole process seems to be 
very sloppy and incoherent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of our concerns.  We look forward to pursuing 
this bill in committee.  Unless the parliamentary secretary and 
the assistant whip can elaborate on the details of the bill, we 
will pursue this at the committee stage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to try to persuade all members present that we should give 
careful consideration to what we are doing here today.  I could 
say I am standing here as part of the body of sober second 
thought.  Usually that terminology is applied to the Senate but 
since the bill started in the Senate and has already been passed 
by the Senate, its sober second thought has become the first 
thought, and so here we are giving it sober second thought in 
this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unelected Senate has done another wonderful thing for us. 
It has now reversed the roles of the House of Commons and its own 
august chamber.  I object to that.  I am sure thousands and maybe 
millions of Canadians do.  It is time we straightened that Senate 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might not object if the senators had been elected, if the 
people would have had a voice to say which one gets in there. 
Instead the prime minister of the day appoints whoever happens to 
have the best party credentials.  Then that person becomes a 
senator.  The other thing that is so unconscionable about that is 
that senator never has to go back to the people nor to the prime 
minister to be accountable. We saw that recently.  The prime 
minister who has the right to appoint senators has no right to 
right to dis-appoint them. I use that term advisedly.  Even the 
prime minister who appoints them cannot hold them accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a large flaw in a democratic system when we break that 
circle of accountability. In a circle everyone is accountable to 
the person either in front or behind them.  That is what happens 
in a democracy.  As a member of Parliament I am responsible to 
the people in my riding.  In return, those people are responsible 
to correctly choose and direct their member of Parliament so we 
get good laws in this country.  The citizens are in that circle 
of responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate when the prime minister appoints a Senate and 
the Senate ends up initiating laws like this because the circle 
of accountability is broken.  We should not be surprised when 
that happens, that we have laws that are not as good as they 
could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the amendments to the Pension Benefits 
Standards Act, the bill we are debating today. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a little problem suppressing my cynicism.  What we have 
here is a government that is proposing to strengthen the role of 
the superintendent of pension administration.  The superintendent 
is the person who oversees the building of pension funds in the 
public and private sectors across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is appointing a superintendent to oversee 
pension funds, presumably providing protection for the pension 
funds of employees and employers but mostly on behalf of 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One needs to ask what kind of credentials the government can 
display.  Since 1966 one of the largest pension funds in the 
country has been the Canada pension plan.  It was started by the 
Liberals.  Right from the beginning as data were gathered and 
statistical information became available it was underfunded. When 
the Conservatives were nine years in power they did not correct 
it.  The Liberals have been in power for a number of years.  That 
pension fund has been administered in such a way that its present 
unfunded liability is currently about equal to our national debt, 
both of which are shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the national debt is a little bigger.  We have 
about $580 billion of debt that we owe directly because 
government was borrowing.  However, if one were to do the 
actuarial mathematical calculation to see what kind of money is 
now needed to fulfil all future obligations of the Canada pension 
plan, one would see the amount of shortfall is in the 
neighbourhood of $500 billion, an astronomical number.  Yet the 
government starts a bill in the Senate that says we need a 
superintendent of pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree on behalf of employees that we need to have the 
assurance that when pension funds are contributed by employers 
and employees they are properly managed and properly invested. An 
accounting should be done.  There should be proper security of 
those funds so that no one can abscond with the money.  In the 
event that businesses run into hard times there need to be 
protections against those businesses reaching into their pension 
funds, which really belong to the employees, to try to bail 
themselves out.  We need those regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree but, as I said earlier, part of me has trouble 
suppressing my cynicism when the same government says that it 
should supervise pension funds so that everything goes well and 
it has such a terrible track record with its own pension fund, 
the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this instance I think right now that I will support the 
measures being proposed in the bill.  Of course I object that the 
bill did not start up here, but so be it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the measures in the bill are needed and I want to 
support it.  I have a concern with sections of the act that state 
the superintendent, under the authority of the minister, has the 
powers to do these different things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the powers are very important.  Anybody who reads the 
act will see that the superintendent, for example, has the right 
to demand that any new pension fund be registered with his office 
within 60 days.  That is a perfectly fine and acceptable 
requirement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a way of providing some assurance and some security for 
employees who are paying into the pension fund.  It helps 
everybody involved in administering the fund to be accountable to 
someone.  There we come back to the question of accountability 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some real serious concerns on behalf of people who work 
all their lives.  When they approach retirement age they suddenly 
find the things they were planning on have evaporated right under 
their noses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of a family back in my riding where that happened.  This 
man worked hard in a company for many years.  He was about four 
or five years away from retirement age when the company, how do I 
put it politely, spun into the ground.  It dug itself into a 
hole.  The bosses decided they would try to do some interim 
financing by borrowing from the pension fund, which on the 
surface seemed okay at that time.  It would have been okay if it 
would have been a temporary loan, if the company would have 
recovered and put the money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this instance it became impossible for the company to do so. 
I am not even sure there was anything illegal about what it was 
doing at the time.  I do not know those details.  However it took 
the pension money to try to bail itself out.  The company still 
went under.  Now the employees, including the person I know who 
was five years away from retiring, suddenly lost their jobs 
because the company quit and their pension fund evaporated with 
it.  Now he is dependent on Canada pension for which he is 
eligible.  It is really a drastic situation when people who pay 
into these funds for years and years cannot trust them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the beginning and the end of what I was to say is 
included in these statements.  We need to make sure as 
legislators that we implement rules and we set up regulations 
correctly.  I am grateful that in the House of Commons we have 
the scrutiny of regulations committee.  When the superintendent, 
under the authority of the minister, makes regulations that apply 
to the administration of pension funds, the regulations are 
subject to the scrutiny of the House committee.  Hopefully that 
will give Canadians a little more security in the assurance that 
their pensions funds will be there for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have problems with some of the powers being given to the 
superintendent.  In some instances they seem to be arbitrary.  I 
have additional anxiety about a superintendent being responsible 
only to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can make an outrageous statement here and I am sure I will not 
hear a voice of protest from them.  Ministers in the present 
government do not always answer questions in question period. 
When we ask a question about something usually we get a 
runaround.  Usually we get some vicious attack on our party, even 
maybe saying that we are not being very nice to ask such a 
question instead of giving us the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a superintendent who is answerable to the 
minister, but who can ever force the minister to be answerable to 
anyone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see a real demand for openness in pension funds. 
Some of that is included in the bill. It begins a process. 
Perhaps it does not go far enough, but it requires that the 
superintendent get information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make sure that everyone with a vested interest 
in the pension fund, whether it is an individual employee or 
someone even more distantly interested in the pension fund 
because of administrative procedures and so on, should have 
access to the records and administrative procedures being used in 
the administration of the pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by simply saying that the administration of pension 
funds is most important.  We are living in an age in which many 
of us live longer.  I come from a family where people live 
terribly long.  I do not know whether I will keep up the family 
tradition but I expect to do so. That is true for many of us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember as a young man at university studying mathematics, 
statistics, actuarial tables and things like that.  Back then the 
actuarial tables we used had a life expectancy for a Canadian 
male of around 62 years.  Now that dates me because those are 
very old tables.  The life expectancy for males in Canada is 
approaching 80 years and for females it is even higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now live longer in that period of time in our lives when we 
usually do not have jobs.  We have retired and are depending on 
our retirement income.  It is incumbent on the government to do 
what it needs to do so that there is openness and accountability. 
Pension funds need to be well administered.  People need to have 
confidence in them.  They need the government to actually deliver 
the funds that are expected when they retire.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Charlotte, Health; the hon. member for 
Sackville—Eastern Shore, The Atlantic Groundfish Strategy; the 
hon. member for Edmonton East, Merchant navy veterans.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have two questions for my friend in the Reform Party.  I applaud 
what he said about the bill being introduced in the Senate.  I 
said similar things a few minutes earlier.  We therefore 
certainly agree on that and I would like to elaborate for a 
minute or so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This practice started decades and decades ago.  Over the last 
few years it has escalated, which concerns me.  When I was first 
elected in 1968 it was extremely rare that the government would 
introduce a bill through the Senate.  If that were to happen, the 
Hon. Stanley Knowles would rise in the House and object to it. 
The practice now is becoming more and more common, which concerns 
me as a democrat.  I am talking about a democrat in a democratic 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member across the way think that the Senate should be 
abolished?  Do we need that other place, or do we form an elected 
Senate?  The problem with forming an elected Senate, having gone 
through a constitutional process, is that it is very difficult to 
come up with a national agreement that would carry in the 
country.  As long as we hold out a dream of electing it and 
reforming it we might be stuck with the unelected Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went through the Charlottetown process, the Meech Lake 
process, the parliamentary committees of the House where there 
was all party consensus and so on, and the most difficult issue 
was always the Senate.  Triple E sounds very nice in principle, 
but the province of Quebec is unique and distinct with 25% of the 
people.  The huge province of Ontario has 38% of the people. 
There are many small provinces.  We are a federation with 65% or 
70% of our people in two of the ten provinces.  Therefore it 
makes it very difficult to reach an agreement on an equal Senate. 
Ontario and Quebec do not agree to it because of their size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the provinces agree to an equal Senate as suggested in the 
Charlottetown accord, the powers of that Senate would be 
diminished.  Then what would be the purpose of the Senate?  I get 
back to how we put a round peg in a square hole and ask whether 
or not the member has some advice for the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My other question is on the substance of the bill.  I am 
concerned that the powers of the Office of the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions are to be enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member deal in more detail than he did with the types 
of powers he thinks will be negative in terms of enhancement and 
the move away from accountability by the House of Commons of the 
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is becoming more and more an issue of sensitivity as 
we are looking at the big bank mergers that are coming down.  I 
know this does not affect banks, but it affects people working in 
private sector companies across the country that are regulated by 
federal law and jurisdiction such as our major chartered banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member is an expert in this area so I would be 
interested in hearing him go into detail in terms of the powers 
he is concerned about being enhanced. 
I certainly agree with him that we are handing too many powers to 
that official and that office without the scrutiny of Parliament. 
This whole process should be democratized. Accountability is 
extremely important in public life and politics.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Senate, how do we put that round peg in a square hole? My 
second question is with regard to the powers of the office of the 
superintendent of financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ken Epp:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I will deal with the second 
question first because it is going to be the shorter of the two. 
That pertains to the accountability of this particular 
superintendent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the bill, this superintendent is actually going to 
have the right to subpoena.  He is going to have the right of the 
court to demand the presentation of documents and he can seize 
pension funds and put them under his own administration if in his 
view there is an improper application or administration of those 
funds.  That is a formidable power.  There is a lot of money in 
some of these funds and it is a very great power.  That is 
exactly what I was talking about.  How do you make it more 
accountable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My answer is simply this.  Right now he or she is accountable to 
the minister.  I would like to see a change in our standing 
orders that requires that the minister answer specific questions. 
Sometimes in question period members of the opposition ask 
rhetorical questions and they deserve a rhetorical answer. 
Sometimes there are very specific questions asked and these 
should be something in question period or through some other 
mechanism of the House where members can get right down to the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is the Canadian Wheat Board, whether it is any one of 
the other crown corporations or one of the superintendents in the 
regulators of the government, the idea of openness and 
accountability has to be the best protection that can be given to 
the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned when even our own Access to Information Act 
usually gives more whiteouts than it does information.  It has to 
be changed because that is where the accountability is.  People 
are not going to do illegal and wrong things if they know they 
are going to be found out.  The temptation to try it is too great 
if there are easy ways to hide it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now going to address the issue of the Senate.  I could 
speak for an hour on this topic but I will limit it.  The 
question has to do with the Senate.  The NDP wants to abolish the 
Senate.  This is wrong. That is the last thing we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House 60% of the representatives come from Quebec and 
Ontario.  Everybody else outside of those two provinces feels 
like a second class citizen.  In the west we can say it does not 
matter who is elected because the election is decided by the time 
the ballots are cast.  Of course now with the new elections act 
the timing is changed, but even then we do not have the power to 
elect majority members in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Senate is abolished and there is only this place and it 
is based on representation by population, which is proper, the 
rest of the country is going to continue to be in distress 
because it could never have a substantial influence on the final 
outcome of things.  The country would keep on getting things like 
that dastardly national energy program which so affected the west 
and still does.  The west is still reeling from that all these 
years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asks how are we going to get a constitutional 
approval for a Senate. I appeal to the goodness of people. It is 
heard over and over again that Canadians are such wonderful 
people, thoughtful, helpful, generous and that is true.  Even the 
NDP members are very generous, albeit usually with other people's 
money, but they have a generous heart. This should be approached 
properly by saying this country has a true bicameral system, a 
House of Commons and a Senate where the representation is of the 
people based on population.  Every 100,000 people would have a 
member of Parliament who occupies a seat on behalf of those 
people.  The Senate would represent the provinces equally.

introduce bills such as this one.  They could introduce 
legislation and bring it here.  Or they could have proper veto 
rights or amendment rights to bills that are introduced here and 
sent over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that my fellow Canadians in Ontario and Quebec 
would say that they are so selfish that they will never give up 
that power.  Right now they have it.  There are 24 senators in 
Ontario, 24 in Quebec, 10 in New Brunswick, 10 in Nova Scotia. 
B.C., the third most populated province, has six.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we tell them, if we appeal to their goodness, do members not 
think that eventually we would come to the point where, out of 
the goodness of their hearts, they would say they believe in 
fairness?  That is a way of achieving it.  Let us have an equal 
number, maybe six senators per province, maybe ten.  Now the 
powers are balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is my goal.  That is one of the reasons I was attracted to 
the Reform Party.  Having representation by population in both 
Houses as it is now, but even then distorted, introduces such an 
inequity that it perpetuates a feeling of dissatisfaction and 
disunity in the country.  This proposal would add greatly to our 
feelings of unity of co-operation as fellow Canadians.  It would 
be a wonderful change.  We should never think of abolishing that 
honourable place, the Senate.  Let us make it honourable. Let us 
make it truly honourable by electing it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
concur with my colleague from Qu'Appelle with respect to where 
this piece of legislation has initiated.  If it is all right with 
the Speaker I would like to talk about why I believe this piece 
of legislation will not improve pension benefits for senior 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not acting on opportunities to improve pensions and therefore 
benefits simply adds to the financial struggles of too many 
vulnerable people.  It is beyond me how this can be the goal of 
any Canadian government.  If the letters I am getting from 
seniors are any indication, the government will have a lot of 
explaining to do during the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is part and parcel of the government's piecemeal 
approach to updating the public pension system.  The entire set 
of proposals from the Canada pension to senior benefits has met 
with opposition from the business community and seniors. The 
seniors benefit proposal has universally been characterized as 
too complicated and unworkable by financial planners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe that is why the finance department has been up to its 
elbows in a redesign that has no end in sight. The cornerstone of 
this half finished pension reform is an unqualified failure and 
the entire policy has no integrity.  The finance minister knows 
that seniors are watching every stumble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us provided an opportunity to diminish the 
government's attack on older Canadians who have claimed what 
author John Myles calls the citizen's right to cease work before 
wearing out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in Bill S-3 the government is proposing a mechanism to 
take the surplus out of private pension plans rather than offer 
incentives to improve pension plans. This is the wrong message to 
send. The government's role is simply to do what it can to add to 
the quality of life of citizens.  It can do so by encouraging the 
improvement and strengthening of pension funds in an attempt to 
increase benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pensions and medicare have institutionalized the concept of 
retirement.  Imagine a society where retirement is not 
institutionalized, where we are not granted the right to a 
peaceful time in our final years, free from the struggle of the 
labour market. 
We have this right today and cutting pensions is an attempt to 
take that away.  To deinstitutionalize retirement, destroying the 
institution of retirement one pension cut at a time means a 
person never stops working regardless of age or health.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence is irrefutable that the private sector does not 
provide enough money by age 65 to create a suitable retirement 
nest egg for the vast majority of Canadians.  This is why there 
has been consistent public pressure throughout the 20th century 
for the government to step in.  Now it is stepping back from that 
mandate and the result is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If hon. members go to fast food restaurants and shopping malls 
they will see some seniors who want to be working, but they will 
mostly see seniors who have no choice but to stay on the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The destruction of retirement, one pension cut at a time, is big 
brother's right wing dream of social engineering, a sick utopia 
being administered by the finance department.  Canadians do not 
want the finance department carrying out centrally planned social 
engineering experiments on their senior citizens.  They want 
pensions the way they were working well before these experiments 
became so fashionable in corporate and government boardrooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one constant theme in the government's scorched 
earth campaign against the long held Canadian consensus in favour 
of public pensions it is a complete lack of interest in making 
life better for seniors.  We have seen it with the Canada pension 
plan where seniors' hopes for a little more money so some can 
literally turn up the heat another degree next winter were put 
through the shredder at the finance department.  Hopefully it is 
using the same shredder on the proposed seniors benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seniors benefit is like some foul monster worthy of the <I>X 
Files</I> television program, speaking a language that even 
financial planners cannot understand and striking fear into the 
hearts of seniors everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again the government is slashing benefits by cancelling the old 
age security and guaranteed income supplement and letting loose 
the cynically titled seniors benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be pointed out that although the government's plan to 
institute a seniors benefit has been stopped dead in its tracks 
at least for a while, this did not come about because the 
government was sensitive to the needs of seniors.  The government 
was unmoved by the outcry from seniors groups and their disbelief 
on seeing the planned benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, it was the outcry of wealthy Canadians through their 
financial planners who said this plan makes it difficult to 
organize the complicated financial affairs of better off 
retirees.  This group saw the losses involved and together with 
lower income Canadians delivered a universal message. Thankfully 
this wretched seniors benefit has been put on hold, and that is 
the strength of universality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A nation is not a thing to be divided and conquered by its own 
government.  We are a nation of citizens who deserve to be 
treated with equal respect.  Universality is about equality and 
balance and the government's approach to destroy universality by 
expanding means testing for pensions through the seniors benefit 
has simply upset the fine balance of universality and equality 
born from the Canadian soul and enshrined in the institution of 
retirement that we have erected as a symbol of our nation.  To 
dismantle these things is to dismantle Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 has some good intentions.  The bill strives to set 
clear ground rules for housekeeping, restores a better balance 
between the employer and those who benefit from the pension plan 
and enhances the ability of the minister to enter into agreements 
with provinces to apply and enforce a province's pension 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill also adds unaccountable power to bureaucrats 
in the name of lowering costs and only addresses the issue of 
taking a surplus out of a pension fund.  This is what most 
seniors and future seniors are concerned with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 is an opportunity for the government to address the 
need to use the surplus wisely.  There could have been something 
in the legislation which encourages pension fund managers to find 
constructive ways to use any surplus, to perhaps leave the 
surplus in a fund for the good of those who receive benefits. But 
the legislation does not do that, which is a shame.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be improving benefits or striving to improve benefits. 
After all, the goal here is to improve the quality of life of our 
senior citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot even be bothered to appear to be striving 
to improve benefits.  Clearly, a discussion on how to use any 
surplus for the good of beneficiaries is lacking in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are a prudent people.  We like to know there is money 
in the bank for a rainy day.  Statistics show that for the vast 
majority of seniors old age is that rainy day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December Statistics Canada announced a 2% rise in the rate of 
seniors' poverty over many years of decline, largely attributed 
to the long established pensions in the country.  However, that 
is not the most telling statistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from a StatsCan report.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A large percentage of the elderly population have incomes near 
the low income cut-offs.  Consequently, rates for seniors are 
particularly sensitive to small income shifts.  The rise in the 
elderly low income rate reflects the fact that more seniors fell 
just short of the cut-offs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senior citizens are hanging on by a thread in a world where 
governments are cutting pensions.  The government is making 
cheaper medicine more difficult to obtain and social assistance 
for the victims of this wild west economy is being rolled up into 
meaningless tax cuts just so the wealthy can smoke a few more 
cigars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The StatsCan report of just five months ago, three days before 
Christmas, makes it clear that seniors are amassing on the last 
rung of the economic ladder.  It reminds me of the hundreds of 
thousands of refugees amassing in the city of Dunkirk during the 
second world war with nowhere to go, looking across the sea 
for any sign of hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has millions of economic refugees staring at it 
through wizened eyes and all the government can think about is 
who will blink first.  It is shameful.  This is not about 
blinking, it is about eating and staying healthy and warm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was recently an elderly gentleman from Cape Breton who had 
to resort to a public plea over radio for help.  Unable to pay 
for his expensive heart medication and facing a refusal for help 
from the cash starved provincial health plan, the man said he 
expected to die the next day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with a member of their community dying in such appalling 
circumstances, Cape Bretoners responded, as they always do in 
Atlantic Canada, with generosity.  The senior is now being taken 
care of, but for how long? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the thousands of others we know are suffering the 
same indignities across this country?  If the government does not 
care about them, who will?  It will not be multinational drug 
companies or the multinational insurance corporations.  I doubt 
it will be the banks who are bent on service charging senior 
citizens right into the grave.  The banks are probably the ones 
who came up with the phrase “You can't take it with you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the job of the government.  If the government is going 
to treat people the way corporations do, then why have a 
government?  It seems the marketplace is crowded with 
organizations trying to figure out ways to get their hands on 
people's money in exchange for nothing but promises and 
apologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seniors were not born yesterday.  They know the government 
should return to its only market niche of good government, adding 
to the quality of life of its citizens.  Why will the government 
not through this legislation encourage pension managers to search 
for ways to increase benefits and help seniors become more 
independent?  This bill makes the improvement of pension plans 
unlikely and that makes seniors and future seniors less secure. 
So why bother? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is part of this government's disturbing pattern of behaviour 
in the area of pensions.  Why did this government announce it was 
going to cancel the old age security and guaranteed income 
supplement which Canadians knew they could use as a building 
block for their retirement, a building block that would not 
shrink every time they earned a dollar of their own through an 
RRSP or some other form of investment?  Why does the government 
plan to replace it with a seniors benefit which will give a 
couple about $18,000 and then take away every dollar of seniors 
benefit for every dollar earned?

</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the government has taken its cue from thieves 
lurking around banking machines, lying in wait for senior 
citizens.  Seniors are only withdrawing their own money paid 
through pension contributions and taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government forcing seniors to work harder, making it 
harder for them to earn money for their final years, and then 
taking away their pension, dollar for dollar, with the seniors 
benefit?  Why has the government put senior citizens on a 
treadmill?  Senior citizens do not need to be on a treadmill. 
They have worked hard all their lives.  They have paid taxes. 
They have defended this country, with their lives in many 
instances.  They have raised families, built businesses, passed 
on their lessons learned and made their communities better places 
for all of us.  After all that, all the government can come up 
with in terms of social policy for seniors is to put them on a 
treadmill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the finance minister needs an education.  He needs to 
learn that senior citizens have a right to cease work and he has 
a responsibility to ensure that when the private sector uses them 
up and throws them away it is his responsibility to take them in 
and thank them for the contribution they have made to this 
country.  That is his job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are compassionate people and a Canadian government devoid of 
compassion is un-Canadian.  This is the unseverable cord of this 
nation's definition of patriotism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance says that all of these pension 
initiatives are designed to maintain the viability of benefits 
for seniors.  If he can maintain them, then he can surely role up 
his sleeves, get to work and go one step further to improve them. 
If he does not like the idea of improving benefits, he should 
step aside and allow someone else who has the stomach for the job 
to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can anyone not be interested in caring for the elderly in 
this country?  How can you say no to that?  How can you not want 
to improve pensions and benefits and improve the lives of our 
wonderful senior citizens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who cannot bring themselves to care for senior citizens 
should think of this.  We are all pretending here.  We are all 
senior citizens.  We run pensions at our own peril.  We are 
hurting ourselves because we all have our senior years to look 
forward to.  That is who we are hurting when this House passes 
legislation like the recent downsizing of the Canada pension plan 
benefits program and, God forbid, the seniors benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government on the one hand slash the Canada pension 
plan, old age security and the guaranteed income supplement by 
claiming it is running out of money and then present this bill 
today with no encouragement to improve pension funds?  Is that 
how we want to teach our children to handle finances?  As soon as 
you get ahead, just throw your money away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is speaking out of both sides of its mouth and 
seniors have stopped listening.  The government should give 
senior citizens a little more credit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member aware that the old age security and GIS programs 
are in fact not being cancelled?  Is the member aware that if a 
person was 60 years of age or older as of December 31, 1995 they 
would continue to receive the old age security and the GIS, or 
that they would have the option to transfer to the senior's

not being cancelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</b>  Mr. Speaker, in response to the

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns that I have about the seniors benefit is 
that I think we are going to end all pretence of universality in 
this country and that really concerns me as a citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very ironic that the Minister of Finance is the son of one 
of the founders of the national social programs in this country, 
along with people like Stanley Knowles and other members of the 
New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the seniors benefit, if someone earns a few dollars, they 
will lose money in terms of their seniors benefit.  After they 
earn a few more dollars, they will lose even more money.  After a 
certain level it will all be gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, people who have saved money for their retirement, who 
have a middle-class income, all of a sudden will not have a 
seniors benefit.  I am talking about people who were not 60 years 
of age by the year 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that happens we will basically have a welfare program and 
there will be a lack of political support for that program.  It 
will become more and more of a welfare program.  There will be a 
means test and an end to universality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a legacy for the Liberal Party of Canada to leave this 
country.  Here is a party which used to pretend in opposition 
that it was a progressive party which stood up for ordinary 
citizens.  It talked about social programs and the redistribution 
of wealth in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a party that makes Brian Mulroney look like a raving 
socialist.  It even makes you, Mr. Speaker, look like a raving 
socialist.  I am sure that you would not even advocate, coming 
from a very progressive Edmonton background, the end of 
universality for pensions in this country.  We have a Liberal 
Party that is a throwback to the conservativism of the last 
century.  It wants to end universality.

people of Bras d'Or. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said in this Chamber on numerous occasions with 
respect to the problems that are occurring both in Bras d'Or and

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
we are talking about Motion No. 85 brought forward by the NDP 
member for Acadie—Bathurst.  The motion concerns the labelling 
of toys that contain phthalates.  There is apparently scientific 
evidence to suggest this substance causes cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not followed the research on this topic but I am sure the 
member has done his research.  If there are toy companies that 
produce toys containing phthalates, I would agree with the member 
wholeheartedly that there should be legislation that these toys 
must be labelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not an expert.  I am reading only from a few reports.  It 
is the first I have heard that phthalates cause cancer.  Someone 
even suggested to me that these toy companies actually produce 
soothers containing this substance which are used by infants.  I 
find that absolutely amazing.  History has shown this is not the 
first time horrifying things have happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Providing that the science is correct, I would speak in support 
of this motion.  I have to go further and say that we should ban 
something like this and not just label it.  I give a qualified 
yes because I obviously have not done the research.  I am not 
challenging the research done by the member.  I read that tests 
conducted in U.K. laboratories reveal widespread presence of 
phthalates in soft plastic toys and other products, particularly 
teething rings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A September 1997 report on the subject concludes that the 
primary problem is that phthalates leaking from these products 
are being ingested by children.  Phthalates are indeed toxic and 
Greenpeace has been effective in lobbying European toy 
manufacturers and distributors to pull some of these products off 
the shelves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two small children at home, a two-year old and a 
four-year old.  I see some eyebrows raised.  I am not that old. I 
am young enough to have a two-year old and a four-year old.  I 
think there are a few grey hairs but I am trying to fight those. 
There are problems with toys which I have seen even in the few 
years we have been dealing with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would support the member in this initiative.  It is a 
qualified yes.  Unless somebody can tell me differently I would 
be very in favour of it.  I thank the member for bringing this

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion states that the government should enact 
legislation mandating toy manufacturers to label toys containing 
phthalates in order to allow parents to make an informed 
decision when buying products for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this no doubt well-intentioned motion is 
somewhat premature. The fact is that there is no conclusive 
evidence linking all phthalates in toys to health risks for 
children. In fact, my predecessor already inquired about this, 
and there has never been a reported case of a child experiencing 
ill effects from phthalates in this country or anywhere else. 
That is why the government is not supporting this motion at this 
time, which does not mean that the government is taking the 
matter lightly. Quite the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada officials are currently investigating the 
potential health risks of phthalates in polyvinyl chloride or 
PVC plastic toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If at any time clear evidence of health risks from phthalates 
are established, appropriate action will immediately be taken to 
protect the health of Canadian children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada's investigation of potential health risks from 
phthalates includes ongoing information exchange with the 
department's counterparts in the United States and in Europe, 
with industry, advocacy groups and health associations, as well 
as a comprehensive literature assessment on the potential 
toxicity of phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of this investigation, Health Canada officials have 
undertaken a scientific risk assessment on phthalates in various 
PVC plastic products. Specifically, they are trying to determine 
the presence of potentially toxic substances and conducting 
tests to see if these substances can in fact be absorbed by 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department has developed a test protocol and is currently 
assessing polyvinyl chloride products to validate test 
procedures. Test results should soon be available to help 
determine the risks represented by phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of the most valuable tools at the government's disposal are 
the Hazardous Products Act and the Hazardous Products (Toys) 
Regulations, which are both administered by the Products Safety 
Bureau of Health Canada. 
The legislation in effect totally bans the sale of certain toys 
while others are not allowed on the market until they meet 
certain very precise safety standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mission of Health Canada's Product Safety Bureau is to 
prevent deaths and injuries linked to the use of products.  In 
order to reduce the potential dangers of products intended for 
children and to promote their safe use, the Bureau operates on a 
number of levels, particularly by enacting legislation, setting 
standards and informing consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bureau's activities dovetail with those of Health Canada's 
national information and education program.  Child safety and 
the prevention of injuries linked to the use of consumer 
products constitute one of the program's key objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that Health Canada's sound research, coupled with 
dialogue and consultation with governments, industry and NGOs, 
will make it possible to clarify the issue and constitute a 
solid and informed basis for measures the Government of Canada 
might take in future in this connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This well thought out approach reflects Health Canada's decision 
to have a solid and informed assessment of the risks in order to 
gain an understanding of the complex health issues,.and to act 
accordingly, especially where children are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reacting in a rigorous and thorough manner to this potential 
health hazard, we are following up on an ongoing government 
commitment to ensure the health and safety of all Canadian 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Health Protection Branch of Health Canada is making every 
effort to reduce health risks associated with the natural or 
artificial environment which can lead to injury or death.

services such as those required for the analysis and evaluation 
of plastic products containing potentially dangerous phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Health Protection Branch, these various programs are 
bound together by the government's desire to ensure the health 
and safety of Canadian children. Of course, this concern is 
shared by parents and other caregivers, public health workers,

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that I find this to be a worthy 
motion, but in light of the efforts already undertaken by Health 
Canada and because of the lack of information, as mentioned by 
the member of the Reform Party, I think it is a little premature 
at this time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on Motion M-85 put forward by my NDP colleague, 
the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should enact 
legislation mandating toy manufacturers to label toys containing 
phthalates in order to allow parents to make an informed 
decision when buying products for their children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst for 
giving us the opportunity to discuss the safety of the 
manufactured products that we buy and in particular the 
potentially toxic products used in the production of children's 
toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, Earth Day, is the perfect time to ask us the following 
questions: In what kind of environment do we want to live? Do we 
want a healthy environment for our kids? Should we let companies 
put their profits before the quality of the products they sell? 
Should our governments legislate to protect our environment and 
ensure that the legislation is enforced? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us deals with phthalates. This is a chemical 
product that is used to make many plastic products more 
malleable. They are found in a number of children's toys among 
other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent scientific studies carried out in several European 
countries show that these products can cause cancer, liver 
damage and infertility. 
These same studies indicate that children, particularly 
preschoolers, are more vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Vinyl Council of Canada and the Canadian Toy Manufacturers' 
Association have denied that phthalate-containing toys are 
dangerous. They have asked that any decision be postponed 
pending the results of a study underway at Health Canada. But it 
could take Health Canada months if not years to examine all toys 
and determine which ones release phthalates. It could take this 
department a long time to determine the acceptable level of this 
product in toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are manufacturers putting people's health at risk by waiting 
to withdraw their products until phthalates have been proven 
dangerous? 
By that time, parents could end up with sick children, and the 
government would have to bear the cost of any health services 
needed to restore them to health or to treat them for permanent 
damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last December, Denmark's environment minister condemned the 
industry for trying so hard to deny any problems with phthalates 
instead of looking for safer alternatives. 
Other substances could be used to make plastic more malleable. 
Why not use substances that are recognized as safer?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In several countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, 
Argentina, Spain, Belgium, and Italy, stores have voluntarily 
withdrawn these toys at the request of governments as a 
preventive measure. This has involved losses for them, but they 
believed that children's health was more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When in doubt, the consumer's interest should always prevail. 
For example, it is common in the food sector to see a company 
withdraw all its products from the shelves because a few people 
got sick. It is a matter of respect for customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, Health Canada issued a warning because children's 
health could be affected by the lead contained in blinds made of 
polyvinyl chloride. The fact that these products had been widely 
distributed before it was realized that they could be dangerous 
shows the importance of prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today at second reading does not even 
demand that all phthalates be prohibited. It merely asks that a 
label be put on children's toys containing phthalates, since 
they could potentially be dangerous. This would allow parents to 
make an informed decision as to whether they are prepared to 
take the risk of having their children chew on toys that could 
release toxic substances. 
The label put on these products would not say that they are 
harmful, but it would inform consumers, as is the case with the 
labels found on all stuffed animals, cereal boxes or other 
consumer products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this morning, <I>La Presse</I> reported that a five-year old girl 
was found to have a high level of lead because she kept chewing 
on a pendant that she received as a Christmas present. Health 
Canada issued a warning and the American manufacturer 
voluntarily withdrew the product from the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only natural for young children to put things in their 
mouths. 
It is part of their development and discovery process. This is 
why it is worrisome to see that teething rings, rattles and 
other toys that children often put in their mouth for hours may 
contain toxic substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Phthalates are dangerous products. In the laboratories where 
they are used, they have a label with the warning “Avoid 
contact”. Since phthalates account for 10% to 40% of the weight 
of some toys, they can be mechanically released when children 
chew on these toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies conducted by the governments of Denmark and Holland, and 
by Greenpeace's laboratories in Great Britain, show that the 
quantities thus released largely exceed the acceptable level, up 
to 40 times according to the European Commission's scientific 
committee on toxicity, ecotoxicity and the environment, which 
conducted a study on a phthalate, di-iso-nonyl. 
These substances get into a child's saliva and then into the 
digestive tract, poisoning the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, the manufacturers are claiming they meet 
Canadian standards, which is true, but in reality there are no 
Canadian standards for acceptable quantities of DINP phtalate or 
di-iso-nonyl phtalate. There is a loophole in the Hazardous 
Products Act, since a product not specifically listed in the act 
is legal, regardless of its level of toxicity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as plastics are concerned, these are not regulated by the 
Hazardous Products Act. Thus Health Canada has no way of 
protecting the public from dangerous additives which may be in 
these plastics.  Health Canada could not, therefore, ask 
retailers to withdraw these products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must, however, put the government on guard against the trend 
toward deregulation, which is being felt in all areas. 
I am totally in agreement with elimination of the over-regulation 
that exists in certain areas, in order to simplify and clarify 
the wording of legislation for the benefit of all.  But 
eliminating red tape must not be confused with deregulation, 
which would lead to decreased public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when our health system is overburdened and 
experiencing financial problems, it must be realized that 
preventive measures will not only save considerable amounts of 
money, but also a great deal of suffering in the medium and long 
term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A child's early years are crucial to physical and intellectual 
development.  Young children are highly susceptible to minimal 
quantities of toxic substances. 
This is why it so crucial to ensure they live in a healthy 
environment and the consumer products in this environment are 
safe. Healthy children will grow into active and fulfilled 
adults.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this motion and I ask the government to always do the 
utmost when people's health is at risk because of toxic 
substances. Human health should get more priority than corporate 
financial interests, even if companies try to influence the 
government towards more lenient regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal members are suggesting that the Hazardous Products Act 
already protects people, but, if the hon. member for 
Acadie—Bathurst had not raised it, the issue of phthalates in 
children's toys would not have been taken up by Health Canada. 
In a previous study, the department tested vinyl toys for the 
presence of lead and cadmium only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst on his motion, 
and I hope it will be passed. It has already generated 
discussion on the safety of children's toys and forced Health 
Canada to study this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the hon. member has also reminded us that we 
should always be on the alert and demand that public safety take 
precedence over the marketing of consumer products. 
On behalf of those children who have no voice, and as a 
preschool education professional with 35 years experience, I 
sincerely thank the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst for this 
motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to the following motion by the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should enact 
legislation mandating toy manufacturers to label toys containing 
phthalates in order to allow parents to make an informed decision 
when buying products for their children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion was introduced following Greenpeace's allegations 
about additives in vinyl toys.  It alleged that the phthalates 
esters, a common family of chemical products, represent a danger 
to children.  It would cause any of us to be concerned when we 
recognize there could be a danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is an important point to make.  The particular 
esters we are talking about have been used safely for over 40 
years in toys as well as in health sensitive applications, 
including blood bags, catheters, IV tubing and surgical gloves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just toys that we are talking about.  It is a wide 
range of medical products.  No other plasticizer has been 
subjected to the same level of scrutiny and testing as the one in 
question here tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The product we are talking about actually softens plastic and 
makes it pliable.  That is all it does.  That is why it is used 
in children's toys and that is why it is used in surgical tubing. 
Obviously that tubing is subjected to a lot of stress and has to 
be able to withstand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall Health Canada released a report conducted by the 
product safety bureau's environmental health directorate.  It 
concludes that the lead and cadmium present in these vinyl 
consumer products do not pose any significant risk to children. 
It is important to remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, Health Canada has undertaken a risk assessment 
of phthalates and will be releasing the results of this testing 
very soon.  In fact it should be late this spring or very early 
summer.  In the best interest of parents and children I would 
suggest that we wait for the risk assessment to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all fairness, any decision to label toys should be based upon 
pure science.  We have to depend on that.  Obviously, if we do 
not depend upon pure science, the significance of labelling would 
be seriously undermined.  That is the only responsible way to 
proceed. 
It has to be based on pure science and the research that is 
necessary to determine whether or not there is a danger.  That is 
why we are suggesting that we should wait on that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This party does not have a problem with the member's motion 
because it is coming from the right place, right here where it 
should be.  The scientific evidence I have been able to gather in 
the last number of months points to the fact that Health Canada 
is taking it very seriously and we are going to wait for those 
results.  No scientific evidence shows that there is any kind of 
a health risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about our party respecting the motion and how much work 
the member has put into it.  Our party will be the first to 
approve appropriate labelling, should the scientific and 
regulatory agency state that this chemical in question presents 
any kind of a risk.  I want the public to know that.  I want 
members on the government side as well as members on this side to 
know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for all of us to know that some of the Danish 
studies which were alluded to and examined by Greenpeace have 
been discredited for what they call producing unrepeatable 
results.  In the scientific world it means that results can be 
achieved through a certain process.  If there is a problem, that 
should be repeatedly done proving the same stated fact at the end 
of the test.  In this case it did not.  They were also using what 
we consider false methodology.  I am sure a few chemists in this 
room tonight know exactly what I am talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standards have to be put in place by Canada's health and safety 
bureau.  There needs to be a regulatory standard for intake just 
as the European Union has already done in terms of the theory to 
put in place maximum daily intake of DINP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on what we know and the scientific evidence out there, 
unfortunately we cannot support the motion until the necessary 
scientific protocols, which are important in the scientific 
community, have been established and Health Canada has in place 
regulatory powers under Health Canada's product safety bureau. 
That is why we are waiting.  We will wait for the scientific jury 
to report back to us and we will make the appropriate decision at 
that time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
speak to Motion No. 85 in the name of the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that members have private motions such as this 
one when they and their constituents have major concerns.  There 
is no question that it is important to get all 
the facts out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted some very interesting comments from members of the Bloc 
and the member opposite who just spoke indicating that we have to 
be vigilant.  We need ways and means of protecting not only our 
children but our society in general through Health Canada, 
through the kinds of processes we use, and by hearing information 
from our colleagues in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that potential hazards exist from polyvinyl 
chlorides or PVC plastic toys, but that is not the issue.  The 
issue, as the member before me said, is whether it is really the 
type of toxin advocated by Greenpeace.  Is it something we should 
pull from the shelves?  We use stringent methods of testing in order to 
make sure this happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has been involved with the particular testing of 
PVCs since the 1980s.  The department has taken a leadership role 
over the last 12 years in assessing the implications of PVCs on 
the health of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is of importance to me.  I have two grandchildren, one 
just born the day before the election.  She is 10 months old. 
She has about two or three teeth, Mr. Speaker, which are quite 
sharp when you put your hands in her mouth.  As the member said, 
this additive is something that makes things pliable. 
We want to make sure that it is not toxic because when we listen 
to people like Dr. Fraser Mustard we know now that the outcome 
for young children is so important.  We know that from the time 
the child is born the parents should not be involved in smoking 
and they should not be involved in alcohol or any dangerous drugs 
that will interfere with the child.  The first three years are 
absolutely critical, we know that.  We know how the brain grows 
in the first six years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been paying particular attention to a CBC program 
called <I>Grow Baby Grow</I> and it is fascinating to see the 
outcome, when children are looked after properly. It makes for a 
much better nation, it makes for great citizens, it makes for 
people who will take our places when we retire and we know we 
will be in good hands.  We need to protect our kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that I want to be vigilant, I want parents 
to be vigilant, but I also want to make sure that when these 
tests are done they are valid and that the science being used is 
not invalid and will create problems for the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of phthalates in children's products, especially the 
DEHP, has been investigated by Health Canada.  It has been 
investigated by many foreign governments as well, including 
Sweden, New Zealand, England and the United States.  Suffice it 
to say the decision on DINP will await the completion of the 
scientific investigation now under way by Health Canada. 
Preliminary results were expected this spring and we hope we will 
have them soon.  Should investigations indicate there is a danger 
or a risk to children the department of course will not hesitate 
to pull these things off the shelf and make sure that a threat to 
our children does not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be consistent, we have to be responsible and we have 
to use a professional approach to the testing.  The government's 
ongoing commitment to the health of all Canadians is extremely 
important.  The government will listen to all the information we 
can get and we will be vigilant in making sure that our citizens 
are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for his intervention.  I think it is 
important that we have the debate.  I cannot support the bill 
because, as has been said by my colleague earlier on, we want to 
make sure that when we pull things and put restrictions on the 
industry it is valid and we are using scientific information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b>  Before we resume 
debate we have approximately 10 minutes remaining and we have 
four people who would like to get a few words in.  We will keep 
that in mind as we resume debate with the hon. member for 
Sydney—Victoria. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
bearing in mind the time constraints I will attempt to be brief, 
although once I am on my feet in the Chamber I sometimes find 
that a hard task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I am speaking in support of this piece of legislation I 
do not think it is necessary for me to go over all the reasons 
why we should support it.  Some of those have been enumerated by 
my colleague from the Bloc and my colleague from the Reform 
Party.  Instead I will take the few moments I have to review 
perhaps the reasons why members of the government and members of 
the Conservative Party are not supporting this legislation and I 
think I can effectively raise some rebuttal to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the parliamentary secretary say that at this point he 
cannot support labelling, and that is what we are talking about 
doing.  We are not talking about pulling toys off shelves.  We 
are not talking about banning them.  We are talking about 
labelling them so that consumers who are parents buying for their 
children know what they are buying for those children and they 
can make the choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the government have said that to date there is no 
conclusive evidence that it threatens the health of children, no 
specific cases having come forward, but that Health Canada is 
currently studying the situation.  I think his exact words at one 
point were research is being done that will show the extent of 
the problem, not whether there is a problem but the extent of the 
problem. 
My colleague from the Conservative Party spoke against this bill 
because he says his party is also waiting to see if there is a 
significant risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know in Europe these products have been taken off the

there is a risk. This debate is all too familiar.  We have had 
this debate during question period every day for the last number 
of days the House has been sitting and I refer to the hepatitis 
C issue the Minister of Health has been grilled on. My hon. 
colleague from the Conservative Party arranged a press conference 
for those people who will not be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are some people not being compensated?  The Minister of 
Health has said they were not testing at a particular point in 
time although we know and there is some evidence to suggest—and 
I am not going to get into that debate today, but the parallel is 
interesting—that Health Canada was aware that there was testing 
available for blood products before it was implemented in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have members of the Conservative Party, the Reform 
Party, the Bloc party and the New Democratic Party grilling the 
Minister of Health as to why people who became infected before 
that test was available or accepted by Health Canada were not 
compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there is evidence in other countries that this product 
can be harmful to children but the government and Conservative 
Party want to wait until Health Canada does its own testing.  Are 
members going to be in this House in 15 years grilling the 
Minister of Health about young children who today may become sick 
because we have not accepted the testing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not use up all of the time because there are other points 
to be made.  I encourage anyone watching this debate tonight, 
especially from Ontario since that is where many of the 
government members are from, to phone or write their member of 
parliament to indicate their concerns, especially parents of 
young children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, this is certainly a very 
important motion. While it is clearly intended to protect the 
children from potentially hazardous products, and I do respect 
the work that went into this, it is simply not the most effective 
response.  This is because the mere labelling of a product based 
on the presence of phthalates tells the parent nothing about the 
potential hazard itself.  It is therefore of little use in 
helping parents make informed decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the label to be of use it would have to identify specific 
substances, how much are in the toy and what level constitutes a 
potential health hazard.  Furthermore, the implication of this 
motion is that government health and safety regulations would 
allow dangerous products to be placed on the market with full 
knowledge of their potential danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not true.  It was not true yesterday, today or tomorrow. 
If a specific toy were found to contain a hazardous product and 
if this product had sufficient quantities to harm a child the 
product would not need a warning label because the product would 
not be on the market.  The government would have already taken 
steps to remove the product from the market.  That is why we have 
the Hazardous Products Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue of vinyl plastic has received recent attention in the 
media following a release by Greenpeace of a report that states 
that phthalates used in children's products are a health risk. 
But here it should be noted that the product identified in both 
studies is known as DINP.  The chemical was introduced by toy 
manufacturers in the United States six years ago to replace a 
product called DEHP which was thought to be potentially hazardous 
to children. Therefore the products Greenpeace refers to in its 
report are classic chemicals used to soften the PVC or vinyl. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has tested these products and even expanded its 
testing and assessment of other plastic toys.  The only toxin 
detected was DINP with very small amounts of DEHP. I would like 
to emphasize a point here that appears to have been overlooked in 
this motion and that is the mere presence of phthalates in a 
given product does not necessarily constitute a health risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently health officials are examining studies to assess if in 
fact these particular substances are toxic in this case and if 
they prove to be a hazard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly none of us will disagree on the intent of this motion 
because we are concerned about the health and safety of our 
children on this issue.  Some of the points made during the 
course of this debate have created some confusion about what 
additives are under dispute and their effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do believe that we now have a better appreciation of 
this issue and of the role Health Canada has been playing because 
the number one priority is our children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</b> Mr. Speaker, these past 
four days, we have heard that all parties were concerned about 
the tainted blood issue in Canada. Health Canada and its 
minister have had fingers pointed at them every day. And the 
issue was raised during the whole week that preceded our two 
week recess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, three very important points were raised in the debate on 
Motion M-85. First, the fact that members from all political 
parties support this initiative proves the significance of this 
motion, and we can understand why that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first reading, everyone spoke in favour. At second reading, 
corporate lobbying began and a number of members started to 
change their tune. 
Most of us here, in the House of Commons, are parents, and those 
who are not all know children they care about. This motion 
touches a chord in us as parents and adults who want to keep 
children out of harm's way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have three daughters and I can tell you that, I would have 
wanted to know that there was a risk that some of the toys I 
bought them when they were babies could cause cancer, liver 
damage and infertility, had it been possible at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the problem with phthalates in plastic toys. We cannot 
tell which toys contain this chemical substance. This means that 
parents who buy a soother or a teething ring are playing Russian 
roulette with their children's health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me outline the studies conducted internationally, which show 
how important it is to label toys containing phthalates. 
Phthalates are chemical agents used to make plastic more 
pliable. They are largely used in the manufacturing of 
pacifiers, teething rings and other flexible plastic toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies undertaken by the Danish government show that phthalates 
can be released when children bite into plastic toys. Swedish 
studies on rats show a correlation between the ingestion of 
phthalates and the onset of leukaemia, infertility and organ 
anomalies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, a study carried out by the European Union concluded that 
the security issue raised by the phthalates known as DINP, DNOP 
and DEHP is cause for concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate also showed that members of the House of Commons are 
not the only ones concerned about the use of phthalates in 
plastic toys. 
In Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Argentina, Spain, Belgium, 
Germany and Italy, toy manufacturers and store chains have 
withdrawn toys containing phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have much time left, but I would like to sound a 
warning.  There are problems with contaminated blood and if 
members vote against this motion, I would not want to see any of 
our children dying because of this three years from now.  I am 
only asking that the label advise Canadian parents what they are 
buying, just as it indicates the content of carpets or other 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we cannot do this for our children, we should just pack it in 
and go home.

<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
concerning the hepatitis C compensation package and questions I 
have asked the minister repeatedly in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position taken by the Government of Canada and supported by 
the health minister is completely untenable. The package 
announced by the health minister leaves 20,000 to 40,000 innocent 
victims outside any kind of compensation.  It is unbelievable a 
package that would leave out 20,000 to 40,000 people would be 
announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately it could be as high as 60,000 people because the 
minister the other day admitted he does not know how many people 
have been left outside the compensation package.  This is 
unbelievable in a country as historically generous as Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little frame has been built around the years 1986 to 1990. 
Those unfortunate victims who are outside the years 1986 to 1990 
would not be compensated.  Persons born on December 31, 1985 
would not be compensated but persons born one day later, on New 
Year's Day 1986, would be compensated.  How can a government 
agree to a package that is absolutely as insane as that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody on this side of the House supports that kind of nonsense. 
Much to their credit there are many backbenchers on the 
government side of the House who cannot support it either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to let the Minister of Health know that this issue is not 
going to go away. As long as there is a member on this side of 
the House, and I do not care whether the member is a Reformer, an 
NDP or with the Bloc, we are not going to let this issue die.  In 
the history of Canada, and Canada is 131 years old this year, 
there has never been a piece of business as sad as this one.  The 
government is being so ungenerous to so many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has found a way to buy its way out of some of the 
other problems it created.  Remember the helicopter deal?  It 
paid half a billion dollars just in legal fees on what we would 
call a cancellation clause on a botched helicopter deal.  Half a 
billion dollars.  The government paid out $750 million, 
three-quarters of a billion dollars, on the failed Pearson 
airport deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A mathematical genius is not required to arrive at the number 
that we have on this one.  Simply add half a billion and 
three-quarters of a billion and it is way over a billion dollars. 
The government found money for those botched projects but it 
cannot find money for innocent victims.  It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is not going to go away.  I am glad the justice 
critic is with me tonight.  He just reminded me that the minister 
is the same minister who was spending half a billion dollars on 
gun registration, half a billion dollars on legislation we do not 
need in this country.

Minister of Health I am pleased to respond to the hon. member.  I 
would like to remind him that we are talking about people, not 
statistics, not numbers.  We are talking about people's lives who 
have been affected as a result of infection through the blood 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind the House that we have been guided 
by the desire to help these people, help them as quickly as 
possible and to do so on the basis of compassion and sound public 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have listened to those who were affected by the blood tragedy 
and we listened to Justice Krever.  We heard about the urgency of 
the situation.  We heard that assistance should come and come 
soon and be tailored to the needs.  We have since moved very 
quickly.  We have taken action.  Thirteen ministers of health 
have had to act and they have had to do so in a responsible 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to address Mr. Krever's approach 
to the issue.  He had a very particular mandate which he 
fulfilled but to which he was also bound.  His final report is a 
comprehensive and exhaustive examination of evidence and various 
facts.  The report provides the best historical look at why the 
events of the past occurred, what was done and more importantly, 
what should be done in the future in order that we can learn from 
the errors of the past and learn about ways in which we should 
improve the blood system in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health has an important mandate and set of 
responsibilities that he must take very seriously also.  His 
provincial and territorial colleagues have mandates of their own. 
They have worked together to address the past.  We have also 
worked together to build the future.  We anticipate how our 
decisions have very serious consequences now and for the future.

blood system, we are talking about all health care, medical 
interventions and health services.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>THE ATLANTIC GROUNDFISH STRATEGY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today on a question I asked in this House on 
March 25 of this year.  I asked the finance minister if and when 
he would produce sufficient funds as recommended in the east 
coast report and the Harrigan report. We are talking about TAGS 
and the infrastructure money required for the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador and the other four Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, I would like to read to this 
House a letter signed by five premiers of Atlantic Canada to the 
Prime Minister dated December 12, 1997: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“We the premiers of Canada's five eastern provinces are writing 
to express our concerns over the pending expiry of the Atlantic 
groundfish strategy, TAGS, and to call upon the Government of 
Canada to immediately establish a successor program to TAGS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“As you are aware the Atlantic groundfish strategy is due to 
expire in May 1998.  Over the past four years this program has 
constituted an essential lifeline for over 40,000 individuals and 
their families from Atlantic Canada and Quebec, individuals who 
through no fault of their own have seen their livelihoods and 
those of their families and communities challenged severely by 
the groundfish crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“TAGS was based on two fundamental premises which have proven 
incorrect.  First, the program was based on the expectation that 
key groundfish stocks would begin to recover by the time the 
program was due to end and commercial fisheries could be reopened 
by this time.  This premise has proven incorrect and many of the 
principal groundfish stocks off Canada's east coast remain 
incapable of sustaining a commercial fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Second, the program was expected to bring about labour market 
adjustment and assist individuals in moving out of occupations 
tied to the traditional fishery.  This has not occurred as 
funding for training and other adjustment initiatives had to be 
terminated prematurely in order to meet demands for income 
support which significantly exceeded initial expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The net result for these considerations is that many of the 
fundamental challenges which caused the federal government to 
establish the original TAGS program remain.  Clearly, a 
comprehensive and effective post TAGS program is essential to the 
future of individuals and communities throughout Canada's five 
eastern provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Through the recent hearings of the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans, of which I was a member, and through the 
community hearings held by the Harrigan task force, the people of 
Atlantic Canada and Quebec have called on the federal government 
to assume its responsibility for the development and 
implementation of an effective post-TAGS program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“They have also stated clearly that the social and economic 
stress created by the fisheries crisis are continuing to 
represent a fundamental challenge to the future of many of our 
rural communities.  This challenge cannot be met effectively 
through normal programs of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Unquestionably the urgent need to establish the effect of the 
post-TAGS program cannot be ignored.  On behalf of the people of 
Atlantic Canada and Quebec we therefore call upon the government 
to ensure that an effective TAGS program is developed and 
implemented immediately”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the response the government gives.  Today in the House 
the Minister of Veterans Affairs spoke to the delegation from 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  Some 3,000 people are to be cut off 
TAGS on May 8, one year premature of the originally promised 
date. He said to those people that there would be no program for 
them. They are finished.  They are cut adrift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that absolutely abominable and the Liberals should be 
ashamed of themselves for that kind of action to people who are 
in such a crisis. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, the Government of 
Canada is aware of the profound impact of the closure of the 
fishery on provinces, communities and individuals especially in 
Atlantic Canada and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now evident that fish stocks are not returning to their 
previous levels and we must help people adjust to an economy with 
a very reduced fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also committed to helping the people and the 
communities affected by the closure of the groundfishery and is 
prepared to deal with the situation with the same compassion and 
responsibility that motivated the government to implement TAGS 
initially in 1994.  The government committed back then $1.9 
billion in benefits to help fishers and plant workers affected by 
the crisis in the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government announced that TAGS would essentially 
continue until the end of August this year, it recognized that 
action was still required.  That is why Mr. Eugene Harrigan was 
appointed by the government to lead a review of the impact of the 
end of TAGS.  That is also why the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans undertook an investigation of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution 
of both reports.  They provide us with assessments of the 
post-TAGS situation and have given us important information which 
will prove useful as we continue working on the development of 
sensitive, forward looking approaches to a post-TAGS program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I wish to assure the hon. member and the House that 
the government remains committed to ensuring that the transition 
to the post-TAGS environment is managed in a fair and sensitive 
way.  We recognize this is a very stressful time for fishers and 
plants workers and will make an announcement as soon as we can.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MERCHANT NAVY VETERANS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, in 
my capacity as official opposition critic for veterans affairs I 
wish to set the record straight.  Canada's merchant navy seamen 
have for far too long been the victims of government bureaucracy 
and systemic procrastination by the Minister of Veterans Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister replied to my question in question period by saying 
that there were no outstanding concerns with regard to the 
merchant navy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's merchant navy veterans have long been fighting for 
recognition of their valiant effort before, during and after 
World War II.  Merchant seamen were the first into the war and 
the last out of the war.  They took our troops and supplies to 
Europe during the war and brought them home safely afterward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The merchant navy served both Canada and its allies during the 
war.  At one point the entire allied war effort had less than a 
month's supply of food and fuel left.  It was the merchant navy, 
our Canadian merchant navy, that brought the supplies through and 
avoided what would have been a defeat at the hands of Hitler. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 30, 1998 I asked the minister why he would not give 
merchant navy seamen the status of war veterans and thus grant 
them the dignity and respect they earned.  The minister said that 
merchant navy veterans were entitled to the same benefits as 
other veterans.  What he failed to mention was that they did not 
have equal access to the benefits.  Without equal access there 
are not equal benefits.  This must change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently our merchant seamen are classified under civilian 
legislation.  This belittles the efforts of these veterans. These 
veterans sailed the same seas as the navy, faced the same planes 
as the air force and dodged the same bullets as the army.  They 
are not considered to be war veterans in Canada. 
In other allied countries they would be entitled to the same 
benefits and war status as every other war veteran.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation was drafted by a former Reform MP some time ago for 
the purpose of righting these serious wrongs.  There were more 
delays by the minister.  Many merchant navy veterans think the 
minister is waiting for the issue to die.  On average three of 
these veterans die each week.  Their average age is 87 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 23 representatives of the merchant navy war veterans 
met with the minister's staff.  Here are eight of the requests 
they made at that meeting, requests they have been making for 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is to recognize the merchant navy as a war service 
with full status as war veterans under war legislation, not under 
civilian legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is to include the Minister of Transport in the vice 
regal party at the National War Memorial on behalf of the 
merchant navy and the 1,500 lives lost in war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is to compensate merchant navy veterans or their 
surviving spouses for the denial of veterans benefits for over 50 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth is to amend the Pension Act to recognize merchant 
navy veterans who were held as prisoners of war and to compensate 
them for missed opportunities and benefits offered to other 
prisoners of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth is to return immediately outstanding wages and 
benefits being held from merchant seamen and their surviving 
spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth is to compensate merchant navy veterans because they 
were the only military service that paid income tax during the 
war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seventh is to restore the $88 million budgeted in 1992 to 
cover the expenses mentioned and to develop a program to 
publicize these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eighth is to allow merchant navy war veterans the same 
opportunity and access available to other war veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These requests are clear, legitimate and fair.  Not once during 
the March 23 meeting with the minister's office could they 
provide our veterans with a ray of hope.  No commitments were 
given, no deadlines established, no promises made. Answers were 
sufficiently ambiguous to warrant a call for clarification and 
confirmation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is simply no time left for these veterans to wait for 
ambiguities to be cleared up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, two points need to be 
addressed.  First, the 1992 legislation provided merchant navy 
veterans with the same access to all currently available veterans 
benefits as armed forces veterans enjoy.  As the Minister of 
Veterans Affairs stated, not a few, not some, but all the 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Edmonton East disputes this.  I would ask 
him to name a current veterans benefit merchant navy veterans do 
not qualify for and I assure the House that I will show him the 
specific legal authority under which that benefit is provided to 
merchant navy veterans today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also suggests that merchant navy veterans have 
been denied access to benefits because of restrictive wording in 
the legislation.  I invite him to provide the details of any case 
of a merchant navy veteran being denied a benefit because of such 
wording.  The reality is that not one case has been produced in 
the almost six years the legislation has been in effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point is related to the commitment made in 1992 to 
monitor the implementation of the legislation and to correct any 
shortcomings which might arise.  As mentioned earlier, no 
material shortcomings have arisen in the six years the 
legislation has been in force.  The legislation has provided the 
access to veterans benefits it was intended to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, merchant navy representatives have identified a 
number of technical and legal points they would like to see 
addressed.  The Minister of Veterans Affairs is prepared to act 
on those items.  Presumably the minister can count on the full 
support of the official opposition for the quick passage of that 
legislation when it is brought forward.
