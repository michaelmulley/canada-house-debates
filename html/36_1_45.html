<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, I am now ready to render a 
decision on the question of privilege raised by the hon. member 
for Sarnia—Lambton on December 4 concerning the draw for Private 
Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 4 the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton rose on a 
question of privilege regarding a random draw to establish an 
order of precedence for additional items on Private Members' 
Business.  While ruling that the matter did not constitute a 
question of privilege, I undertook to return to the House after 
having examined the situation about which the hon. member 
complained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notice of the draw was given on Wednesday, in accordance with 
Standing Order 87(2), and the draw is scheduled to be held today 
at 1.15 p.m.  The member pointed out that a draw had recently 
been held on Tuesday, November 25, 1997, when 14 names were 
drawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subcommittee on private members' business is planning to 
meet next week to begin the process of deciding which of the 
members whose names were drawn on November 25 have items which 
should be selected as votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton pointed out that there were 
already only two openings for additional votable items, one bill 
and one motion.  By holding another draw at this time the 
subcommittee might be faced with having even more items from 
which to choose, namely nine bills instead of six.  This, the 
member suggests, would put him at a disadvantage.  In effect, he 
would have to compete against a slightly larger field of 
candidates for what was already a very small number of openings. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's concern is not at all unreasonable. At first blush it 
does appear that he might be disadvantaged by having to compete against 
three additional candidates for the single opening for another votable 
bill. However, if we look at the process in more detail, the Chair is of 
the opinion that the member will not really suffer any prejudice. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we should note that unlike the draw itself, which is 
entirely random, the selection of votable items is based on the 
merits of the bills or motions put forward by members.  Indeed 
Standing Order 92(1) specifically states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In making its selection, the Committee—shall allow the merits 
of the items alone to determine the selection—. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The merits of the member's bill are not directly affected by the 
number of bills being considered by the subcommittee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nonetheless true that the subcommittee is, on occasion, 
unable to choose as many votable items as it might like because 
the votable items selected after a previous draw remain in the 
order of precedence on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some of you may recall, the subcommittee in the previous 
Parliament was put in the unenviable position of not having 
openings for additional votable items following a draw. 
Unfortunately, votable items chosen at the same time all tend to 
remain on the order paper for approximately the same length of 
time, after which several openings may be created within a short 
period of time when they are put to a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is because all votable items may be debated for up to three 
hours.  How many openings for votable items exist at the time the 
subcommittee meets to select additional votable items is 
something over which none of us have any control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should remember that although draws are usually held 
when there are only 15 or 16 items remaining in the order of 
precedence, the standing orders do not stipulate that a draw 
cannot be held sooner.  Standing Order 87(2) provides that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Clerk of the House, acting on behalf of the Speaker, shall, 
when necessary during a Session, conduct a random draw to 
establish an order of precedence for not more than fifteen 
additional items of Private Members' Business— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is thus possible to conduct a draw even though there are more 
than 15 items in the order of precedence, provided it is 
considered necessary to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal reason for not holding draws more frequently than 
we normally do is in order to limit the number of meetings of the 
subcommittee on private members' business.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The order of precedence used to contain 20 items, but in the 
34th Parliament this was increased to 30, the present number, 
precisely because the subcommittee at that time wanted it so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair would point out that the subcommittee is by no means 
obliged to consider any new items placed in the order of 
precedence following today's draw.  The subcommittee may confine 
its selection to the items added after the November 25th draw. 
Furthermore, members whose names are drawn later today will have 
until the end of the day Tuesday to designate which of their 
bills or motions are to be added to the order of precedence, and 
the subcommittee has 10 sitting days following the draw before it 
must begin the process of selecting votable items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, and there is no way to predict this, some members 
whose names are drawn may not wish to be considered by the 
subcommittee.  They may prefer that their bills or motions not be 
designated votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair would also draw members' attention to the fact that 
the subcommittee may select an item as votable at any time before 
it is taken up by the House.  Thus, if an item is not selected as 
votable by the subcommittee next week, it may still be selected 
in February.  There may be more openings for votable items at 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the member suggested that since this draw is being 
held to remedy a problem arising from the accidental exclusion 
from the previous draw of a member with a motion, then the proper 
course would have been to conduct a draw for motions only. 
However, that would have meant that the number of bills in the 
order of precedence would decrease faster than the number of 
motions, causing more bills to be drawn next time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Standing Order 87(1)(b) stipulates: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the draw shall be conducted so that there shall be in the 
order of precedence an equal number of motions and bills 
originating in the House of Commons— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is of the opinion that any draw should be held for 
both bills and motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for bringing this matter to the 
attention of the House.  This may seem to some like a lot of 
quibbling over numbers and technical details, but it reminds us 
all that in attempting to remedy a wrong done to one member, we 
must not cause harm to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After considering the situation thoroughly, I am of the opinion 
that the draw will not adversely affect the hon. member for 
Sarnia—Lambton but will allow another member to have the

<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-9, an act for making the system of Canadian 
ports competitive, efficient and commercially oriented, providing 
for the establishing of port authorities and the divesting of 
certain harbours and ports, for the commercialization of the St. 
Lawrence Seaway and ferry services and other matters related to 
maritime trade and transport and amending the Pilotage Act and 
amending and repealing other acts as a consequence, be read the 
third time and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure to be able to 
speak to members about Bill C-9 for this third reading debate. 
Before I talk about the bill I want to take a moment to 
acknowledge the critical role that has been played by members of 
the House, in particular those members of the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Transport, for their work on this bill, the 
very thoughtful improvements they have made which I think have 
illustrated very constructively the role that the committee 
system plays in our legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank the critics for the other parties, the 
members for Cypress Hills—Grasslands, 
Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, Cumberland—Colchester, and 
Churchill because they have all worked in a very collegial 
fashion.  They have brought forward very sensible 
recommendations.  Some of them we have accepted, some for various 
reasons we have not accepted.  In any event, it has been a very 
collegial process which I think is a testament to the way 
Parliament should work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members have displayed a great diligence in working to 
prepare what I consider to be a quality piece of legislation 
which will ensure the best marine transportation system for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also a great contribution made by the transportation 
community across the country.  They stayed with us throughout the 
length of the process.  They really were in for the long haul. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Mr. Speaker, this bill has been in the works for 
many years, in fact about three years, and we have seen it 
debated twice in this House.  It has been shepherded through that 
time not just within the House but within industry by one 
individual who I want to pay a particular word of respect to 
today.  That is my parliament secretary, the member for Hamilton 
West, who has worked diligently, was a member of the committee, 
the chairman of the standing committee on transport and who came 
forward with the recommendations.  He was able to convince my 
predecessor that this was the route to go.  He has stayed with 
this process and is now working very effectively as parliamentary 
secretary.  All members of the House owe him a great vote of 
thanks, as I do as minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope some people will acknowledge that in the House.  It is 
Friday, Mr. Speaker.  I know it is early. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  The transportation community 
did show us where the cloth could be cut to make a better result 
for all.  We owe them much gratitude for all their help with the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after I became minister I did meet with port managers, 
the seaway and port users, ship owners and with pilotage 
interests.  The message from all of these parties was the same. 
They wanted us to bring back the Canada Marine Act and to proceed 
as quickly possible to bring it through parliament.  Although no 
one stakeholder got everything they wanted from the bill, they 
all agreed the comprises made represented a good balance of 
interests and that it is time to get on with implementing the 
improvements envisioned in the national marine policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that marine transportation is vitally important to 
Canada's economic health.  It makes an enormous contribution to 
our international trade, tourism and jobs.  One of our 
government's central goals has been to strengthen Canada's 
economy and create a climate that supports job creation and 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To meet the objective in the marine transportation area, that is 
to make sure our marine system is efficient, competitive and 
operated according sound business practices, in this bill we are 
making important changes to Canada's port and seaway 
transportation institutions.   By providing new governance and 
organizational arrangements through the bill, we will be able to 
bring decisions closer to the users who, when all is said and 
done, are the ones who must pay for marine facilities and 
services.  In this way we forge stronger links to the communities 
that are served by and linked to our marine system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said a moment ago, the journey to this point has been a 
long one, some would say an arduous one.  In 1994 at the request 
of my predecessor, Transport Canada began a review of the 
management system for the marine industry and the regulatory 
regime.  The following year the standing committee undertook the 
study of the marine sector under the leadership of the member for 
Hamilton West.  A number of important recommendations emerged. 
Following the report, Transport Canada held regional meetings 
with shippers and industry and consulted with other key players 
in the marine sector.  The result was the national marine policy 
that was adopted by the government in December 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy is designed to bring a greater commercial discipline 
to the marine sector and to increase efficiency, to cut costs and 
to give communities more control over their ports.  Also, it will 
allow the government to focus on its top priorities, safety, 
security and sustainability. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the Canada Marine Act is to implement the national 
marine policy. This act was first introduced in June 1996, and it 
clearly reflects the objectives of that policy in many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It defines the role of the federal government in relation to marine 
transportation. It establishes a fair collaborative framework for the 
management of commercial ports. 
It provides for the transfer of local and regional facilities to 
interested parties. It eliminates useless costs in the operation of 
ports, the seaway and the pilotage authorities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>New discussions were held with all stakeholders, and the Standing 
Committee on Transportation held hearings across the country when it 
conducted its review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the full range of observations gathered 
from interested parties during its review, the Standing Committee on 
Transportation proposed about one hundred changes, most of which were 
incorporated in the present bill. Also included are the amendments made 
by the House of Commons during its review of the former bill at the 
report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Parliament was dissolved on April 27, 1997, before 
third reading of the bill in the Senate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we reintroduced the bill.  When I talked with my critics 
about a quick passage through the House they were quite concerned 
that we bring the bill back as passed last spring in the House. 
We did that.  I know that created a bit of controversy because 
there was some unfinished business that we have tried to tidy up 
in this round in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We knew the marine system needed modernization.  We knew that 
industry indicated this great support for the bill.  So we were 
quite confident that with some flexibility and with some debate 
we could come to this stage of third reading reasonably quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make mention here of a few key amendments that 
we have made during the consideration of the bill in this 
session. 
The first is the inclusion of Hamilton and North Fraser in the list of 
initial port authorities.  I talked about that on Wednesday of 
this week when we did the report stage deliberations.  Part of 
the problem there was there was unfinished business between the 
city of Hamilton and the harbour commissioners, unresolved issues 
that now look like there on the way to resolution.  Therefore it 
only made sense to bring the harbour commission in Hamilton into 
the fold and designate it as a CPA in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly for North Fraser we thought about combining the two 
harbour commissions there into one port authority but there did 
not seem to be a consensus on that.  Perhaps down the road under 
the new system there may be a move toward one port authority but 
for now we have included North Fraser as part of the schedule of 
those installations that should be designated as a CPA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also brought in an amendment to change board member 
qualifications for appointments by the three levels of government 
allowing for a wider breadth of experience in board composition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of pilotage the legislation changes the completion 
date for a statutory review of pilotage issues to one year after 
the coming into force of the pilotage provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key feature of the bill which I cannot underscore too broadly 
is the creation of the Canada port authorities as an important 
new institutional model for management of our ports of national 
importance.  From an efficiency and gains perspective we intend 
to free ports in the system from government bureaucracy and they 
are expected in return to be self-sufficient.  I think that is a 
pretty good trade off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new port authority created under the auspices of this act 
would have the powers directly related to shipping, navigation, 
the transportation of goods and passengers and the handling of 
storage of all products.  With government approval the port may 
also engage in other activities that support its port operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Port authority borrowing to support capital investments will be 
decided by private sector lenders base on the port authority 
stream of future revenues.  The port authority will be able to 
pledge its own land and fixtures plus any fixtures on federal 
land that it manages as securities to support the borrowing. 
The authorities will be accountable through their annual reports 
and audits which are to be available to the public and general 
meetings which are to be open to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Port authorities will also be subject to special examinations. 
These are combined performance reviews and audits and are 
required not less than every five years.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of reforms that the port communities have 
been asking for for many, many years and we are happy that we are 
now finally moving in that direction. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human resources were a priority during development of the Canada 
Marine Act. We want to ensure that all employees affected by these 
changes are treated fairly and that all applicable requirements of the 
Canada Labour Code are fully complied with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 reflects our position that all marine facility employees 
presently under federal pension and benefit plans will be covered by 
similar substitute plans. Employees should not be penalized financially 
when leaving the public service plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee also emphasized the need to clarify the 
right of these marine facility employees to transfer their accumulated 
benefits into the plan they are joining with their new employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a concern for committee members from all parties in the 
House, and I am happy to announce that this was included in an amendment 
at the report stage. This is a good point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of amendment demonstrates very clearly the constructive 
role of the committee review system, through which members can have 
input to enhance the bills referred to them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is a bill that requires that marine employees leaving 
the federal plan under this policy be offered comparable benefits 
until such time as they and the new employer agree to change it. 
The bill also requires a new employer to set in place 
contribution rates no higher than the rates employees paid 
immediately before the transfer and to take all reasonable steps 
to negotiate a pension transfer agreement with Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pension transfer agreements would allow benefits to continue to 
grow as service time accumulates with the new employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in the House on Wednesday, these changes give us a 
bill that does the right thing, not only for our ports and the 
seaway but also for all of their employees.  Now that the House 
is just about finished its work, we have in Bill C-9 a balanced 
package, one that gives Canada the right set of policies and the 
right set of institutions to link Canada and Canadians to the 
rest of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The marine community wants this bill.  It is very comprehensive 
and we should hasten it forward to the Senate to complete the 
legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to going to the other place and to working with 
my colleagues in that chamber to assure them of the objectives of 
the bill, to see what ideas they have and to work with them in a 
collaborative fashion to effect speedy passage in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, let us not forget the major achievement in this 
bill.  The legislation meets the goals of the national marine 
policy and strikes a balance in how we manage our marine 
institutions and facilities.  It complements the government's 
other transportation initiatives and is also an important element 
of the overall effort to prepare our transportation system for 
the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, and I have said it before and I will say it again, no 
matter what changes are made or how many services are 
commercialized, Transport Canada will continue to make safety and 
security of Canada's transportation system its first priority. 
The interest of Canadians and the Government of Canada will 
always be present in that particular area.  However, under this 
bill we are giving the Canadian marine industry more flexibility 
in managing its own affairs in a commercial, efficient and 
effective manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members present to join with us on the government side 
to pass this bill so that we can complete the legislative process 
in the Senate, proclaim it early in the new year and get down to 
the business of giving Canada a terrific new vehicle to discharge 
marine policy as we move into the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday we all held our noses here.  We voted for C-9 
at report stage.  We are going to repeat that exercise again 
today because most players in the industry have indicated that 
they want to get the show on the road, so to speak.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost everyone of course is happy to see the last of “Pork” 
Canada, and it has to be replaced by something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is truly a pity that not a single amendment proposed by 
opposition members in committee at the instigation of shipping 
companies, maritime associations, individual port corporations, 
stevedoring firms, unions or commodity shippers was accepted over 
the doctrine of Transport Canada bureaucrats. Surely all those 
amendments could not have been that bad.  I simply do not 
understand what the minister meant this morning when he spoke 
kindly of our input in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If nothing else, the exercise proved the futility of our 
committee system.  Our committees, and I would have to say most 
especially the transport committee compared to others that I have 
sat on, are merely extensions of ministerial offices with 
government members dutifully lining up and saluting on cue.  What 
a farce. Opposition members and government backbenchers are kept 
busy and kept out of trouble, and the illusion of sober 
deliberations is maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most poorly thought out section of the bill, and the one for 
which I have yet to hear a kind word from anyone outside 
government, is one which gives the government the right to 
collect a levy based on gross revenue from port authorities, a 
slice right off the top. The size of that levy under the terms of 
the legislation may be set quite capriciously by the minister. 
Different port authorities, because they have different financial 
circumstances, will have these gross levies set at different 
levels.  Different ports are going to be treated differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever happened to commonly accepted business principles? 
Whatever happened to fairness?  It would have been very simple to 
set in the regulations a net levy which would have been paid by 
all the new port authorities irrespective of their basic 
financial situation. Because it would only have entered into 
their profits or would only have been taken away from their 
profits, it would not strangle a port which might be staggering 
under an extraordinarily heavy capital debt for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are ports that are in the fortunate position of having 
made fairly major capital expenses while they were still 
creatures of the federal government so that the taxpayers from 
sea unto shining sea picked up the tab. They are going to be in 
hog heaven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, ports that have very heavy capital expenditures facing 
them that are going to have to be made after the formation of the 
new port authorities will then have to take on enormous debt for 
which they alone will be responsible. Yet they will be expected 
to pay off the top a levy on gross revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of where they stand in competition with each other or 
in conflicts of interest with each other, I have yet to talk to 
one player in the industry who thinks that this is a good idea. 
The bureaucrats in Transport Canada think it is a good idea and 
the bureaucrats in Transport Canada get what they want in the 
transport committee and so we have a done deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter here from the Greater Vancouver Gateway Council. 
This is probably one of the biggest associations in Canada which 
is directly concerned with harbours, concerned with the movement 
of goods because it includes not only the port of Vancouver but 
it also includes the airport, the railway shippers and so on. 
The council really castigates this idea of forcing ports to pay 
off the top to the federal government. The federal government 
always has its hand in somebody's pocket.  In this case it wants 
to put its hand into the pocket of an entity which it has created 
ostensibly to serve the public.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Greater Vancouver Gateway Council mentions a few facts which 
I think should be taken into consideration in the House with 
respect to the competitiveness between Canadian ports and U.S. 
ports.  In the case of these people it would be the port of 
Seattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much lower taxation in the U.S.  In spite of the fact 
that there is much lower taxation, our federal government wants 
to slap an additional levy on the ports and make them pay on 
their gross revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an ability in the U.S. to finance port development 
through the issuance of tax exempt bonds.  Here in Canada the 
government is not even going to allow these new port authorities 
to mortgage or use as collateral the federal property which they 
will be administering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The port authorities will be able to use only their own property 
or use the non-fixed equipment in the ports as collateral. Mostly 
they will have to hold out their hand, bend over to the financial 
institutions and say: “Please lend us some money. We will pay 
almost any rate of interest because that is the way it has to be. 
We do not have anything to back our loan”.  They not only do not 
have any physical means to back their loans, but one of the whole 
objects of the commercialization is to get the federal government 
out of the position where it has to take any responsibility for 
the port debts. These institutions which are ostensibly going to 
be independent are going to have the responsibility but they are 
not going to have authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing which the gateway council mentions is that in the 
U.S. there are lower fees or no fees for government services such 
as dredging.  It says there are no requirements to pay dividends 
or make special payments to shareholders.  I have already 
mentioned that one. They are going to have to make a monstrous 
special payment to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing the gateway council talks about but does not go into 
detail on is lower taxation.  In the ports to the south, 
particularly Seattle and Tacoma, the port authorities actually 
have taxing powers, while our ports are paying taxes.  Can you 
believe it?  Government institutions that are supposed to be 
serving the public are going to be forced to pay taxes.  This is 
bizarre. There is no place else in the civilized world I would 
say that has such a totally unprecedented way of beating up on 
their own government entities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this brave new world of port authorities, it is proposed that 
the boards of directors all be appointed with ministerial 
approval from nominees and that the minister in effect will have 
a veto power.  Talk about patronage heaven. This is what we are 
supposed to be trying to get rid of when we get rid of “Pork 
Canada”.  It is the same old story, right back to the trough.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition the government has refused to consider proposed 
amendments which would provide for a more open system of 
appointing directors.  It has also refused to consider proposals 
that would provide for greater accountability in the port 
authorities by addressing the problem of conflict of interest 
during privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all saw what happened during the privatization of NavCan.  I 
do not have to continue beating that dog in this House.  Everyone 
is aware of it. It was disgraceful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we have a port which is in the process of divestiture. 
We have a gross conflict of interest with lobbyists who used 
to be members of this honourable House. They are out flogging a 
deal on behalf of potential buyers who want to take over the port 
so they will have a fix on the only easily available means they 
have for shipping their product. This is not unprecedented but it 
is unheard of.  It is the Liberal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we go again. The same amendments that were proposed to 
avoid conflicts during privatization would also have provided for 
more arm's length safeguards in the proposed five year audits. 
The audits are fine but let us have independent audits and not 
have the audits ultimately under the control of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned another problem several times in this House and 
in committee.  That is the problem of pilotage in particular on 
the St. Lawrence.  Here is one case where all the stakeholders 
are not onside.  All but one are on side.  The one that is not 
on side is the pilotage monopoly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition to this monopoly goes right across the industry. 
It is not just the shipping associations.  It is not just the 
shippers.  It is not just the commodity producers in western 
Canada.  It is not just the grain handling companies.  Everybody 
wants to get rid of this except for those who benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a tight little monopoly where people collect from $80,000 
to $180,000 a year for nine months of work.  They have all sorts 
of feather bedding provisions in their enabling legislation. They 
cannot be shaken off because it is so difficult under the terms 
of the act for masters of Canadian vessels, not foreign ships, I 
repeat Canadian vessels, who regularly ply our inland waters, who 
know them like the backs of their hands, to have themselves 
certified as pilots.  It is virtually impossible.  Somebody told 
me there are nine Canadian masters who have been certified to 
pilot their own vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays when there are modern navigational aids like GPS, these 
experienced masters cannot write an examination to prove their 
competence, prove that they know the waters, show that they also 
have on their vessels the requisite GPS systems.  They cannot get 
around this monopoly.  It costs the Canadian grain farmer $4 
million in excess pilotage costs per annum in order to maintain 
this cosy little club.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is provision in the legislation for a review of the 
situation.  It is supposed to take place one year after the bill 
receives royal assent.  I am not holding my breath that anything 
will come of it, but we will see how things work out.  We are on 
the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody made a lot of nice noises about the preservation of 
the pension rights of employees at the ports when they are either 
commercialized, as in the case of the port authorities, or 
divested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gather from reading the legislation—and I am fairly cognizant 
of it—that the employees of the bigger ports, the people who 
will be in the port authorities, will be reasonably well 
protected.  However, if an employee works for a small port that 
will be divested, he is toast, absolute toast.  There is nothing 
in the legislation to protect that person at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two classes of employees:  those who work for the big 
guys and will continue to work for other big guys, and those who 
work for the small and rather vital ports in the hinterlands. 
Some of these port employees have 10 or 15 years of seniority and 
they are getting nothing.  That is wrong, absolutely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is fairly typical of what happens when bureaucracy runs 
amok.  It is always the person with the smallest voice who gets

reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought I would approach my speech a little differently than 
we usually do in the House.  Let me explain.  As members know, in 
the British parliamentary system from which this Parliament sprang, 
the government introduces bills and the opposition naturally 
criticizes.  Sometimes, when we meet with members of the public on 
the weekends they tell us that the opposition seems to be objecting 
for the sheer pleasure of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new approach I wish to take is to talk about the points 
with which we agree in this bill. 
Then I will be able to mention the points with which we are not in 
agreement, and state our party's position on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, just before beginning, could you ask the

whip has come back to keep order on that side of the House.  I am 
trying to do the best I can as a parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had started to talk about the points in this bill with which 
I agree, and it is very annoying to hear someone keep on yapping in 
the back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to correct some of the points mentioned by my 
colleague, the critic for the Reform Party, with respect to this 
bill.  The Reform member seemed to be blaming the government for 
not holding public hearings at this stage of the new Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will submit to you most humbly, and it is not my intention 
to annoy the government—the hon. parliamentary secretary knows 
that I am a highly critical parliamentarian and that when things 
are not going right,the parliamentary secretary is familiar with my 
good nature, of which you have just seen an example—you have seen 
that I am a peaceable fellow.  However, when things do not suit me, 
I speak up for myself.  But I also speak up when things do suit me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, the Government of Canada, the Liberal 
government, held very thorough public hearings in order to draft 
Bill C-9.  Having been on the transport committee at that time, I 
can tell you that we visited 15 port communities, all of us on that 
committee. 
We visited the regions.  We heard witnesses and were given briefs. 
We heard groups, corporations and ports people, who told us what 
they thought of the bill and what provisions they thought it should 
contain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we held weeks of hearings in Ottawa.  It cost 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, but we were exercising democracy. 
That is what is healthy about a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that, as Bloc Quebecois members, 
when we were elected in 1993, we wondered about our participation 
in parliamentary committees.  We asked ourselves whether 
parliamentary committees served any purpose and changed anything, 
whether the government had preconceived ideas and in any case, 
since governments are elected to govern, whether it would govern? 
As a party, we wondered whether we should sit on the parliamentary 
committees.  Together we decided that we opposed the empty chair 
theory, that we would take our seat and that we would play an 
active role in committees.  And so I and other colleagues toured 15 
communities so people could speak out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I really regret that Bill C-44 died on the Order 
Paper in the Senate, in the other House.  This is of greater 
concern for democracy. 
It is unfortunate that we had to start all over following the 
election on June 2.

reading yesterday and why we will complete third reading this 
afternoon and perhaps vote next week before Parliament adjourns 
December 12, because Canada and Quebec's marine community has asked 
us to pass this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I wanted to say in this regard is that I find it 
deplorable that the other House killed Bill C-44, which had given 
rise to considerable consultation. 
It is unfortunate that it was killed by unelected persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing about democracy in Canada and Quebec is that 
members like me and my colleagues from all parties are democratically 
elected by the people and when we are no longer needed at the end of our 
term, we are told, as we say back home “Off to the doghouse with 
you”—and I would not want you to think that I have the hon. member for 
Bourassa in mind when I say this; this is just a colloquialism—and 
another representative gets elected. That is the idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not how it works for the members in the other place: the 
senators. They are friends of the government, appointed either by the 
Liberals or by the Conservatives. We will recall the Conservatives. 
Brian Mulroney appointed Senator Roberge, who was the general manager of 
the Ritz Carleton because, when Mulroney travelled to Montreal, he 
stayed at the Ritz Carleton. 
He told the manager he was going to appoint him as a senator. The 
Liberals did the exact same thing. In addition to her pension as a 
former Quebec Liberal MNA, Senator Lise Bacon gets paid as a senator. 
That is what we find unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice, Mr. Speaker, that you are about to interrupt me to 
proceed to oral questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that Bill C-44 was killed 
by unelected persons. I take this opportunity to remind the House that 
they killed Bill C-44 in the last Parliament and, as a result, we had to 
start all over by introducing Bill C-9 now before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to indicate which provisions in Bill C-9 we agree 
with. First, we find it interesting that the government would give a 
high level of autonomy to local port authorities. 
We cannot disagree with Bill C-9 bringing management closer to local 
communities—

unlikely because they are already dead broke from Liberal taxes,

they would have to consider where to invest it.  Would they 
rather mail that loonie off to Ottawa to a plan that is already 
$500 billion in debt in the faint hope of $1.80 return if they 
are really, really lucky or would they invest it themselves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even at 5% return on that investment that loonie would turn into 
at least $4 in 30 years.  That would be in a safe or secure bank

Canadians are fed up with the high taxes they pay.  They are also 
fed up with the fact that their disposable income has gone down 
under this Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the finance minister tell Canadians today when their taxes 
are going to come down? 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, they have already come down.  In fact, the Minister of 
Human Resources announced a week ago that the employment 
insurance premiums would be cut by $1.4 billion.  In the 1997 
budget we brought taxes down by more than $2 billion over three 
years, helping students and the physically disabled.  At the same 
time, we put more money in the hands of those families with 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue really is, why did the Reform Party oppose those 
reductions in taxes? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
a recent poll shows today that the Canadian public are not going 
to buy the arrogance of this Liberal government.  The finance 
minister said he helped.  Well, let's take a look; 86 months of 
unemployment rates above 9%, all time record bankruptcies in 
Canada, the worst record since the dirty thirties under this 
Liberal government.

that there were 34,000 new jobs created last month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members on that side of the table who talked about one

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I do not buy the finance minister's line and neither do 
Canadians.  If he had read the news this morning, he would have 
found that Canadians clearly understand the relationship between 
high Liberal taxes and job creation in this country.  Canadians 
know that high taxes kill jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will again ask the finance minister on behalf of all 
Canadians, when are we going to get the tax cuts that we want and

strains this member's capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that I have already answered both of those 
questions.  We brought taxes down and the Reform Party opposed 
it.  The Canadian economy has produced over a million new jobs, 
34,000 last month.  That is a record we are proud to stand

in CPP payroll taxes.  It will start the second that Canadians 
shout “Happy New Year.”

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he admit that there is confusion between his position and 
that of Reformers, because, on the one hand, the minister wants to

fishing is perfectly legitimate.  I point out, though, that 
current fishing within the 200 mile limit is probably below 4% of 
what it was in the eighties when his government was in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out that if we do not permit stocks that are not 
being utilized by Canadian fishers to be taken by fishermen of 
other nations, we will not be able to protect the cod and 
groundfish stocks on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks.  We 
cannot take an international law when it is to our benefit, 
reject it when it is not, and expect other nations to agree with 
us.

to export Canadian housing technology products.  Naturally as we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the supposed Minister of Health, a former lawyer, has become 
pretty good at dragging his government into the law courts and 
paying out lots of money to lawyers for the Airbus boondoggle, 
for the obstruction of Krever, in the future for stonewalling 
hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government exempts auto racing in the Tobacco Act, other 
groups will be sprinting to the courts. He knows that. What 
possible defence will this government offer at that time in court 
for exempting one event but not others?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
with the close attention the hon. member pays to the activities 
of lawyers, I know he will be aware that this government is in 
court at the moment vigorously defending the Tobacco Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tobacco Act is under attack by tobacco companies. They claim 
it is unconstitutional.  We say it is entirely valid.  The court 
will decide.  One thing is clear.  The Tobacco Act puts Canada in 
a position of leadership throughout the world for vigorous and 
effective steps to reduce the incidence of tobacco use among its 
citizens and of that we are very proud.

question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the minister stated in this House that Canada had, and 
I quote: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The toughest export controls in arms of any country in the 
western world”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these controls are so tough, how can the minister explain that 
arms sales to Indonesia totalling approximately $2 billion have been 
authorized when Amnesty International reports that, in East Timor, a

security forces?

<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, under the export controls that we exercise, we do a 
careful evaluation as to any piece of article or artefact, 
determining whether it could be used for involvement in civil 
wars, involvement in the suppression of civil society.  If it is 
simply a matter of a piece of equipment that could be a rubber 
boot or a parachute or some kind of electronic device for a ship, 
then clearly it is not eligible.  It is for defensive purposes, 
not offensive purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very happy to offer the hon. member a full briefing 
on the export and import control act so he understands how it 
works.

question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will be aware that the failure to achieve financial 
targets in 1994 and 1995 has resulted in some last minute 
decisions to cut back.  It is the government's version of the 
last minute club and it is civilians that are getting clubbed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the minister not confirm today that 3,800 additional

<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the government in 1993 that did have the moral 
courage to order helicopters, only to see the Liberal government 
default on that order, I was really gratified today by the 
editorial in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> entitled “Here comes a 
chopper to chop off your head”.  It goes on to say that this 
government does not have the moral courage to order helicopters. 
It says that the EH-101 is undoubtedly the best helicopter but 
because it is politically undesirable, the government will not 
order it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister prove the <I>Globe and Mail</I> wrong today, 
prove that the government does have the moral courage to buy 
helicopters and announce today to Canadians that it is going to 
order new helicopters before more Sea Kings crash?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and

evaluating the process.  We are taking everything into 
consideration.  Our purpose is to make sure that the helicopters 
we are going to buy are the best value for Canadian taxpayers. As 
soon as the decision is made, we will announce it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

</I></B></P><P align=left>Ensuring that children have a strong start in life is critical 
to Canada's future. The national child benefit is and remains a 
top priority for our government. The 1997 budget targeted and 
reflected our commitment with an $850 million down payment for 
poor children in Canada. There is another $850 million to come in 
this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With our provincial partners we are creating more than a program

already knew.  He stated that the Immigration and Refugee Board 
was a slow, bureaucratic and patronage-ridden board.  He said it 
takes up to two and a half years to get a refugee claim settled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this government really think two and a half years is an

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcomed 
the auditor general's report.  In fact, the auditor general's 
views and recommendations fit very well with what the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration is already doing. The minister has 
appointed a task force to do a complete legislative review to 
deal with the process and to enhance our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has also said very clearly that he did not 
want to see a patchwork situation because it is a complex issue. 
Some of the recommendations that the auditor general made are 
already being implemented by the department.

for the Minister for International Cooperation and Minister responsible 
for Francophonie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the accepted standard, industrialized countries must 
allocate a minimum of 0.7% of their gross national product to official 
development assistance. However, in 1997-98, the federal government will 
not even allocate 0.3% of its GNP to ODA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since additional budget cuts of $159 million are anticipated in 
1998, are we to understand that, at the rate things are going, the 
minister's target for development assistance will be 0.0% by the year 
2000?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister for International Cooperation and 
Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we 
mentioned on several occasions, our goal is to go back to the standard 
of 0.7% of the gross national product. Unfortunately, CIDA also had to 
do its share in the fight against the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the situation is much improved, I am confident that, 
before too long, we can aim again for that standard.

Revenue Canada in record numbers.  The target of this massive

cost of living in the north.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  If the hon. member 
has a question of privilege I wish he would state it and never 
mind the interjections that sometimes happen.  I am willing to 
hear his question of privilege but I would ask him to state it 
promptly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my question of privilege 
can be found under Beauchesne's citation 99 which will be helpful 
to you pertaining to the safety of members of this House. Another 
place you can find it is in Maingot, page 196. Another reference 
is in the Criminal Code pertaining to the issue of assault and 
threatening.  Mr. Speaker, I would very much like to have you and 
your brother Speakers review those sections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue in question is can we have threats of physical assault 
take place in this Chamber which are contrary not only to the 
codes mentioned but contrary to the Constitution of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue at stake is can a member rise in his place and not be 
subjected to physical threats and violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The incident yesterday was not videotaped like the incident that 
was videotaped on February 4.  Before the ruling came down on 
that particular incident Mr. Speaker gave assurances to this 
House that all the facts were going to be reviewed and the 
videotape was going to be reviewed but the whole issue as it 
pertained to the threat of physical violence, to the threat of 
assault, was not addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to go about doing our business in this Chamber, 
it is incumbent on the Chair to ensure the safety of the members 
of this House and in cases where we have repeat offenders, it is 
something that this House cannot and should not tolerate.  This 
House is based on representation and every member of this House 
should have the right to stand up and speak without having to 
worry about the physical well-being of his or her person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is my point of privilege and I expect Mr. Speaker to come 
back with a ruling on it, looking particularly at the issue of 
threatening as it is defined by the Criminal Code and assault as 
it is defined by the Criminal Code.

closed for today but that he intended to review the tape and the

were, in this case and that he was going to come back with a

floor at the time perceived intimidation—I had an opportunity to 
review his words and he did use the word intimidation—and if 
there was intimidation, then it was perceived as such.  Setting 
aside completely any reference to the Criminal Code definitions, 
we have in this House a standard of conduct which we must uphold 
ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer the Speaker to an incident that occurred in the 34th 
Parliament in which a member impaired the movement of the 
Sergeant at Arms who was carrying the Mace.  The member was asked 
to account for that at the Bar.  Depending on how the Chair deals 
with this case, I would like the Chair to consider that as an 
option to deal with this issue once and for all so we do not have 
any repeated incidents of this kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to give further clarification, 
I will read from <I>Hansard</I>.  The Speaker said: “From what I 
have heard now I am not sure whether we have a point of 
privilege.  What I will undertake to do is I will look at the 
blues and I will look at what was on the tape. If it is 
necessary, I will come back to the House”.  That was the ruling. 
At the end of that he said:  “This point is closed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I think you have no choice but to shut 
this down and we will await the return of the Speaker after he 
has done what he said he will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair is concerned that we are 
getting into a bit of a debate here.  I have heard some points of 
view on the issue.  I would like a few moments to consult and 
then I will say something to the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is not a trivial issue.  This is a very serious issue, 
especially for those of us who sit here.  The member in question 
put in writing: “I do consider violence appropriate sometimes”. 
He put that in writing to a women's organization and he even 
recommended that perhaps we should consider— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The issue raised by the hon. member 
for Kitchener—Waterloo dealt with the safety of members of this 
House in the course of their participation in the proceedings of 
the House.  There was some suggestion on his part that members 
should not feel threatened by other persons in the course of 
their work in debate in this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the hon. member has raised a point 
that involves a matter of concern to the House and to all members 
and certainly to the Chair.  In that sense it is a very serious 
issue.  However, the Chair is mindful of the fact that in the 
course of the work of the Chamber there is a security arrangement 
in place for this House.  The Sergeant at Arms is sitting right 
here in the House and is able to assist if there is serious 
disorder in this House and is indeed here for that purpose, among 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know hon. members have considerable confidence in the Sergeant 
at Arms and in his ability to exercise the necessary restraint on 
those who might at some point get carried away.  He has legions 
of people able to assist him who could come here at a moment's 
notice should that be necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the point of view of the protection of members of this 
House, the Chair is very well aware of the need for that and has 
made arrangements. 
There is an organization to assist the House should that 
necessity arise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member for Kitchener—Waterloo in raising his 
point of order has raised a concern.  I want to assure him of the 
seriousness with which the Chair regards the issue of the safety 
of hon. members.  This issue is certainly one that is constantly 
in the mind of the Chair and will continue to remain there and in 
the mind of the Sergeant-at-Arms who is doing his duty here in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is a question of privilege that has been 
raised today by the hon. member for Kitchener—Waterloo that 
cannot be answered by the security arrangements in place in this 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the incident yesterday, his Honour, the Speaker, 
has taken the matter under advisement, as the hon. member for Elk 
Island has so ably pointed out to us.  The Deputy Chairman of 
Committees of the Whole, who was here at the time, indicated that 
as far as he was concerned the matter was not closed for certain 
purposes and that he also would review the matter with the 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that the Speaker, in considering the blues and 
the tapes that he will be looking at in this case, will consider 
the remarks made by hon. members today in the House.  I will 
certainly draw those to his attention.  However, I do not think 
it is necessary to go on with this any further.  I believe that 
the safety of all hon. members is protected by the Chair and will 
continue to be protected by the Chair.  I trust we can close the 
matter for today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, without 
wishing to express my opinion directly on the matter, since you 
have just made a ruling, I would nevertheless like to raise a point 
in this House and to state that I greatly appreciate the fact that 
the Chair had the delicacy to hear the points of view of colleagues 
here, because yesterday the hon. members did not have that 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair did, of course, indicate to this House its intention 
to review the blues and look at the videotapes, but the problem is 
that it will probably not be possible, using the blues or the 
tapes, to see or hear what was going on in the House at that point. 
That is why it is important to be able to hear from colleagues who 
were present at that particular time, and perhaps to appeal to all 
colleagues to exercise restraint and common sense and to respect 
the dignity of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I submit to you that I am concerned by the fact 
that we have twice, in the space of as many days, seen colleagues 
involved in deplorable incidents which, in my opinion, injure the 
dignity of this House and constitute contempt of the institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair has heard the words of the hon. 
whip of the Bloc Quebecois and I heard all the members who spoke 
today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the tapes do not always disclose everything, but I 
think the hon. member must be aware that there is a presiding 
officer in the House at all times and that the Deputy Chairman of 
Committees of the Whole House was here and saw the incidents as 
they occurred.  I am sure that there were other hon. members who 
were here and saw what happened. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members have the opportunity to speak with the Chair to 
explain what they saw and what they heard.  I am sure that, if the 
Chair requires information from other members in preparing the 
ruling, it can be contacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the time being, I think the subject is closed.  I have 
indicated that there will no question of privilege today on members 
here being in danger.  We have a system in place to ensure members 
are protected and it will remain in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to add 
something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If it is on this point, I do not want to 
continue the debate.  We have spent nearly 20 minutes on the 
subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whip of the Bloc Quebecois has the floor, if it is on 
another matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to 
make sure I am understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have to say does not concern the matter of safety 
raised by our colleague.  I wanted simply to express my concern 
regarding respect for the House of Commons and call on the goodwill 
of all my colleagues here in respecting the dignity of this 
institution.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE AND ACTION ON VIOLENCE AGAINST 
WOMEN 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on December 6 Canadians across 
this country will join in marking our National Day of Remembrance 
and Action on Violence Against Women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a day of mourning for the 14 young women who tragically 
lost their lives in 1989, specifically because they were women. 
It is a day to reflect on the many women who continue to live and 
die in the shadow of violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than one-third of Canadian women are the victims of sexual 
assault.  One out of two have experienced physical or sexual 
violence as defined by the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Systemic violence against women is a fundamental abuse of power. 
It is a violation of human rights.  It is a cause and consequence 
of women's inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years women's organizations have worked to bring this issue 
into the public domain.  Violence against women was high on the 
agenda of the recent federal, provincial and territorial 
ministers of status of women. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the tragic turn of events in Montreal's École Polytechnique on 
December 6, 1989 galvanized a nation into action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the eight years since, we have collectively pursued a 
multifaceted strategy to end violence. A strategy that is founded on 
acknowledgement, support and prevention. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made some progress.  Gun control legislation was a major 
initiative.  One woman is killed with a firearm every six days in 
a private residence by a family member of close friend. 
Anti-stalking legislation, peace bonds, DNA evidence, denial of 
parole to known sex offenders and an additional $7 million last 
year to the substantial sums spent by different federal 
departments are examples of the initiatives taken.  As well, 
Status of Women Canada fund several holistic and community based 
violence prevention initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The violence against women continues and it is systemic.  I 
applaud the YWCA distribution of the rose button on December 6 to 
promote anti-violence work in our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged by the growing support from the private sector 
on this issue.  I am inspired by the many commemorations across 
this country such as this year' unveiling of the Marker of Change 
Monument in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this national day of remembrance I challenge Canadians to use 
our collective will to make Canada a safer place for our mothers, 
our sisters and our daughters. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the Reform Party I would like to say that 
Saturday, December 6, Canadians across our land will join in the 
National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. 
This day came into being after the senseless murder of 14 young 
women in Montreal's École Polytechnique on December 6, 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that fateful day, efforts have been pursued to deal with 
violence against women but they have been less than successful. 
The violence continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It take many forms, not only physical but also sexual and 
psychological.  What is more, violence affects women but it also 
affects men and it affects children.  In my experience working in 
the emergency department patching up these battered people, I 
cannot help but think how tragic it is that we have not done more 
to prevent the situation from continuing to occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to do this, we have to rethink our position on 
violence.  We need to recognize that violence affects both 
genders.  It affects men and women, the young and the old, the 
rich and the poor.  In other words, violence is a problem of 
society and affects us all, regardless of our gender.  We need 
only remember the tragic situation at Maple Leaf Gardens this 
past year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to implement judicial initiatives to strengthen 
anti-stalking laws, a strong DNA data bank, strengthen penalties 
against violent offenders and keep those who are a danger to 
others in society behind bars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to prevent these tragedies from occurring.  This 
means early intervention and dealing with children in the first 
eight years of life to prevent situations so these people do not 
develop the fractured psyches which lead them to abuse other 
people in heinous ways. 
It is essential that this occur if we are to do justice to the 
memory of the 14 innocent women who died so senselessly in 1989.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to come together to implement initiatives which work. 
Let us make a commitment today to honour the death of those women 
and the deaths, maiming and tragedies of people who are victims 
of violence across this land.  We must act and we must do it 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not forget.  We must not forget.  We must act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, 
I must tell you how profoundly affected I am by these tragic events. Let 
me remind the House that the women we are taking about today are from my 
generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. secretary of state for her poignant statement. It 
is reassuring to see that the government feels concerned. In fact, I 
would like to see the hon. secretary of state rise in this House more 
often to represent the interests of women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the parents and friends of the victims at the École 
Polytechnique and all the other victims of violence to know that, on 
this National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, 
our warmest thoughts are with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This day is more than a day to remember the victims, it is a day of 
action. I urge each and every one of you to talk about violence against 
women, denounce it and help ensure that society will no longer tolerate 
it. There must be zero tolerance for violence against women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague mentioned earlier the progress made in the fight 
against violence. While I agree there has been some progress, much 
remains to be done. Until all women can live in total safety, the fight 
must go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague talked about progress and about the measures 
taken by her government. Yet I do not remember hearing anything about 
concrete measures. 
She mentioned an additional $7 million to fund family violence 
prevention initiatives, but she failed to mention that this amount is 
divided among seven departments. If we make the calculation, we see that 
this is not nearly enough. She mentioned anti-stalking legislation but 
failed to mention that enforcement is lacking and that the judicial 
system does not even have the resources required to deal with these 
cases with sensitivity and efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this to say that there is still a long way to go. Actions to 
oppose violence against women must be taken on a daily basis. More 
importantly, the tragedy of violence transcends not only generations but 
gender. It is no longer incumbent on women and women's groups alone to 
act; all of us, women and men of all generations, must join forces to 
eradicate the scourge of violence against women. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am honoured 
to speak about this measure today.  I remember where I was when 
the Montreal massacre occurred and I remember the devastation I 
felt.  It was the same devastation I felt at the murders of Susan 
Klassen, Miranda Peters and, indeed, week after week, not only 
women but children who were murdered at the hands of those they 
trusted and loved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This speaks to the depth of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The violence we are facing is structural.  It is so deeply 
rooted that, in fact, in our justice system the defence of 
provocation is often used to excuse spousal violence, saying that 
an alleged insult is enough to provoke and excuse an angry murder 
of a wife by her husband. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our government spends $50 million on APEC, inviting 
representatives from countries with gross human rights abuses, 
and only $200,000 to support women's groups or indigenous 
people's groups which fight for human rights and the safety of 
women in their communities, we have a contradiction in what we 
say and what we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is so deeply rooted that in the last week there have 
been three incidents of violence and threats within this very 
House. A member of the Liberal Party challenged a female member 
of the New Democrats to step outside the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want to change the situation, we have to set an 
example here.  We have to set it in our policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our society women face poverty, less pay, physical abuse, 
sexual abuse and even murder, and they face it on a daily basis. 
To change this we must recognize women's massive role in unpaid 
labour and provide solid public pensions for those who stay at 
home to raise their children.  We must recognize that that 
prevents violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need pay equity.  We need to make sure that wealth is fairly 
distributed.

<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the 
member for Yukon has just stated, many Canadians will never 
forget what they were doing on December 6, 1989.  It was a time 
marked with such sorrow and amazement that such a tragic event 
could happen, much less here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members all know, violence against women is all too common, 
but it unfortunately took such a tragedy to open our eyes to its 
extent.  As other members have said in this House, it is truly 
the event that galvanized this country and the government into 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my party, I would like to extend our thoughts and 
our prayers to the families and the victims of the Montreal École 
Polytechnique as well as to all those who are affected by 
violence against women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that we have made progress in the eradication of 
violence against women but so much more needs to be done.  As I 
said in a statement earlier, I do not agree that the current gun 
control legislation will do anything to prevent such a terrible 
crime from happening again. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eliminating violence is an issue of great concern to us all, since 
each woman is someone's daughter, sister or mother. It is somewhat 
appropriate that the three most important women in my life, namely my 
wife and two daughters, are sitting in the gallery today. On their 
behalf, and on behalf of my party, I pledge to work with the government 
to make Canada a safer place for all Canadian women and men.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I

</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the official opposition party, I want to say we 
have attached to this report a dissenting report outlining our 
concerns.  It must be emphasized that the Reform Party of Canada 
in no way wishes to impede the reform and improvement of any 
institution in a federal or provincial sphere.  Rather, we 
encourage and support such efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it has been made abundantly clear through the course of 
the joint other place and House special committee meetings that 
at least one of the minority groups, the Pentecostals, is not in 
favour of having their 1987 constitutionally entrenched minority 
rights extinguished by the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this matter that we find troubling.  We express our 
concerns that it may be precedent setting.  Canada's beginnings 
and its future is due to its wonderful multicultural nature, 
citizens who came to Canada from all over the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minority rights have been entrenched in our constitution to 
reflect Canada's diversity.  Members must carefully consider 
whether this request to extinguish minority rights is the 
beginning of the slippery slope and the beginning of the end of 
minority rights protection.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform the House that I 
will be sharing my time with my colleague from North Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In moving concurrence of the 13th report of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, I want to emphatically 
inform and appeal to backbench members to stand up for their 
rights and duties in bringing forward issues which are of concern 
to their constituents and Canadians across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were asked to revive the mandate of the subcommittee of the 
35th Parliament.  It is instructive to read the motion that 
precipitated that study. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the committee undertake a study of private members' ballot 
items, to determine the possibility of allowing all or more such 
items to become votable, and to study the disposition of private 
members' bills at the committee stage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present committee basically went over the recommendations of 
the previous committee, made some minor changes and submitted the 
report.  At present there are four major hurdles to cross before 
a private members' initiative can finally become law in our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first hurdle is the random draw.  I must admit that due to 
the sheer volume of items submitted, I see no practical way of 
solving this problem beyond extending the number of items which 
can be put on the order of precedence by multiple seconders.  I 
must also add that it is possible that the large volume is due to 
the lottery system.  The more tickets bought, the higher the 
probability of winning.  Perhaps if we were to change it, the 
volume would be decreased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second hurdle is the appeal to the subcommittee to determine 
votability.  This subcommittee currently works on consensus.  In 
my mind it is offensive for a single member in this subcommittee 
to have the power to veto the votability of another hon. member's 
item.  That is how this subcommittee works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over and over when members are discussing their private members' 
business in the House, they ask for unanimous consent to make it 
votable.  Invariably there will be one member in the House who 
will say no, and the unanimous consent is denied.  That one 
member in the House can deny that consent is no less offensive 
than one member of a five member committee also being capable of 
shutting down the initiative of a private member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third hurdle is quite obviously gaining the support of the 
majority of members in the House, including overcoming front 
bench control.  I want to emphasize this, including front bench 
control.  We keep saying that private members' business is a free 
vote.  As a matter of fact, the front bench can control whether 
or not it even comes to the House.  That is where the control 
lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last hurdle is getting the bill back from committee.  We 
have seen numerous occasions where a bill has been killed in 
committee by the tactic of simply not getting around to dealing 
with it.  The committee report addresses some of these hurdles, 
but there is no recommendation regarding the original mandate of 
the committee, namely increasing the number of votable items. 
The primary thing the committee was to do, it did not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also instructive for members to know that when I proposed 
to append a minority report, it was declined by the committee of 
procedure and house affairs.  We are, therefore, providing an 
opportunity for all members on both sides of the House to express 
themselves on this issue. 
I hope that all members will support what is being done here 
today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 35th Parliament in the first session, 505 motions were 
introduced by private members and 12 passed.  That is 2%.  Of the 
266 bills introduced, three received royal assent.  That is 1%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second session of the last Parliament, 355 motions were 
introduced and seven passed.  Again that is 2%.  Of the 344 bills 
introduced, six received royal assent.  Again that is 2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that all private members' business should be votable. 
At minimum, a start would be to arrange for more items to be 
votable.  This could be achieved by a possible combination of 
increasing the amount of time spent each week on private members' 
business and by reducing the amount of debate time on each 
votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In concluding, I wish to draw to the attention of all members 
here that the previous committee solicited written comments from 
all members.  There were 45 replies and the overwhelming message 
from the majority of those addressed the frustration with the 
votability question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is just one quotation from one of those presentations: “It 
is unacceptable that under a strange and archaic House rule, a 
lone MP can bring about the rejection of a broadly supported 
private member's bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should also know that all changes to standing orders, 
including those regarding private members' business, are subject 
to cabinet approval.  Unless backbench members stand together, it 
is likely that there will be no changes and private members' 
business will simply consume a lot of time and effort without a 
significant chance of changing any laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to stand up and be counted on this most 
important democratic issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Elk Island has done an excellent job of articulating 
the frustration that is felt by many and perhaps the majority of 
the members in this place with respect to the handling of private 
members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that is not unique just to this Parliament.  It affects 
parliaments throughout the world.  That frustration is fully 
justified.  It is fully justified not just from the perspective 
of fairness within our own Canadian system, but also by 
comparison with the rules of those other parliaments.  Many of 
them have made changes which do improve the private members' 
business function and the power of private members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read recently an article from the Political Science Department 
at Queen's University which was in the November 1997 edition of 
the publication “Policy Options”.  That article was written by 
Professor C.E.S. Franks.  He wrote that private members are 
weaker in Canada than in most other parliamentary systems, that 
private members are not normally influential in Parliament, but 
that their position can be and should be strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way to strengthen that position and the influence of 
individual members would be to genuinely overhaul the way that 
private members' business is dealt with in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, as the member for Elk Island has explained, the 
13th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs contains little more than a few crumbs of hope for 
meaningful change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A brief scan of all the private members' bills and motions 
presently before the House seems to support the position that at 
least half of all the bills and motions have been drafted by 
individual members in what appears to be a way of recognizing 
lobbying or efforts put in by their constituents to have 
something done about a particular law or situation.  They appear 
to address issues which generally the government refuses to 
acknowledge as a problem or else just simply does not want to put 
on its agenda but which the average Canadian views as quite 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bills and motions introduced to this place in both the previous 
and this Parliament on consecutive sentencing, elimination of 
section 745 of the Criminal Code, grandparent access to children 
of broken marriages, accountability of organizations which 
receive taxpayer funding such as charities, victims rights, are 
all issues and initiatives capable of attracting wide support of 
members and they certainly have the support of the general 
public, the voters and the taxpayers who pay the bill for what we 
do here.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as the member for Elk Island has already 
mentioned, as we all know as private members here, even if an 
individual member is lucky enough to have his or her bill or 
motion drawn in the lottery we still have to overcome tremendous 
hurdles along the way to finally getting royal assent. It is 
virtually impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the lottery occurs and we make a selection among the 
available bills or motions, there is no guarantee that bill or 
motion will even be made votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members are suspicious that the government imposes its 
agenda through the workings of that committee.  One of the 
government's own members during the last Parliament called the 
committee a cockroach committee because she said it meets behind 
closed doors and then it runs away from its decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly true that the committee keeps no minutes and 
gives no reasons for its decisions.  This fact alone is enough to 
encourage suspicion and an atmosphere of discontent and 
irritation among individual members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it need not be so.  Other jurisdictions have either 
made a much greater percentage of private members' bills votable 
or, as in the case of New Zealand, made all private members' 
bills votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The undeniable fact is that having a votable bill or motion 
dramatically increases the satisfaction level for individual 
members even if that vote is subsequently lost.  Almost anyone 
can accept the democratic outcome of a meaningful debate followed 
by a vote.  If the vote goes against the bill, the member can 
accept it, but to have never had the opportunity to have the vote 
in the first place is a devastating situation to occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many different ways in which the present unfairness 
could be addressed, for example making all private members' bills 
and motions fully votable.  Admittedly, this would result in less 
private members' business getting to the floor of the House, but 
most members, perhaps the majority or perhaps all members, would 
be willing to take this trade-off in return for at least having 
the chance to have a votable bill if they do get to the floor of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way of increasing member satisfaction with respect to 
votability might be to have more than one level of votability. 
For example, simple one line motions could perhaps be allocated 
one full hour of debate followed by a vote and referral to some 
sort of committee if the House so wished.  That is one way of 
dealing with simple motions, or perhaps deferring the vote to 
another day when the government has votes planned any way, or if 
the hours of the House could be rearranged so that Private 
Members' Business took place, for example, all day Friday. 
Perhaps more business could be handled that way with most or all 
of the bills made votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further suggestion would be to implement a system which puts 
responsibility on individual members to go out there and get a 
minimum number of signatures in order to be eligible for 
votability.  At least then the competence of the bill or motion 
would be put at question and there would be a chance of getting 
really good quality material to the floor of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any combination of these suggestions or even some others would 
probably work out very well.  In other words, it would only take 
a very little amount of creativity to find a much better way to 
accommodate private members' business within the system.  In the 
end, the government can still prevent a bill or motion from 
receiving royal assent.  So giving us a little satisfaction at 
the time of debate and vote certainly is not losing control as 
far as the government is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all this in mind, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK187">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following:  “the thirteenth 
report be not now concurred in but that it be recommitted to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs with 
instruction that they amend the same so as to recommend that all 
Private Members' Business be votable and appropriate measures be 
taken to ensure an increased amount of time is available in the 
House for such business”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, without getting 
into a debate on the merits of the issue raised by the hon. member, I 
would like to point out to the House that there is a problem concerning 
the process put forward by Reform members on the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue was discussed by the Subcommittee on Private Members' 
Business. While the subcommittee was drafting its report, the member for 
Elk Island made little or no comments. 
When the report of the Subcommittee on Private Members' Business was 
submitted to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, it 
was learned that the member for Elk Island wished to include a minority 
report. This minority report was never even discussed among members of 
the subcommittee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, you can understand the natural and unavoidable reaction 
of the members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, 
who said there was a procedural or technical defect, since the member 
came up with suggestions that he never even bothered to submit to his 
colleagues on the Subcommittee on Private Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should the member for Elk Island be granted the privilege, 
recognized in the Standing Orders of this House, of tabling a dissenting 
report, a dissenting opinion, when that opinion was never brought to the 
attention of the Subcommittee on Private Members Business? If a member 
has to or wants to submit or attach a dissenting report or opinion, he 
must first inform his colleagues of his dissenting opinion. Otherwise, 
as I was saying earlier, there is to all intents and purposes a 
technical defect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we reacted properly, whatever the merits of the no doubt 
quite valid arguments presented by our colleague from Elk Island. 
We took the decision of refusing to attach his dissenting report or 
opinion to the report to be submitted to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I think that our colleague from Elk Island is only adding 
insult to injury when he rises in this House to ask his colleagues to 
accept a dissenting opinion which was rejected by the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs and which was never discussed by the 
Subcommittee on Private Members Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I ask all my colleagues in this House to reject this 
motion, again, independently of the merits of the opinions or 
suggestions expressed by our colleague and of the completely legitimate 
right of any political party in this House to attach a dissenting 
opinion to a committee report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is basically what I had to say. But whatever the motives 
behind the attitude of the member for Elk Island in making these 
suggestions, I disagree with some of the things he is proposing. But 
since I have risen to speak on the form and not the content of his 
proposal, I will stop here and ask my colleagues to vote against this 
motion.

an act for making the system of Canadian ports competitive, 
efficient and commercially oriented, providing for the establishing 
of port authorities and the divesting of certain harbours and 
ports, for the commercialization of the St. Lawrence Seaway and 
ferry services and other matters related to maritime trade and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thought I had miraculously regained 10 minutes, since it 
seemed to me that I had already taken 10 of my allotted 40 minutes. 
I will continue my explanations for the next 30 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just before we stopped for Oral Question Period, I had said 
that I had chosen, in a non-partisan spirit, to list in my speech 
the points of Bill C-9 with which our party is in agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had time to mention, but shall quickly do so again, that 
this bill will provide a high level of autonomy for local port 
authorities. Why did I say that?  I would like to be clear, without 
referring to the directors appointment process, however. I must 
point out, though, that if the decision-making power is brought 
back to the regions, to the port communities, it will be far easier 
to make decisions that will take local and regional needs into 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why our party also supports the abolition of the crown 
corporation known as Ports Canada.  You will recall, Mr. Speaker, 
and I will repeat it because you were perhaps not in the Chair at 
the time, but during a speech at second reading I mentioned that 
the word Ports Canada should be spelled P-o-r-k-s Canada, because 
it was an institution that needed—and since we are into the 
bacon here—to be trimmed of some of its fat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember having Arnold Masters, the president of Ports 
Canada, appear before the committee.  I raked him over the coals on 
the subject of his expense account.  I recall questioning him on 
his activities in Edmonton, where he had rented a room—and you 
represent Edmonton yourself, Mr. Speaker—at the Fantasy Hotel in 
the West Edmonton Mall. 
Apparently the hotel is something else.  This same Arnold Masters— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> A theme room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> My colleague for Berthier—Montcalm is 
proposing a theme room.  Yes indeed, Mr. Masters rented a room 
called the Truck Room.  Do you know what the Truck Room in the 
Fantasy Hotel in the West Edmonton Mall is?  You literally sleep in 
the back of a pickup truck.  They have a king-sized bed in the back 
of a pickup truck.  The room also just happens to have a Jacuzzi 
that will accommodate six.  The rate for this room rented by Mr. 
Masters, the president of Ports Canada, is $280 a night.  I am sure 
this incident is funny when you look at it from a bit of a 
distance.

expense account. How could Mr. Masters, the president of Ports Canada, 
justify renting a room like that at public expense? Ordinary people, the 
taxpayers, were paying for these luxuries. To say nothing of what the 
six-person jacuzzi was used for, but these things are generally not used 
for taking a quiet bath while reading the paper. Whatever the case may 
be, to ask the question is to answer it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could also bring up a certain all-expenses-paid golf tournament 
held by Mr. Masters for users of the port of Montreal and other ports at 
his secondary home in Vermont. The president of Ports Canada did not 
reside in Canada, he had a home in Vermont. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, this bill provides for the dismantling of Ports Canada. Our 
party fully supports this wise decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also states that local port authorities will be required 
to present comprehensive land use plans. I submit that this is also an 
excellent idea, which truly reflects this government's commitment to 
bringing ports closer to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that there is one more thing that we agree with in this 
bill. The bill provides for the establishment of a non-profit 
corporation to manage the St. Lawrence Seaway. 
Again, it is a good decision and I congratulate the minister and the 
parliamentary secretary—the hon. member for Hamilton West—for 
including this provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do have one reservation. Since we are talking about a 
facility and about equipment that we share with the United States, we 
will have to make sure the Americans do their fair share in terms of 
maintaining the St. Lawrence seaway, since they are a primary user of 
this facility. Again, while the legislation provides that the equipment 
and the maintenance work should be shared, we will have to see how this 
is achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is sometimes totally controlled by the United States, even 
though the prime minister may be golfing with the U.S. president, even 
though they may discuss certain issues during the game, while in the 
kart or at the 19th hole, over a stiff scotch. 
So, we will have to be careful. I do not want to sound anti-American, 
but we will have to ensure that the U.S. pays its fair share of the 
maintenance costs for the St. Lawrence seaway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that the government whip, who has a particular 
interest in the St. Lawrence seaway since he represents the city of 
Cornwall, agrees that the Americans must do their fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point on which we agree. Again, I will humbly say 
that I am very pleased that the government accepted to maintain pilotage 
activities in Canada, in spite of the lobbying by shipowners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our subcommittee, which looked at the future of the St. Lawrence 
seaway and Great Lakes network, was chaired by the Liberal member for 
Thunder Bay. 
Our subcommittee met American officials, as the parliamentary secretary 
surely remembers, since he accompanied us on that trip. When the 
subcommittee submitted its report, I was stunned to see a provision 
allowing foreign shipmasters to navigate on our waters without a 
competent pilot on board. This did not make any sense whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A shipmaster from Bahrain, who speaks neither French nor English, 
could navigate on the St. Lawrence, around the northern side of l'île 
d'Orléans, in my riding, without being accompanied by a pilot. You may 
remember that, about two years ago, the <I>Alexita</I>, a ship flying the 
Swedish flag arrived on the St. Lawrence with one and a half million 
barrels of oil on board.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had followed the recommendations of the Liberal majority 
on this subcommittee, this vessel would have been allowed in 
without a qualified pilot on board.  I am not an extremist when it 
comes to the environment but I think I always kept asking if we 
could afford an <I>Exxon Valdez</I> in the Montmagny archipelago, on the 
shores of Cap-Tourmente in my riding or of île d'Orléans, or across 
from Quebec City.  Can we afford an <I>Exxon Valdez</I>? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argued in favour of keeping mandatory pilotage by our 
experienced francophone pilots in the case of Quebec and the Lower 
St. Lawrence. 
Once again, partisanship aside, I thank the government for 
listening to the Bloc Quebecois' arguments and keeping pilotage 
mandatory in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second part of my speech, I would like to talk about 
the parts of this bill with which we are not in agreement.  First, 
we know that this bill provides for the divestiture of ports by the 
federal government.  In other words, the federal government is 
getting out of daily administration and giving local port 
authorities more autonomy.  I said that, as far as the increase in 
autonomy was concerned, there is no problem.  But while the federal 
government is handing ports over, it still controls the appointment 
of directors.  Of course, we cannot agree with the fact that the 
minister will continue to appoint a large number of directors to 
port authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have used exactly the same process as it 
did with the privatization of airports.  It can certainly appoint 
one or two representatives, but not a large number, and continue 
to maintain control.  Appointments to the boards of directors of 
local port authorities represent a wonderful patronage 
opportunity.  I could mention that, in the port of Quebec City, 
right after the October 25, 1993 election, we saw people who had 
been appointed by the Conservatives literally kicked out and 
replaced by René Paquette, for one, who is the president of the 
board of directors for the port of Quebec City, and a known 
Liberal organizer.  There was the Liberal candidate in the 1993 
election, Margo Brousseau, who was defeated by my former 
colleague, the member for Louis-Hébert, Philippe Paré.  No sooner 
was the election over than there was a little political 
appointment to the port of Quebec City board of directors. 
So I think that the government could have been much more transparent and 
let the ports appoint their own representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention another matter that we do not agree with. 
Since I dealt with this issue at the committee stage, I did not raise it 
at third reading nor at the report stage, but we should have required 
better qualifications for these directors, other than simply require 
that they be card-carrying members of the party in power. We should have 
required board members to have recognized skills in certain areas. It 
was in that context that I stated that since one of the objectives of 
this act is to provide for a high level of environmental protection, it 
would be appropriate to have people with qualifications in that area as 
directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, representatives from chambers of commerce or the 
tourist industry could be very helpful, for example in developing the 
market for cruises in Quebec City, and the requirement to have extensive 
experience in port operations could limit access to such resources. In 
addition, experience in land use management should be an acceptable 
qualification when the integration of a port to its community involves 
critical elements, as is the case in the Quebec City area. Therefore, we 
should have provided for a wider range of professional qualifications 
required to sit on the board of a local port authority.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we disagree with is the fact that the $125 million 
port improvement fund for all of Canada announced by the minister and 
confirmed by the committee is, in my humble opinion and that of my 
party, clearly insufficient. We know that many ports need extensive 
renovation work, and I do not think we will go very far with $125 
million. In fact, this amount could be spent on the port of Quebec 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that when Jean Pelletier, the Prime Minister's 
current chief of staff, was running in the 1993 election as the Liberal 
candidate in the riding of Quebec, he met the board of administration of 
the port of Quebec with his team of candidates. 
He said “If we Liberals are elected in 1993, we will give you at least 
$125 million to rebuild your facilities which, in some places, are 
literally falling apart”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals won the election, but Mr. Pelletier was not elected 
and we never heard anything more about the improvement fund for the port 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, we submit that $125 million for all of Canada is 
clearly insufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this bill contains no provisions preventing the 
government from dipping into any accumulated surplus. Under the 
Conservatives, we saw the example of the port of Quebec, and this 
happened also in Trois-Rivières and in Montreal. The port of Quebec had 
$33 million in its coffers as a result of good management. 
So the Conservative government then in power, led by the President of 
the Treasury Board, Gilles Loiselle, dipped into that fund twice: they 
took $23 million the first time, and $10 million the second time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So here we have an example of a crown corporation that was 
penalized because of its good management. This $33 million alone, 
invested at 10% interest, was sufficient for the normal operation of the 
port of Quebec, a $3.3 million expenditure. It was not necessary to ask 
the government for new money. They came and took it away; it went up in 
smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill contains no provision to ensure that money will not be 
taken away like that when there are economic downturns in the future. We 
hope this does not happen, but we should be ready if it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another matter, and this is the issue we raise in Motion 
No. 2 we tabled at the report stage. The limits of the port remain a 
contentious issue. 
We would have liked to see it made possible when the bill was 
passed to exclude certain parts of ports from port operations.  You 
know very well that I was referring to the perimeter of Beauport 
Bay, which is a recreational and tourism site for the Quebec City 
region and, unfortunately, within the limits of the port of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One never knows when the Beauport people could get a message from 
the Quebec Port Corporation telling them “Move your stuff.  We are 
bringing in the bulldozers and making a pier longer, because we 
have got a contract with a container company”.  That is worrisome 
and I would have liked to have seen the government accept our 
amendment to Motion No. 2.  Unfortunately, that did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last safeguard left to me is the drafting of the letters 
patent. 
I trust that the government will be able to lend an ear to a region 
such as the Quebec City region and ensure that Beauport Bay can 
receive long-term assurance that it will be able to continue 
recreational and tourist activities for the benefit of the entire 
greater Quebec City region.  The only hope I have for this is when 
they draw up the letters patent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point of disagreement, we would have liked to see each 
municipality bordering on the port able to designate a 
representative.  My colleague from the Reform Party said during 
second reading yesterday “Yes, but then if there are 12 
municipalities there will be 12 representatives, and the boards of 
directors will end up with 20 or 25 members on them”. In that 
connection, I would have been prepared, if the government had shown 
any openness about it, to support a maximum number for municipal 
representatives. 
We know how that will work.  A representative of the biggest 
municipality will sit on the board, and so its interests will be 
heard.  The other municipalities with less port area within their 
limits will have no voice.  They will have to appeal to the bigger 
municipality in order to be heard.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we are not talking about fairness.  They should have 
planned to have more than one municipality act as a director for 
local port authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point is really important.  I think the government made 
a serious mistake in rejecting our amendment yesterday at second 
reading, report stage.  It would have enabled the employees of 
the new local port authorities and of the St. Lawrence 
seaway—the government neglected to do this—to participate in 
the pension plan of the Canadian public service known as 
superannuation. 
I consider this to be an arm-twisting contest between the Treasury Board 
and the Department of Transport. As you might suspect, we are hearing 
from public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listening to me, the thought may cross your mind that I am on a 
witch hunt and making things up because I am a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois. Let me just tell you that I am not making anything up. I know 
for a fact that there was a power struggle between Treasury Board and 
Transport Canada officials. While Transport Canada wanted its employees 
in the new corporations to continue to participate in the pension plan, 
the order came—I cannot say whether it came directly from the 
President of the Treasury Board or from Treasury Board secretary Peter 
Harder—to object to their continue participation, that these 
employees will have to leave the public service pension plan et buy into 
another one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said yesterday, I do not need to be an actuary to know full 
well that it costs more to maintain a pension plan for a small group of 
575 employees—and I encourage St. Lawrence seaway employees to go to 
their MP, the hon. member for Stormont—Dundas and government whip, and 
tell him this—than to be covered under the large public service of 
Canada plan. The actuarial cost is different. It does not take a degree 
in actuarial science to understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that, in the long run, the bargaining power of these 
small groups of employees will be affected. 
I know that when the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of 
Transport rises to speak in a little while and replies, as it 
were, to my speech, he is going to say that the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans is an alarmist, that he is on a 
witch hunt, that Motion No. 21 represents an undertaking that 
each of the port authorities may have a comparable pension plan. 
What is he afraid of?  Comparable, yes, but at what cost?  I 
would like the government to prove to us that it will cost 
exactly the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the committee should invite some actuaries in to 
explain to the government that the benefits of a small group 
pension plan are not comparable.  The issue is not the benefits, 
but buying a pension plan for a small group does not cost the same 
as buying one for a group of 200,000 to 300,000 employees, as 
provided under the Public Service Superannuation Act. 
That is why I say that, in the long term, the bargaining power of 
port employees and St. Lawrence seaway workers will be affected by 
this decision and I humbly submit that, even though the amendment 
passed yesterday by the government because of its majority 
addressed comparability, it does not pass the test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I think I have had an opportunity to express my 
views.  I thank all members for their attention.  I thank the 
government whip for maintaining discipline on his side.  I do not 
want to start another debate, but it is obvious that the government 
has a good whip who has and who deserves respect.  I do not know if 
it helps him to be praised by a member of the Bloc Quebecois but I 
just want to show that I am not an extreme partisan.  I think I am 
able to admit certain things, as you have seen from my speech.

</I></B></P><P align=left>You will read this in the airplane, Mr. Speaker, on your way 
back to Edmonton.  You will see how I approached my speech.  I 
looked at points of agreement and points of disagreement, but for 
all these reasons, I must unfortunately tell you that our party 
will have to vote against this bill at third reading. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on behalf of the New 
Democratic Party caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time available I will focus on five areas of concern that 
we have with respect to Bill C-9.  The number one issue is the 
loss of a nationally integrated and coherent port and 
transportation system.  We are also concerned about the policing 
of the new ports, the privatization of them, the funding and 
capital expenditures required, and the superannuation plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I deal with those areas, however, I was interested in the 
earlier comments of the Minister of Transport today when he 
addressed the Chamber on Bill C-9.  He acknowledged the help 
members of the standing committee had been in this area. Then I 
heard the member for Cypress Hills—Grassland lamenting that none 
of the opposition amendments had been accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to that statement I was going to encourage the minister 
responsible for transportation to have a word with his colleague, 
the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, because we 
certainly had that kind of treatment when that bill was before 
the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new member of the House I agree with the member for Cypress 
Hills—Grassland that committees to date have been a joke. I 
encourage members on the government side to see if we could not 
make them more meaningful in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party is opposed to Bill C-9 for different 
reasons.  I take the opportunity today to raise some of the 
concerns we have with the marine act.  As I indicated, I want to 
turn first to the nationally integrated and coherent port and 
transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern is that Bill C-9 will create a patchwork of 
privately run ports.  With new mandates oriented to financial 
self-sufficiency, it is unlikely these ports will form an 
integral part of a coherent national strategy for meeting our 
transportation and regional development needs.  Instead we will 
have a set of local activities unlinked to a national vision or 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members of the House of what the member for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre was saying on this subject earlier 
this week.  Canada is the only country in the OECD that seems not 
to have a national transportation vision for the near future. 
Ultimately the proposed privatization will have negative 
implications for many people presently working in the port system 
and the maritime industry generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite assurances from the government about job security it 
seems likely that as a new strictly commercial oriented 
management approach is brought in, jobs will be lost within the 
longshore and among the administrative workers who presently work 
within the Canada Ports Corporation.  We see similar examples 
with the alternate service delivery in the military, this rush to 
privatization the government is exhibiting time after time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is evidence from numerous other sectors that short term 
financial considerations will inevitably prevail over the 
preservation of jobs and the maintenance of fair working 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As productivity and throughput considerations become more 
dominant the question is who will look out for the welfare of the 
staff remaining in the service of the ports organization.  Cuts 
to any workforce inevitably place additional pressures on the 
remaining staff.  The added stress this creates is often 
reflected in increasing numbers of industrial accidents.  There 
is nothing in the legislation to address this potential problem 
and concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the item of policing of the new ports, the proposal to remove 
the port police from the newly created entity seems to us to be 
a most unwise step.  Private security firms are not peace 
officers and traditionally do not enjoy the same range of powers 
enjoyed by the police.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is likely that drug smuggling, which is already a significant 
problem and growing, will not be curtailed in any way and could 
well increase as a result of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I want to remind the House of what the president of the 
Canadian Police Association was quoted as saying earlier this 
year.  Neal Jessop said that abolishing Canada's port police will 
open the floodgates to the smuggling of drugs, guns and other 
contraband by organized crime.  What passes through the ports, 
Mr. Jessop said, will end up on the streets of our towns and 
cities coast to coast to coast.  What he did not add but which 
needs to be added is that will incur additional policing costs 
and personal tragedies as a result of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's privatization of our national ports and 
disbanding Canada Ports police will be a serious blow to the 
fight against organized crime in this country.  This government's 
actions have resulted, we think, in a serious setback in the 
efforts to control and stop organized crime activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a well known fact in the law enforcement community that 
organized crime and gang activity are thriving in our ports.  The 
result of the federal government's disbanding of the ports police 
and privatization will open the doors for an increase in the 
destructive activities, as I noted, drug trafficking, weapons 
trafficking, auto theft and liquor and tobacco smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Ports police was created almost 30 years ago in 1968 
and represented a highly specialized and dedicated police force 
with skills and powers specifically designed to combat organized 
crime, smuggling and gang activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other jurisdictions, the United States being one example but 
there are many others, have experimented with similar 
privatization schemes for their ports and have had to re-evaluate 
their actions in the face of increases in criminal activities in 
those other countries and to reinstate specialized port police 
and take back control of the ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note that with this bill Canada is going in a very different 
and, we would submit, wrong headed direction in this regard.  It 
is noteworthy that numerous case files and ongoing investigations 
into organized crime and gang activities were either halted or 
compromised with the removal of the Canada Ports police from the 
Vancouver port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the opposite coast, the Atlantic coast, in a few weeks the 
Halifax port police will be disbanded and we are sure that 
organized crime is waiting and marking the days on its calendar 
until that disbandment occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, with the privatization of our national ports, 
this government is putting out the welcome sign for gangs and 
organized crime and putting our communities and citizens at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the privatization of ports consistent with the 
withdrawal of federal presence from other matters of concern to 
coastal residents, the privatization fits into an ongoing pattern 
where we are seeing this government withdraw from a host of 
activities and functions vital to the well-being of communities 
and here we are concerned about coastal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cutbacks to the coast guard, search and rescue capacity, the 
automation of lighthouses were the forerunner and backdrop to the 
port privatization.  There are estimated to be approximately 500 
public ports and harbours in Canada and it is safe to assume that 
communities with ports smaller than those of Vancouver, Halifax 
and Montreal will feel the brunt of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that needs to be asked is why is the Liberal 
government turning its back on the legitimate needs of our 
smaller coastal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dealing with funding and capital expenditures, the bill fails 
to provide for the capital financing required to construct new 
port facilities at some future date.  The submission of the 
Halifax Port Development Commission is highly instructive on this 
point and worth quoting: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funding needed for construction of major port facilities can 
only be arranged in part, if at all, in the private sector.  No 
private sector lender or investor can advance the bulk of such 
funding against user commitments which may or may not materialize 
when the facilities are completed, and if they do not 
materialize, may or may not continue until the funding has been 
repaid.  Under such a scenario, funding can only come from 
governments which have the necessary financial resources and can 
justify, in the interests of promoting the economy of their 
constituents, the assumption of the attendant commercial risk. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had Bill C-9 been in effect in the late 1960s, Halifax would 
never have been able to build and equip even one container berth 
and the harbour would long ago have fallen into disuse.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Should these ports be privatized, will they be required to 
disclose their capital expenditure plans for local community 
input and review?  The kind of secrecy that normally shrouds the 
investment activities of private companies must not be allowed to 
prevail within the ports where a range of public groups has a 
vital stake in the financial posture of them.  Why has the 
government not chosen to make mandated public disclosure of 
financial plans a precondition for the transfer of the ports into 
the private sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to turn now to superannuation because the first version 
of this bill did not include the continuance of the pension plan 
for ports employees once the port is transferred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus brought forward an amendment at committee stage which 
called for the continuance of the superannuation.  The ports 
employees have belonged to that system for decades now and they 
have been devoted to achieving the success which the ports have 
had over the years.  It would be most unfair for these employees 
to lose their pension benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those employees who planned their retirement based on that plan 
should have had the opportunity to continue with the plan. 
However, unfortunately our motion was defeated.  A member of the 
Bloc introduced a similar motion at report stage, one which we 
were pleased to support, but again it was defeated.  Then the 
Liberals introduced a motion for comparable employee benefits. 
Naturally it passed.  It is certainly better than nothing, but we 
wanted it to go further, as did the Bloc, to protect employee 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the major concerns we have with the bill, the failure 
of the nationally integrated and coherent port, the policing 
aspect of the new ports, the privatization of them, the concern 
about funding and capital expenditure, and the superannuation 
plan for long service employees at the ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the deficiencies which we find in the bill, we 
will be voting against it.  We believe that Canada needs a 
nationally integrated transportation system and it will not be 
possible with privatized ports.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the process of going through the Canada marine act and the 
changes which will come about as a result of Bill C-9 has been 
very interesting.  I have really enjoyed it.  It was a little 
short for me because in the last Parliament the same bill was 
studied for three years.  Our deliberations lasted only a few 
weeks.  I am sorry it was only a few weeks because we did not 
have the chance to hear all the people we would have liked to 
hear. Nevertheless it was an interesting process.  It was very 
refreshing for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to support the bill in principle although, like all 
bills, it is not perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four major parts of the bill.  First, it designates 
all ports into one of three categories.  Second, it addresses new 
management for the St. Lawrence Seaway, which will have a huge 
impact.  Third, it will change piloting.  There are minimal 
changes to piloting, but not nearly enough.  Fourth, it will 
eliminate port police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to port designations, all ports in Canada will have 
one of three designations.  One of the designations will be for 
viable ports.  These are the ports which make a profit.  They can 
stand on their own two feet and are able to survive.  They are 
put into one category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are regional ports.  They are not viable, by 
definition.  They are to be divested by the federal government 
and turned over to user groups, the province, municipalities or 
whomever.  It is a very interesting approach because there is no 
formula for this category.  They will all be negotiated 
separately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third designation is for remote ports, for which the federal 
government maintains responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our biggest concern with the bill is the designation of regional 
ports.  They will face an awful lot of problems.  Examples of 
these ports are Pugwash, Parrsboro, and Shelburne in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shelburne, for instance, suffered through the collapse of the 
fishery.  Its people are making extremely effective efforts to 
replace the fishery to make their port viable.  When I called the 
mayor of Shelburne, Mayor Comeau, he was in Massachusetts trying 
to arrange for a ferry between Massachusetts and Shelburne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have also arranged to bring cruise lines to Shelburne. 
They have come up with a lot of different commercial uses for the 
port.  However, it is not enough to make the port viable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are going to need some help through this change from the 
present structure where they are owned by the federal government 
to being a regional port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I went to see the mayor of Parrsboro to see how the changes 
were going to affect his port, he did not know anything about the 
changes.  He did not even know that there was a process.  He had 
never even heard of the Canada marine act. They are going to be 
faced with a lot of decisions and I am going to help them through 
those decision as much as I can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pugwash is another port in my riding.  It is going through the 
process right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As helpful as Department of Transport people are, the ports, the 
communities and the people involved do not understand the 
process.  I hope that the government will take the time as this 
process unfolds and impacts on communities, that it will take 
the time to help people and help the communities establish the 
proper set-up.  A wrong decision now could cause huge grief in the 
future.  There are funds— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Excuse me.  Before 
the Chair recognizes the hon. chief government whip, I would like 
to acknowledge that the Chair neglected to ask for questions and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there have been consultations among all parties and there has 
been a tremendous amount of co-operation to facilitate the end of

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the consent of the House not to see the clock and 
I move: 
<A NAME="LINK207">&nbsp;</A>

</I></B></P><P align=left>That at the conclusion of today's debate on third reading of 
Bill C-9, but no later than 2 p.m., all questions necessary to

recorded division requested and deferred until Tuesday, December 
9, 1997 at the expiry of Government Orders. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that would allow the member for Cumberland—Colchester

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois member for Terrebonne—Blainville will speak for 
a few minutes. The parliamentary secretary will then say a few words, 
and this will conclude debate at third reading. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Continuing debate, 
the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that.  Is there 
anyone else who wants to interrupt me?  I do not want to miss 
anybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will continue on and I will be brief. Our main 
concern with this whole bill is the fact that regional ports were 
not allowed to make presentations at committee.  They are going 
to be the ones that are most impacted by these decisions and most 
of them have no idea of what is going to happen.  I hope that we, 
as members, will help them through this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is going to have a profound effect on many of these ports.  I 
mentioned Shelburne. The hon. parliamentary secretary has agreed 
to meet with me and officials from Shelburne and also the member 
for South Shore to discuss Shelburne and to make sure they can 
take advantage of any programs available through that transition. 
I make that offer to any port, any community that will be 
impacted by this legislation to contact us and we will help them 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several problems we see with the bill have been mentioned by 
previous speakers.  One is that ports police have been 
eliminated.  It is not so much that they have been eliminated but 
there has been no strategic plan to replace them and no strategic 
plan to look after the people who are involved.  Again, these are 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Saint John who spoke very eloquently on this 
issue on behalf of the ports police and defended their position 
is not here today.  I would like to recognize her efforts on that 
because she is an untiring spokesperson for people who have a 
problem no matter what it is.  The ports police were going 
through a tough time and she did everything she could to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the piloting regulations, it is, as I heard other speaker say 
earlier, a closed shop.  There is not competition.  It is very 
tightly controlled.  It completely contradicts the rest of the 
bill which is to make the process more efficient, more 
commercialized, free it up, local decisions, but still the 
pilotage problem exists.  It is a very closed shop and there is 
no competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is superannuation for the employees who are 
affected.  Under these legislation we put an amendment forth, as 
other members did, asking for superannuation to be extended to 
employees who lost their jobs and who had always had 
superannuation benefits. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT45"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT45"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1345

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government made a commitment to provide that extension in 
some kind of bridge process.  However, when the amendment was 
presented, it was only for the viable ports people who were going 
to Canada ports authorities. Again, the regional ports people 
have no superannuation benefits.  We will still be pushing for 
that and hope the hon. members, the hon. minister and 
parliamentary secretary will help us with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment we had put in was to put the port of Hamilton 
back on the same playing field with every other port in Canada. 
Although our amendment was retracted, another amendment came 
right back in again from the government side and addressed the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the third time I say that our biggest concern is the impact 
on regional ports which by definition are not viable. The 
government has said, “These ports are not viable any more, 
therefore we do not want to have anything to do with them any 
more.  We will turn them over to the user groups.  We will turn 
them over to the municipalities or to the provinces”.  It will 
have a big impact on small ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we are going to support the Canada Marine Act.  I am 
pleased to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to compliment the staff of Transport Canada who 
have done a fantastic job in negotiating the agreements that have 
already been negotiated with the ports. I am truly awed by their 
ability.  They have made profound changes in communities. They 
have been able to work with communities, work with the 
governments and the local people and have done a great job at 
having transferred these over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our part as a Conservative caucus will be to help those regional 
ports change.  Of those ports that I contacted, some knew nothing 
about this legislation.  They knew nothing about what was 
happening to them.  Some misunderstood the process completely. 
Some had it in reverse.  Some were resigned to the change, but 
did not know they could access assistance programs from the 
government to help them over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Conservative Party members I would like to 
extend an invitation to any port that has a problem, that does 
not understand the process, that does not understand the details 
or how to access programs, to contact us.  We will be glad to 
help them through the system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government recently privatized three facilities in the transportation 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it was the Montreal airports, which are now managed by ADM, 
Administration des aéroports de Montréal, with the federal government 
keeping ownership of the facilities. Then, it was the ground facilities 
for air navigation, the management of which was transferred to Nav 
Canada, a corporation established for this purpose. This time, ownership 
of the facilities was also transferred. Now, the purpose of Bill C-9 is 
to transfer the management of marine ports to private organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would really appreciate it if members opposite 
would listen. I guess my request is not being accepted. I will 
carry on nevertheless. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member has 
requested that we have the courtesy to pay attention to his 
remarks. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will begin with ADMr. In ADM's 
case, the board of directors' seven members are appointed by regional 
organizations, and the government is not represented at all. These seven 
members make up the board of directors and they hold all the powers. ADM 
is a totally independent organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Nav Canada, it is an organization which, unlike ADM, also 
has ownership of the facilities, but I will not discuss this aspect 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the ports affected by Bill C-9 will have a board of 
directors made up of seven to eleven members, including one appointed by 
the province and one appointed by the municipalities. The other members, 
anywhere from five to nine of them, will be appointed by the government, 
in consultation—but in consultation only—with users.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to compare the structure given ADM and the 
structure given to seaports. The similarity of airports and seaports, 
over which Ottawa retains ownership, is obvious and one must wonder why 
there is such a difference in the level of autonomy given ADM, which is 
total, and that given ports, which is very limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was ADM given so much power? Why was ADM given complete 
autonomy when seaports are not getting any? I think I know why. Montreal 
airports were a hot potato. 
Mirabel was created by a Liberal government; so now we had two airports 
and no road or rail link between Mirabel and Montreal; having two 
airports was bad for competitiveness and one had to be shut down. Air 
Canada was lobbying to have Mirabel closed down. However, this was a hot 
potato the government did not want to handle. I suggest that this is the 
reason why ADM was given so much power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa wanted to wash its hands of the surgery that had to be 
performed to move international flights from an airport developed to the 
tune of billions of dollars to accommodate international flights. This 
is exactly what it did. Every single question I have asked in this House 
regarding Mirabel have been met by the same answer from the transport 
minister of the day “ADM is in charge”. In other words, the Minister of 
Transports, just like Pontius Pilate, is washing his hands of the whole 
Mirabel mess. 
This is the easy way out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I say once again that when it comes to this government 
there is a world of difference between political logic and plain logic. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Resuming debate by 
previous agreement, the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Transport. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was in the fall of 1994 
that Transport Canada embarked on this voyage to change Canadian 
marine policy. Now today, just over three years later, it is my 
hope that the House of Commons will pass Bill C-9, the Canada 
Marine Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the ministers of transport both present and past, 
members of the Standing Committee on Transport both present and 
past, and literally hundreds of people in industry, labour and 
ports to acknowledge and thank for their continued support and 
contribution to the development of this policy. However, I would 
like to recognize the personal efforts of the current Minister of 
Transport, the Deputy Minister of Transport, Margaret Bloodworth, 
and the Assistant Deputy Minister of Transport, Policy, Louis 
Ranger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thinking back a couple of years, I would like to single out the 
former Deputy Minister of Transport, Mr. Nick Mulder who had the 
courage to embark on these changes to marine legislation and then 
cleverly move on to life's challenges beyond government 
bureaucracy and leave all the tough sledding to others.  It was 
Nick Mulder who hired Mr. Neil MacNeil who stuck with the marine 
policy development from the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neil MacNeil, now President of Canada Ports Corporation, and 
David Cuthbertson, now the Executive Vice-President of Canada 
Ports Corporation have been instrumental in developing the 
consensus with industry and communities to see these changes 
through.  They are now responsible for closing down Canada Ports 
Corporation and establishing the new Canada port authorities. I 
know I speak for the ports and the users when I congratulate Neil 
and David for their achievements and thank them for their 
contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak for a couple of minutes because I realize we have 
to see the clock at two o'clock for the end of debate on Bill C-9 
and I want to give a couple of minutes to my colleague from 
Wentworth—Burlington who has been waiting patiently to say a few 
words as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition members may think we were short on our 
deliberations in committee. I want to remind them that it was the 
decision of the committee, and some of the opposition members 
voted with the government to not hear the witnesses again.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the witnesses themselves, the communities, the 
corporations, the port operators, the users, the shareholders, 
the stakeholders who came forward and said, “Look, you guys have 
been to our communities twice now. The committee has been here on 
the marine policy development.  The officials were here on the 
heels of that policy development and then the transport committee 
was here again. We gave three speeches to you.  You know what we 
need and you know what we want”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of all that consultation, a year and a half of 
consultations, we came up with Bill C-44, and the exact same bill 
has been brought forward to the House as Bill C-9.  So the 
consultation did take place.  It was thorough and quite frankly, 
everything that was achieved in consultations on Bill C-44 was 
the result of compromise and hard work by all of the players 
involved in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all the years of extensive consultations with the 
shippers, the carriers and other levels of government we did find 
widespread support in the marine community. That is why we have 
reintroduced the bill, because we know that the community 
supports it and wants to see the bill enacted as soon as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the passage of this legislation we will see a 
stronger, more efficient marine sector that will improve Canada's 
international trade performance. That means more economic growth 
and jobs for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, to leave a couple of minutes for my colleague, I 
want to thank everyone who was involved with the bill.  We have 
done it again.  It is my hope after our vote on Tuesday when the 
bill is in the hands of the Senate that the Senate will also see 
fit to recognize the request of the marine users and give speedy 
passage to Bill C-9. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to have a few minutes to speak on Bill C-9.  I 
would like to draw the attention of the House and the Canadian 
public to two major innovations in Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is a giant step forward in developing accountability 
in arm's length institutions of government.  The mechanisms of 
accountability in these new port authorities far exceed anything 
that existed with the harbour commissions and indeed with respect 
to many other types of organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I feel that the bill represents a reform in attitude of 
governments of the past and this government toward political 
patronage.  Instead of harbour commissioners who were appointed 
indirectly by a regional minister, there is now a system of 
directors appointed to port authorities will all kinds of checks 
and balances to make sure that these appointees of the crown 
conduct themselves in a responsible manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the old way of appointing harbour commissioners in my 
region there was one city appointee and two federal appointees. 
Under the new system the port authority in the city of Hamilton 
will have a federal appointee, a provincial appointee, a city or 
municipality appointee, and four appointees recommended by users 
in the area. The minister will listen to the users in the area 
who will name certain individuals who have competence in the 
field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill explains at great length what type of competence is 
required of the people who are to become directors of the port 
authority.  This is a huge step forward.  It separates the 
directors of the port authority from political influence.  This 
is hugely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret to say that in the history of harbour commissions 
across the country there have been too many instances where 
harbour commissioners have felt vulnerable or have come under the 
influence of area politicians. This bill changes that.  It is an 
enormous step forward.  It has a code of conduct.  It requires 
annual meetings, financial reports, public accountability in 
large scale.  I think all sides of the House, including the Bloc 
Quebecois should support this bill. I think the Canadian public 
will as well.

sanctions.  These recommendations resulted from the 
commissioners' investigations which were prompted by the Krever 
commission and the Somalia inquiry where the issue of document 
tampering and record destruction was raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commissioner John Grace states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These lamentable incidents of wilful actions taken by public 
officials for the purpose of suppressing information have been a 
wake-up call.  As recommended in last year's annual report, there 
should be a specific offence in the access act for acts of 
omissions intended to thwart the rights set out in the law. 
Moreover, those who commit this offence should be subject to 
greater sanctions than exposure of wrongdoing.  At a minimum, the 
offence should carry a penalty of up to five years in prison. 
Such a penalty is in line with that imposed in section 122 of the 
Criminal Code for breach of trust by a public officer.  The 
stakes are too high for a slap on the wrist. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the intent of this bill to provide the very sanctions that 
Mr. Grace has recommended.  Currently section 67 of the act 
states that no person shall obstruct the Information Commissioner 
or any person acting on behalf or under the direction of the 
Commissioner in the performance of the Commissioner's duties and 
function under this act.  Every person who contravenes this 
section is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction 
to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not been able to find any instance in which this penalty 
has ever been imposed.  It is up to this Parliament to put teeth 
into this law.  Measures to ensure responsibility and 
accountability must become part of the act.  We must send a 
strong message that these acts of destruction will not go 
unpunished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-208 adds to the existing offences of the access act under 
section 67 by calling for an up to $10,000 fine and/or up to a 
five-year jail sentence for persons destroying, mutilating, 
altering or falsifying records or not keeping “required 
records”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is accountability, the accountability of members 
of Parliament.  Without access to the truth, how can we be 
accountable to our constituents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I ran to represent my constituents, I campaigned for a more 
open and transparent government.  I promised that my minimal duty 
would be supplying them with the truth on government issues which 
troubled them.  I had no idea that the problem with document 
tampering had become so widespread. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ken Rubin, a dedicated Canadian who is well known as an advocate 
of public interest issues in Canada and to whom I am indebted for 
sharing his research with me, cites many examples of this abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most dramatic example of this occurred with the 1989 
destruction of the Canadian blood committee records.  It was only 
with the release of the Information Commissioner's report in 
January 1997 that Mr. Rubin learned that his first of several 
requests in the fall of 1987 for records related to private blood 
banks along with requests from a <I>Globe and Mail</I> reporter 
for information on the safety of Canada's blood supply had been 
the initial spark that had unfortunately led Health Canada to 
destroy the Canadian blood committee's records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Krever inquiry final report helps put the CBC record 
destruction episode in perspective.  The real victims were those 
inflicted with tainted blood infusions, condemned in many cases 
to die and who could not have access to the crucial transcripts 
of the Canadian blood committee meetings to know why action had 
not been taken quickly enough to save them from infection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an access requester filing numerous requests on the 1993 
Canadian forces event in Somalia on the aftermath, Mr. Rubin 
became aware of the attempted record destruction of national 
defence transitory response to media inquiries and the deceptive 
alteration of those records into shorter media response lines in 
order to respond to the requests of the CBC reporter.  This other 
well known incident of record tampering is documented in the 
Somalia inquiry commission 1997 report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other examples of record abuse that stand out.  Right 
from the start problems with the access act began to surface. 
Upon the act's proclamation in 1983, Mr. Rubin and a 
<I>Kitchener-Waterloo Record</I> reporter fought for five years, 
all the way to the Federal Court of Appeal in 1989, for the right 
to obtain Agriculture Canada's meat inspection reports reviewing 
how safe various meat packing establishments were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after finally winning fuller access to inspection 
reports, Agriculture Canada and the meat packers then agreed to 
alter these reports, taking out inspectors' valuable written and 
often critical observations, leaving in only a check-off sheet 
with different boxes on matters like hygiene and sanitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet there is another example.  In 1984 after winning the right 
to see the minutes of the Atomic Energy Control Board meetings 
from 1975 to 1982, which were requested for use in a series of 
news stories on matters discussing nuclear safety problems at the 
board, the AECB immediately cut down on what was recorded at its 
board meeting discussions, thus greatly sanitizing what was 
really publicly thereafter their board summary record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is yet another example.  On March 9, 1989 a Health Canada 
official who is still with the department had ordered a scientist 
employed under him to “please destroy all copies of”.  He was 
referring to the draft copy of his critical report before 
continuing to gather records for responding to Mr. Rubin's 
request on the safety of the Meme breast implants.  The original 
draft report had been done after reviewing reports and contact 
with Meme breast patients, manufacturers and experts. 
The memo was critical of the department's lack of moratorium 
action against further use of this medical device and stated that 
such implants were “unfit for human implantation”.  We have 
seen the result of that cover-up.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have another one.  Transport Canada, on April 13, 1993, 
finally located a key briefing memo dated August 11, 1991 from 
the head of the safety review team doing an August 1991 
post-accident review on Nationair.  The review was done after the 
disastrous July 1991 crash of a DC-8 Nationair charter plane.  It 
was about the past safety deficiencies of Nationair airline 
operations.  A partially released memo that went missing for so 
long found there were matters the review uncovered of “extreme 
concern”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The memo had been, according to Transport Canada, unfortunately 
overlooked despite a very specific request in September 1991 for 
this report, right down to naming the official who wrote it and 
stating accurately that he had done the memo on his computer at 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada also conducted dozens of air safety surveys in 
confidence with airlines.  Many were done between 1990 and 1994. 
However, when Mr. Rubin discovered their existence and applied 
for them, Transport Canada indicated that it had never even 
bothered to retain a copy of its own report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After pursuing the matter, Transport Canada grudgingly, without 
the benefit of certifying the truthfulness of the responses, 
asked the airline companies that were given the reports for them 
back.  The airline companies' response in those cases was that 
the copies they had received had already been destroyed or were 
missing.  The few reports retrieved are still secret and the 
subject of a Federal Court action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, when Mr. Rubin sought in 1989 projections by CIDA on the 
effects of the earlier announced financial cutbacks on a project 
by project basis, he was informed that the computerized records 
had been erased from their computers to make way for new 
projected estimates.  This is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1980s, national defence used to provide, upon 
application, lists of briefing notes.  Health Canada, until this 
year, used to provide comprehensive lists of health protection 
branch contracts.  They were cancelled, reputedly, because of 
inadequate resources and because their management did not require 
them.  Mr. Rubin believes, more to the point, these reference 
record indexes were too frequently leading to the discovery of 
embarrassing and significant operational activities of the 
departments.  I have to say I agree with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now defending departments like these get off with nothing 
worse than maybe some adverse publicity.  Until there are 
provisions in the act to ensure accountability of all levels of 
government, Canadians will be unable to receive the necessary 
legislative protection they deserve.  They will also be deprived 
of the right to know why decisions are made and if these 
decisions sufficiently address issues affecting their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existence of sanctions in the law will also assist in 
providing Canadians with a more competent civil service, one less 
likely to commit acts of omission or carelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my life I have held, among others, two positions of which I 
am extremely proud.  Needless to say, my present position is one 
of the most privileged to be had in our country.  The other was 
that of a public servant.  To serve your country to the best of 
your ability with integrity and honesty gives you a great sense 
of pride.  I was not the only public servant who felt this way. 
In fact, all of my colleagues were among the most conscientious 
in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine that my department was unique.  In fact, I know 
it was not.  The public service in Canada has attracted the best 
in the land and it is simply not right that the few exceptions be 
allowed to smear the entire service.  It is not fair to these 
dedicated workers or to the citizens who rely on them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is about the protection of public records.  It provides 
the necessary tools to prevent future occurrences of document 
tampering and destruction.  It will strengthen democracy in 
Canada and go a long way toward restoring the public trust by 
protecting it from future violations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to members on all sides of the House about the 
bill.  Some feel it does not go far enough while others believe 
it may go too far.  On the whole, however, I have received 
overwhelming approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all here to serve our constituents.  Those in the public 
service must serve, and if they betray the public trust they must 
be held accountable.  If left unchecked we will surely face the 
dire consequences of our inaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still a young nation built on trust.  Lack of trust will 
weaken our resolve to continue building an honest and caring 
society.  I urge all members to support the principle of Bill 
C-208 by passing it over to committee for study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing so, we will show Canadians we are serious about their 
right to access to information and are prepared to take strong 
measures to ensure that it is not jeopardized. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the member for Brampton West—Mississauga not only for bringing 
the bill forward but for her comments in the House today.  She is 
to be commended for this initiative.  She is to be commended for 
the very frank and forthright manner in which she has laid so 
many facts before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recognize this is a non-partisan effort.  We all pledged 
to our constituents that as members of Parliament we were elected 
to protect the rights of the people and will seek to do so.  When 
I see the hon. member bringing forward a bill with such an honest 
assessment of the justification for it, I am moved by it and I am 
encouraged by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see happening here is an effort on the part of members 
in opposition to bring about a more open, honest and 
straightforward government on behalf of the people we represent. 
We also see members concerned about the same issues and moving to 
do what we can to bring about a government that is more open so 
that we can accept without question or equivocation the honesty 
and integrity of our public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We elect governments to protect our rights and our freedoms, not 
to take them from us.  If we are to have a peaceful country with 
the prosperity that flows from it, we must have the truth. From 
truth flows justice, from justice flows peace, and from peace 
flows prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we deny the fundamental essential in that formula there is a 
breakdown of justice, peace of mind, and the prosperity that 
flows from any country or any people that trust their 
institutions, base their actions upon truth, base their future 
hopes and plans upon the commitment, awareness and promise that 
the truth will not be held from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned a number of issues where documents 
were tampered with, where documents were perhaps concealed and 
where documents were difficult to obtain.  She mentioned the 
Somalia and Krever inquiries.  These are very serious matters 
where lives were lost.  There was vested interest to frustrate 
efforts to obtain the truth about conditions.  This is wrong.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the parliamentary secretary to the justice minister.  It 
appears that she is prepared to speak to the bill.  I cannot help 
but wonder what she will say.  I can almost predict that she will 
not be in favour of it.  If I am wrong I will be pleasantly 
surprised and will be the first one to commend her if she 
supports the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems unusual that cabinet would dither when it is obvious a 
bill of this nature is needed.  Perhaps the parliamentary 
secretary will amend the bill to strengthen it further.  If that 
is the case she will have the support of members on this side of 
the House, certainly within our caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who introduced the bill referred to a number of 
cases which indicate that it is required.  I also have cases 
which come to mind.  One was an unfortunate incident that 
occurred when the government attempted to deport three suspected 
Nazi war criminals from Canada.  Unfortunately, because there was 
a time delay in the minds of government officials handling the 
case, the assistant deputy attorney general did something which 
was interpreted as interfering with the judicial independence of 
the judge who was handling the three cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the three suspected Nazi war criminals was a man by the 
name of Tobiass.  In his case the immigration documents upon 
which the crown was relying to base its case had been destroyed. 
If we look through the documents we find this statement: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All irrelevant immigration files were destroyed by its servants 
and are now not available.  In addition the government cannot 
provide evidence of any one of its servants who interviewed Mr. 
Tobiass prior to his admission to Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is the only process by which the government can rid the 
country of suspected Nazi war criminals, it is essential not to 
allow documents to be destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be very interesting to see this case go forward.  It has 
been stalled or at least delayed for months by the interference 
of Mr. Thompson.  I will be watching with interest to see how the 
crown will proceed against Mr. Tobiass when all the documents 
have been destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need for the bill and for awareness on the part of 
senior public servants that if they alter, destroy or conceal a 
document they will face the sanctions the bill contains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very much in support of the bill.  The hon. member and her 
colleagues in the House today are to be commended.  I hope the 
support my hon. colleague has for the bill on her side of the 
House will be greater than what I see today.  It is a Friday 
afternoon and many members are on their way home or they have 
other duties to perform.  This is not an indication of the 
strength of support for her bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless it is very encouraging to see the kind of 
initiative, which often comes from the opposition in terms of 
opening up the government and making public servants more 
accountable to all Canadians and to all members of Parliament, 
being taken by a member on the government side.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My time has almost elapsed.  I await with anticipation the words 
of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice to see 
whether she is prepared to support the bill, strengthen the bill, 
or simply oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  By agreement we will resume debate 
with the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I certainly support the bill and I thank my colleagues 
who have given me the opportunity to speak a little sooner than 
otherwise.  I will be brief but I have something I would like to 
bring to the debate that is a little special. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a former life I had a lot of experience working with the 
Access to Information Act.  The reason a jail term is necessary, 
which is now missing from the act, be it two years or five 
years—I actually prefer two years—is that access officers are 
subject to fierce pressure from their superiors when there is a 
request for a document that is sensitive and maybe a little 
embarrassing.  It takes tremendous courage on the part of an 
access officer to resist the kind of bullying that comes down 
from authorities.  They simply say  “You don't want to release 
that.  Don't do it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, without a penalty the access officer may stand on 
his or her principles.  I have to say “her” as well because I 
remember a few instances when access officers who were women went 
out on limb to get documents for me.  The point is that they may 
go out on a limb but they stand a good chance of being punished 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The beauty of a jail term is that when bureaucratic bullies try 
to twist the arms of access officers who they know they should 
release a document, all they have to say is “Send me a written 
note”.  If the access officer cuts the document and later on it 
is disclosed that the order was improper, it is the person up the 
line who will go to jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that the beauty of a jail sentence is that it 
protects the line access officers and lets them exercise their 
judgement properly without being bullied from above. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I endorse this principle 100%.  It will open doors everywhere if 
we can get some sort of jail sentences for those people who would 
flaunt the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to speak on Bill C-208, an act to amend the Access to 
Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to congratulate the government member who is 
introducing this bill, the hon. member for Brampton-West—Mississauga. 
It goes to show clearly that private member's bills are crucial to the 
vitality of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment provides sanctions against any person who improperly 
destroys or falsifies government records in an attempt to deny right of 
access to information under the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, the Access to Information Act does not provide severe 
enough sanctions for this type of violation. Section 67 reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>67. (1) No person shall obstruct the Information Commissioner 
or any person acting on behalf or under the direction of the 
Commissioner in the performance of the Commissioner's duties and 
functions under this Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is serious. What are the sanctions? 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) Every person who contravenes this section is guilty of an 
offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding 
one thousand dollars. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, $1,000 is not a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-208 is a bit more realistic. It makes it a criminal offence 
for anyone who tries to destroy or falsify official records or who omits 
to keep such records. Anyone found guilty of this offence is liable to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to a fine not 
exceeding $10,000 or to both. 
Already we see that the penalties are much heavier.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The obvious purpose of this bill is to meet, at least in part, the 
concerns raised by the information commissioner in his last two annual 
reports. But I believe that it is specifically designed to meet the 
concerns of the public in Canada and in Quebec. This is especially true 
following the Somalia inquiry, when people found out, in very disturbing 
circumstances, that truth with a capital <I>T</I> was not reality in government 
backrooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the awareness that this inquiry created in the public now 
makes it absolutely necessary that a bill like the one we have before 
us, Bill C-208, be adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his 1995-1996 annual report, the information commissioner 
expressed his deep concern that the Access to Information Act was not 
being rigorously enforced. This is what he had to say “After 13 years of 
operation of this Act, it is unfortunate to have to report several very 
disturbing manoeuvres to hinder the right of access to government 
documents, including destruction, falsification and cover-up”. It should 
be noted that the commissioner's office conducted investigations into 
three major incidents during 1995-1996. That was only the tip of the 
iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, at Transport Canada, a high official—there are not 
tens of thousands of them—ordered his staff to destroy every copy of an 
audit report dealing with a project on which he knew that an access to 
information request had been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At National Defence, a journalist alleging that certain 
documents had been falsified before release to him under the Access 
to Information Act asked the commissioner to investigate.  The 
outcome of the investigation was that the journalist's allegations 
were correct.  Not only had the documents been tampered with before 
release, but orders had been given afterward to destroy the 
originals.  What is very worrisome about this, is that those orders 
came from high up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commissioner's third example cames from Health 
Canada.  During the sittings of the Krever commission, testimony 
revealed that minutes of Canadian Blood Committee meetings had been 
destroyed in the late 1980s. 
According to the commissioner, the time has come to amend the 
Access to Information Act to provide sanctions in the event of 
flagrant violations of its provisions.  He added that legislation 
considered toothless is rapidly depleted of content, if not totally 
cast aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go from that to saying that the current legislation is 
almost meaningless is but a short hop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again in his 1996-97 annual report the commissioner repeats 
that the current legislation cannot be effectively enforced.  On 
the subject of tainted blood specifically, the commissioner calls 
the lawmakers to task saying that the deplorable examples of 
measures taken by officials to destroy information had sounded the 
alarm. 
As recommended in last year's report, the Access to Information Act 
should make it an offence to commit any act or omission aimed at denying 
rights provided under the act. Such an offence should carry a penalty of 
at least five years emprisonment, which this bill provides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, how many reports will the commissioner have to write 
before the government and the members of the House of Commons get the 
message that it is time for reform?  How long will we have to wait 
before we pass new sanctions that will make it clear to managers and 
officials that the right to access to information is not to be denied 
and that to do so will result in sanctions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-208 is a commendable piece of legislation, which we will 
support enthusiastically. However, it must be noted that this reform is 
incomplete in many respects. But we all know that anything can be 
improved. For example, we must be aware of the fact that documents 
subject to an access to information request are seldom destroyed or 
falsified by those who will really benefit from their disappearance. 
Indeed, in many cases, the order to take such actions comes from a 
superior or a high official. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill as drafted does not make any distinction between the 
person who commits the offence and the person who benefits from the 
offence. 
Therefore, the Access to Information Act should prohibit any employer or 
any person in a position of authority within a federal institution from 
retaliating or threatening to retaliate against a person who refuses to 
destroy or falsify a document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A complete bill should include three types of offences: first, 
destroying or falsifying documents; second, ordering the destruction or 
falsification of documents; and third, retaliating against a person who 
refuses to destroy or falsify documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the intent of Bill C-208 is commendable, and that is why 
we will support it. 
That is also why we hope to have the opportunity at some point to 
discuss Bill C-286, which deals with the falsification and destruction 
of documents, but also with access to confidential Privy Council 
documents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this legislation.  It indicates one of the reasons why 
we need parliamentary reform, to bring more power to the elected 
representatives of the people of Canada and to develop a system 
far more responsive to the needs of the citizens rather than 
protecting a non-accountable system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need for toughening up Canada's Access to Information 
Act to stop officials from tampering with right of Canadians to 
know the real facts and figures on policy, analyses and 
decisions. There is a need to put strong sanctions to penalize 
those destroying public information and sabotaging the public's 
right to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in place to penalize offenders.  The government 
has ignored calls from Information Commissioner John Grace. 
It his last two reports the commissioner has been calling for 
sanctions.  There has been as of yet no action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are increasingly cynical of government structures. 
When we see what some non-accountable bureaucrats or officials 
are doing and the cloud of secrecy behind government action, we 
can see that there is need to reform the overall governance 
system and to make clear and accountable to citizens of this 
country all information on how decisions were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Penalties should be addressed not only to those destroying 
information but to those who delay access to information and to 
other abuses connected to the access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power of the information commissioner needs to be expanded 
to include stopping the growing circumvention of access to 
information documents.  There is a growing tendency, as I have 
experienced, for information to define some documents as working 
papers or consultant papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had applied for some documents and was told they were 
confidential.  These very same documents had already been 
presented in two different public forums.  It took a letter to 
the minister outlining this decision to get these papers.  As 
everyone here knows, to do our job we need information and we 
need access to it on an honest and fairly quick basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need to expand the concept of public records if we 
want to have an informed citizenship on policy development and 
implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number records under the Access to Information Act must be 
expanded to include certain crown corporations and restricted 
consultants and other reports.  There is need to implement 
policies to protect professional civil servants willing to 
provide information on issues of significance for citizens of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The repressive policy of enforcing secrecy at all levels must be 
eliminated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This act will strengthen democracy in Canada because democracy 
is about discussion, not about force.  We need the information to 
make good decisions.  It is also about public trust, 
accountability and credibility, and about our credibility, yours 
and mine, for the people who sit here because we depend on the 
availability of information from the bureaucrats who form the 
foundation of our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I urge all members to support this bill as it 
will show the public that we are sincere in our work and sincere 
in allowing it access to information as much as ourselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak on Bill C-208, an act to amend the Access to Information 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known that the Access to Information Act does not 
have enough teeth and actually even the information commissioner 
has said so in his most recent report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-208 makes it an offence for a person who, with 
intent to deny a right of access under the Access to Information 
Act, destroys, mutilates or alters a record, falsifies a record 
or makes a false entry in a record or does not keep required 
records.  A person found guilty would be liable to imprisonment 
for a term not exceeding five years or to a fine not exceeding 
$10,000, or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very simple amendment that will give more teeth to 
this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some time now Canadians have been losing confidence in their 
public institutions and especially in government.  Canadians need 
to know that their federal government is truly working on their 
behalf and truly working well.  Otherwise, people feel that both 
their votes and their taxes are wasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Access to Information Act is one of the tools for the public 
to achieve that objective and this amendment proposed in Bill 
C-208 is simply helping to make the law more complete.  The 
amendment will give more visibility, more access and more teeth 
to the Access to Information Act by including strong penalties 
for those who do their utmost to prevent its application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that more could not have been done to improve 
the act.  For example, amendments could have been proposed to 
allow the public to have access to documents of the privy council 
which are currently confidential.  In fact, many other amendments 
reflecting the information commissioner's concerns and 
expectations could have been tabled at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that the Progressive Conservative Party of 
Canada will support this private member's bill and we invite all 
other parties to do so.  We believe that this bill is a step 
forward in opening up the government to more public scrutiny and 
giving Canadians a stronger sense of public control and identity 
with their public institutions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to begin by commending my colleague, the hon. member for 
Brampton West—Mississauga, for bringing this important issue for 
debate before the House and for her continued commitment to 
safeguarding the rights of Canadian citizens and assuring, as a 
representative of the people, that government becomes more open 
and accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on Bill C-208. 
The bill proposes to add to the Access to Information Act an 
infraction for destroying documents that are subject to the act 
with intent to deny access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before talking about the specifics of the bill, I wish to take a 
moment to provide some background to my comments.  Canadians have 
had the benefit of a federal Access to Information Act since 
1983. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For fifteen years now, Canadians have enjoyed a high degree of 
access to federal government information.  I must emphasize that Canada 
is one of the rare countries where such legislative measures exist. The 
law states that access must be granted to information on the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can only refuse access to information on the basis 
of a few very specific exceptions. 
Whenever the government refuses access to information, people have the 
legal right to file a complaint with the information commissioner and to 
have the government's decision reviewed by the federal court.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to government information is a fundamental right in a 
democratic system. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court of Canada stated 
that the overriding goal of legislation concerning access to information 
was to promote democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the court ruled, in Dagg v. Minister of Finance, 1997, the 
purpose of the right to have access to information held by the 
government is to improve government operations by making the government 
more efficient, receptive and accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, in totalitarian states, the people are denied this right 
and, as a result, they do not have this means of making the government 
accountable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say that our Access to Information Act could not 
be improved upon and brought more up to date.  I believe the hon. 
member is trying to improve the act with the amendment proposed 
in Bill C-208. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can argue that there is a gap in the protection currently 
offered by the act since it does not contain a penalty for the 
deliberate alteration or destruction of a record.  The act does 
contain a penalty but it is a penalty for obstructing the work of 
the information commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act also authorizes the commissioner to disclose to the 
Attorney General of Canada information relating to the commission 
of an offence against any law of Canada by any officer or 
employee of a federal government institution. The bill before us 
today would add an offence for actions that one can legitimately 
see as actions that intend to defeat the purpose of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, I would agree with the hon. member that the 
Access to Information Act should include a penalty for 
deliberately destroying documents that are subject to the act. I 
believe that such an action is unacceptable and therefore should 
be punished.  For this reason, I support the general goal of Bill 
C-208.  Did I surprise you?  I do not however support the 
specifics of the bill and I will explain. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be argued that section 126 of the Criminal Code applies to 
a situation where a person wilfully destroys a document for the purpose 
of impeding the right to access provided under the Access to Information 
Act. Section 126 of the Criminal Code provides that “Every one who, 
without lawful excuse, contravenes an Act of Parliament by wilfully 
doing anything that it forbids—is guilty of an indictable offence and 
liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stiffness of the penalty provided in section 126 could make 
some wonder whether it is necessary to provide a penalty in the Access 
to Information Act for wilfully destroying documents that are subject to 
the act. 
They have in mind a specific penalty that would not be quite as 
harsh as the maximum of two years' imprisonment in section 126 for 
committing such a criminal act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am of the opinion that the penalty in the Criminal Code is 
probably too harsh and that, if a specific penalty is added to the 
Access to Information Act, it should be less harsh than the penalty 
now provided for in section 126 of the Criminal Code. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is proposed in Bill C-208?  It is to create an indictable 
offence with a maximum penalty of five years in prison which is a 
heavier penalty than the penalty provided for in section 126. For 
this reason, I cannot support the specifics of Bill C-208. I 
understand the hon. member wants to make the point that the 
destruction or alteration of documents is serious and we all 
agree it is but it should also be put into perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, a maximum of five years is too heavy a penalty for 
destroying documents.  This penalty would be more severely 
punished than the offence of assault causing bodily harm, which 
is a hybrid offence that carries a maximum penalty of 18 months 
when prosecuted on summary conviction. Destroying documents, 
while undoubtedly serious, cannot be compared to assault causing 
bodily harm.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to make another comment regarding the offence provided 
for in Bill C-208.  When an offence is a criminal one, the accused 
may choose to appear before a judge and jury.  This is a slow 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, an individual charged with a criminal offence is 
entitled to a preliminary hearing, which can also slow down the 
judicial process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the destruction of documents is more comparable 
to the offence of mischief with respect to property, now provided 
for under section 430 of the Criminal Code. 
This is a hybrid offence and the maximum penalty, if the Crown 
decides to proceed by way of indictment, is two years' 
imprisonment.  But, if the Crown decides to proceed by way of 
summary conviction, the maximum penalty is a $2,000 fine or six 
months' imprisonment, or both. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I believe the need to create an offence for 
deliberate destruction of records in order to thwart the Access 
to Information Act is an issue that should be considered within 
the context of the reform of the act.  I believe a case can be 
made that the addition of such an offence would strengthen the 
principles of openness and accountability that are inherent in 
the access to information legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that particular attention should be paid to 
determining the appropriate sentence to be attached to the 
offence, which would be proportional to penalties provided for 
comparable offences. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, since my 
speech is extemporaneous, I shall address the question in a 
general term with respect to justice and doing things that are 
right in the country.  I am not that rich on specific details on 
the bill since I have not had an opportunity to study the minute 
details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on the statements we have just heard 
from the parliamentary secretary.  It seems to me there is a 
habit in this House whenever a private member brings forward a 
motion.  Even though it is filled with common sense and a lot of 
good ideas which are very useful and very broadly supported among 
Canadians, the Liberal government for the last four years plus a 
little bit has almost always been in opposition to the private 
member's initiative.  It usually finds some small technical 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the parliamentary secretary spoke of the variance 
in sentencing for one misdemeanour versus another one.  She said 
why should this sentence be greater than another one where the 
criminal offence seems to be more offensive to Canadians. We 
could say that over and over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example a person who under the new gun registration law 
fails simply to report the sale of a hunting rifle could end up 
with a greater penalty than a young person who killed someone. 
That is also an aberration in the sentencing structure and it is 
not sufficient reason to say we should just be against this whole 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to support this initiative.  The 
government should support it so that the bill will go to 
committee and when it is studied in committee, perhaps the 
committee in its wisdom will amend the sentencing structure so 
that at least we get something that will protect Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to ask the question, what is justice and on what is 
justice based?  I contend that it is based on truth.  Whether it 
is a civil suit or a criminal case, someone is charged with an 
offence.  In many cases we simply want to hold the government 
accountable.  We want to find out what has happened.  Have they 
done something that is wrong?  Is there some accountability 
question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we err greatly if we get so tied up in our dealings 
with government, whether it is in the justice system or in any 
other system, and the truth is not available. Frankly, if a 
government official or someone in some other organization does 
something which is offensive to someone else and it is a 
chargeable offence, then they should have to meet those charges. 
The whole issue at stake here is the altering of documents which 
are being requested under access to information from government 
departments.  Why on earth would we want to support a system 
which provides for the production of documentation which is 
false?  There ought to be very strong penalties and strong 
deterrents against that type of thing.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether a person from the media, a person from the official 
opposition or one of the other opposition parties or indeed even 
a member from the government side wants to know what has 
happened, they should be able to get documentation which 
accurately reflects the truth.  That is the heart of the issue 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge the government to support this bill so that when 
it goes to committee, sure, if there is something that it is not 
totally supportive of, let us work together.  Let us make the 
bill work on behalf of Canadians, on behalf of the taxpayers of 
the country, on behalf of the victims of whatever the case is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I do not know what you do for your bedtime reading, 
but the other night for my bedtime reading I was reading the deal 
struck with the former prime minister and the justice department 
on this Airbus scandal.  When I was reading it I found it 
intriguing in one place.  It said “The parties agree that” and 
then they went on to say that this was done strictly by the RCMP 
and by no one else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a suspicion when I read words like that.  If this is 
actual fact, why would one have to agree to it?  It is as if we 
agree to say something that is not really quite true but it is a 
term of the agreement which gets us out of the conflict.  That 
ought not to be.  We ought to deal honestly, we ought to deal 
openly, we ought to deal truthfully with one another in all of 
these instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hesitate to raise this example because it is very old.  In 
fact, I will not be specific.  I will just mention it in general. 
When I had some access to information requests several years ago, 
I received information back from the department that I had 
requested with a great amount of the document whited out.  It was 
altered so that I could not see the truth.  I was unable to 
reconcile the questions which were troubling us because we were 
not able to get at the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was, of course, a justification by the President of the 
Treasury Board who said that these things were justifiably whited 
out but that was a legal technicality, one with which we 
disagreed.  The effect of it was that the truth was hidden from 
us.  We were not able to get down to the facts of the issue.  So 
there was a cover-up.  There was a whiteout of the actual facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe very strongly that for justice to prevail on behalf 
of Canadians, irrespective of what the issue is, we should be 
able to find out who did this, who did what, when did they do it 
and where did they do it.  There should be answers to all of 
those questions which are totally reliable.  Those documents must 
not be alterable simply to cover someone's, shall I use the 
phrase, political butt because they do not want to face the 
consequences.  There should be total honesty and openness in the 
access to information that citizens, reporters and others ask 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think that on a very broad basis the justice system and 
the government in general have an obligation.  When they were 
running for election in 1993, the Liberals said “We will restore 
the confidence of Canadians in the integrity of their 
government”.  That was their promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think right here in this bill they have another opportunity to 
make an attempt to fulfil that promise, a promise I venture to 
propose is not anywhere near being filled at this stage.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They have an opportunity here by saying yes, we will take all 
the measures we possibly can to make sure that access to 
information requests will reveal the truth of the matter. This is 
absolutely mandatory.  It is an opportunity for the Liberal 
government.  I urge the government to be in favour of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one point with respect to private members' business.  I 
really hope that all private members, including Liberal 
backbenchers, everyone, will judge this bill on its merits and 
will truly vote what they believe and not be instructed by those 
who have some other political agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time provided 
for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of 
precedence on the Order Paper.
